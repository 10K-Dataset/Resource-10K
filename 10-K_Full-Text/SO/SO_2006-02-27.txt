PART I

Item 1. BUSINESS

Southern Company was incorporated under the laws of Delaware on November 9, 1945. Southern
Company is domesticated under the laws of Georgia and is qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation under the laws of Alabama. Southern Company owns all the outstanding common stock of
Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power and Savannah Electric, each of which is
an operating public utility company. The retail operating companies supply electric service in the
states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida and Mississippi. More particular information relating to each
of the retail operating companies is as follows:

Alabama Power

is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Alabama on November 10,
1927, by the consolidation of a predecessor Alabama Power Company, Gulf Electric Company and
Houston Power Company. The predecessor Alabama Power Company had had a continuous existence
since its incorporation in 1906.

Georgia Power

was incorporated under the laws of the State of Georgia on June 26, 1930, and
admitted to do business in Alabama on September 15, 1948.

Gulf Power

is a Florida corporation that has had a continuous existence since it was
originally organized under the laws of the State of Maine on November 2, 1925. Gulf Power was
admitted to do business in Florida on January 15, 1926, in Mississippi on October 25, 1976, and
in Georgia on November 20, 1984. Gulf Power became a Florida corporation after being
domesticated under the laws of the State of Florida on November 2, 2005.

Mississippi Power

was incorporated under the laws of the State of Mississippi on July 12, 1972,
was admitted to do business in Alabama on November 28, 1972, and effective December 21, 1972,
by the merger into it of the predecessor Mississippi Power Company, succeeded to the business
and properties of the latter company. The predecessor Mississippi Power Company was
incorporated under the laws of the State of Maine on November 24, 1924, and was admitted to do
business in Mississippi on December 23, 1924, and in Alabama on December 7, 1962.

Savannah Electric

is a corporation existing under the laws of the State of Georgia; its charter
was granted by the Secretary of State on August 5, 1921. On December 13, 2005, Georgia Power
and Savannah Electric entered into a merger agreement, under which Savannah Electric will merge
with and into Georgia Power, with Georgia Power as the surviving corporation in the merger.
Following the merger, Southern Company will continue to own all of the outstanding common stock
of Georgia Power. The merger must be approved by the shareholders of Savannah Electric and the
sole shareholder of Georgia Power, and is subject to receipt of related regulatory approvals of
the FERC, Georgia PSC and Federal Communications Commission. Assuming the timely receipt of
all required approvals, Georgia Power and Savannah Electric expect to complete the merger by
July 2006. See Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company under “Merger of Georgia
Power and Savannah Electric” and Note 3 to the financial statements of Georgia Power and
Savannah Electric under “Retail Regulatory Matters — Merger” in Item 8 herein for additional
information.

In addition, Southern Company owns all of the common stock of Southern Power, which is also an
operating public utility company. Southern Power constructs, owns and manages Southern Company’s
competitive generation assets and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market.
Southern Power is a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware on January 8, 2001 and was
admitted to do business in Alabama, Florida and Georgia on January 10, 2001 and in Mississippi on
January 30, 2001.

Southern Company also owns all the outstanding common stock or membership interests of
SouthernLINC Wireless, Southern Company Gas, Southern Nuclear, SCS, Southern Telecom, Southern
Holdings and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. SouthernLINC Wireless provides digital
wireless communications services to the retail operating companies and also markets these services
to the public within the Southeast. Southern Company Gas, which began operation in August 2002,
was a competitive retail natural gas marketer which served communities in Georgia until January 4,
2006 when it sold substantially all of its assets to Gas South (see “The SOUTHERN System – Other

I-1


Business”
herein for additional information). Southern Nuclear provides services to Alabama
Power’s and Georgia Power’s nuclear plants.
SCS is the system service company providing, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and
its subsidiary companies. Southern Telecom provides wholesale fiber optic solutions to
telecommunication providers in the Southeastern United States. Southern Holdings is an
intermediate holding subsidiary for Southern Company’s investments in synthetic fuels and leveraged
leases and various other energy-related businesses.

Alabama Power and Georgia Power each own 50% of the outstanding common stock of SEGCO. SEGCO
is an operating public utility company that owns electric generating units with an aggregate
capacity of 1,019,680 kilowatts at Plant Gaston on the Coosa River near Wilsonville, Alabama.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power are each entitled to one-half of SEGCO’s capacity and energy.
Alabama Power acts as SEGCO’s agent in the operation of SEGCO’s units and furnishes coal to SEGCO
as fuel for its units. SEGCO also owns three 230,000 volt transmission lines extending from Plant
Gaston to the Georgia state line at which point connection is made with the Georgia Power
transmission line system.

See Note 10 to the financial statements of Southern Company in Item 8 herein for additional
information regarding Southern Company’s segment and related information.

The registrants’ Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports
on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports are made available on Southern Company’s website,
free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with
or furnished to the SEC. Southern Company’s internet address is http://www.southerncompany.com.

The SOUTHERN System

Retail Operating Companies

The transmission facilities of each of the retail operating companies are connected to the
respective company’s own generating plants and other sources of power and are interconnected with
the transmission facilities of the other retail operating companies and SEGCO by means of
heavy-duty high voltage lines. For information on Georgia Power’s integrated transmission system,
see “Territory Served by the Utilities” herein for additional information.

Operating contracts covering arrangements in effect with principal neighboring utility systems
provide for capacity exchanges, capacity purchases and sales, transfers of economy energy and other
similar transactions. Additionally, the retail operating companies have entered into voluntary
reliability agreements with the subsidiaries of Entergy Corporation, Florida Electric Power
Coordinating Group and TVA and with Progress Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Corporation, South
Carolina Electric & Gas Company and Virginia Electric and Power Company, each of which provides for
the establishment and periodic review of principles and procedures for planning and operation of
generation and transmission facilities, maintenance schedules, load retention programs, emergency
operations and other matters affecting the reliability of bulk power supply. The retail operating
companies have joined with other utilities in the Southeast (including those referred to above) to
form the SERC to augment further the reliability and adequacy of bulk power supply. Through the
SERC, the retail operating companies are represented on the National Electric Reliability Council.

The IIC provides for coordinating operations of the power producing facilities of the retail
operating companies and Southern Power and the capacities available to such companies from
non-affiliated sources and for the pooling of surplus energy available for interchange.
Coordinated operation of the entire interconnected system is conducted through a central power
supply coordination office maintained by SCS. The available sources of energy are allocated to the
retail operating companies and Southern Power to provide the most economical sources of power
consistent with reliable operation. The resulting benefits and savings are apportioned among each
of the companies. See MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
— FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “FERC
Matters — Intercompany Interchange Contract” of each of the registrants in Item 7 herein, Note 3 to
the financial statements of Southern Company and each of the retail operating companies and Note 2
to the financial statements of Southern Power, all under “FERC
Matters — Intercompany Interchange

I-2


Contract” in Item 8 herein for information on the FERC proceeding related to the IIC.

SCS has contracted with Southern Company, each retail operating company, Southern Power,
Southern Nuclear, SEGCO and other subsidiaries to furnish, at direct or allocated cost and upon
request, the following services: general and design engineering, purchasing, accounting and
statistical analysis, finance and treasury, tax, information resources, marketing, auditing,
insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures and other services
with respect to business and operations and power pool transactions. Southern Power, Southern
Company Gas, SouthernLINC Wireless and Southern Telecom have also secured from the retail operating
companies certain services which are furnished at cost.

Southern Nuclear has contracts with Alabama Power to operate Plant Farley and with Georgia
Power to operate Plants Hatch and Vogtle. See “Regulation — Atomic Energy Act of 1954” herein for
additional information.

Southern Power

Southern Power is an electric wholesale generation subsidiary with market-based rate authority
from the FERC. Southern Power constructs, owns and manages generating facilities and sells the
output under long-term, fixed-price capacity contracts both to unaffiliated wholesale purchasers as
well as to the retail operating companies (under PPAs approved by the respective state PSCs).
Southern Power’s business activities are not subject to traditional state regulation of utilities
but are subject to regulation by the FERC. Southern Power has attempted to insulate itself from
significant fuel supply, fuel transportation and electric transmission risks by making such risks
the responsibility of the counterparties to the PPAs. However, Southern Power’s overall profit
will depend on the parameters of the wholesale market and its efficient operation of its wholesale
generating assets. At December 31, 2005, Southern Power had 5,403 megawatts of generating capacity
in commercial operation.

Other Business

On January 4, 2006, Southern Company Gas completed the sale of substantially all of its
assets, including natural gas inventory, accounts receivable and customer list to Gas South. See
Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company under “Southern Company Gas Sale” in Item 8
herein for additional information.

Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding subsidiary for Southern Company’s investments in
synthetic fuels and leveraged leases and various other energy-related businesses.

SouthernLINC Wireless serves Southern Company’s retail operating companies and marketing its
services to non-affiliates within the Southeast. SouthernLINC Wireless bundles multiple
communication options into one phone including InstantLINC

SM

Mobile to Mobile, cellular
service, text messaging, wireless internet access and wireless data. Its system covers
approximately 128,000 square miles in the Southeast.

These continuing efforts to invest in and develop new business opportunities offer potential
returns exceeding those of rate-regulated operations. However, these activities also involve a
higher degree of risk.

I-3


Construction Programs

The subsidiary companies of Southern Company are engaged in continuous construction programs
to accommodate existing and estimated future loads on their respective systems. For estimated
construction and environmental expenditures for the periods 2006 through 2008, see Note 7 to the
financial statements of Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi
Power and Savannah Electric and Note 6 to the financial statements of Southern Power all under
“Construction Program” in Item 8 herein.

Estimated construction costs in 2006 are expected to be apportioned approximately as follows:

These amounts include the retail operating companies and Southern Power (as detailed
in the table above) as well as the amounts for the other subsidiaries. See “Other Business” herein
for additional information.

The construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction
costs may vary from the above estimates because of changes in such factors as: business conditions;
environmental regulations; nuclear plant regulations; FERC rules and transmission regulations; load
projections; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment and materials; and cost of
capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be
fully recovered.

Under Georgia law, Georgia Power and Savannah Electric each are required to file an IRP for
approval by the Georgia PSC. Under the plan rules, the Georgia PSC must pre-certify the
construction of new power plants and new PPAs. See “Rate Matters — Integrated Resource Planning”
herein for additional information.

See “Regulation — Environmental Statutes and Regulations” herein for additional information
with respect to certain existing and proposed environmental requirements and PROPERTIES -
“Jointly-Owned Facilities” in Item 2 herein for additional information concerning Alabama Power’s,
Georgia Power’s and Southern Power’s joint ownership of certain generating units and related
facilities with certain non-affiliated utilities.

The retail operating companies have long-term agreements in place from which they expect
to receive approximately 84% of their coal burn requirements in 2006. These agreements cover
remaining terms up to 8 years. In 2005, the weighted average sulfur content of all coal burned by
the retail operating companies was 0.8% sulfur. This sulfur level, along with banked and purchased
sulfur dioxide allowances, allowed the retail operating companies to remain within limits set by
the Phase II acid rain requirements of the Clean Air Act. In 2005, Southern Company purchased
approximately $121 million in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission allowances. As additional
environmental regulations are proposed that impact the utilization of coal, the retail operating
companies’ fuel mix will be monitored to ensure that the retail operating companies remain in
compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, Southern Company and the retail
operating companies will continue to evaluate the need to purchase additional emission allowances
and the timing of capital expenditures for emission control equipment. See MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS — FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “Environmental Matters — Environmental Statutes and
Regulations” of Southern Company and each of the retail operating companies in Item 7 herein for
information on the Clean Air Act.

The Southern Company system has long-term agreements in place for its natural gas burn
requirements.

I-5


For 2006, the Southern Company system has contracted for 130 billion cubic feet of natural gas
supply. These agreements cover remaining terms up to 13 years. In addition to gas supply, the
Southern Company system has contracts in place for both firm gas transportation and storage.
Management believes that these contracts provide sufficient natural gas supplies, transportation
and storage to ensure normal operations of the Southern Company system’s natural gas generating
units.

Changes in fuel prices to the retail operating companies are generally reflected in fuel
adjustment clauses contained in rate schedules. See “Rate Matters — Rate Structure” herein for
additional information.

Alabama Power and Georgia Power have numerous contracts covering a portion of their nuclear
fuel needs for uranium, conversion services, enrichment services and fuel fabrication. These
contracts have varying expiration dates and most are short to medium term (less than 10 years).
Management believes that sufficient capacity for nuclear fuel supplies and processing exists to
preclude the impairment of normal operations of the Southern Company system’s nuclear generating
units.

Alabama Power and Georgia Power have contracts with the DOE that provide for the permanent
disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin disposing of spent fuel in 1998, as
required by the contracts, and Alabama Power and Georgia Power are pursuing legal remedies against
the government for breach of contract. Sufficient pool storage capacity is available at Plant
Farley to maintain full-core discharge capability until the refueling outages scheduled for 2006
and 2008 for units 1 and 2, respectively. Construction of an on-site dry storage facility at Plant
Farley was completed in 2005 and is expected to provide adequate spent fuel storage through 2015
for both units. The facility can be expanded to provide storage through 2025. Sufficient pool
storage capacity for spent fuel is available at Plant Vogtle to maintain full-core discharge
capability for both units into 2015. Construction of an on-site dry storage facility at Plant
Vogtle is scheduled to begin in sufficient time to maintain pool full-core discharge capability.
At Plant Hatch, an on-site dry storage facility is operational and can be expanded to accommodate
spent fuel through the life of the plant.

The Energy Act of 1992 established a Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning
Fund, which is funded in part by a special assessment on utilities with nuclear plants, including
Alabama Power and Georgia Power. This assessment is being paid over a 15-year period ending in
2006. This fund will be used by the DOE for the decontamination and decommissioning of its nuclear
fuel enrichment facilities. The law provides that utilities will recover these payments in the
same manner as any other fuel expense. See Note 1 to the financial statements of Southern Company,
Alabama Power and Georgia Power under “Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs” in Item 8 herein for additional
information.

Territory Served by the Utilities

The territory in which the retail operating companies provide electric service comprises most
of the states of Alabama and Georgia together with the northwestern portion of Florida and
southeastern Mississippi. In this territory there are non-affiliated electric distribution systems
which obtain some or all of their power requirements either directly or indirectly from the retail
operating companies. The territory has an area of approximately 120,000 square miles and an
estimated population of approximately 11 million.

Alabama Power is engaged, within the State of Alabama, in the generation and purchase of
electricity and the distribution and sale of such electricity at retail in over 1,000 communities
(including Anniston, Birmingham, Gadsden, Mobile, Montgomery and Tuscaloosa) and at wholesale to 15
municipally-owned electric distribution systems, 11 of which are served indirectly through sales to
AMEA, and two rural distributing cooperative associations. Alabama Power also supplies steam
service in downtown Birmingham. Alabama Power owns coal reserves near its Gorgas Steam Electric
Generating Plant and uses the output of coal from the reserves in its generating plants. Alabama
Power also sells, and cooperates with dealers in promoting the sale of, electric appliances.

Georgia Power is engaged in the generation and purchase of electricity and the transmission,
distribution and sale of such electricity within the State of Georgia at retail in over 600
communities, as well as in rural areas, and at wholesale currently to OPC, MEAG, Dalton and
Hampton. See Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company under “Merger of Georgia Power
and Savannah Electric” and Note 3 to the financial statements of Georgia Power and Savannah
Electric under “Merger” in Item 8 herein for information on the planned merger of Savannah Electric
with and into Georgia Power.

I-6


Gulf Power is engaged, within the northwestern portion of Florida, in the generation and
purchase of electricity and the distribution and sale of such electricity at retail in 71
communities (including Pensacola, Panama City and Fort Walton Beach), as well as in rural areas,
and at wholesale to a non-affiliated utility and a municipality.

Mississippi Power is engaged in the generation and purchase of electricity and the
distribution and sale of such energy within the 23 counties of southeastern Mississippi, at retail
in 123 communities (including Biloxi, Gulfport, Hattiesburg, Laurel, Meridian and Pascagoula), as
well as in rural areas, and at wholesale to one municipality, six rural electric distribution
cooperative associations and one generating and transmitting cooperative.

Savannah Electric is engaged, within a five-county area in eastern Georgia, in the generation
and purchase of electricity and the distribution and sale of such electricity at retail. See Note
3 to the financial statements of Southern Company under “Merger of Georgia Power and Savannah
Electric” and Note 3 to the financial statements of Georgia Power and Savannah Electric under
“Merger” in Item 8 herein for information on the planned merger of Savannah Electric with and into
Georgia Power.

For information relating to kilowatt-hour sales by classification for the retail operating
companies, see MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS — RESULTS OF OPERATIONS of each of the retail
operating companies in Item 7 herein. Also, for information relating to the sources of revenues
for the Southern Company system, each of the retail operating companies and Southern Power,
reference is made to Item 6 herein.

A portion of the area served by the retail operating companies adjoins the area served by TVA
and its municipal and cooperative distributors. An Act of Congress limits the distribution of TVA
power, unless otherwise authorized by Congress, to specified areas or customers which generally
were those served on July 1, 1957.

The RUS has authority to make loans to cooperative associations or corporations to enable them
to provide electric service to customers in rural sections of the country. There are 71 electric
cooperative organizations operating in the territory in which the retail operating companies
provide electric service at retail or wholesale.

One of these organizations, AEC, is a generating and transmitting cooperative selling power to
several distributing cooperatives, municipal systems and other customers in south Alabama and
northwest Florida. AEC owns generating units with approximately 1,776 megawatts of nameplate
capacity, including an undivided 8.16% ownership interest in Alabama Power’s Plant Miller Units 1
and 2. AEC’s facilities were financed with RUS loans secured by long-term contracts requiring
distributing cooperatives to take their requirements from AEC to the extent such energy is
available.

Four electric cooperative associations, financed by the RUS, operate within Gulf Power’s
service area. These cooperatives purchase their full requirements from AEC and SEPA (a federal
power marketing agency). A non-affiliated utility also operates within Gulf Power’s service area
and purchases its full requirements from Gulf Power.

Alabama Power and Gulf Power have entered into separate agreements with AEC involving
interconnection between their respective systems. The delivery of capacity and energy from AEC to
certain distributing cooperatives in the service areas of Alabama Power and Gulf Power is governed
by the Southern Company/AEC Network Transmission Service Agreement. The rates for this service to
AEC are on file with the FERC. See PROPERTIES — “Jointly-Owned Facilities” in Item 2 herein for
details of Alabama Power’s joint-ownership with AEC of a portion of Plant Miller.

Mississippi Power has an interchange agreement with SMEPA, a generating and transmitting
cooperative, pursuant to which various services are provided, including the furnishing of
protective capacity by Mississippi Power to SMEPA.

There are 43 electric cooperative organizations operating in, or in areas adjoining, territory
in the State of Georgia in which Georgia Power provides electric service at retail or wholesale.
Three of these organizations obtain their power from TVA, one from Southern Power under a 15-year
agreement which began in January 2005 and one from other sources. OPC has a wholesale power
contract with the remaining 38 of these cooperative organizations. OPC and these cooperative
organizations utilize self-owned generation, some of

I-7


which is acquired and jointly-owned with Georgia Power, megawatt capacity purchases from Georgia
Power under power supply agreements and other arrangements to meet their power supply obligations.
Georgia Power, OPC and Georgia Systems Operations Corporation entered into a new control area
compact agreement effective March 1, 2005 which replaced previous coordination service agreements.

Pursuant to an agreement entered into in April 1999, OPC will purchase 250 megawatts of
capacity from Georgia Power through March 2006. In April 2006, AEC will begin purchasing such
capacity for a 10-year term. In January 2005, 29 electric cooperative organizations served by OPC
and one served by Southern Power began purchasing a total of 700 megawatts of capacity from Georgia
Power under individual contracts for 10-year terms. Also, in January 2005, the electric
cooperative served by Southern Power began purchasing 25 megawatts of peaking capacity from Georgia
Power under a 10-year contract. This electric cooperative will purchase 50 megawatts of coal-fired
capacity from Georgia Power beginning April 1, 2006 and ending December 31, 2014 and another 75
megawatts of coal-fired capacity from Georgia Power beginning June 1, 2010 and ending December 31,
2019. See PROPERTIES — “Jointly-Owned Facilities” in Item 2 herein for additional information.

There are 65 municipally-owned electric distribution systems operating in the territory in
which the retail operating companies provide electric service at retail or wholesale.

AMEA was organized under an act of the Alabama legislature and is comprised of 11
municipalities. In October 1991, Alabama Power entered into a power sales contract with AMEA
entitling AMEA to scheduled amounts of additional capacity (up to a maximum 80 megawatts) for a
period of 15 years. Under the terms of the contract, Alabama Power received payments from AMEA
representing the net present value of the revenues associated with the respective capacity
entitlements. This contract expired on December 31, 2005. See Note 6 to the financial statements
of Alabama Power under “First Mortgage Bonds” in Item 8 herein for further information on this
contract.

In December 2001, Alabama Power entered into a power sales agreement with AMEA which began on
January 1, 2006. Under this contract, AMEA supplies 70 to 95 megawatts of power from its
combustion turbine plant and Alabama Power serves the remainder of its member needs through 2010.
Beginning in 2011, the amount of power supplied to AMEA by Alabama Power is fixed at 2010 levels
and AMEA has the option to seek other suppliers for its incremental growth needs through 2015, at
which time the contract terminates.

Forty-eight municipally-owned electric distribution systems and one county-owned system
receive their requirements through MEAG, which was established by a Georgia state statute in 1975.
MEAG serves these requirements from self-owned generation facilities, some of which are acquired
and jointly-owned with Georgia Power, power purchased from Georgia Power and purchases from other
resources. In 1997, a pseudo scheduling and services agreement was implemented between Georgia
Power and MEAG. Since 1977, Dalton has filled its requirements from self-owned generation
facilities, some of which are acquired and jointly-owned with Georgia Power, and through purchases
from Georgia Power pursuant to their partial requirements tariff. Beginning January 1, 2003,
Dalton entered into a power supply agreement with Georgia Power and Southern Power pursuant to
which it will purchase 134 megawatts from Georgia Power and the balance of its requirements, net of
self-owned generation, from Southern Power for a 15-year term. In addition, Georgia Power serves
the full requirements of Hampton’s electric distribution system under a market-based contract. See
PROPERTIES — “Jointly-Owned Facilities” in Item 2 herein for additional information.

Georgia Power has entered into substantially similar agreements with Georgia Transmission
Corporation (formerly OPC’s transmission division), MEAG and Dalton providing for the establishment
of an integrated transmission system to carry the power and energy of each. The agreements require
an investment by each party in the integrated transmission system in proportion to its respective
share of the aggregate system load. See PROPERTIES — “Jointly-Owned Facilities” in Item 2 herein
for additional information.

See MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS — FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “Power Sales
Agreements” of Southern Power in Item 7 herein for information concerning its PPAs.

I-8


SCS, acting on behalf of the retail operating companies, also has a contract with SEPA
providing for the use of those companies’ facilities at government expense to deliver to certain cooperatives and
municipalities, entitled by federal statute to preference in the purchase of power from SEPA,
quantities of power equivalent to the amounts of power allocated to them by SEPA from certain
United States government hydroelectric projects.

The retail service rights of all electric suppliers in the State of Georgia are regulated by
the 1973 State Territorial Electric Service Act. Pursuant to the provisions of this Act, all areas
within existing municipal limits were assigned to the primary electric supplier therein (451
municipalities, including Atlanta, Columbus, Macon, Augusta, Athens, Rome and Valdosta, to Georgia
Power; 115 to electric cooperatives; and 50 to publicly-owned systems). Areas outside of such
municipal limits were either to be assigned or to be declared open for customer choice of supplier
by action of the Georgia PSC pursuant to standards set forth in this Act. Consistent with such
standards, the Georgia PSC has assigned substantially all of the land area in the state to a
supplier. Notwithstanding such assignments, this Act provides that any new customer locating
outside of 1973 municipal limits and having a connected load of at least 900 kilowatts may receive
electric service from the supplier of its choice. See “Competition” herein for additional
information.

Under and subject to the provisions of its franchises and concessions and the 1973 State
Territorial Electric Service Act, Savannah Electric has the full but nonexclusive right to serve
the City of Savannah, the Towns of Bloomingdale, Pooler, Garden City, Guyton, Newington, Oliver,
Port Wentworth, Rincon, Tybee Island, Springfield, Thunderbolt and Vernonburg, and in conjunction
with a secondary supplier, the Town of Richmond Hill. In addition, Savannah Electric has been
assigned certain unincorporated areas in Chatham, Effingham, Bryan, Bulloch and Screven Counties by
the Georgia PSC. See “Competition” herein for additional information. In connection with the
proposed merger with Savannah Electric, Georgia Power has filed an application with the Georgia PSC
for approval of the transfer of Savannah Electric’s service territory to Georgia Power at the
effective time of merger.

Pursuant to the 1956 Utility Act, the Mississippi PSC issued “Grandfather Certificates” of
public convenience and necessity to Mississippi Power and to six distribution rural cooperatives
operating in southeastern Mississippi, then served in whole or in part by Mississippi Power,
authorizing them to distribute electricity in certain specified geographically described areas of
the state. The six cooperatives serve approximately 375,000 retail customers in a certificated
area of approximately 10,300 square miles. In areas included in a “Grandfather Certificate,” the
utility holding such certificate may, without further certification, extend its lines up to five
miles; other extensions within that area by such utility, or by other utilities, may not be made
except upon a showing of, and a grant of a certificate of, public convenience and necessity. Areas
included in such a certificate which are subsequently annexed to municipalities may continue to be
served by the holder of the certificate, irrespective of whether it has a franchise in the annexing
municipality. On the other hand, the holder of the municipal franchise may not extend service into
such newly annexed area without authorization by the Mississippi PSC.

Competition

The electric utility industry in the United States is continuing to evolve as a result of
regulatory and competitive factors. Among the early primary agents of change was the Energy Act of
1992. The Energy Act of 1992 allowed IPPs to access a utility’s transmission network in order to
sell electricity to other utilities.

Alabama Power currently has cogeneration contracts in effect with 11 industrial customers.
Under the terms of these contracts, Alabama Power purchases excess generation of such companies.
During 2005, Alabama Power purchased approximately 137 million kilowatt-hours from such companies
at a cost of $5.7 million.

Georgia Power currently has contracts in effect with 10 small power producers whereby Georgia
Power purchases their excess generation. During 2005, Georgia Power purchased 22 million
kilowatt-hours from such companies at a cost of $0.9 million. Georgia Power has PPAs for
electricity with two cogeneration facilities. Payments are subject to reductions for failure to
meet minimum capacity output. During 2005, Georgia Power purchased 238 million kilowatt-hours at a
cost of $68 million from these facilities.

Gulf Power currently has agreements in effect with various industrial, commercial and
qualifying facilities pursuant to which Gulf Power

I-9


purchases “as available” energy from
customer-owned generation. During 2005, Gulf Power purchased 17 million kilowatt-hours from such companies for approximately $0.9 million.

Mississippi Power currently has a cogeneration agreement in effect with one of its industrial
customers. Under the terms of this contract, Mississippi Power purchases any excess generation.
During 2005, Mississippi Power purchased approximately 39 million kilowatt-hours of excess
generation at a cost of approximately $1 million.

During 2005, Savannah Electric purchased energy from seven customer-owned generating
facilities. Six of the seven customers provide only energy to Savannah Electric. These six
customers make no capacity commitment and are not dispatched by Savannah Electric. Savannah
Electric does have a contract with the remaining customer for eight megawatts of dispatchable
capacity and energy. During 2005, Savannah Electric purchased a total of 62.3 million
kilowatt-hours from the seven suppliers at a cost of approximately $3.3 million.

The competition for retail energy sales among competing suppliers of energy is influenced by
various factors, including price, availability, technological advancements and reliability. These
factors are, in turn, affected by, among other influences, regulatory, political and environmental
considerations, taxation and supply.

Generally, the retail operating companies have experienced, and expect to continue to
experience, competition in their respective retail service territories in varying degrees as the
result of self-generation (as described above) and fuel switching by customers and other factors.
See also “Territory Served by the Utilities” herein for additional information concerning suppliers
of electricity operating within or near the areas served at retail by the retail operating
companies.

Regulation

State Commissions

The retail operating companies are subject to the jurisdiction of their respective state PSCs,
which have broad powers of supervision and regulation over public utilities operating in the
respective states, including their rates, service regulations, sales of securities (except for the
Mississippi PSC) and, in the cases of the Georgia PSC and the Mississippi PSC, in part, retail
service territories. See “Territory Served by the Utilities” and “Rate Matters” herein for
additional information.

Federal Power Act

In July 2005, the U.S. Congress passed the Energy Act of 2005 which repealed the Holding Company
Act effective February 8, 2006. The retail operating companies, Southern Power and its generation
subsidiaries and SEGCO are all public utilities engaged in wholesale sales of energy in interstate
commerce and therefore remain subject to the rate, financial and accounting jurisdiction of the
FERC under the Federal Power Act. Certain financing approvals which would have been obtained from
the SEC under the repealed Holding Company Act now must be obtained from the FERC. In implementing
repeal of the Holding Company Act, the FERC sought to minimize unnecessary administrative burdens
and decided to retain an “at cost standard” for services rendered by system service companies such
as SCS, to permit certain existing financing authorizations to remain effective without further
action by the FERC and to reduce reporting requirements. In addition to its repeal of the Holding
Company Act, the Energy Act of 2005 authorized the FERC to establish regional reliability
organizations authorized to enforce reliability standards, established a process for the FERC to
address impediments to the construction of transmission and established clear responsibility for
the FERC to prohibit manipulative energy trading practices.

Alabama Power and Georgia Power are also subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act or
the earlier Federal Water Power Act applicable to licensees with respect to their hydroelectric
developments. Among the hydroelectric projects subject to licensing by the FERC are 14 existing
Alabama Power generating stations having an aggregate installed capacity of 1,662,400 kilowatts and
18 existing Georgia Power

I-10


generating stations having an aggregate installed capacity of 1,074,696 kilowatts.

In December 2004, the FERC issued a new 30-year license for the Middle Chattahoochee Project.
This project consists of the Goat Rock, Oliver and North Highlands facilities. In 2003, Georgia
Power started the relicensing process for the Morgan Falls project and is currently working on
completing field studies for the facility. The license for the Morgan Falls project expires in
2009. In July 2005, Alabama Power filed two applications with the FERC for a new 50-year license
for its seven hydroelectric developments on the Coosa River (Weiss, Henry, Logan Martin, Lay,
Mitchell, Jordan and Bouldin) and a new 50-year license for the Lewis Smith and Bankhead
developments on the Warrior River. The FERC licenses for all of these nine developments expire in
2007. In 2006, Alabama Power will initiate the process of developing a relicensing application for
the Martin hydroelectric project located on the Tallapoosa River. The current Martin license will
expire in 2013 and the application for a new license will have to be submitted to the FERC in 2011.
See MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS — FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “FERC Matters — Hydro
Relicensing” of Alabama Power in Item 7 herein for additional information.

Georgia Power and OPC also have a license, expiring in 2027, for the Rocky Mountain Plant, a
pure pumped storage facility of 847,800 kilowatt capacity. See PROPERTIES — “Jointly-Owned
Facilities” in Item 2 herein for additional information.

Licenses for all projects, excluding those discussed above, expire in the period 2013-2033 in
the case of Alabama Power’s projects and in the period 2014-2039 in the case of Georgia Power’s
projects.

Upon or after the expiration of each license, the United States Government, by act of
Congress, may take over the project or the FERC may relicense the project either to the original
licensee or to a new licensee. In the event of takeover or relicensing to another, the original
licensee is to be compensated in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Power Act, such
compensation to reflect the net investment of the licensee in the project, not in excess of the
fair value of the property taken, plus reasonable damages to other property of the licensee
resulting from the severance therefrom of the property taken.

Atomic Energy Act of 1954

Alabama Power, Georgia Power and Southern Nuclear are subject to the provisions of the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended, which vests jurisdiction in the NRC over the construction and
operation of nuclear reactors, particularly with regard to certain public health and safety and
antitrust matters. The National Environmental Policy Act has been construed to expand the
jurisdiction of the NRC to consider the environmental impact of a facility licensed under the
Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.

The NRC operating licenses for Plant Vogtle units 1 and 2 currently expire in January 2027 and
February 2029, respectively. In January 2002, the NRC granted Georgia Power a 20-year extension of
the licenses for both units at Plant Hatch which permits the operation of the unit 1 and 2 until
2034 and 2038, respectively. Similarly, in May 2005 the NRC granted Alabama Power a 20-year
extension of the licenses for both units at Plant Farley which permits operation of units 1 and 2
until 2037 and 2041, respectively.

See Notes 1 and 9 to the financial statements of Southern Company, Alabama Power and Georgia
Power in Item 8 herein for information on nuclear decommissioning costs and nuclear insurance.

FERC Matters

See MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS — FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “FERC Matters” of each of
the registrants in Item 7 herein for information on matters regarding the FERC.

Environmental Statutes and Regulations

Southern Company’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by state and federal
environmental agencies under a variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental
media, including air, water and land resources. Compliance with these environmental
requirements involves significant costs, a major portion of which is expected to be recovered
through existing ratemaking provisions. There is no assurance, however, that all such costs
will, in fact, be recovered.

I-11


Compliance with the federal Clean Air Act and resulting regulations has been, and will
continue to be, a significant focus for Southern Company, each retail operating company and SEGCO. See
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  — FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “Environmental Matters” of
Southern Company and each of the retail operating companies in Item 7 herein for additional
information about the Clean Air Act and other environmental issues, including the litigation
brought by the EPA under the New Source Review provisions of the Clean Air Act.

Additionally, each retail operating company and SEGCO has incurred costs for environmental
remediation of various sites. See MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS — FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL
— “Environmental Matters — Environmental Statutes and Regulation — Environmental Remediation” of
Southern Company and each of the retail operating companies in Item 7 herein for information
regarding environmental remediation efforts. Also, see Note 3 to the financial statements of
Southern Company, Georgia Power and Mississippi Power under “Environmental Matters — Environmental
Remediation” and Note 3 to the financial statements of Gulf Power under “Retail Regulatory Matters
— Environmental Remediation” in Item 8 herein for information regarding the identification of sites
that may require environmental remediation.

The retail operating companies, Southern Power and SEGCO are unable to predict at this time
what additional steps they may be required to take as a result of the implementation of existing or
future quality control requirements for air, water and hazardous or toxic materials, but such steps
could adversely affect system operations and result in substantial additional costs.

The outcome of the matters mentioned above under “Regulation” cannot now be determined, except
that these developments may result in delays in obtaining appropriate licenses for generating
facilities, increased construction and operating costs or reduced generation, the nature and extent
of which, while not determinable at this time, could be substantial.

Rate Matters

Rate Structure

The rates and service regulations of the retail operating companies are uniform for each class of
service throughout their respective service areas. Rates for residential electric service are
generally of the block type based upon kilowatt-hours used and include minimum charges.

Residential and other rates contain separate customer charges. Rates for commercial service
are presently of the block type and, for large customers, the billing demand is generally used to
determine capacity and minimum bill charges. These large customers’ rates are generally based upon
usage by the customer and include rates with special features to encourage off-peak usage.
Additionally, the retail operating companies are allowed by their respective state PSCs to
negotiate the terms and cost of service to large customers. Such terms and cost of service,
however, are subject to final state PSC approval. Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power
and Savannah Electric are allowed by state law to recover fuel and net purchased energy costs
through fuel cost recovery provisions which are adjusted to reflect increases or decreases in such
costs as needed. Gulf Power also recovers from retail customers costs of fuel, net purchased
power, energy conservation and environmental compliance through provisions approved by the Florida
PSC which are adjusted annually to reflect increases or decreases in such costs. Revenues are
adjusted for differences between recoverable costs and amounts actually recovered in current rates.

See MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS — FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “PSC Matters”
of Southern Company and each of the retail operating companies in Item 7 herein and Note 3 to the
financial statements of Southern Company under “Alabama Power Retail Regulatory Matters” and
“Georgia Power Retail Regulatory Matters” and Note 3 to the financial statements of each of the
retail operating companies under “Retail Regulatory Matters” in Item 8 herein for a discussion of
rate matters. Also, see Note 1 to the financial statements of Southern Company and each of the
retail operating companies in Item 8 herein for a discussion of recovery of fuel costs and
environmental compliance costs through rates.

I-12


Integrated Resource Planning

Georgia Power and Savannah Electric must file IRPs with the Georgia PSC that specify how each
intends to meet the future electrical needs of its customers through a combination of demand-side
and supply-side resources. The Georgia PSC must certify any new demand-side or supply-side
resources. Once certified, the lesser of actual or certified construction costs and purchased
power costs will be recoverable through rates.

In July 2001, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power’s certification request for approximately
1,800 megawatts of purchased power and 12 megawatts of upgraded hydro generation for Plant Goat
Rock, units 1 and 2. This certification request included a seven-year PPA with Southern Power for
two gas-fired, combined cycle units at Plant Franklin. The purchase of the full 570 megawatts from
the first unit began in 2003. The purchase of the full 610 megawatts from the second unit began in
2004. Additionally, this certification included approval of a 15-year PPA with Southern Power for
615 megawatts of gas-fired combined cycle generation at Plant Harris in Alabama.

In December 2002, the Georgia PSC certified a PPA between Duke Energy and Georgia Power for
620 megawatts for seven years that began in June 2005.

In May 2004, the Georgia PSC ordered Georgia Power and Savannah Electric to purchase the
McIntosh combined cycle generating facility from Southern Power and place it into their respective
rate bases. The McIntosh resource was previously certified as a PPA by the Georgia PSC in the
supply-side certification conducted in 2002 and, at the same time, the Georgia PSC also approved
the de-certification of Savannah Electric’s Plant Riverside, units 4 through 8, effective in May
2005. The McIntosh units produce a combined 1,240 megawatts, of which Georgia Power’s portion is
1,040 megawatts and Savannah Electric’s portion is 200 megawatts. This new generation became
available in June 2005. See Note 3 to the financial statements of Georgia Power and Savannah
Electric under “Retail Regulatory Matters — Plant McIntosh Construction Project” in Item 8 herein
for additional information.

Georgia Power and Savannah Electric received Georgia PSC approval of the 2004 IRP in July
2004. Through the approval of the 2004 IRP, Georgia Power de-certified the Atkinson combustion
turbine units 5A and 5B totaling approximately 80 megawatts of capacity and Savannah Electric
extended the life of the Kraft combustion turbine unit until such time as its retirement is
warranted. Georgia Power and Savannah Electric issued an RFP in July 2005 for approximately 1,000
megawatts to meet their future supply-side capacity needs for 2009 and beyond. With the planned
merger of Savannah Electric into Georgia Power, this RFP will be consolidated by Georgia Power
which will be the sole party to these contracts. In March 2006, Georgia Power is scheduled to
issue RFPs for approximately 2,100 and 1,400 megawatts, respectively, to meet its 2010 and 2011
supply-side needs. For the 2011 RFP, Georgia Power will submit a self-build proposal that compares
to the market. Additionally, Georgia Power and, until completion of the planned merger, Savannah
Electric will each continue a residential load management program which was certified by the
Georgia PSC for up to 40 megawatts of equivalent supply-side capacity. Georgia Power will continue
to utilize approximately eight megawatts of capacity from existing qualifying facilities under firm
contracts and continue to add additional resources as ordered by the Georgia PSC.

In January 2006, Georgia Power filed an application with the Georgia PSC to approve an
amendment to Georgia Power’s IRP in connection with the merger to add Savannah Electric customers
and generating assets.

Environmental Cost Recovery Plans

On October 5, 2004, the Alabama PSC approved a specific rate mechanism for the recovery of
Alabama Power’s retail costs associated with environmental laws, regulations or other such
mandates. The rate mechanism began operation in January 2005 and provides for the recovery of
these costs pursuant to a factor that will be calculated annually. Environmental costs to be
recovered include operation and maintenance expense, depreciation and a return on invested
capital. See MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS — FUTURE
EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “PSC Matters —
Alabama Power” and “PSC Matters — Retail Rate Adjustments,” respectively, of Southern Company
and Alabama Power in Item 7 herein and Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company
and Alabama Power, under “Alabama Power Retail Regulatory Matters” and “Retail Regulatory
Matters,” respectively, in Item 8 herein for a discussion on Alabama PSC rate matters.

I-13


The Florida Legislature has adopted legislation for an Environmental Cost Recovery Clause,
which allows Gulf Power to petition the Florida PSC for recovery of prudent environmental
compliance costs that are not being recovered through base rates or any other recovery mechanism.
Such environmental costs include operation and maintenance expense, emission allowance expense,
depreciation and a return on invested capital. This legislation was amended in 2002 to allow recovery of costs incurred as a result of an agreement
between Gulf Power and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection for the purpose of
ensuring compliance with ozone ambient air quality standards adopted by the EPA. See Note 3 to the
financial statements of Gulf Power under “Retail Regulatory Matters” in Item 8 herein for
additional information.

In 1992, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power’s Environmental Compliance Overview
Plan (ECO Plan). The ECO Plan establishes procedures to facilitate the Mississippi PSC’s overview
of Mississippi Power’s environmental strategy and provides for recovery of costs (including costs
of capital associated with environmental projects approved by the Mississippi PSC). Under the ECO
Plan, any increase in the annual revenue requirement is limited to two percent of retail revenues.
However, the ECO Plan also provides for carryover of any amount over the two percent limit into the
next year’s revenue requirement. Mississippi Power conducts studies, when possible, to determine
the extent of any required environmental remediation. Should such remediation be determined to be
probable, reasonable estimates of costs to clean up such sites are developed and recognized in the
financial statements. Mississippi Power recovers such costs under the ECO Plan as they are
incurred, as provided for in Mississippi Power’s 1994 ECO Plan order. Mississippi Power filed its
2006 ECO Plan in February 2006, which, if approved as filed, will result in a decrease in customer
prices. See Note 3 to the financial statements of Mississippi Power under “Environmental
Compliance Overview Plan” in Item 8 herein for additional information.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS

In addition to the other information in this Form 10-K, including MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS — FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL in Item 7 of each
registrant, and other documents filed by Southern Company and/or its subsidiaries with the SEC from
time to time, the following factors should be carefully considered in evaluating Southern Company
and its subsidiaries. Such factors could affect actual results and cause results to differ
materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of,
Southern Company and/or its subsidiaries.

Risks Related to the Energy Industry

Southern Company and its subsidiaries are subject to substantial governmental regulation.
Compliance with current and future regulatory requirements and procurement of necessary approvals,
permits and certificates may result in substantial costs to Southern Company and its subsidiaries.

Southern Company and its subsidiaries, including the retail operating companies and Southern
Power, are subject to substantial regulation from federal, state and local regulatory agencies.
Southern Company and its subsidiaries are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations and
to obtain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from the governmental agencies that regulate
various aspects of their businesses, including customer rates, service regulations, retail service
territories, sales of securities, asset acquisitions and sales, accounting policies and practices
and the operation of fossil-fuel, hydroelectric and nuclear generating facilities. For example,
the rates charged to wholesale customers by the retail operating companies and by Southern Power
must be approved by the FERC. In addition, the respective state PSCs must approve the retail
operating companies’ rates for retail customers. While the retail rates approved by the respective
state PSCs are designed to provide for recovery of costs and a return on invested capital, there
can be no assurance that a state PSC will not deem certain costs to be imprudently incurred and not
subject to recovery.

Until February 8, 2006, Southern Company was subject to regulation by the SEC under the
Holding Company Act. In July 2005, the U.S. Congress passed the Energy Act of 2005 which, among
other things, repealed the Holding Company Act effective February 8, 2006. Under the Energy Act of
2005, the FERC was provided with new oversight responsibilities for the electric utility industry.

Southern Company and its subsidiaries believe the necessary permits, approvals and
certificates have been obtained for its existing operations and that their respective businesses
are conducted in accordance with applicable laws; however, the impact of any future revision or
changes in interpretations of existing regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations
applicable to Southern Company or any of its subsidiaries cannot now be predicted. Changes in
regulation or the imposition of additional regulations could influence the operating environment of
Southern Company and its subsidiaries and may result in substantial costs.

General Risks Related to Operation of Southern Company’s Utility Subsidiaries

The regional power market in which Southern Company and its utility subsidiaries compete may have
changing transmission regulatory structures, which could affect the ownership of these assets and
related revenues and expenses.

The retail operating companies currently own and operate transmission facilities as part of a
vertically integrated utility. Transmission revenues are not separated from generation and
distribution revenues in their approved retail rates. Since 1999, when the FERC issued final rules
on RTOs, there have been a number of proceedings at FERC designed to encourage further voluntary
formation of RTOs or to mandate their formation. Under this new transmission regulatory structure,
the retail operating companies could transfer functional control (but not ownership) of their
transmission facilities to an independent third party. While there are no active proceedings at
FERC that would require Southern Company to participate in a RTO, current FERC efforts that may
potentially change the regulatory and/or operational structure of transmission include rules
related to the standardization of generation interconnection, as well as an inquiry into, among
other things, market power by vertically integrated utilities. The financial condition, net income
and cash flows of Southern Company and its utility subsidiaries

I-16


could be adversely affected by
future changes in the federal regulatory or operational structure of transmission.

Certain events in the energy markets that are beyond the control of Southern Company and its
subsidiaries have increased the level of public and regulatory scrutiny in the energy industry and
in the capital markets. The reaction to these events may result in new laws or regulations related
to the business operations or the accounting treatment of the existing operations of Southern
Company and its subsidiaries which could have a negative impact on the net income or access to
capital of Southern Company and its subsidiaries.

As a result of the energy crisis in California during the summer of 2001, the Enron
Corporation bankruptcy, investigations by governmental authorities into energy trading activities
and the August 2003 power outage in the Northeast, companies in regulated and unregulated electric
utility businesses have been under an increased amount of public and regulatory scrutiny with
respect to, among other things, accounting practices, financial disclosures and relationships with
independent auditors. This increased scrutiny has led to substantial changes in laws and
regulations affecting Southern Company and its subsidiaries, including, among others, enhanced
internal control and auditor independence requirements, financial statement certification
requirements, more frequent SEC reviews of financial statements and accelerated and additional SEC
filing requirements. New accounting and disclosure requirements have changed the way Southern
Company and its subsidiaries are required to record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities.
Southern Company expects continued regulatory focus on accounting and financial reporting issues.
Future disruptions in the industry such as those described above and any additional resulting
regulations may have a negative impact on the net income or access to capital of Southern Company
and its subsidiaries.

Deregulation or restructuring in the electric industry may result in increased competition and
unrecovered costs which could negatively impact the net income of Southern Company and the retail
operating companies and the value of their respective assets.

Increased competition, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant
adverse financial impact on Southern Company and its retail operating companies. Increased
competition could result in increased pressure to lower the cost of electricity. Any adoption in
the territories served by the retail operating companies of retail competition and the unbundling
of regulated energy service could have a significant adverse financial impact on Southern Company
and the retail operating companies due to an impairment of assets, a loss of retail customers,
lower profit margins, an inability to recover reasonable costs or increased costs of capital.
Southern Company and the retail operating companies cannot predict if or when they may be subject
to changes in legislation or regulation, nor can Southern Company and the retail operating
companies predict the impact of these changes.

Additionally, the electric utility industry has experienced a substantial increase in
competition at the wholesale level. As a result of changes in federal law and regulatory
policy, competition in the wholesale electricity market has greatly increased due to a greater
participation by traditional electricity suppliers, non-utility generators, IPPs, wholesale
power marketers and brokers, and due to the trading of energy futures contracts on various
commodities exchanges. In addition, FERC rules on transmission service are designed to
facilitate competition in the wholesale market on a nationwide basis, by providing greater
flexibility and more choices to wholesale power customers.

Potential changes to the criteria used by the FERC for approval of market-based contracts may
negatively impact the retail operating companies’ and Southern Power’s ability to charge
market-based rates.

Each of the retail operating companies and Southern Power have authorization from the FERC
to sell power to nonaffiliates at market-based prices. The retail operating companies and
Southern Power also have FERC authority to make short-term opportunity sales at market rates.
Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a market-based contract with an
affiliate. In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s
generation dominance within its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based
rates in other markets is not an issue in that proceeding. Any new market-based rate
transactions in its retail service territory entered into after February 27, 2005 are subject to
refund to the level of the default cost-based rates, pending the outcome of the proceeding. In
the event

I-17


that FERC’s default mitigation measures for entities that are found to have market power are
ultimately applied, the retail operating companies and Southern Power may be required to charge
cost-based rates for certain wholesale sales in the Southern Company retail service territory,
which may be lower than market-based rates.

In addition, in May 2005 the FERC started an investigation to determine whether Southern
Company satisfies the other three parts of FERC’s market-based rate analysis: transmission
market power, barriers to entry and affiliate abuse or reciprocal dealing. Any and all new
market-based rate transactions involving any Southern Company subsidiary will be subject to
refund to the extent the FERC orders lower rates as a result of this new investigation, with the
refund period beginning July 19, 2005.

In May 2005, the FERC also initiated a proceeding to examine the provisions of the IIC,
whether any parties to the IIC have violated FERC’s standards of conduct applicable to utility
companies that are transmission providers, and whether Southern Company’s code of conduct
defining Southern Power as a “system company” rather than a “marketing affiliate” is just and
reasonable. Effective July 19, 2005, revenues from transactions under the IIC involving any
Southern Company subsidiaries will be subject to refund to the extent FERC orders any changes to
the IIC.

Risks Related to Environmental Regulation

Southern Company’s and the retail operating companies’ costs of compliance with environmental laws
are significant. The costs of compliance with future environmental laws and the incurrence of
environmental liabilities could harm the net income and cash flows of Southern Company, the retail
operating companies or Southern Power.

Southern Company and the retail operating companies are subject to extensive federal, state
and local environmental requirements which, among other things, regulate air emissions, water
discharges and the management of hazardous and solid waste in order to adequately protect the
environment. Compliance with these legal requirements requires Southern Company and the retail
operating companies to commit significant expenditures for installation of pollution control
equipment, environmental monitoring, emissions fees and permits at all of their respective
facilities. These expenditures are significant and Southern Company and the retail operating
companies expect that they will increase in the future. Through 2005, Southern Company had
spent approximately $1.6 billion in reducing sulfur dioxide (SO


) and nitrogen oxide
(NO

x

) emissions and in monitoring emissions pursuant to the Clean Air Act.
Additional controls have been announced and are currently being installed at several plants to
further reduce SO


and NO

x

emissions, to maintain compliance with existing
regulations and to meet new requirements.

Approximately $1.3 billion of these expenditures related to reducing NO

x

emissions
pursuant to state and federal requirements in connection with the EPA’s one-hour ozone standard and
the 1998 regional NO

x

reduction rules.

Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage,
personal injury, and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements, such as opacity and other
air quality standards, has increased generally throughout the United States. In particular,
personal injury claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become
more frequent.

If Southern Company, the retail operating companies or Southern Power fail to comply with
environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond their control, that failure
may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and fines. The EPA has filed civil
actions against Alabama Power, Georgia Power and Savannah Electric alleging violations of the new
source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. Georgia Power is a party to a civil suit regarding
alleged violations of the Clean Air Act at four units of Plant Wansley, and Southern Company is a
party to a suit alleging its emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, contribute to global
warming. An adverse outcome in any one of these cases could require substantial capital
expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly require the payment of
substantial penalties. This could affect future results of operations, cash flows, and possibly
financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

Existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised or new laws and regulations seeking
to protect the environment may be

I-18


adopted or
become applicable to Southern Company, the retail operating companies and Southern Power. Revised or additional laws
and regulations could result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on the
facilities of the retail operating companies or Southern Power or increased compliance costs which
may not be fully recoverable from customers and would therefore reduce the net income of Southern
Company, the retail operating companies or Southern Power. The cost impact of such legislation
would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined at this time.

Risks Related to Southern Company and its Business

Southern Company may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay
dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay upstream dividends or repay
funds to Southern Company.

Southern Company is a holding company and, as such, Southern Company has no operations of its
own. Southern Company’s ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its
common stock at the current rate is primarily dependent on the net income and cash flows of its
subsidiaries and their ability to pay upstream dividends or to repay funds to Southern Company.
Prior to funding Southern Company, Southern Company’s subsidiaries have financial obligations that
must be satisfied, including among others, debt service and preferred stock dividends.

The financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected if its
subsidiaries are unable to successfully operate their facilities.

Southern Company’s financial performance depends on the successful operation of its
subsidiaries’ electric generating, transmission and distribution facilities. Operating these
facilities involves many risks, including:

A decrease or elimination of revenues from power produced by the electric generating
facilities or an increase in the cost of operating the facilities would reduce the net income and
cash flows and could adversely impact the financial condition of the affected retail operating
company or Southern Power and of Southern Company.

In addition, Southern Company’s non-utility businesses depend on the successful operation of
their respective facilities. For example, the net income and cash flows of SouthernLINC Wireless
and Southern Company could be adversely impacted in the event of a major failure of its
telecommunications facilities.

The revenues of Southern Company, the retail operating companies and Southern Power depend in part
on sales under PPAs. The failure of a counterparty to one of these PPAs to perform its
obligations, or the failure to renew the PPAs, could have a negative impact on the net income and
cash flows of the affected retail operating company or Southern Power and of Southern Company.

Most of Southern Power’s generating capacity has been sold to purchasers under PPAs having
initial terms of five to 15 years. In addition, the retail operating companies enter into PPAs
with non-affiliated parties. Revenues are dependent on the continued performance by the purchasers
of their obligations under these PPAs. Even though Southern Power and the retail operating
companies have a rigorous credit evaluation, the failure of one of the purchasers to perform its
obligations could have a negative impact on the net income and cash flows of the affected retail
operating company or Southern Power and of Southern Company. Although these credit evaluations
take into account the possibility of default by a purchaser, actual exposure to a default by a
purchaser may be greater than the credit evaluation predicts. Neither Southern Power nor the
retail operating companies can predict whether the PPAs will be renewed at the end of their
respective terms or on what terms any renewals may be made. If a PPA is not renewed, a replacement
PPA cannot be assured.

I-19


Southern Company, the retail operating companies and Southern Power may incur additional costs or
 delays in power plant construction and may not be able to recover their investment. The facilities
of Southern Company, the retail operating companies and Southern Power require ongoing capital
expenditures.

Certain of the retail operating companies and Southern Power are in the process of
constructing new generating facilities. Southern Company intends to continue its strategy of
developing and constructing other new facilities and expanding existing facilities. The completion
of these facilities without delays or cost overruns is subject to substantial risks, including:

If a retail operating company or Southern Power is unable to complete the development or
construction of a facility or decides to delay or cancel construction of a facility, it may not be
able to recover its investment in that facility. In addition, construction delays and contractor
performance shortfalls can result in the loss of revenues and may, in turn, adversely affect the
net income and financial position of a retail operating company or Southern Power and Southern
Company. Furthermore, if construction projects are not completed according to specification, a
retail operating company or Southern Power and Southern Company may incur liabilities and suffer
reduced plant efficiency, higher operating costs and reduced net income.

Once facilities come into commercial operation, ongoing capital expenditures are required to
maintain reliable levels of operation. Significant portions of the retail operating companies’
existing facilities were constructed many years ago. Older generation equipment, even if
maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant capital
expenditures to maintain efficiency, to comply with changing environmental requirements or to
provide reliable operations.

Changes in technology may make Southern Company’s electric generating facilities owned by the
retail operating companies and Southern Power less competitive.

A key element of the business model of Southern Company, the retail operating companies and
Southern Power is that generating power at central power plants achieves economies of scale and
produces power at relatively low cost. There are other technologies that produce power, most
notably fuel cells, microturbines, windmills and solar cells. It is possible that advances in
technology will reduce the cost of alternative methods of producing power to a level that is
competitive with that of most central power station electric production. If this were to happen
and if these technologies achieved economies of scale, the market share of Southern Company, the
retail operating companies and Southern Power could be eroded, and the value of their respective
electric generating facilities could be reduced. Changes in technology could also alter the
channels through which retail electric customers buy or utilize power, which could reduce the
revenues or increase the expenses of Southern Company, the retail operating companies or Southern
Power.

Operation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, health,
regulatory, terrorism and financial risks that could result in fines or the closure of Southern
Company’s nuclear units owned by Alabama Power or Georgia Power, and which may present potential
exposures in excess of insurance coverage.

Alabama Power owns two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and
contracts for operation of, four nuclear units. These six units are operated by Southern Nuclear
and represent approximately 3,680 megawatts, or 9.1% of Southern Company’s generation capacity as
of December 31, 2005. These nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, health and financial
risks such as on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel, the ability to dispose of such spent nuclear
fuel, the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning, potential liabilities arising
out of the operation of these facilities and the threat of a possible terrorist attack. Alabama
Power and Georgia Power

I-20


maintain
decommissioning trusts and external insurance coverage to minimize the financial exposure to these risks; however, it is possible that
damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage.

The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related
requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. In the event of non-compliance,
the NRC has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its
assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Recent NRC orders
related to increased security measures and any future safety requirements promulgated by the NRC
could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make substantial operating and capital
expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, although Alabama Power, Georgia Power and
Southern Company have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at its plants, if an
incident did occur, it could result in substantial costs to Alabama Power or Georgia Power and
Southern Company. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC
to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit.

In addition, potential terrorist threats and increased public scrutiny of utilities could
result in increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs that are difficult or impossible to
predict.

The generation and energy marketing operations of Southern Company, the retail operating companies
and Southern Power are subject to risks, many of which are beyond their control, including changes
in power prices and fuel costs, that may reduce Southern Company’s, the retail operating companies’
and Southern Power’s revenues and increase costs.

The generation and energy marketing operations of Southern Company, the retail operating
companies and Southern Power are subject to changes in power prices or fuel costs, which could
increase the cost of producing power or decrease the amount Southern Company, the retail operating
companies and Southern Power receive from the sale of power. The market prices for these
commodities may fluctuate over relatively short periods of time. Southern Company, the retail
operating companies and Southern Power attempt to mitigate risks associated with fluctuating fuel
costs by passing these costs on to customers through the retail operating company fuel cost
recovery clauses or through PPAs. Among the factors that could influence power prices and fuel
costs are:

Certain of these factors could increase the expenses of the retail operating companies or
Southern Power and Southern Company. For the retail operating companies, such increases may not be
fully recoverable through rates. Other of these factors could reduce the revenues of the retail
operating companies or Southern Power and Southern Company.

As a result of increasing fuel costs, the retail operating companies have accrued significant
underrecovered fuel cost balances. In addition, Alabama Power, Gulf Power and Mississippi Power
have significant deficit balances in their storm cost recovery reserves as a result of Hurricanes
Ivan, Dennis and Katrina. While the retail operating companies are generally authorized under
state legislation administered by the

I-21


respective
PSCs to recover underrecovered fuel costs through fuel cost recovery clauses and storm recovery costs through special rate provisions,
recovery may be denied if costs are deemed to be imprudently incurred and delays in the
authorization of such recovery could negatively impact the cash flows of the affected retail
operating companies and Southern Company.

The use of derivative contracts by Southern Company and its subsidiaries in the normal course of
business could result in financial losses that negatively impact the net income of Southern Company
and its subsidiaries.

Southern Company and its subsidiaries, including the retail operating companies and Southern
Power, use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forwards, to manage their
commodity and financial market risks and, to a lesser extent, engage in limited trading activities.
Southern Company and its subsidiaries could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility
in the market values of these contracts, or if a counterparty fails to perform. In the absence of
actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these
financial instruments can involve management’s judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes
in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the value of the
reported fair value of these contracts.

The retail operating companies and Southern Power may not be able to obtain adequate fuel supplies,
which could limit their ability to operate their facilities.

The retail operating companies and Southern Power purchase fuel, including coal, natural gas
and fuel oil, from a number of suppliers. Disruption in the delivery of fuel, including
disruptions as a result of, among other things, weather, labor relations, force majuere events or
environmental regulations affecting any of these fuel suppliers, could limit the ability of the
retail operating companies and Southern Power to operate their respective facilities, and thus,
reduce the net income of the affected retail operating company or Southern Power and Southern
Company.

The retail operating companies are dependent on coal for much of their electric generating
capacity. Each retail operating company has coal supply contracts in place; however, there can be
no assurance that the counterparties to these agreements will fulfill their obligations to supply
coal to the retail operating companies. The suppliers under these agreements may experience
financial or technical problems which inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to the
retail operating companies. In addition, the suppliers under these agreements may not be required
to supply coal to the retail operating companies under certain circumstances, such as in the event
of a natural disaster. If the retail operating companies are unable to obtain their coal
requirements under these contracts, the retail operating companies may be required to purchase
their coal requirements at higher prices, which may not be fully recoverable through rates.

In addition, Southern Power in particular, and the retail operating companies to a lesser
extent, are dependent on natural gas for a portion of their electric generating capacity. Natural
gas supplies can be subject to disruption in the event production or distribution is curtailed.
For example, in connection with the 2005 hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, production and
distribution of natural gas was limited for a period of time, resulting in shortages and
significant increases in the price of natural gas. In addition, world market conditions for fuels,
including the policies of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Companies, can impact the price
and availability of natural gas.

Demand for power could exceed supply capacity, resulting in increased costs for purchasing capacity
in the open market or building additional generation capabilities.

Through the retail operating companies and Southern Power, Southern Company is currently
obligated to supply power to retail customers and wholesale customers under long-term PPAs. At
peak times, the demand for power required to meet this obligation could exceed Southern Company’s
available generation capacity. Market or competitive forces may require that the retail operating
companies or Southern Power purchase capacity on the open market or build additional generation
capabilities. Because regulators may not permit the retail operating companies to pass all of
these purchase or construction costs on to their customers, the retail operating companies may not
be able to recover any of these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the
time between the incurrence of costs of purchased or constructed capacity and the retail operating
companies’ recovery in customers’ rates. Under Southern Power’s long-term fixed price PPAs,
Southern

I-22


Power
would not have the ability to recover any of these costs. These situations could have negative impacts on net income and cash flows for the
affected retail operating company or Southern Power and Southern Company.

The operating results of Southern Company, the retail operating companies and Southern Power are
affected by weather conditions and may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis.

Electric power generation is generally a seasonal business. In many parts of the country,
demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time.
In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter. As a result, the overall operating results
of Southern Company, the retail operating companies and Southern Power in the future may fluctuate
substantially on a seasonal basis. In addition, Southern Company, the retail operating companies
and Southern Power have historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income, when
weather conditions are milder. Unusually mild weather in the future could reduce the revenues, net
income, available cash and borrowing ability of Southern Company, the retail operating companies
and Southern Power.

Mirant and The Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Mirant Corporation have filed a claim
against Southern Company seeking substantial monetary damages in connection with transfers made by
Mirant to Southern Company prior to the Mirant spin-off.

In July 2003, Mirant filed for voluntary reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy
Code, and in January 2006, completed its plan of reorganization.

In 2005, Mirant, as debtor in possession, and The Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of
Mirant Corporation filed a complaint against Southern Company in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the
Northern District of Texas, which was amended in July 2005 and February 2006. The complaint
alleges that Southern Company caused Mirant to engage in certain fraudulent transfers and to pay
illegal dividends to Southern Company in 1999 and 2000 with actual intent to hinder, delay or
defraud creditors, or, alternatively, when Southern Company knew or should have known that Mirant
was allegedly insolvent, undercapitalized or unable to pay its debts. The complaint seeks monetary
damages in excess of $2 billion plus interest, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. In
addition, Mirant has objected to Southern Company’s claims against Mirant in the Bankruptcy Court
and seeks equitable subordination of Southern Company’s claims to the claims of all other
creditors. While Southern Company believes there is no meritorious basis for Mirant’s claims and
intends to vigorously defend itself in the action, the ultimate outcome of Mirant’s claims cannot
be determined at this time.

IRS challenges to Southern Company’s income tax deductions taken in connection with four
international leveraged lease transactions could result in the payment of substantial additional
interest and penalties and could materially impact Southern Company’s cash flow and net income.

Southern Company participates in four international leveraged lease transactions and receives
federal income tax deductions for depreciation and amortization, as well as interest on related
debt. In connection with its audit of Southern Company’s tax returns for 1996 through 2001, the
IRS proposed to disallow Southern Company’s tax losses related to one international leveraged lease
(a lease-in-lease-out, or LILO) transaction. In February 2005, Southern Company reached a
negotiated settlement with the IRS relating to this matter, which is
subject to final approval.

In addition, the IRS has challenged Southern Company’s deductions related to the three other
international leases (sale-in-lease-out, or SILO) transactions in connection with its audit of
Southern Company’s 2000 and 2001 tax returns. If the IRS is ultimately successful in disallowing
the tax deductions related to these three transactions, beginning with the 2000 tax year, Southern
Company could be subject to additional interest charges of up to $34 million, and the IRS has
proposed a penalty of approximately $16 million. Although the payment of the tax liability,
exclusive of this interest, would not affect Southern Company’s results of operations under current
accounting standards, it could have a material impact on cash flow. Furthermore, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board has recently proposed changes to the accounting for both leveraged
leases and uncertain tax positions that are expected to become effective in 2006. For the LILO
transaction, Southern

I-23


Company’s
estimates the cumulative effect upon adoption of the accounting change would reduce Southern Company’s net
income by approximately $16 million. The impact of these proposed changes related to the SILO
transactions would be dependent on the outcome of ongoing negotiations with the IRS, but could be
significant, and potentially material, to Southern Company’s net income.

Risks Related to Market and Economic Volatility

The business of Southern Company, the retail operating companies and Southern Power is dependent on
their ability to successfully access capital markets. The inability of Southern Company, any
retail operating company or Southern Power to access capital may limit its ability to execute its
business plan or pursue improvements and make acquisitions that Southern Company, the retail
operating companies or Southern Power may otherwise rely on for future growth.

Southern Company, the retail operating companies and Southern Power rely on access to both
short-term money markets and longer-term capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for
capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from their respective operations. If Southern
Company, any retail operating company or Southern Power is not able to access capital at
competitive rates, its ability to implement its business plan or pursue improvements and make
acquisitions that Southern Company, the retail operating companies or Southern Power may otherwise
rely on for future growth will be limited. Each of Southern Company, each retail operating company
and Southern Power believes that it will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets
based upon current credit ratings. However, certain market disruptions or a downgrade of the
credit rating of Southern Company, any retail operating company or Southern Power may increase its
cost of borrowing or adversely affect its ability to raise capital through the issuance of
securities or other borrowing arrangements. Such disruptions could include:

Southern Company, the retail operating companies and Southern Power are subject to risks associated
with a changing economic environment, including their ability to obtain insurance, the financial
stability of their respective customers and their ability to raise capital.

The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the continuing threat of terrorism and the related
military action by the United States have affected the nation’s economy and financial markets. The
insurance industry has also been disrupted by these events. The availability of insurance covering
risks Southern Company, the retail operating companies, Southern Power and their respective
competitors typically insure against may decrease, and the insurance that Southern Company, the
retail operating companies and Southern Power are able to obtain may have higher deductibles,
higher premiums and more restrictive policy terms. Any economic downturn or disruption of
financial markets could constrain the capital available to Southern Company’s, the retail operating
companies’ and Southern Power’s industry and could reduce access to funding for the respective
operations of Southern Company, the retail operating companies and Southern Power, as well as the
financial stability of their respective customers and counterparties. These factors could
adversely affect Southern Company’s subsidiaries’ ability to achieve energy sales growth, thereby
decreasing Southern Company’s level of future net income.

Certain of the retail operating companies have substantial investments in the Gulf Coast region
which can be subject to major storm activity. The ability of the retail operating companies to
recover costs and replenish reserves in the event of a major storm, other natural disaster,
terrorist attack or other catastrophic event generally will require regulatory action.

Each retail operating company maintains a reserve for property damage to cover the cost of
damages from major storms to its transmission and distribution lines and the cost of uninsured
damages to its generating facilities and other property. In September 2004, Hurricane Ivan hit the
Gulf coast of Florida and Alabama, causing significant damage to the service areas of Alabama Power
and Gulf Power. In July and August

I-24


2005, Hurricanes Dennis and Katrina, respectively, hit the Gulf coast of the United States and
caused significant damage in the service areas of Gulf Power, Alabama Power and Mississippi Power.
In each case, costs to the respective retail operating companies exceeded their respective storm
cost reserves and insurance coverage. In the event a retail operating company experiences a
natural disaster, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event, recovery of costs in excess of
reserves and insurance coverage is subject to the approval of the respective state PSC. While the
retail operating companies generally are entitled to recover prudently incurred costs incurred in
connection with such an event, any denial by the state PSC or delay in recovery of any portion of
such costs could have a material negative impact on a retail operating company’s result of
operations and/or cash flows.

Increases in the price of oil may limit tax credits available to Southern Company under Section 29
of the Internal Revenue Code in connection synthetic fuel investments and could result in
impairments to Southern Company’s investments in synthetic fuel projects.

Southern Company has investments in two entities that produce synthetic fuel and receive tax
credits under Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code. In accordance with Section 29 of the
Internal Revenue Code, these tax credits are subject to limitation as the annual average price of
oil (as determined by the DOE) increases over a specified, inflation-adjusted dollar amount
published in the spring of the subsequent year. Southern Company, along with its partners in these
investments, will continue to monitor oil prices. Any indicated potential limitation on these
credits could affect either the timing or the amount of the credit recognition and could require an
impairment analysis of these investments by Southern Company.

Except as discussed below under “Titles to Property,” the principal plants and other
important units of the retail operating companies, Southern Power and SEGCO are owned in fee by
the respective companies. It is the opinion of management of each such company that its
operating properties are adequately maintained and are substantially in good operating
condition.

Mississippi Power owns a 79-mile length of 500-kilovolt transmission line which is leased
to Entergy Gulf States. The line, completed in 1984, extends from Plant Daniel to the Louisiana
state line. Entergy Gulf States is paying a use fee over a 40-year period covering all expenses
and the amortization of the original $57 million cost of the line. At December 31, 2005, the
unamortized portion of this cost was approximately $27.7 million.

The all-time maximum demand on the retail operating companies, Southern Power and SEGCO was
35,049,600 kilowatts and occurred on July 26, 2005. This amount excludes demand served by capacity retained by MEAG, OPC and SEPA.
The reserve margin for the retail operating companies, Southern Power and SEGCO at that time was
14.4%. See SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA in Item 6 herein for additional information on
peak demands.

for the joint owners. SCS provides operation and maintenance services for Plant Stanton A.

In addition, Georgia Power has commitments regarding a portion of a five percent interest
in Plant Vogtle owned by MEAG that are in effect until the
later of retirement of the plant or the latest stated maturity date of MEAG’s bonds issued to
finance such ownership interest. The payments for capacity are required whether any capacity is
available. The energy cost is a function of each unit’s variable

operating costs. Except for
the portion of the capacity payments related to the Georgia PSC’s disallowances of Plant Vogtle
costs, the cost of such capacity and energy is included in purchased power from non-affiliates
in Georgia Power’s Statements of Income in Item 8 herein.

As of the end of the period covered by this annual report, Southern Company, the retail

with the participation of each company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Sections 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934). Based upon these evaluations, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial
Officer, in each case, concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

During the fourth quarter 2005, Savannah Electric transferred responsibility for certain
internal control procedures related to accounting for property, joint ownership, fuel and purchased

transactions and maintains overall financial reporting responsibility; however, the transfer of
these control procedures constitutes a change in Savannah Electric’s internal control over
financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934) that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

Southern Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate
system of internal control over financial reporting as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
and as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). A control system can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.

Under management’s supervision, an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of Southern
Company’s internal control over financial reporting was conducted based on the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that Southern Company’s
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2005.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as auditors of
Southern Company’s financial statements, has issued an
attestation report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of Southern Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2005. Deloitte & Touche LLP’s report, which expresses unqualified opinions on management’s
assessment and on the effectiveness of Southern Company’s internal control over financial
reporting, is included herein.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Southern Company

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management Report (page
II-8), that Southern Company (the “Company”) maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The
Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including
the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements
due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based
on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2005, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2005 of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2006 expressed an unqualified
opinion on those financial statements.

Consolidated Financial Statements

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Southern Company

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of
capitalization of Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2005
and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, common
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2005. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements (pages II-38 to II-75) present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

OVERVIEW

Business Activities

The primary business of Southern Company (the Company) is electricity sales in the Southeast by
the retail operating companies – Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power,
and Savannah Electric – and Southern Power. Southern Power constructs, owns, and manages
Southern Company’s competitive generation assets and sells electricity at market-based rates in
the wholesale market.

Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of Southern Company’s
electricity business. These factors include the retail operating companies’ ability to maintain
a stable regulatory environment, to achieve energy sales growth while containing costs, and to
recover rising costs. These costs include those related to growing demand, increasingly
stringent environmental standards, fuel prices, and storm restoration following multiple
hurricanes. Since the beginning of 2004, each of the retail operating companies completed
successful retail rate proceedings. These regulatory actions are expected to benefit future
earnings stability and enable the recovery of substantial capital investments to facilitate the
continued reliability of the transmission and distribution network and to continue environmental
improvements at the generating plants. Appropriately balancing environmental expenditures with
customer prices will continue to challenge the Company for the foreseeable future. In addition,
Georgia Power, Gulf Power, and Mississippi Power expect further rate proceedings in 2006 as
necessary to address fuel and storm damage cost recovery.

Another major factor is the profitability of the competitive market-based wholesale
generating business and federal regulatory policy, which may impact Southern Company’s level of
participation in this market. Southern Power continued executing its regional strategy in 2005
by signing several wholesale contracts with major utilities, as well as with cooperatives and
municipal suppliers in the Southeast. However, the Company continues to face regulatory
challenges related to transmission and market power issues at the national level.

Southern Company’s other business activities include investments in synthetic fuel
producing entities, which claim federal income tax credits that offset their operating losses, leveraged
lease projects, telecommunications, and energy-related services. Management continues to evaluate the
contribution of each of these activities to total shareholder return and may pursue acquisitions and dispositions accordingly. In January 2006,
the sale of the Company’s natural gas marketing business was completed.

Key Performance Indicators

In striving to maximize shareholder value while providing cost-effective energy to more than 4
million customers, Southern Company continues to focus on several key indicators. These
indicators include customer satisfaction, plant availability, system reliability, and earnings
per share (EPS). Southern Company’s financial success is directly tied to the satisfaction of
its customers. Key elements of ensuring customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high
reliability, and competitive prices. Management uses customer satisfaction surveys and
reliability indicators to evaluate the Company’s results.

Peak season equivalent forced outage rate (Peak Season EFOR) is an indicator of
fossil/hydro plant availability and efficient generation fleet operations during the months when
generation needs are greatest. The rate is calculated by dividing the number of hours of forced
outages by total generation hours. Peak Season EFOR performance excludes the impact of
hurricanes and certain outage events caused by manufacturer defects. The 2005 Peak Season EFOR
performance was slightly below target (as shown in the chart below) primarily due to an outage
event at a combined cycle unit. Transmission and distribution system reliability performance is
measured by the frequency and duration of outages. Performance targets for reliability are set
internally based on historical performance, expected weather conditions, and expected capital
expenditures. The 2005 performance was above target on these reliability measures. EPS is the
measure for Southern Company’s efforts to increase returns to shareholders through average
long-term earnings per share growth of 5 percent.

See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for additional information on the Company’s financial
performance. The strong financial performance achieved in 2005 reflects the continued emphasis
that management places on these indicators as well as the commitment shown by employees in
achieving or exceeding management’s expectations.

Earnings

Southern Company’s financial performance in 2005 remained strong, despite the challenges of
rising costs and major hurricanes. Net income was $1.59 billion in 2005, an increase of 3.8
percent over the prior year. Net income was $1.53 billion in 2004 and $1.47 billion in 2003,
reflecting increases over the prior year of 4.0 percent and 11.8 percent, respectively. Basic
EPS, including discontinued operations, was $2.14 in 2005, $2.07 in 2004, and $2.03 in 2003.
Diluted EPS, which factors in additional shares related to stock options, was 1 cent lower than
basic EPS each year.

Dividends

Southern Company has paid dividends on its common stock since 1948. Dividends paid per share of
common stock were $1.475 in 2005, $1.415 in 2004, and $1.385 in 2003. In January 2006, Southern
Company declared a quarterly dividend of 37.25 cents per share. This is the 233rd consecutive
quarter that Southern Company has paid a dividend equal to or higher than the previous quarter.
The Company’s goal for the dividend payout ratio is to achieve and maintain a payout of
approximately 70 percent of net income, excluding earnings from synthetic fuel businesses. For
2005, the actual payout ratio was 73 percent excluding synthetic fuel earnings, and 69 percent
overall.

significant factors driving these changes are shown
in the preceding table. The increase in base rates in 2005 is primarily due to approval by the
Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC) of retail base rate increases at Georgia Power and
Savannah Electric. Electric rates for the retail operating companies include provisions to
adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased
energy costs. Under these provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses, including
the fuel component of purchased energy, and do not affect net income. Certain of the retail
operating companies also have clauses to recover other costs, such as environmental, storm
damage, new plants, and/or purchased power agreements (PPAs).

Sales for resale revenues increased $326 million in 2005, decreased $17 million in 2004,
and increased $190 million in 2003. In 2005, sales for resale revenues increased primarily due
to a 26.5 percent increase in the average cost of fuel per net kilowatt-hour (KWH) generated.
In addition, Southern Company entered into new PPAs with 30 electric membership cooperatives
(EMCs) and Flint EMC, both beginning in January 2005, and in June 2005, in connection with the
acquisition of Plant Oleander, assumed two PPAs. In 2004, coal and gas prices increased,
resulting in a lower marginal price differential that reduced demand. Mild summer weather
throughout the Southeast also reduced demand. In 2003, Southern Company entered into several
new PPAs with neighboring utilities. In addition, milder weather in Southern Company’s service
territory, compared with the rest of the Southeast and combined with higher gas prices, resulted
in increases in both customer demand and available generation.

Southern Company’s average wholesale contract now extends more than 11 years, and as a result,
the Company has significantly limited its remarketing risk. Capacity revenues under unit power
sales contracts, principally sales to Florida utilities, reflect the recovery of fixed costs and a
return on investment, and energy is generally sold at variable cost. Unit power energy sales
increased 1.7 percent, 1.9 percent, and 4.0 percent in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.
Fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices, which are the primary fuel sources for unit power sales
customers, influence changes in these sales. However, because the energy is generally sold at
variable cost, these fluctuations have a minimal effect on earnings. The capacity and energy
components of the unit power contract revenues were as follows:

Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in sales for resale. These opportunity
sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above the Company’s variable
cost to produce the energy. Revenues associated with opportunity sales and PPAs were as follows:

In May 2003, Mississippi Power and Southern Power entered into agreements with Dynegy,
Inc. (Dynegy) that terminated all capacity sales contracts with subsidiaries of Dynegy. The
termination payments from Dynegy resulted in an increase in other electric revenues of $135
million in 2003.

Energy Sales

Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the volume of energy sold each year. KWH sales
for 2005 and the percent change by year were as follows:

Energy sales in 2005 increased 4.5 billion KWH as a result of sustained economic growth
and customer growth of 1.2 percent. Hurricane Katrina dampened customer growth from previous years
and was the primary contributor to the decrease in industrial sales in 2005. In addition, in 2005,
some Georgia Power industrial customers were reclassified from industrial to commercial to be

II-13


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies Annual Report

consistent with the rate structure approved by the Georgia PSC
resulting in higher commercial sales and lower industrial sales in 2005 when compared with 2004.
Energy sales in 2004 were strong across all retail customer classes as a result of an improved
economy in the Southeast and customer growth of 1.5 percent. Residential energy sales in 2003
reflected a decrease in customer demand as a result of very mild weather, partially offset by
customer growth of 1.6 percent. In 2003, commercial sales continued to show steady growth while
industrial sales increased somewhat over the depressed results of previous years. Energy sales
to retail customers are projected to increase at a compound average annual rate of 1.9 percent
during the period 2006 through 2011, assuming normal weather conditions.

Energy sales for resale increased by 2.6 billion KWH in 2005, decreased 5.3 billion KWH in
2004, and increased by 8.0 billion KWH in 2003. The increase in sales in 2005 is related
primarily to the new PPAs discussed above. The decrease in 2004 as compared with 2003 is due to
the increased availability of coal-fired generation in 2003 resulting from weather-related lower
retail demand coupled with higher natural gas prices, which increased the wholesale market
demand for opportunity sales.

Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses

Fuel costs constitute the single largest expense for the electric utilities. The mix of fuel
sources for generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel
consumed, and the availability of generating units. The amount and sources of generation, the
average cost of fuel per net kilowatt-hour generated, and the average cost of purchased power
were as follows:




Total
generation (billions of KWH)

1.89

1.67

Average cost of purchased
power per net KWH (cents)

3.86

In 2005, fuel and purchased power expenses were $5.2 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion
or 29.1 percent above the prior year costs. An additional 7.8 billion KWH were generated in
2005 at a 26.5 percent higher average cost per net KWH generated; however, this lowered
requirements to purchase even more expensive electricity from non-affiliates.

Fuel and purchased power expenses were $4.0 billion in 2004, an increase of $570 million or
16.4 percent above 2003 costs. This increase was the result of a 13.2 percent increase in the
average cost per net KWH generated and a 16.1 percent increase in the average cost per KWH
purchased.

Fuel and purchased power expenses were $3.5 billion in 2003, an increase of $237 million or
7.3 percent above the prior year costs. This increase was primarily attributed to higher
average unit fuel cost and increased customer demand.

A significant upward trend in the cost of coal and natural gas has emerged since 2003, and
volatility in these markets is expected to continue. Increased coal prices have been influenced
by a worldwide increase in demand as a result of rapid economic growth in China, as well as by
increases in mining costs. Higher natural gas prices in the United States are the result of
increased demand and slightly lower gas supplies despite increased drilling activity. Natural
gas supply interruptions, such as those caused by the 2004 and 2005 hurricanes result in an
immediate market response; however, the long-term impact of this price volatility may be reduced
by imports of natural gas and liquefied natural gas. Fuel expenses generally do not affect net
income, since they are offset by fuel revenues under the retail operating companies’ fuel cost
recovery provisions. Likewise, Southern Power’s PPAs generally provide that the purchasers are
responsible for substantially all of the cost of fuel.

Other Operation and Maintenance Expenses

Other operation and maintenance expenses were $3.2 billion, $3.0 billion, and $2.9 billion,
increasing $215 million, $148 million, and $105 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.
Other production expenses increased $58 million and $53 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, and
decreased $27 million in 2003. Production expenses fluctuate from year to year due to variations
in outage schedules, flexible spending projects, and normal increases in costs.

II-14


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies Annual Report

Administrative and general expenses increased $73 million in 2005 related to a $33 million
increase in employee benefits, a $22 million increase in shared
services expenses, and a $9 million increase in property insurance. Administrative and general expenses
increased $106 million in 2004 primarily related to $41 million, $23 million, and $13 million
increases in employee benefits, shared services expenses, primarily nuclear security, and
property insurance, respectively. In 2003, administrative and general expenses increased $46
million, due primarily to a $19 million increase in property insurance, a $9 million increase in
employee benefits, and $9 million of business development costs at Southern Power.

Transmission and distribution expenses increased $60 million in 2005, $49 million in 2004,
and $23 million in 2003. Transmission and distribution expenses increased in 2005 primarily as
a result of $48 million of expenses recorded by Alabama Power in accordance with an accounting
order approved by the Alabama PSC primarily to offset the costs of Hurricane Ivan and restore
the natural disaster reserve. In accordance with the accounting order, Alabama Power also
returned certain regulatory liabilities related to deferred income taxes to its retail
customers; therefore, the combined effect of the accounting order had no impact on net income.
See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Storm Damage Cost Recovery” for additional
information. Transmission and distribution expenses also fluctuate from year to year due to
variations in maintenance schedules, flexible spending projects, and normal increases in costs,
and are the primary basis for the 2004 and 2003 increases.

The 2003 increase in other operation and maintenance expenses also reflects the establishment
of a $60 million regulatory liability related to Plant Daniel that was expensed in 2003.

Depreciation and Amortization Expenses

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $229 million in 2005 as a result of additional
plant in service and from the expiration in 2004 of certain provisions in Georgia Power’s retail
rate plan for the three years ended December 31, 2004 (2001 Retail Rate Plan). In accordance
with the 2001 Retail Rate Plan, Georgia Power amortized an accelerated cost recovery liability
as a credit to amortization expense and recognized new Georgia PSC-certified purchased power
costs in rates over the three years ended December 31, 2004. See Note 3 to the financial
statements under “Georgia Power Retail Regulatory Matters” for additional information.

Depreciation and amortization expenses declined by $64 million in 2004, primarily as a
result of amortization of the Plant Daniel regulatory liability and a Georgia Power regulatory
liability related to the levelization of certain purchased power costs that reduced amortization
expense by $17 million and $90 million, respectively, from the prior year. See FUTURE EARNINGS
POTENTIAL — “PSC Matters — Mississippi Power” herein and Note 3 to the financial statements
under “Georgia Power Retail Regulatory Matters” for more information on these regulatory
adjustments. These reductions were partially offset by a higher depreciable plant base.

The $16 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses in 2003 was primarily due
to a $49 million reduction in amortization of the previously discussed Georgia Power purchased
power regulatory liability and was partially offset by a higher depreciable plant base.

Taxes Other Than Income Taxes

Taxes other than income taxes increased by $52 million in 2005 primarily as a result of
increases in franchise and municipal gross receipts taxes associated with increases in revenues
from energy sales. In 2004, taxes other than income taxes increased $40 million as a result of
additional plant in service and a higher property tax base. Taxes other than income taxes
increased $29 million in 2003 as a result of additional generating facilities, as well as higher
property tax valuations on existing facilities.

Electric Other Income and (Expense)

Total interest charges and other financing costs increased by $62 million in 2005 associated
with an additional $863 million in debt outstanding at December 31, 2005 as compared to December
31, 2004 and an increase in average interest rates on variable rate debt. Variable rates on
pollution control bonds are highly correlated with the Bond Market Association Municipal Swap
Index which averaged 2.5 percent in 2005 and 1.2 percent in 2004. Variable rates on commercial
paper and senior notes are highly correlated with the one-month London Interbank Offer Rate
(LIBOR), which averaged 3.4 percent in 2005 and 1.5 percent in 2004. An additional $17 million
increase in 2005 was the result of a lower percentage of interest costs

II-15

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies Annual Report

capitalized as
construction projects reached completion. The $19 million increase in interest charges and
other financing costs in 2004 was also the result of a lower percentage of interest costs
capitalized as construction projects reached completion.

Other Business Activities

Southern Company’s other business activities include the parent company (which does not allocate
operating expenses to business units), investments in synthetic fuels and leveraged lease
projects, telecommunications, energy-related services, and natural gas marketing. These
businesses are classified in general categories and may comprise one or more of the following
subsidiaries: Southern Company Holdings invests in various energy-related projects, including
synthetic fuels and leveraged lease projects that receive tax benefits, which contribute
significantly to the economic results of these investments; SouthernLINC Wireless provides
digital wireless communications services to the retail operating companies and also markets
these services to the public within the Southeast; Southern Telecom provides fiber optics
services in the Southeast; and Southern Company Gas was a retail gas marketer serving customers
in the State of Georgia. On January 4, 2006, Southern Company Gas completed the sale of
substantially all of its assets and is reflected in the condensed income statement below as
discontinued operations. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Southern Company Gas
Sale” for additional information.

Southern Company’s non-electric operating revenues increased $12 million in 2005 primarily
as the result of higher production and increased fees in the synthetic fuel business. The $7
million decrease in 2004 was primarily due to lower operating revenues in the energy-related
services business, partially offset by an increase in SouthernLINC Wireless revenues as a result
of increased wireless subscribers. The $30 million increase in revenues in 2003 was primarily
due to increased sales in the energy-related services business. Revenues from a subsidiary that
primarily provides fuel transportation services related to synthetic fuel products were $123
million in 2005, increasing by $17 million, $21 million, and $37 million in 2005, 2004, and
2003, respectively, as a result of increased production at the synthetic fuel facilities and
annual increases in rates. Most of these service revenues are ultimately included in the cost
of the synthetic fuel purchased by Alabama Power and Georgia Power and, therefore, have no
significant effect on Southern Company’s consolidated revenues. See Note 1 to the financial
statements under “Related Party Transactions” for additional information.

II-16


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies Annual Report

Operation and maintenance expenses for these other businesses increased by $12 million in 2005
as a result of $9 million of higher losses for property damage, $2 million in higher network costs
at SouthernLINC Wireless, and a $11 million increase in shared
services expenses, offset by the 2004
$12.5 million bad debt reserve discussed below. Operation and maintenance expenses increased $28
million in 2004 primarily due to a $3 million increase in advertising, a $5 million increase in
shared services expenses, and a $12.5 million bad debt reserve related to additional federal income
taxes and interest Southern Company paid on behalf of Mirant Corporation (Mirant). See FUTURE
EARNINGS POTENTIAL  — “Mirant Bankruptcy Matters” herein and Note 3 to the financial statements
under “Mirant Matters — Mirant Bankruptcy” for additional information. Operation and maintenance
expenses decreased by $23 million in 2003 primarily due to a $6 million decrease in shared services
expenses and a $3 million decrease in losses for property damage at the parent company; a $4
million decrease in bad debt expense and a $3 million decrease in network costs at SouthernLINC
Wireless; and a $2 million decrease in salaries in the energy-related services business.

Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased $9 million and $7 million in 2004 and 2003,
respectively. These reductions are primarily the result of $10 million of expenses associated with
the repurchase of debt at Southern Holdings recorded in 2003 and a $16 million charge recorded in
2002 related to the impairment of assets under certain customer contracts for energy-related
services.

The increases in equity in losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2005 and 2003 reflect the
results of additional production expenses in the synthetic fuel partnerships. These partnerships
also claim federal income tax credits that offset their operating losses and make the businesses
profitable. These credits totaled $177 million in 2005, $146 million in 2004, and $120 million in
2003. In 2004, a $37 million reserve related to these tax credits was reversed following the
settlement of an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “Income
Tax Matters” herein for additional information.

The decrease in other income in 2004 as compared with 2003 reflects a $15 million gain for
a Southern Telecom contract settlement during 2003. The gain in 2003 was partially offset by an
increase of $7 million in charitable contributions made by the parent company.

Total interest charges and other financing costs increased by $18 million in 2005
associated with an additional $283 million in debt outstanding and a 164 basis point increase in
average interest rates on variable rate debt. Interest expense decreased $21 million in 2004 as
a result of the parent company’s redemption of preferred securities in 2003. This decrease was
partially offset by an increase in outstanding long-term debt in 2004.

Effects of Inflation

The retail operating companies and Southern Power are subject to rate regulation and party to
long-term contracts, respectively, that are generally based on the recovery of historical costs.
In addition, the income tax laws are based on historical costs. Therefore, inflation creates
an economic loss because Southern Company is recovering its costs of investments in dollars that
have less purchasing power. While the inflation rate has been relatively low in recent years,
it continues to have an adverse effect on Southern Company because of the large investment in
utility plant with long economic lives. Conventional accounting for historical cost does not
recognize this economic loss nor the partially offsetting gain that arises through financing
facilities with fixed-money obligations such as long-term debt and preferred securities. Any
recognition of inflation by regulatory authorities is reflected in the rate of return allowed in
the retail operating companies’ approved electric rates.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL

General

The retail operating companies operate as vertically integrated companies providing electricity
to customers within their service areas in the southeastern United States. Prices for
electricity provided to retail customers are set by state PSCs under cost-based regulatory
principles. Retail rates and earnings are reviewed and may be adjusted periodically within
certain limitations. Southern Company’s wholesale business continues to focus on long-term
capacity contracts, optimized by limited energy trading activities. The level of future
earnings depends on numerous factors including the FERC’s market-based rate investigation,
creditworthiness of customers, total generating capacity available in the Southeast, and the
successful remarketing of capacity as current contracts expire. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES —
“Application of Critical Accounting Policies and

II-17


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies Annual Report

Estimates — Electric Utility Regulation”
herein and Note 3 to the financial statements for
additional information about these and other regulatory matters.

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of future
earnings potential. The level of Southern Company’s future earnings depends on numerous factors
that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of Southern Company’s primary business of
selling electricity. These factors include the retail operating companies’ ability to maintain
a stable regulatory environment that continues to allow for the recovery of all prudently
incurred costs. Another major factor is the profitability of the competitive market-based
wholesale generating business and federal regulatory policy, which may impact Southern Company’s
level of participation in this market. Future earnings for the electricity business in the near
term will depend, in part, upon growth in energy sales, which is subject to a number of factors.
These factors include weather, competition, new energy contracts with neighboring utilities,
energy conservation practiced by customers, the price of electricity, the price elasticity of
demand, and the rate of economic growth in the service area.

Southern Company system generating capacity increased 1,880 megawatts in 2005 with the
completion of Plant McIntosh units 10 and 11 by Georgia Power and Savannah Electric and the
acquisition by Southern Power of Plant Oleander. In general, Southern Company has constructed
or acquired new generating capacity only after entering into long-term capacity contracts for
the new facilities or to meet requirements of Southern Company’s regulated retail markets, both
of which are optimized by limited energy trading activities.

To adapt to a less regulated, more competitive environment, Southern Company continues to
evaluate and consider a wide array of potential business strategies. These strategies may
include business combinations, acquisitions involving other utility or non-utility businesses or
properties, internal restructuring, disposition of certain assets, or some combination thereof.
Furthermore, Southern Company may engage in new business ventures that arise from competitive
and regulatory changes in the utility industry. Pursuit of any of the above strategies, or any
combination thereof, may significantly affect the business operations and financial condition of
Southern Company.

Environmental Matters

New Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil action in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against certain Southern Company
subsidiaries, including Alabama Power and Georgia Power, alleging that these subsidiaries had
violated the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act and related state laws at
certain coal-fired generating facilities. Through subsequent amendments and other legal
procedures, the EPA added Savannah Electric as a defendant to the original action and filed a
separate action against Alabama Power in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
Alabama after it was dismissed from the original action. In these lawsuits, the EPA alleges
that NSR violations occurred at eight coal-fired generating facilities operated by Alabama
Power, Georgia Power, and Savannah Electric. The civil actions request penalties and injunctive
relief, including an order requiring the installation of the best available control technology
at the affected units. On June 3, 2005, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
Alabama issued a decision in favor of Alabama Power on two primary legal issues in the case;
however, the decision does not resolve the case, nor does it address other legal issues
associated with the EPA’s allegations. In accordance with a separate court order, Alabama Power
and the EPA are currently participating in mediation with respect to the EPA’s claims. The
action against Georgia Power and Savannah Electric has been administratively closed since the
spring of 2001, and none of the parties has sought to reopen the case. See Note 3 to the
financial statements under “Environmental Matters — New Source Review Actions.”

Southern Company believes that the retail operating companies complied with applicable laws
and the EPA regulations and interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place.
The Clean Air Act authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $32,500 per day, per violation
at each generating unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in any
one of these cases could require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this
time and could possibly require payment of substantial penalties. This could affect future results
of operations, cash flows, and financial

condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

In December 2002 and October 2003, the EPA issued final revisions to its NSR regulations under
the Clean Air Act. A coalition of states and environmental organizations filed petitions for
review of these regulations. On June 24, 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit upheld, in part, the EPA’s December 2002 revisions to its NSR regulations, which
included changes to the regulatory exclusions and methods of calculating emissions increases.
However, the court vacated portions of those revisions, including those addressing the exclusion of
certain pollution control projects. The October 2003 revisions, which clarified the scope of the
existing Routine Maintenance, Repair and Replacement exclusion, have been stayed by the Court of
Appeals pending its review of the rules. On October 20, 2005, the EPA also published a proposed
rule clarifying the test for determining when an emissions increase subject to the NSR requirements
has occurred. The impact of these revisions and proposed rules will depend on adoption of the
final rules by the EPA and the individual state implementation of such rules, as well as the
outcome of any additional legal challenges, and, therefore, cannot be determined at this time.

Carbon Dioxide Litigation

In July 2004, attorneys general from eight states, each outside of Southern Company’s service
territory, and the corporation counsel for New York City filed a complaint in the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York against Southern Company and four other electric power
companies. A nearly identical complaint was filed by three environmental groups in the same court.
The complaints allege that the companies’ emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas,
contribute to global warming, which the plaintiffs assert is a public nuisance. Under common law
public and private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs seek a judicial order (1) holding each
defendant jointly and severally liable for creating, contributing to, and/or maintaining global
warming and (2) requiring each of the defendants to cap its emissions of carbon dioxide and then
reduce those emissions by a specified percentage each year for at least a decade. Plaintiffs have
not, however, requested that damages be awarded in connection with their claims. Southern Company
believes these claims are without merit and notes that the complaint cites no statutory or
regulatory basis for the claims. In September 2005, the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York granted Southern Company’s and the other defendants’ motions to dismiss these
cases. The plaintiffs filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on
October 19, 2005. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Plant Wansley Environmental Litigation

In December 2002, the Sierra Club, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Georgia Forestwatch, and
one individual filed a civil suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia
against Georgia Power for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act at four of the units at Plant
Wansley. The civil action requests injunctive and declaratory relief, civil penalties, a
supplemental environmental project, and attorneys’ fees. The Clean Air Act authorizes civil
penalties of up to $27,500 per day, per violation at each generating unit. The liability phase of
the case has concluded with the court ruling in favor of Georgia Power in part and the plaintiffs
in part. In March 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit accepted Georgia
Power’s petition for review of the district court’s order, and oral arguments were held on January
24, 2006. The district court case has been administratively closed pending that appeal. If
necessary, the district court will hold a separate trial, which will address civil penalties and
possible injunctive relief requested by the plaintiffs.

The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot currently be determined; however, an adverse
outcome could require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and
could possibly require the payment of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of
operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated
rates.

Environmental Statutes and Regulations

General

Southern Company’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by state and federal
environmental agencies under a variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental media,
including air, water, and land resources. Applicable statutes include the Clean Air Act; the
Clean Water Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Emergency Planning &
Community Right-to-Know Act; and the Endangered Species Act. Compliance with these environmental
requirements

II-19


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

involves significant capital and operating costs, a major portion of which is
expected to be recovered through existing ratemaking provisions. Through 2005, Southern Company had invested
approximately $2.4 billion in capital projects to comply with these requirements, with annual
totals of $423 million, $300 million, and $256 million for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.
Over the next decade, the Company expects that capital expenditures to assure compliance with
existing and new regulations could exceed an additional $7.5 billion, including $0.8 billion, $1.3
billion, and $1.1 billion for 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively. Because the Company’s
compliance strategy is impacted by changes to existing environmental laws and regulations, the
cost, availability, and existing inventory of emission allowances, and the Company’s fuel mix, the
ultimate outcome cannot be determined at this time. Environmental costs that are known and
estimable at this time are included in capital expenditures discussed under FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND LIQUIDITY – “Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations” herein.

Compliance with possible additional federal or state legislation or regulations related to
global climate change, air quality, or other environmental and health concerns could also
significantly affect Southern Company. New environmental legislation or regulations, or changes
to existing statutes or regulations, could affect many areas of Southern Company’s operations;
however, the full impact of any such changes cannot be determined at this time.

Air Quality

Compliance with the Clean Air Act and resulting regulations has been and will continue to be a
significant focus for Southern Company. Through 2005, the Company had spent approximately $1.6
billion in reducing sulfur dioxide (SO


) and nitrogen oxide (NO

x

)
emissions and in monitoring emissions pursuant to the Clean Air Act. Additional controls have
been announced and are currently being installed at several plants to further reduce SO


and NO

x

emissions, maintain compliance with existing regulations, and to meet
new requirements.

Approximately $1.3 billion of these expenditures related to reducing NO

x

emissions pursuant to state and federal requirements in connection with the EPA’s one-hour ozone
standard and the 1998 regional NO

x

reduction rules. In 2004, the regional
NO

x

reduction rules were implemented for the northern two-thirds of Alabama.
Although the State of Georgia was originally included in the states subject to the regional
NO

x

rules, the EPA, in August 2005, stayed compliance with these requirements and
initiated rulemakings to address issues raised in a petition for reconsideration filed by a
coalition of Georgia industries. The impact of the 1998 regional NO

x

reduction rules
for the State of Georgia will depend on the outcome of the petition for reconsideration and/or
any subsequent development and approval of its state implementation plan.

In addition, in 2005, Gulf Power substantially completed the terms of a 2002 agreement with
the State of Florida to help ensure attainment of the ozone standard in the Pensacola, Florida
area. The conditions of the agreement, which required installing additional controls on certain
units and retiring three older units at a plant near Pensacola, will be fully implemented in
2006 at a cost of approximately $134.4 million, of which $4.3 million remains to be spent. Gulf
Power’s costs have been approved under its environmental cost recovery clause. See Note 1 to
the financial statements under “Environmental Cost Recovery” for additional information.

In 2005, the EPA revoked the one-hour ozone standard and published the final set of rules for
implementation of the new, more stringent eight-hour ozone standard. Areas within Southern
Company’s service area that have been designated as nonattainment under the eight-hour ozone
standard include Birmingham (Alabama), Macon (Georgia), and a 20-county area within metropolitan
Atlanta. State implementation plans, including new emission control regulations necessary to bring
those areas into attainment, are required for most areas by June 2007. These state implementation
plans could require further reductions in NO

x

emissions from power plants.

In November 2005, the State of Alabama, through the Alabama Department of Environmental
Management, submitted a request to the EPA to redesignate the Birmingham eight-hour ozone
non-attainment area to attainment for the standard. On January 25, 2006, the EPA published a
proposal in the Federal Register to approve the redesignation request. If ultimately approved
by the EPA, the area would be designated to be in attainment. The final outcome of this matter
cannot now be determined.

During 2005, the EPA’s fine particulate matter nonattainment designations became effective
for several areas within Southern Company’s service area in Alabama and Georgia, and the EPA
proposed

II-20


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

a rule for the implementation of the fine particulate matter standard. The EPA plans
to finalize the proposed implementation rule in 2006. State plans for addressing the nonattainment designations
are required by April 2008 and could require further reductions in SO


and
NO

x

emissions from power plants. The EPA has also published proposed revisions to
lower the levels of particulate matter currently allowed.

The EPA issued the final Clean Air Interstate Rule on March 10, 2005. This cap-and-trade rule
addresses power plant SO


and NO

x

emissions that were found to contribute to
nonattainment of the eight-hour ozone and fine particulate matter standards in downwind states.
Twenty-eight eastern states, including each of the states within Southern Company’s service area,
are subject to the requirements of the rule. The rule calls for additional reductions of
NO

x

and/or SO


to be achieved in two phases, 2009/2010 and 2015. These
reductions will be accomplished by the installation of additional emission controls at Southern
Company’s coal-fired facilities or by the purchase of emission allowances from a cap-and-trade
program.

The Clean Air Visibility Rule (formerly called the Regional Haze Rule) was finalized on
July 6, 2005. The goal of this rule is to restore natural visibility conditions in certain
areas (primarily national parks and wilderness areas) by 2064. The rule involves the
application of Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements and a review each decade,
beginning in 2018, of progress toward the goal. BART requires that sources that contribute to
visibility impairment implement additional emission reductions, if necessary, to make progress
toward remedying current visibility concerns. For power plants, the Clean Air Visibility Rule
allows states to determine that the Clean Air Interstate Rule satisfies BART requirements for
SO


and NO

x

. However, additional requirements could be imposed. By
December 17, 2007, states must submit implementation plans that contain emission reduction
strategies for implementing BART requirements and for achieving sufficient and reasonable
progress toward the goal.

On March 15, 2005, the EPA announced the final Clean Air Mercury Rule, a cap-and-trade
program for the reduction of mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. The rule sets caps
on mercury emissions to be implemented in two phases, 2010 and 2018, and provides for an
emission allowance trading market. The Company anticipates that emission controls installed to
achieve compliance with the Clean Air Interstate Rule and the eight-hour ozone and
fine-particulate standards will also result in mercury emission reductions. However, the
long-term capability of emission control equipment to reduce mercury emissions is still being
evaluated, and the installation of additional control technologies may be required.

The impacts of the eight-hour ozone standard, the fine particulate matter nonattainment
designations, the Clean Air Interstate Rule, the Clean Air Visibility Rule, and the Clean Air
Mercury Rule on the Company will depend on the development and implementation of rules at the
state level. States implementing the Clean Air Mercury Rule and the Clean Air Interstate Rule,
in particular, have the option not to participate in the national cap-and-trade programs and
could require reductions greater than those mandated by the federal rules. Such impacts will
also depend on resolution of pending legal challenges to the Clean Air Interstate Rule, the
Clean Air Mercury Rule and a related petition from the State of North Carolina under Section 126
of the Clean Air Act, also related to the interstate transport of air pollutants. Therefore,
the full impacts of these regulations on the Company cannot be determined at this time. The
Company has developed and continually updates a comprehensive environmental compliance strategy
to comply with the continuing and new environmental requirements discussed above. As part of
this strategy, the Company plans to install additional SO


, NO

x

, and
mercury emission controls within the next several years to assure continued compliance with
applicable air quality requirements.

Water Quality

In July 2004, the EPA published final rules under the Clean Water Act for the purpose of
reducing impingement and entrainment of fish and fish larvae at power plants’ cooling water
intake structures. The new rules require baseline biological information and, perhaps,
installation of fish protection technology near some intake structures at existing power plants.

Georgia Power is installing cooling towers at additional facilities under the Clean Water
Act to cool water prior to discharge. Near Atlanta, a cooling tower for one plant was completed
in 2004 and two others are scheduled for completion in 2008.
The total estimated cost of these projects is $173 million, with $85 million remaining to be
spent.

II-21


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

Georgia Power is also conducting a study of the aquatic environment at another facility to
determine if further thermal controls are necessary at that plant.

The full impact of these new rules will depend on the results of studies and analyses
performed as part of the rules’ implementation and the actual requirements established by state
regulatory agencies, and therefore, cannot now be determined.

Environmental Remediation

Southern Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that cover the
handling and disposal of waste and release of hazardous substances. Under these various laws
and regulations, the retail operating companies could incur substantial costs to clean up
properties. The retail operating companies conduct studies to determine the extent of any
required cleanup and have recognized in their respective financial statements the costs to clean
up known sites. Amounts for cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs were not material for any year
presented. The retail operating companies may be liable for some or all required cleanup costs
for additional sites that may require environmental remediation.
See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Environmental
Matters — Environmental Remediation”
for additional information.

Global Climate Issues

Domestic efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions have been spurred by international
discussions surrounding the Framework Convention on Climate Change and specifically the Kyoto
Protocol, which proposes constraints on the emissions of greenhouse gases for a group of
industrialized countries. The Bush Administration has not supported U.S. ratification of the
Kyoto Protocol or other mandatory carbon dioxide reduction legislation; however, in 2002, it did
announce a goal to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of the U.S., the ratio of greenhouse gas
emissions to the value of U.S. economic output, by 18 percent by 2012. A year later, the
Department of Energy (DOE) announced the Climate VISION program to support this goal.
Energy-intensive industries, including electricity generation, are the initial focus of this
program. Southern Company is involved in the development of a voluntary electric utility sector
climate change initiative in partnership with the government. In a memorandum of understanding
signed in December 2004 with the DOE under Climate VISION, the utility sector pledged to reduce
its greenhouse gas emissions rate by 3 percent to 5 percent by 2010- 2012. The Company is
continuing to evaluate future energy and emission profiles relative to the Climate VISION
program and is analyzing voluntary programs to support the industry initiative.

FERC Matters

Market-Based Rate Authority

Each of the retail operating companies and Southern Power has authorization from the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to sell power to non-affiliates at market-based prices. The
retail operating companies and Southern Power also have FERC authority to make short-term
opportunity sales at market rates. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a
market-based contract with an affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation
dominance within its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other
markets is not an issue in that proceeding. In February 2005, Southern Company submitted
responsive information. In February 2006, the FERC suspended the proceeding to allow the
parties to conduct settlement discussions. Any new market-based rate transactions in its retail
service territory entered into after February 27, 2005 are subject to refund to the level of the
default cost-based rates, pending the outcome of the proceeding. The impact of such sales
through December 31, 2005 is not expected to exceed $16 million. The refund period covers 15
months. In the event that the FERC’s default mitigation measures for entities that are found to
have market power are ultimately applied, the retail operating companies and Southern Power may
be required to charge cost-based rates for certain wholesale sales in the Southern Company
retail service territory, which may be lower than negotiated market-based rates. The final
outcome of this matter will depend on the form in which the final methodology for assessing
generation market power and mitigation rules may be ultimately adopted and cannot be determined
at this time.

In addition, in May 2005, the FERC started an investigation to determine whether Southern
Company satisfies the other three parts of the FERC’s market-based rate analysis: transmission
market power, barriers to entry, and affiliate abuse or reciprocal dealing. The FERC established a
new refund period related to this

II-22


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

expanded investigation. Any and all new market-based rate
transactions both inside and outside Southern Company’s retail service territory involving any
Southern Company subsidiary will be subject to refund
to the extent the FERC orders lower rates as a result of this new investigation, with the 15-month
refund period beginning July 19, 2005. The impact of such sales through December 31, 2005 is not
expected to exceed $31 million, of which $11 million relates to sales inside the retail service
territory discussed above. The FERC also directed that this expanded proceeding be held in
abeyance pending the outcome of the proceeding on the Intercompany Interchange Contract (IIC)
discussed below.

Southern Company and its subsidiaries believe that there is no meritorious basis for this
proceeding and are vigorously defending themselves in this matter. However, the final outcome of
this matter, including any remedies to be applied in the event of an adverse ruling in this
proceeding, cannot now be determined.

Intercompany Interchange Contract

The Company’s generation fleet in its retail service territory is operated under the IIC, as
approved by the FERC. In May 2005, the FERC initiated a new proceeding to examine (1) the
provisions of the IIC among Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, Savannah
Electric, Southern Power, and SCS, as agent, under the terms of which the power pool of Southern
Company is operated, and, in particular, the propriety of the continued inclusion of Southern Power
as a party to the IIC, (2) whether any parties to the IIC have violated the FERC’s standards of
conduct applicable to utility companies that are transmission providers, and (3) whether Southern
Company’s code of conduct defining Southern Power as a “system company” rather than a “marketing
affiliate” is just and reasonable. In connection with the formation of Southern Power, the FERC
authorized Southern Power’s inclusion in the IIC in 2000. The FERC also previously approved
Southern Company’s code of conduct. The FERC order directs that the administrative law judge who
presided over a proceeding involving approval of PPAs between Southern Power and Georgia Power and
Savannah Electric be assigned to preside over the hearing in this proceeding and that the testimony
and exhibits presented in that proceeding be preserved to the extent appropriate. Hearings are
scheduled for September 2006. Effective July 19, 2005, revenues from transactions under the IIC
involving any Southern Company subsidiaries are subject to refund to the extent the FERC orders any
changes to the IIC.

Southern Company and its subsidiaries believe that there is no meritorious basis for this
proceeding and are vigorously defending themselves in this matter. However, the final outcome of
this matter, including any remedies to be applied in the event of an adverse ruling in this
proceeding, cannot now be determined.

Generation Interconnection Agreements

In July 2003, the FERC issued its final rule on the standardization of generation
interconnection agreements and procedures (Order 2003). Order 2003 shifts much of the financial
burden of new transmission investment from the generator to the transmission provider. The FERC
has indicated that Order 2003, which was effective January 20, 2004, is to be applied
prospectively to interconnection agreements. Subsidiaries of Tenaska, Inc., as counterparties
to three previously executed interconnection agreements with subsidiaries of Southern Company,
have filed complaints at the FERC requesting that the FERC modify the agreements and that
Southern Company refund a total of $19 million previously paid for interconnection facilities,
with interest. These proceedings are still pending at the FERC. Southern Company has also
received similar requests from other entities totaling approximately $14 million. Southern
Company has opposed all such requests. The impact of Order 2003 and its subsequent rehearings
on Southern Company and the final results of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Transmission

In December 1999, the FERC issued its final rule on Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs).
Since that time, there have been a number of additional proceedings at the FERC designed to
encourage further voluntary formation of RTOs or to mandate their formation. However, at the
current time, there are no active proceedings that would require Southern Company to participate
in an RTO. Current FERC efforts that may potentially change the regulatory and/or operational
structure of transmission include rules related to the standardization of generation
interconnection, as well as an inquiry into, among other things, market power by vertically
integrated utilities. See “Market-Based Rate Authority” and “Generation Interconnection
Agreements” above for additional

II-23


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

information. The final outcome of these proceedings cannot now
be determined. However, Southern Company’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash
flows could be adversely affected
by future changes in the federal regulatory or operational structure of transmission.

PSC Matters

Alabama Power

In October 2004, the Alabama PSC approved a specific rate mechanism for the recovery of Alabama
Power’s retail costs associated with environmental laws, regulations, or other such mandates.
The rate mechanism began operation in January 2005 and provides for the recovery of these costs
pursuant to a factor that will be calculated annually. Environmental costs to be recovered
include operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation, and a return on invested capital.
Retail rates increased approximately 1 percent in both January 2005 and 2006. In conjunction
with the Alabama PSC’s approval of this rate mechanism, Alabama Power agreed to a moratorium
until 2007 on any retail rate increase under its previously approved Rate Stabilization and
Equalization Plan (Rate RSE).

On October 4, 2005, the Alabama PSC approved a revision to Rate RSE requested by Alabama
Power. Effective January 2007, Rate RSE adjustments will be based on forward-looking
information for the applicable upcoming calendar year. Rate adjustments for any two-year
period, when averaged together, cannot exceed 4 percent per year and any annual adjustment is
limited to 5 percent. Rates will remain unchanged if the return on equity (ROE) is between 13
percent and 14.5 percent. If Alabama Power’s actual retail ROE is above the allowed equity
return range, customer refunds will be required; however, there is no provision for additional
customer billings should the actual retail return on common equity fall below the allowed equity
return range. Alabama Power will make its initial submission of projected data for calendar
year 2007 by December 1, 2006.

See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Alabama Power Retail Regulatory Matters” for
further information.

Georgia Power

In December 2004, the Georgia PSC approved the December 2004 three-year retail rate plan ending
December 31, 2007 (2004 Retail Rate Plan) for Georgia Power. Under the terms of the 2004 Retail
Rate Plan, earnings will be evaluated against a retail ROE range of 10.25 percent to 12.25
percent. Two-thirds of any earnings above 12.25 percent will be applied to rate refunds, with
the remaining one-third retained by Georgia Power. Retail rates and customer fees were
increased by approximately $203 million in January 2005 to cover the higher costs of purchased
power, operation and maintenance expenses, environmental compliance, and continued investment in
new generation, transmission, and distribution facilities to support growth and ensure
reliability.

Georgia Power is required to file a general rate case on or about July 1, 2007, in response
to which the Georgia PSC would be expected to determine whether the 2004 Retail Rate Plan should
be continued, modified, or discontinued. Until then, Georgia Power may not file for a general
base rate increase unless its projected retail return on common equity falls below 10.25
percent. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Georgia Power Retail Regulatory Matters”
for additional information.

On December 13, 2005, Georgia Power and Savannah Electric entered into a merger agreement.
Savannah Electric will merge into Georgia Power, with Georgia Power continuing as the surviving
corporation. Pending regulatory approvals, the merger is expected to occur by July 2006. See
“Fuel Cost Recovery” herein and Note 3 to the financial statements under “Merger of Georgia
Power and Savannah Electric” for additional information.

Mississippi Power

On December 1, 2005, Mississippi Power submitted its annual Performance Evaluation Plan (PEP)
filing to the Mississippi PSC. Ordinarily, PEP limits annual rate increases to 4 percent;
however, Mississippi Power has requested that the Mississippi PSC approve a temporary change to
allow it to exceed this cap as a result of the ongoing effects of Hurricane Katrina.
Mississippi Power has requested a 5 percent, or $32 million, retail base rate increase to become
effective in April 2006 if approved. Hearings are scheduled for March 2, 2006.

II-24


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

In May 2004, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power’s request to reclassify to
jurisdictional cost of service the 266 megawatts of Plant Daniel unit 3 and 4 capacity,
effective January 1, 2004. The Mississippi PSC authorized Mississippi Power to include the
related costs and revenue credits in jurisdictional rate base, cost of service, and revenue
requirement calculations for purposes of retail rate recovery. Mississippi Power is amortizing
the regulatory liability established pursuant to the Mississippi PSC’s interim December 2003
order, as approved in May 2004, to earnings as follows: $16.5 million in 2004, $25.1 million in
2005, $13.0 million in 2006, and $5.7 million in 2007, resulting in expense reductions in each
of those years.

Fuel Cost Recovery

The retail operating companies each have established fuel cost recovery rates approved by their
respective state PSCs. Over the past year, the retail operating companies have continued to
experience higher than expected fuel costs for coal and natural gas. These higher fuel costs have
increased the under recovered fuel costs included in the balance sheets. The retail operating
companies continuously monitor the under recovered fuel cost balance in light of these higher fuel
costs. Each of the retail operating companies received approval in 2005 to increase their fuel
cost recovery factors to recover existing under recovered amounts as well as projected future
costs.

Alabama Power fuel costs are recovered under Rate ECR (Energy Cost Recovery), which provides
for the addition of a fuel and energy cost factor to base rates. In December 2005, the Alabama PSC
approved an increase that allows for the recovery of approximately $227 million in existing under
recovered fuel costs over a two-year period.

In May 2005, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power’s request to increase customer fuel
rates by approximately 9.5 percent to recover under recovered fuel costs of approximately $508
million existing as of May 31, 2005 over a four-year period that began June 1, 2005. Under
recovered fuel amounts for the period subsequent to June 1, 2005 totaled $327.5 million through
December 31, 2005. The Georgia PSC’s order instructs that such amounts be reviewed semi-annually
beginning February 2006. If the amount under or over recovered exceeds $50 million at the
evaluation date, Georgia Power would be required to file for a temporary fuel rate change. In
addition, Savannah Electric’s under recovered fuel costs totaled $77.7 million at December 31,
2005. In accordance with a Georgia PSC order, Savannah Electric was scheduled to file an
additional request for a fuel cost recovery increase in January 2006. In connection with the
proposed merger, Georgia Power has agreed with a Georgia PSC staff recommendation to forego the
temporary fuel rate process, and Savannah Electric has postponed its scheduled filing. Instead,
Georgia Power and Savannah Electric will file a combined request in March 2006 to increase its
fuel cost recovery rate

.

The case will seek approval of a fuel cost recovery rate based upon future fuel cost
projections for the combined Georgia Power and Savannah Electric generating fleet as well as the
under recovered balances existing at June 30, 2006. The new fuel cost recovery rate would be
billed beginning in July 2006 to all Georgia Power customers, including the existing Savannah
Electric customers. Under recovered amounts as of the date of the merger will be paid by the
appropriate customer groups.

In August 2005, the Georgia PSC initiated an investigation of Savannah Electric’s fuel
practices. In February 2006, an investigation of Georgia Power’s fuel practices was initiated.
Georgia Power and Savannah Electric are responding to data requests and cooperating in the
investigations. The final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.

Fuel cost recovery revenues as recorded on the financial statements are adjusted for
differences in actual recoverable costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates.
Accordingly, any increase in the billing factor would have no significant effect on the
Company’s revenues or net income, but would increase annual cash flow. Based on their
respective state PSC orders, a portion of the under recovered regulatory clause revenues for
Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Savannah Electric was reclassified from current assets to
deferred charges and other assets in the balance sheet. See Note 1 to the financial statements
under “Revenues” and Note 3 to the financial statements under “Alabama Power Retail Regulatory
Matters” and “Georgia Power Retail Regulatory Matters” for additional information.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

Storm Damage Cost Recovery

Each retail operating company maintains a reserve for property damage to cover the cost of
damages from major storms to its transmission and distribution facilities and the cost of
uninsured damages to its generation facilities and other property. In September 2004, Hurricane
Ivan hit the Gulf Coast of Florida and Alabama and continued north through Southern Company’s
service territory causing substantial damage.

At Gulf Power, the related costs charged to its property damage reserve as of December 31,
2004 were $93.5 million. Prior to Hurricane Ivan, Gulf Power’s reserve balance was approximately
$28 million. Gulf Power’s current annual accrual to the property damage reserve, as approved by
the Florida PSC, is $3.5 million. The Florida PSC has also approved additional accrual amounts
at Gulf Power’s discretion; Gulf Power accrued an additional $6 million and $15 million in 2005
and 2004, respectively. In February 2005, Gulf Power, the Office of Public Counsel for the
State of Florida, and the Florida Industrial Power Users Group filed a Stipulation and
Settlement with the Florida PSC, which the Florida PSC subsequently approved, allowing Gulf
Power to recover the retail portion of $51.7 million of these costs, plus interest and revenue
taxes, from customers over a 24-month period that began in April 2005. In connection with the
stipulation, Gulf Power has agreed that it will not seek any additional increase in its base
rates and charges to become effective on or before March 1, 2007.

At Alabama Power, operation and maintenance expenses associated with repairing the damage to
its facilities and restoring service to customers as a result of Hurricane Ivan were $57.8 million
for 2004. The balance in Alabama Power’s natural disaster reserve prior to the storm was $14.6
million. In October 2004, Alabama Power received approval from the Alabama PSC to defer the
negative balance for recovery in future periods. Alabama Power is allowed to accrue $250,000 per
month until a maximum accumulated provision of $32 million is attained. Higher accruals to restore
the reserve to its authorized level are allowed whenever the balance in the reserve declines below
$22.4 million. During 2004, Alabama Power accrued an additional $6.9 million.

In February and December 2005, Alabama Power requested and received Alabama PSC approval of
accounting orders that allowed Alabama Power to immediately return certain regulatory liabilities
to the retail customers. These orders also allowed Alabama Power to simultaneously recover from
customers accruals of approximately $48 million primarily to offset the costs of Hurricane Ivan and
restore a positive balance in the natural disaster reserve. The combined effect of these orders
had no impact on net income in 2005.

In July and August 2005, Hurricanes Dennis and Katrina, respectively, hit the Gulf Coast of
the United States and caused significant damage within Southern Company’s service area, including
portions of the service areas of Alabama Power, Gulf Power, and Mississippi Power. The total
incremental cost of repairing the damages to Mississippi Power’s facilities and restoring service
to customers is currently estimated to be approximately $277 million net of approximately $68
million of insurance proceeds. Prior to Hurricane Katrina, Mississippi Power had a balance of
approximately $3 million in its property reserve. Incremental costs incurred through December 31,
2005 were $210 million net of insurance proceeds of $68 million, of which $8 million has been
received. These costs include approximately $149 million of
capital additions and $133 million of
operation and maintenance expenditures. Restoration efforts following Hurricane Katrina are
ongoing for approximately 19,200 Mississippi Power customers who remain unable to receive power, as
well as to make permanent improvements in areas where temporary emergency repairs were necessary.
In addition, business and governmental authorities are still reviewing redevelopment plans for
portions of the most severely damaged areas along the Mississippi shoreline. Until such plans are
complete, Mississippi Power cannot determine the related electric power needs or associated cost
estimates. The ultimate impact of redevelopment plans in these areas on the cost estimates cannot
now be determined.

Each of the affected retail operating companies has been authorized by their respective state
PSCs to defer the portion of the Hurricane Dennis and Katrina restoration costs that exceeded the
balance in their storm damage reserve accounts. As of December 31, 2005, the deficit balance in
Southern Company’s storm damage reserve accounts totaled approximately $366 million, of which
approximately $70 million and $296 million, respectively, is included in the balance sheets herein
under Other Current Assets and Other Regulatory
Assets. The recovery of these deferred

II-26


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

costs is subject to the approval of the respective state PSCs.

In December 2005, the Alabama PSC approved a separate rate rider to recover Alabama Power’s
$51 million of deferred Hurricane Dennis and Katrina operation and maintenance costs over a
two-year period and to replenish its reserve to a target balance of $75 million over a five-year
period.

In October 2005, the Mississippi PSC issued an Interim Accounting Order requiring Mississippi
Power to recognize a regulatory asset in an amount equal to the retail portion of the recorded
Hurricane Katrina restoration costs, including both operation and maintenance expenditures and
capital additions. In December 2005, Mississippi Power filed with the Mississippi PSC a detailed
review of all Hurricane Katrina restoration costs as required in the Interim Accounting Order.
Mississippi Power is currently working with the Mississippi PSC to establish a method to recover
all such prudently incurred costs upon resolution of uncertainties related to federal grant
assistance and proposed state legislation to allow securitized financing.

In 2005, the Florida Legislature authorized securitized financing for hurricane costs. On
February 22, 2006, Gulf Power filed a petition with the Florida PSC under this legislative
authority requesting permission to issue $87.2 million in securitized storm-recovery bonds. The
bonds would be repaid over 8 years from revenues to be received from storm-recovery charges
implemented under the securitization plan and billed to customers. If approved as proposed, the
plan would resolve Gulf Power’s remaining deferred costs, by refinancing, net of taxes, the
remaining balance of storm damage costs currently being recovered from customers related to
Hurricane Ivan and financing, net of taxes, restoration costs associated with Hurricanes Dennis and
Katrina of approximately $54 million. It would also replenish Gulf Power’s property damage reserve
with an additional $70 million. A decision on the plan is expected prior to the end of the second
quarter of 2006. Since Gulf Power will recognize expenses equal to the revenues billed to
customers, the securitization plan would have no impact on net income, but would increase cash
flow.

See Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements under “Storm Damage Reserves” and “Storm Damage
Cost Recovery,” respectively, for additional information on these reserves. The final outcome of
these matters cannot now be determined.

Mirant Bankruptcy Matters

Mirant is an energy company with businesses that include independent power projects and energy
trading and risk management companies in the U.S. and selected other countries. It was a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Company until its initial public offering in October 2000.
In April 2001, Southern Company completed a spin-off to its shareholders of its remaining
ownership and Mirant became an independent corporate entity.

In July 2003, Mirant filed for voluntary reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy
Code. In January 2006, Mirant’s plan of reorganization became effective, and Mirant emerged
from bankruptcy. As part of the plan, Mirant transferred substantially all of its assets and
its restructured debt to a new corporation that adopted the name Mirant Corporation (Reorganized
Mirant). Southern Company has certain contingent liabilities associated with guarantees of
contractual commitments made by Mirant’s subsidiaries discussed in Note 7 to the financial
statements under “Guarantees.”

In December 2004, as a result of concluding an IRS audit for the tax years 2000 and 2001,
Southern Company paid $39 million in additional tax and interest for issues related to Mirant
tax items. Under the terms of the separation agreements entered into in connection with the
spin-off, Mirant agreed to indemnify Southern Company for costs associated with these tax items
and additional IRS assessments. However, as a result of Mirant’s bankruptcy, Southern Company
sought reimbursement as an unsecured creditor in the Chapter 11 proceeding. Based on
management’s assessment of the collectibility of this receivable, Southern Company has reserved
approximately $12.5 million. If Southern Company is ultimately required to make any additional
payments, Mirant’s indemnification obligation to Southern Company for these additional payments
would constitute unsecured claims against Mirant, entitled to stock in Reorganized Mirant, the
value of which is uncertain. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Mirant Matters –
Mirant Bankruptcy.”

In June 2005, Mirant, as a debtor in possession, and The Official Committee of Unsecured
Creditors of Mirant Corporation filed a complaint against

II-27


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

Southern Company in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, which was
amended in July 2005 and February 2006. The complaint alleges that Southern Company caused
Mirant to engage in certain fraudulent transfers and to pay illegal dividends to Southern
Company prior to the spin-off. The complaint also seeks to recharacterize certain advances from
Southern Company to Mirant for investments in energy facilities from debt to equity. The
complaint further alleges that Southern Company is liable to Mirant’s creditors for the full
amount of Mirant’s liability and that Southern Company caused Mirant to breach its fiduciary
duties to creditors. The complaint seeks monetary damages in excess of $2 billion plus
interest, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. Finally, Mirant objects to Southern
Company’s claims against Mirant in the Bankruptcy Court (which relate to reimbursement under the
separation agreements of payments such as income taxes, interest, legal fees, and other
guarantees described in Note 7 to the financial statements) and seeks equitable subordination of
Southern Company’s claims to the claims of all other creditors. Southern Company served an
answer to the second amended complaint in February 2006. Also in February 2006, the Company’s
motion to transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia was
granted. Southern Company believes there is no meritorious basis for the claims in the
complaint and is vigorously defending itself in this action. See Note 3 to the financial
statements under “Mirant Matters – Mirant Bankruptcy Litigation” for additional information.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Income Tax Matters

Leveraged Lease Transactions

Southern Company undergoes audits by the IRS for each of its tax years. The IRS has completed
its audits of Southern Company’s consolidated federal income tax returns for all years through
2001. Southern Company participates in four international leveraged lease transactions and
receives federal income tax deductions for depreciation and amortization, as well as interest on
related debt. The IRS proposed to disallow the tax losses for one of these leases (a
lease-in-lease-out, or LILO) in connection with its audit of 1996 through 2001. In October
2004, Southern Company submitted the issue to the IRS appeals division and in February 2005
reached a negotiated settlement with the IRS, which is subject to final approval.

In connection with its audit of 2000 and 2001, the IRS also challenged Southern Company’s
deductions related to three other international lease (sale-in-lease-out, or SILO) transactions.
If the IRS is ultimately successful in disallowing the tax deductions related to these three
transactions, beginning with the 2000 tax year, Southern Company would be subject to additional
interest charges of up to $34 million. The IRS has also proposed a penalty of approximately $16
million. Southern Company believes these transactions are valid leases for U.S. tax purposes,
the related deductions are allowable, and the assessment of a penalty is inappropriate.
Southern Company is continuing to pursue resolution of these matters with the IRS and expects to
litigate the issue if necessary. Although the payment of the tax liability, exclusive of
interest, would not affect Southern Company’s results of operations under current accounting
standards, it could have a material impact on cash flow. Through December 31, 2005, Southern
Company has claimed $241 million in tax benefits related to these SILO transactions challenged
by the IRS. See Note 1 to the financial statements under “Leveraged Leases” for additional
information.

Under current accounting rules, the settlement of the LILO transaction will not have a
material impact on Southern Company’s financial statements; however, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) has proposed changes to the accounting for leveraged leases that are
expected to become effective in 2006. If approved as proposed, these changes could require
Southern Company to reflect the tax deductions that the IRS is challenging as currently payable
in the balance sheet and to change the timing of income recognized for the leases, including a
cumulative effect upon adoption of the change. For the LILO transaction settled with the IRS in
February 2005, Southern Company estimates such cumulative effect would reduce Southern Company’s
net income by up to $16 million. The impact of these proposed changes related to the SILO
transactions would be dependent on the resolution of these matters with the IRS but could be
significant, and potentially material, to Southern Company’s net income. The ultimate outcome
of these matters cannot now be determined.

Synthetic Fuel Tax Credits

Southern Company has investments in two entities that produce synthetic fuel and receive tax
credits under Section 45K (formerly Section 29) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended

II-28


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

(Internal Revenue Code). In accordance with Section 45K of the Internal Revenue Code, these tax
credits are subject to limitation as the annual average price of oil (as determined by the DOE) increases
over a specified, inflation-adjusted dollar amount published in the spring of the subsequent
year. Southern Company, along with its partners in these investments, will continue to monitor
oil prices. Any indicated potential limitation on these credits could affect either the timing
or the amount of the credit recognition and could also result in an impairment of these
investments, which total approximately $19.5 million at December 31, 2005, by Southern Company.

Construction Projects

Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle

In December 2005, Southern Power and the Orlando Utilities Commission (OUC) executed definitive
agreements for development of an integrated coal gasification combined cycle (IGCC) 283-megawatt
project in Orlando, Florida. The definitive agreements provide that Southern Power will own at
least 65 percent of the gasifier portion of the IGCC project. OUC will own the remainder of the
gasifier portion and 100 percent of the combined cycle portion of the IGCC project. OUC will
purchase all of the gasifier capacity from Southern Power once the plant is in commercial
operation. Southern Power will construct the project and manage its operation after
construction is completed. In February 2006, Southern Power signed a cooperative agreement with
the DOE that provides up to $235 million in grant funding for the gasification portion of this
project. The IGCC project is subject to National Environmental Policy Act review as well as
state environmental review, requires certain regulatory approvals, and is expected to begin
commercial operation in 2010. Southern Power’s total cost related to the IGCC project is
estimated at approximately $121 million.

Plant Franklin Unit 3

In August 2004, Southern Power completed limited construction activities on Plant Franklin Unit
3 to preserve the long-term viability of the project. Final completion is not anticipated until
the 2008-2011 period. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Plant Franklin Construction
Project” for additional information. The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Nuclear

As part of a potential expansion of Plant Vogtle, Georgia Power and Southern Nuclear have
notified the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) of their intent to apply for an early site
permit (ESP) this year and a combined construction and operating license (COL) in 2008. In
addition, a reactor design from Westinghouse Electric Company has been selected and a purchase
agreement is being negotiated. Participation agreements have been reached with each of the
existing Plant Vogtle co-owners. See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional
information on these co-owners. At this point, no final decision has been made regarding actual
construction. The NRC’s streamlined licensing process for new nuclear units allows utilities to
seek regulatory approval at various stages. These stages include design certification, which is
obtained by the reactor vendor, and the ESP and COL, which are each obtained by the
owner-operators of the units. An ESP indicates site approval is obtained before a company
decides to build and the COL provides regulatory approval for building and operating the plant.
In addition, any new Georgia Power generation must be certified by the Georgia PSC.

Southern Company also is participating in NuStart Energy Development, LLC (NuStart Energy),
a broad-based nuclear industry consortium formed to share the cost of developing a COL and the
related NRC review. NuStart Energy plans to complete detailed engineering design work and to
prepare COL applications for two advanced reactor designs, then to choose one of the
applications and file it for NRC review and approval. The COL ultimately is expected to be
transferred to one or more of the consortium companies; however, at this time, none of them have
committed to build a new nuclear plant.

Southern
Company is also exploring other possibilities relating to nuclear
power projects, both on its own or in partnership with other
utilities.

Other Matters

In accordance with FASB Statement No. 87, Employers’ Accounting for Pensions, Southern Company
recorded non-cash pre-tax pension income/(expense) of approximately $(2) million, $44 million,
and $99 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Postretirement benefit costs for
Southern Company were $118 million, $106 million, and $101 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003,
respectively. Both pension and postretirement costs are expected to continue to trend upward.
Such amounts are dependent on several factors including

II-29


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

trust earnings and changes to the plans. A portion of pension and postretirement benefit costs is capitalized
based on construction-related labor charges. For the retail operating companies, pension and
postretirement benefit costs are a component of the regulated rates and generally do not have a
long-term effect on net income. For more information regarding pension and postretirement
benefits, see Note 2 to the financial statements.

Southern Company is involved in various other matters being litigated, regulatory matters,
and certain tax-related issues that could affect future earnings. See Note 3 to the financial
statements for information regarding material issues.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Southern Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. Significant accounting policies are
described in Note 1 to the financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain
estimates are made that may have a material impact on Southern Company’s results of operations
and related disclosures. Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that
are significantly different from those recorded in the financial statements. Senior management
has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates
described below with the Audit Committee of Southern Company’s Board of Directors.

Electric Utility Regulation

Southern Company’s retail operating companies, which comprise approximately 88 percent of
Southern Company’s total earnings for 2005, are subject to retail regulation by their respective
state PSCs and wholesale regulation by the FERC. These regulatory agencies set the rates the
retail operating companies are permitted to charge customers based on allowable costs. As a
result, the retail operating companies apply FASB Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects
of Certain Types of Regulation (Statement No. 71), which requires the financial statements to
reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the ratemaking process, the regulators may
require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when they would be
recognized by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of expenses
and the recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery through
rates or the deferral of gains or creation of liabilities and the recording of related
regulatory liabilities. The application of Statement No. 71 has a further effect on the
Company’s financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the
ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from those actually incurred by the retail
operating companies; therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in specific costs such as
depreciation, nuclear decommissioning, and pension and postretirement benefits have less of a
direct impact on the Company’s results of operations than they would on a non-regulated company.

As reflected in Note 1 to the financial statements, significant regulatory assets and
liabilities have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of these
regulatory assets and liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines and accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. However, adverse legislative, judicial, or
regulatory actions could materially impact the amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities
and could adversely impact the Company’s financial statements.

Contingent Obligations

Southern Company and its subsidiaries are subject to a number of federal and state laws and
regulations, as well as other factors and conditions that potentially subject them to
environmental, litigation, income tax, and other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein
and Note 3 to the financial statements for more information regarding certain of these
contingencies. Southern Company periodically evaluates its exposure to such risks and records
reserves for those matters where a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The adequacy of reserves can be
significantly affected by external events or conditions that can be unpredictable; thus, the
ultimate outcome of such matters could materially affect Southern Company’s financial
statements. These events or conditions include the following:

•

Changes in existing state or federal regulation by governmental
authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality,
control of toxic substances, hazardous and solid wastes, and other
environmental matters.

II-30


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

•

Changes in existing income tax regulations or changes in IRS
interpretations of existing regulations.

•

Identification of additional sites that require environmental
remediation or the filing of other complaints in which Southern
Company or its subsidiaries may be asserted to be a potentially
responsible party.

•

Identification and evaluation of other potential lawsuits or
complaints in which Southern Company or its subsidiaries may be named
as a defendant.

•

Resolution or progression of existing matters through the legislative
process, the court systems, the IRS, or the EPA.

Unbilled Revenues

Revenues related to the sale of electricity are recorded when electricity is delivered to
customers. However, the determination of KWH sales to individual customers is based on the
reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the
end of each month, amounts of electricity delivered to customers, but not yet metered and
billed, are estimated. Components of the unbilled revenue estimates include total KWH
territorial supply, total KWH billed, estimated total electricity lost in delivery, and customer
usage. These components can fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including weather,
generation patterns, and power delivery volume and other operational constraints. These factors
can be unpredictable and can vary from historical trends. As a result, the overall estimate of
unbilled revenues could be significantly affected, which could have a material impact on the
Company’s results of operations.

New Accounting Standards

Income Taxes

In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 109-1, Application of FASB Statement No.
109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities
provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (FSP 109-1), which requires that the
generation deduction be accounted for as a special tax deduction rather than as a tax rate
reduction. Southern Company adopted FSP 109-1 in the first quarter of 2005 with no material
impact on its financial statements.

Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations

Effective December 31, 2005, Southern Company adopted the provision of FASB Interpretation No.
47 (FIN 47), Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires that an asset retirement
obligation be recorded even though the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on
future events. Prior to December 2005, Southern Company did not recognize asset retirement
obligations for asbestos removal and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain
transformers because the timing of their retirements was dependent on future events. For
additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements under “Asset Retirement
Obligations and Other Costs of Removal.” At December 31, 2005, Southern Company recorded
additional asset retirement obligations (and assets) of approximately $153 million. The
adoption of FIN 47 did not have any effect on Southern Company’s income statement.

Stock Options

On January 1, 2006, Southern Company adopted FASB Statement No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, on a
modified prospective basis. This statement requires that compensation cost relating to
share-based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements. That cost will be
measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued.
Although the compensation expense required under the revised statement differs slightly, the
impacts on the Company’s financial statements are similar to the pro forma disclosures included
in Note 1 to the financial statements under “Stock Options.”

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

Southern Company’s financial condition continued to be stable at December 31, 2005. Net cash
flow from operating activities totaled $2.5 billion, $2.7 billion, and $3.1 billion for 2005,
2004, and 2003, respectively. The $165 million decrease for 2005 resulted primarily from higher
fuel costs at the retail operating companies, partially offset by increases in base rates and
fuel recovery rates. The $376 million decrease from 2003 to 2004 also resulted primarily from
higher fuel costs at the retail operating companies. Fuel costs are recoverable in future
periods and are reflected in the balance sheets as under recovered regulatory clause revenues.
See

II-31


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “PSC Matters — Fuel Cost Recovery” herein for additional
information.

Significant balance sheet changes include a $0.4 billion increase in long-term debt and
preferred stock for 2005 due to an increase of $1.1 billion in property, plant, and equipment. The
majority of funds needed for property additions were provided from operating activities.

At the close of 2005, the closing price of Southern Company’s common stock was $34.53 per
share, compared with book value of $14.42 per share. The market-to-book value ratio was 240
percent at the end of 2005, compared with 242 percent at year-end 2004.

Each of the retail operating companies, Southern Power, and SCS have received investment grade
ratings from the major rating agencies.

Sources of Capital

Southern Company intends to meet its future capital needs through internal cash flow and
external security issuances. Equity capital can be provided from any combination of the
Company’s stock plans, private placements, or public offerings. The amount and timing of
additional equity capital to be raised in 2006, as well as in subsequent years, will be
contingent on Southern Company’s investment opportunities. The Company does not currently
anticipate any equity offerings in 2006 outside of its existing stock option plan.

The retail operating companies plan to obtain the funds required for construction and other
purposes from sources similar to those used in the past, which were primarily from operating
cash flows, security issuances, and term loan and short-term borrowings. Gulf Power and
Mississippi Power are considering other financing options for storm recovery costs. However,
the type and timing of any financings, if needed, will depend upon prevailing market conditions,
regulatory approval, and other factors. The issuance of securities by the retail operating
companies is generally subject to the approval of the applicable state PSC. In addition, the
issuance of all securities by Mississippi Power and Southern Power and short-term securities by
Georgia Power and Savannah Electric is generally subject to regulatory approval by the FERC
following the repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended (PUHCA), on
February 8, 2006. Additionally, with respect to the public offering of securities, Southern
Company and certain of its subsidiaries file registration statements with the Securities and
Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (1933 Act). The amounts of
securities authorized by the appropriate regulatory authorities, as well as the amounts
registered under the 1933 Act, are continuously monitored and appropriate filings are made to
ensure flexibility in the capital markets.

Southern Power plans to use operating cash flows, external funds, and equity capital from
Southern Company to finance its capital expenditures. External funds are expected to be
obtained from the issuance of unsecured senior debt and commercial paper or through credit
arrangements from banks.

Southern Company and each retail operating company obtains financing separately without
credit support from any affiliate. See Note 6 to the financial statements under “Bank Credit
Arrangements” for additional information. The Southern Company system does not maintain a
centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of each company are not commingled with funds
of any other company.

Southern Company’s current liabilities frequently exceed current assets because of the
continued use of short-term debt as a funding source to meet cash needs as well as scheduled
maturities of long-term debt. To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, Southern Company
has various sources of liquidity. In addition, Southern Company has substantial cash flow from
operating activities and access to the capital markets, including commercial paper programs, to
meet liquidity needs.

At December 31, 2005, Southern Company and its subsidiaries had approximately $202 million
of cash and cash equivalents and $3.3 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks, of which
$810 million expire in 2006 and $2.5 billion expire in 2007 and beyond. Approximately $228
million of the credit facilities expiring in 2006 allow for the execution of term loans for an
additional two-year period, and $311 million allow for the execution of one-year term loans.
Most of these arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels and typically contain cross
default provisions that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company.
Southern Company and its subsidiaries are currently in compliance with all such covenants. See
Note 6

II-32


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

to the financial statements under “Bank Credit Arrangements” for additional information.

Financing Activities

During 2005, Southern Company and its subsidiaries issued $1.6 billion of long-term debt and $55
million of preference stock. The security issuances were used to redeem $1.3 billion of
long-term debt, to fund Southern Company’s ongoing construction program, and for general
corporate purposes. In addition, Southern Company issued 10.1 million new shares of common
stock through the Company’s stock plans and realized proceeds of $213 million. In a program
designed primarily to offset these issuances, Southern Company also repurchased 10.1 million
shares of common stock at a total cost of $352 million. The repurchase program was discontinued
in early January 2006.

Subsequent to December 31, 2005, Alabama Power issued $600 million of long-term senior notes
to reduce short-term debt and for other general corporate purposes. In conjunction with these
transactions, Alabama Power terminated $600 million notional amount of interest rate swaps at a
gain of $18 million. The gain will be amortized to interest expense over a 10-year period. In
addition, Southern Company redeemed $72 million in long-term debt payable to affiliated trusts
following the repurchase of the underlying capital securities.

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements

In 2001, Mississippi Power began the initial 10-year term of a lease agreement for a combined cycle
generating facility built at Plant Daniel for approximately $370 million. In 2003, the generating
facility was acquired by Juniper Capital L.P. (Juniper), a limited partnership whose investors are
unaffiliated with Mississippi Power. Simultaneously, Juniper entered into a restructured lease
agreement with Mississippi Power. Juniper has also entered into leases with other parties
unrelated to Mississippi Power. The assets leased by Mississippi Power comprise less than 50
percent of Juniper’s assets. Mississippi Power is not required to consolidate the leased assets
and related liabilities, and the lease with Juniper is considered an operating lease. The lease
also provides for a residual value guarantee, approximately 73 percent of the acquisition cost, by
Mississippi Power that is due upon termination of the lease in the event that Mississippi Power
does not renew the lease or purchase the assets and that the fair market value is less than the
unamortized cost of the assets. See Note 7 to the financial statements under “Operating Leases”
for additional information.

Credit Rating Risk

Southern Company does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in
payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. There are certain
contracts that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit
rating change to BBB- or Baa3 or below. These contracts are primarily for physical electricity
purchases and sales. At December 31, 2005, the maximum potential collateral requirements at a
BBB- or Baa3 rating were approximately $196.4 million. The maximum potential collateral
requirements at a rating below BBB- or Baa3 were approximately $602.3 million. Generally,
collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. Southern
Company is also party to certain derivative agreements that could require collateral and/or
accelerated payment in the event of a credit rating change to below investment grade. These
agreements are primarily for natural gas price risk management activities. At December 31, 2005,
Southern Company and its subsidiaries had no material exposure under these contracts.

Subsequent to December 31, 2005, the Company has entered into additional physical
electricity purchases and sales contracts adding $9 million to the maximum potential collateral
requirements at a credit rating of BBB and Baa2 and $17 million at BBB- or Baa3 and below.

Market Price Risk

Southern Company is exposed to market risks, primarily commodity price risk and interest rate
risk. To manage the volatility attributable to these exposures, the Company nets the exposures
to take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the
remaining exposures pursuant to the Company’s policies in areas such as counterparty exposure
and risk management practices. Company policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for
hedging purposes and mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies.
Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including, but not limited to, market
valuation, value at risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis.

II-33


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

To mitigate future exposure to change in interest rates, the Company has entered into
forward starting interest rate swaps that have been designated as hedges. These swaps have a
notional amount of $930 million and are related to anticipated debt issuances over the next two
years. The weighted average
interest rate on $1.5 billion of long-term variable interest rate exposure that has not been
hedged at January 1, 2006 was 4.37 percent. If Southern Company sustained a 100 basis point
change in interest rates for all unhedged variable rate long-term debt, the change would affect
annualized interest expense by approximately $15.4 million at January 1, 2006. For further
information, see Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements under “Financial Instruments.”

Due to cost-based rate regulations, the retail operating companies have limited exposure to
market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity. In
addition, Southern Power’s exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of
electricity is limited because its long-term sales contracts shift substantially all fuel cost
responsibility to the purchaser. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in
electricity prices, the retail operating companies and Southern Power enter into fixed-price
contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity market and,
to a lesser extent, into similar contracts for natural gas purchases. The retail operating
companies have implemented fuel-hedging programs at the instruction of their respective state
PSCs. Southern Company Gas also utilized a risk management program to substantially mitigate
its exposure to price volatility for its natural gas purchases.

Unrealized gains and losses from mark-to-market adjustments on derivative contracts related to
the retail operating companies’ fuel hedging programs are recorded as regulatory assets and
liabilities. Realized gains and losses from these programs are included in fuel expense and are
recovered through the retail operating companies’ fuel cost recovery clauses. In addition,
unrealized gains and losses on energy-related derivatives used by Southern Power to hedge
anticipated purchases and sales are deferred in other comprehensive income. Gains and losses on
derivative contracts that are not designated as hedges are recognized in the income statement as
incurred. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of derivative energy contracts was reflected in the
financial statements as follows:

Southern Company is exposed to market price risk in the event of nonperformance by
counterparties to the derivative energy contracts. Southern Company’s policy is to enter into
agreements with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody’s and Standard &
Poor’s or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure.
Therefore, Southern Company does not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the
counterparties. For additional information, see Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements under
“Financial Instruments.”

Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations

The construction program of Southern Company is currently estimated to be $2.8 billion for 2006,
$3.6

II-34


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

billion for 2007, and $3.1 billion for 2008. Environmental expenditures included in these
amounts are $0.8 billion, $1.3 billion, and $1.1 billion for
2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively. Actual construction costs may vary from this estimate
because of changes in such factors as: business conditions; environmental regulations; nuclear
plant regulations; FERC rules and regulations; load projections; the cost and efficiency of
construction labor, equipment, and materials; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can
be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered.

As a result of NRC requirements, Alabama Power and Georgia Power have external trust funds for
nuclear decommissioning costs; however, Alabama Power currently has no additional funding
requirements. For additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements under “Nuclear
Decommissioning.” Also, as discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements under “Nuclear Fuel
Disposal Costs,” in 1993 the DOE implemented a special assessment over a 15-year period on
utilities with nuclear plants, to be used for the decontamination and decommissioning of its
nuclear fuel enrichment facilities. The final installment is scheduled to occur in 2006.

In addition, as discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, Southern Company provides
postretirement benefits to substantially all employees and funds trusts to the extent required by
the retail operating companies’ respective regulatory commissions.

Other funding requirements related to obligations associated with scheduled maturities of
long-term debt and preferred securities, as well as the related interest, derivative obligations,
preferred and preference stock dividends, leases, and other purchase commitments are as follows.
See Notes 1, 6, and 7 to the financial statements for additional information.

All amounts are reflected based on final maturity dates. Southern Company and its
subsidiaries plan to continue to retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations
with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit. Variable rate interest obligations are
estimated based on rates as of January 1, 2006, as reflected in the statements of
capitalization. Fixed rates include, where applicable, the effects of interest rate
derivatives employed to manage interest rate risk.

Southern Company forecasts capital expenditures over a three-year period. Amounts represent
current estimates of total expenditures excluding those amounts related to contractual
purchase commitments for uranium and nuclear fuel conversion, enrichment, and fabrication
services. At December 31, 2005, significant purchase commitments were outstanding in
connection with the construction program.

(f)

Natural gas purchase commitments are based on various indices at the time of delivery.
Amounts reflected have been estimated based on the New York Mercantile Exchange future prices
at December 31, 2005.

Southern Company forecasts postretirement trust contributions over a three-year period. No
contributions related to Southern Company’s pension trust are currently expected during this
period. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information related to the
pension and postretirement plans, including estimated benefit payments. Certain benefit
payments will be made through the related trusts. Other benefit payments will be made from
Southern Company’s corporate assets.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General

Southern Company (the Company) is the parent company of five retail operating companies,
Southern Power Company (Southern Power), Southern Company Services (SCS), Southern
Communications Services (SouthernLINC Wireless), Southern Company Holdings (Southern Holdings),
Southern Nuclear Operating Company (Southern Nuclear), Southern Telecom, and other direct and
indirect subsidiaries. The retail operating companies, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf
Power, Mississippi Power, and Savannah Electric, provide electric service in four Southeastern
states. Southern Power constructs, owns, and manages Southern Company’s competitive generation
assets and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Contracts among the
retail operating companies and Southern Power, related to jointly owned generating facilities,
interconnecting transmission lines, or the exchange of electric power, are regulated by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). SCS, the system service company, provides, at
cost, specialized services to Southern Company and the subsidiary companies. SouthernLINC
Wireless provides digital wireless communications services to the retail operating companies and
also markets these services to the public within the Southeast. Southern Telecom provides fiber
cable services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding subsidiary
for Southern Company’s investments in synthetic fuels and leveraged leases and various other
energy-related businesses. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to Southern
Company’s nuclear power plants.

On January 4, 2006, Southern Company completed the sale of substantially all the assets of
Southern Company Gas, its competitive retail natural gas marketing subsidiary, including natural
gas inventory, accounts receivable, and customer list, to Gas South, LLC, an affiliate of Cobb
Electric Membership Corporation. As a result of the sale, Southern Company’s financial
statements and related information reflect Southern Company Gas as discontinued operations. For
additional information, see Note 3 under “Southern Company Gas Sale.”

The financial statements reflect Southern Company’s investments in the subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis. The equity method is used for subsidiaries in which the Company has
significant influence but does not control and for variable interest entities where the Company
is not the primary beneficiary. All material intercompany items have been eliminated in
consolidation. Certain prior years’ data presented in the financial statements have been
reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.

Southern Company was registered as a holding company under the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935, as amended (PUHCA), until its repeal on February 8, 2006, and the Company
and its subsidiaries were subject to the regulatory provisions of the PUHCA. The retail
operating companies, Southern Power, and certain of their subsidiaries are subject to regulation
by the FERC and the retail operating companies are also subject to regulation by their
respective state public service commissions (PSC). The companies follow accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States and comply with the accounting policies and practices
prescribed by their respective commissions. The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the use
of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates.

Related Party Transactions

Alabama Power and Georgia Power purchase synthetic fuel from Alabama Fuel Products, LLC (AFP), an
entity in which Southern Holdings holds a 30 percent ownership interest. Total fuel purchases for
2005, 2004, and 2003 were $507 million, $409 million, and $312 million, respectively. Synfuel
Services, Inc. (SSI), another subsidiary of Southern Holdings, provides fuel transportation
services to AFP that are ultimately reflected in the cost of the synthetic fuel billed to Alabama
Power and Georgia Power. In connection with these services, the related revenues of approximately
$83 million, $82 million, and $65 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, have been
eliminated against fuel expense in the financial statements. SSI also provides additional services
to AFP, as well as to a related party of AFP. Revenues from these transactions totaled
approximately $40 million, $24 million, and $20 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

The retail operating companies are subject to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation.
Regulatory assets represent probable future revenues associated with certain costs that are
expected to be recovered from customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities
represent probable future reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be
credited to customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory assets and (liabilities)
reflected in the balance sheets at December 31 relate to:

Note:

The recovery and amortization periods for these regulatory assets and (liabilities) are as follows:

(a)

Asset retirement and removal liabilities are recorded, deferred income tax assets are
recovered, and deferred tax liabilities are amortized over the related property lives, which
may range up to 60 years. Asset retirement and removal liabilities will be settled and trued
up following completion of the related activities.

(b)

Recovered over either the remaining life of the original issue or, if refinanced, over the
life of the new issue, which may range up to 50 years.

(c)

Recorded as earned by employees and recovered as paid, generally within one year.

(d)

Recorded and recovered or amortized as approved by the appropriate state PSCs.

(e)

Amortized over four-year period ending in 2007.

In the event that a portion of a retail operating company’s operations is no longer
subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, such company would be required to write off
related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable through regulated
rates. In addition, the retail operating company would be required to determine if any impairment
to other assets, including plant, exists and write down the assets, if impaired, to their fair
value. All regulatory assets and liabilities are to be reflected in rates.

Revenues

Capacity revenues are generally recognized on a levelized basis over the appropriate contract
periods. Energy and other revenues are recognized as services are provided. Unbilled revenues
are accrued at the end of each fiscal period. Electric rates for the retail operating companies
include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, fuel hedging, the energy
component of purchased power costs, and certain other costs. Revenues are adjusted for
differences between these actual costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Under or
over recovered regulatory clause revenues are recorded in the balance sheets and are recovered
or returned to customers through adjustments to the billing factors.

Retail fuel costs recovery mechanisms vary by each retail operating company, but in
general, the process requires periodic filings with the appropriate state PSC. Alabama Power
continuously monitors the under/over recovered balance and files for a revised fuel rate when
management deems appropriate. The Georgia PSC requires that such amounts be reviewed
semi-annually. If the amount under or over recovered exceeds $50 million at the evaluation
date, Georgia Power is required to file for a temporary fuel rate change. If the over or under
recovery exceeds 10 percent of the projected fuel costs for the period, Gulf Power is required
to notify the Florida PSC to determine if an adjustment to the fuel cost recovery factor is
necessary. Mississippi Power is required to file for an adjustment to the fuel cost recovery
factor annually. See “Alabama Power Retail Regulatory Matters” and “Georgia Power Retail
Regulatory Matters” in Note 3 for additional information.

Southern Company has a diversified base of
customers. No single customer or industry comprises 10 percent or more of revenues. For all
periods presented, uncollectible accounts averaged less than 1 percent of revenues despite an
increase in customer bankruptcies.

Fuel Costs

Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is used. Fuel expense generally includes the cost of
purchased

II-46


NOTES
(continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

emission allowances as they are used. Fuel expense also includes the amortization of
the cost of nuclear fuel and a charge, based on nuclear generation, for the
permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. Total charges for nuclear fuel included in fuel
expense amounted to $134 million in 2005, $134 million in 2004, and $138 million in 2003.

Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs

Alabama Power and Georgia Power have contracts with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) that
provide for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin disposing of
spent nuclear fuel in 1998 as required by the contracts, and Alabama Power and Georgia Power are
pursuing legal remedies against the government for breach of contract. Sufficient pool storage
capacity for spent fuel is available at Plant Vogtle to maintain full-core discharge capability
for both units into 2015. Construction of an on-site dry storage facility at Plant Vogtle is
scheduled to begin in sufficient time to maintain pool full-core discharge capability. At
Plants Hatch and Farley, on-site dry storage facilities are operational and can be expanded to
accommodate spent fuel through the life of each plant.

Also, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 established a Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and
Decommissioning Fund, which is funded in part by a special assessment on utilities with nuclear
plants. This assessment has been paid over a 15-year period; the final installment is scheduled
to occur in 2006. This fund will be used by the DOE for the decontamination and decommissioning
of its nuclear fuel enrichment facilities. The law provides that utilities will recover these
payments in the same manner as any other fuel expense. Alabama Power and Georgia Power, based
on its ownership interest, estimate their respective remaining liability at December 31, 2005
under this law to be approximately $5 million and $4 million.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost less regulatory disallowances and
impairments. Original cost includes: materials; labor; minor items of property; appropriate
administrative and general costs; payroll-related costs such as taxes, pensions, and other
benefits; and the interest capitalized and/or cost of funds used during construction.

Southern Company’s property, plant, and equipment consisted of the following at December 31

The cost of replacements of property, exclusive of minor items of property, is capitalized.
The cost of maintenance, repairs, and replacement of minor items of property is charged to
maintenance expense as incurred or performed with the exception of nuclear refueling costs,
which are recorded in accordance with specific state PSC orders. Alabama Power accrues
estimated refueling costs in advance of the unit’s next refueling outage. Georgia Power defers
and amortizes refueling costs over the unit’s operating cycle before the next refueling. The
refueling cycles for Alabama Power and Georgia Power range from 18 to 24 months for each unit.
In accordance with a Georgia PSC order, Georgia Power also defers the costs of certain
significant inspection costs for the combustion turbines at Plant McIntosh and amortizes such
costs over 10 years, which approximates the expected maintenance cycle.

Income Taxes

Southern Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provides
deferred income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences. Investment tax
credits utilized are deferred and amortized to income over the average life of the related
property.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation of the original cost of utility plant in service is provided primarily by using
composite straight-line rates, which approximated 2.9 percent in 2005, 3.0 percent in 2004, and
3.1 percent in 2003. Depreciation studies are conducted periodically to update the composite
rates. These studies are filed with the respective state PSC for the retail operating
companies. Accumulated depreciation for utility plant in service totaled $15.3 billion and
$14.6 billion at December 31, 2005 and

II-47


NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

2004, respectively. When property subject to composite depreciation is retired or otherwise
disposed of in the normal course of business, its original cost, together with the cost of
removal, less salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation. For other property dispositions,
the applicable cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the balance sheet accounts and
a gain or loss is recognized. Minor items of property included in the original cost of the
plant are retired when the related property unit is retired.

Under its 2001 rate order, the Georgia PSC ordered Georgia Power to amortize $333 million, the
cumulative balance of accelerated depreciation and amortization previously expensed, equally over
three years as a credit to depreciation and amortization expense beginning January 2002. Georgia
Power was also ordered to recognize new certified purchased power costs in rates evenly over the
three-year period by the 2001 rate order. As a result of this regulatory adjustment, Georgia Power
recorded depreciation and amortization expense of $(77) million and $14 million in 2004 and 2003,
respectively. See Note 3 under “Georgia Power Retail Regulatory Matters” for additional
information.

In May 2004, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power’s request to reclassify 266
megawatts of Plant Daniel units 3 and 4 capacity to jurisdictional cost of service effective
January 1, 2004 and authorized Mississippi Power to include the related costs and revenue
credits in jurisdictional rate base, cost of service, and revenue requirement calculations for
purposes of retail rate recovery. Mississippi Power is amortizing the related regulatory
liability pursuant to the Mississippi PSC’s order as follows: $16.5 million in 2004, $25.1
million in 2005, $13.0 million in 2006, and $5.7 million in 2007, resulting in increases to
earnings in each of those years.

Depreciation of the original cost of other plant in service is provided primarily on a
straight-line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 25 years. Accumulated
depreciation for other plant in service totaled $378 million and $345 million at December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively.

Asset Retirement Obligations

and Other Costs of Removal

Effective January 1, 2003, Southern Company adopted FASB Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations, which established new accounting and reporting standards for legal
obligations associated with the ultimate costs of retiring long-lived assets. The present value
of the ultimate costs for an asset’s future retirement is recorded in the period in which the
liability is incurred. The costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and
depreciated over the asset’s useful life. In addition, effective December 31, 2005, Southern
Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 47, Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations, which requires that an asset retirement obligation be recorded even though the
timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on future events. Prior to December 2005, the
Company did not recognize asset retirement obligations for asbestos removal and disposal of
polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers because the timing of their retirements was
dependent on future events. The Company has received accounting guidance from the various state
PSCs allowing the continued accrual of other future retirement costs for long-lived assets that
the Company does not have a legal obligation to retire. Accordingly, the accumulated removal
costs for these obligations will continue to be reflected in the balance sheets as a regulatory
liability. Therefore, the Company had no cumulative effect to net income resulting from the
adoption of Statement No. 143 or Interpretation No. 47.

The liability recognized to retire long-lived assets primarily relates to the Company’s
nuclear facilities, Plants Farley, Hatch, and Vogtle. The fair value of assets legally
restricted for settling retirement obligations related to nuclear facilities as of December 31,
2005 was $954 million. In addition, the Company has retirement obligations related to various
landfill sites and underground storage tanks. In connection with the adoption of Interpretation
No. 47, Southern Company also recorded additional asset retirement obligations (and assets) of
approximately $153 million, primarily related to asbestos removal and disposal of
polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers. The Company has also identified retirement
obligations related to certain transmission and distribution facilities, co-generation
facilities, certain wireless communication towers, and certain structures authorized by the
United States Army Corps of Engineers. However, liabilities for the removal of these assets
have not been recorded because the range of time over which the Company may settle these
obligations is unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated. The Company will continue

II-48

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

to recognize in the statements of income allowed removal costs in accordance with its regulatory
treatment. Any difference between costs recognized under Statement No. 143 and Interpretation
No. 47 and those reflected in rates are recognized as either a regulatory asset or liability, as
ordered by the various state PSCs, and are reflected in the balance sheets. See “Nuclear
Decommissioning” herein for further information on amounts included in rates.

Nuclear Decommissioning

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requires licensees of commercial nuclear power reactors
to establish a plan for providing reasonable assurance of funds for future decommissioning.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power have external trust funds to comply with the NRC’s regulations.
Use of the funds is restricted to nuclear decommissioning activities and the funds are managed
and invested in accordance with applicable requirements of various regulatory bodies, including
the NRC, the FERC, and state PSCs, as well as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The trust
funds are invested in a tax-efficient manner in a diversified mix of equity and fixed income
securities and are classified as available-for-sale. The trust funds are included in the
balance sheets at fair value, as obtained from quoted market prices for the same or similar
investments. Details of the securities held in these trusts at December 31 are as follows:

The contractual maturities of debt securities at December 31, 2005 are as follows: $17.3
million in 2006; $90.1 million in 2007-2010; $59.5 million in 2011-2015; and $65.5 million
thereafter.

Sales of the securities held in the trust funds resulted in proceeds of $596.3 million,
$781.3 million, and $978.1 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, all of which were
re-invested. Net realized gains (losses) were $22.5 million, $21.6 million, and $19.6 million in
2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Realized gains and losses are determined on a specific
identification basis. In accordance with regulatory guidance, all realized and unrealized gains
and losses are included in the regulatory liability for Asset Retirement Obligations in the
balance sheets and are not included in net income or other comprehensive income. Unrealized
gains and losses are considered non-cash transactions for purposes of the statements of cash
flow. Unrealized losses were not material in any period presented and did not require the
recognition of any impairment related to the underlying investments.

Amounts previously recorded in internal reserves are being transferred into the external
trust funds over periods approved by the respective state PSCs. The NRC’s minimum external
funding requirements are based on a generic estimate of the cost to decommission only the
radioactive portions of a nuclear unit based on the size and type of reactor. Alabama Power and
Georgia Power have filed plans with the NRC designed to ensure that, over time, the deposits and
earnings of the external trust funds will provide the minimum funding amounts prescribed by the
NRC. At December 31, 2005, the accumulated provisions for decommissioning were as follows:

Site study cost is the estimate to decommission a specific facility as of the site study
year. The estimated costs of decommissioning based on the most current studies, which were
performed in 2003, for Alabama Power’s Plant Farley and Georgia Power’s ownership interests in
Plants Hatch and Vogtle were as follows:

The decommissioning cost estimates are based on prompt dismantlement and removal of the
plant from service. The actual decommissioning costs may vary from the above estimates because
of changes in the assumed date of decommissioning, changes in NRC requirements, or changes in
the assumptions used in making these estimates.

For ratemaking purposes, Alabama Power’s decommissioning costs are based on the site study
and Georgia Power’s decommissioning costs are based on the NRC generic estimate to decommission
the radioactive portion of the facilities as of 2003, $421 million and $326 million for Plants
Hatch and Vogtle, respectively. Amounts expensed in 2005, 2004, and 2003 totaled $7 million,
$27 million, and $27 million, respectively. Significant assumptions used to determine these
costs for ratemaking were an inflation rate of 4.5 percent and 3.1 percent for Alabama Power and
Georgia Power, respectively, and a trust earnings rate of 7.0 percent and 5.1 percent for
Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively. Another significant assumption used was the
change in the operating licenses for Plants Farley and Hatch. In January 2002, the NRC granted
Georgia Power a 20-year extension of the licenses for both units at Plant Hatch, which permits
the operation of units 1 and 2 until 2034 and 2038, respectively.

In May 2005, the NRC granted Alabama Power a similar 20-year extension of the operating
license for both units at Plant Farley. As a result of the Farley license extension, amounts
previously contributed to the external trust fund are currently projected to be adequate to meet
the decommissioning obligations. Therefore, in June 2005, the Alabama PSC approved Alabama
Power’s request to suspend, effective January 1, 2005, the inclusion in its annual cost of
service of $18 million in decommissioning costs and to also suspend the associated obligation to
make semi-annual contributions to the external trust fund. Alabama Power will continue to
provide site specific estimates of the decommissioning costs and related projections of trust
funds to the Alabama PSC and, if necessary, would seek the Alabama PSC’s approval to address any
changes in a manner consistent with NRC and other applicable requirements. The approved
suspension would not affect the transfer of internal reserves (less than $1 million annually) to
the external trust over the remaining life of the licenses.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) and Interest Capitalized

In accordance with regulatory treatment, the retail operating companies record AFUDC. AFUDC
represents the estimated debt and equity costs of capital funds that are necessary to finance
the construction of new regulated facilities. While cash is not realized currently from such
allowance, it increases the revenue requirement over the service life of the plant through a
higher rate base and higher depreciation expense. Interest related to the construction of new
facilities not included in the retail operating companies’ regulated rates is capitalized in
accordance with standard interest capitalization requirements.

Cash payments for interest totaled $661 million, $551 million, and $603 million in 2005,
2004, and 2003, respectively, net of amounts capitalized of $21 million, $36 million, and $49
million, respectively.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles

Southern Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The
determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on either a specific regulatory
disallowance or an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as
compared with the carrying value of the assets. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of
the impairment recognized is determined by either the amount of regulatory disallowance or by
estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater
than the fair value. For assets identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to

value less the cost to sell in order to determine if an impairment provision is required. Until
the assets are disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or
events change.

Storm Damage Reserves

Each retail operating company maintains a reserve for property damage to cover the cost of
uninsured damages from major storms to transmission and distribution facilities and to
generation facilities and other property. In accordance with their respective state PSC orders,
the retail operating companies accrued $15 million in 2005 that is recoverable through base
rates. Alabama Power, Gulf Power, and Mississippi Power also have discretionary authority from
their state PSCs to accrue certain additional amounts as circumstances warrant. In 2005, 2004,
and 2003, such additional accruals totaled $6 million, $25 million, and $8 million,
respectively. See Note 3 under “Storm Damage Recovery” for additional information regarding the
depletion of these reserves following Hurricanes Ivan, Dennis, and Katrina and the deferral of
additional costs, as well as additional rate riders or other cost recovery mechanisms which may
be approved by the respective state PSCs to replenish these reserves.

Environmental Cost Recovery

Southern Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that cover the
handling and disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws
and regulations, the subsidiaries may also incur substantial costs to clean up properties.
Alabama Power, Gulf Power, and Mississippi Power have each received authority from their
respective state PSCs to recover approved environmental compliance costs through specific retail
rate clauses. Within limits approved by the state PSCs, these rates are adjusted annually.

Georgia Power continues to recover environmental costs through its base rates. Beginning
in 2005, such rates include an annual accrual of $5.4 million. Environmental remediation
expenditures will be charged against the reserve as they are incurred. The annual accrual
amount will be reviewed and adjusted in future regulatory proceedings. Under Georgia PSC
ratemaking provisions, $22 million had previously been deferred in a regulatory liability
account for use in meeting future environmental remediation costs of Georgia Power and is being
amortized over a three-year period that began in January 2005.

In September 2004, Gulf Power increased its liability for the estimated costs of
environmental remediation projects by approximately $47 million. This increase related to new
regulations and more stringent site closure criteria by the Florida Department of Environmental
Protection (FDEP) for impacts to soil and groundwater from herbicide applications at Gulf Power
substations. The schedule for completion of the remediation projects will be subject to FDEP
approval. The projects have been approved by the Florida PSC for recovery, as expended, through
Gulf Power’s environmental cost recovery clause; therefore, there was no impact on net income as
a result of these revised estimates.

For Southern Company, the environmental remediation liabilities balances as of December 31,
2005 and 2004 totaled $62 million and $63 million, respectively.

Leveraged Leases

Southern Company has several leveraged lease agreements, ranging up to 45 years, which relate to
international and domestic energy generation, distribution, and transportation assets. Southern
Company receives federal income tax deductions for rent or depreciation and amortization, as
well as interest on long-term debt related to these investments.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are considered cash
equivalents. Temporary cash investments are securities with original maturities of 90 days or
less.

Materials and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include the average costs of transmission, distribution, and
generating plant materials. Materials are charged to inventory when purchased and then expensed
or capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when installed.

Fuel Inventory

Fuel inventory includes the average costs of oil, coal, natural gas, and emission allowances.
Fuel is charged to inventory when purchased and then expensed as used. Emission allowances
granted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are included in inventory at zero cost.

Stock Options

Southern Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plans in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized
because the exercise price of all options granted equaled the fair-market value on the date of
grant.

For pro forma purposes, Southern Company generally recognizes stock option expense on a
straight-line basis over the vesting period. Stock options granted to employees who are
eligible for retirement are expensed at the grant date. The pro forma impact of fair-value
accounting for options granted on earnings from continuing operations is as follows:

Financial Instruments

Southern Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to fluctuations in
interest rates, the prices of certain fuel purchases, and electricity purchases and sales. All
derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured
at fair value.

II-52


NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

Substantially all of Southern Company’s bulk energy purchases and sales contracts that meet the
definition of a derivative are exempt from fair value accounting requirements and are accounted
for under the accrual method. Other derivative contracts qualify as cash flow hedges of
anticipated transactions or are recoverable through the retail operating companies’ fuel hedging
programs. This results in the deferral of related gains and losses in other comprehensive
income or regulatory assets and liabilities, respectively, until the hedged transactions occur.
Any ineffectiveness arising from cash flow hedges is recognized currently in net income. Other
derivative contracts are marked to market through current period income and are recorded on a
net basis in the statements of income.

Southern Company is exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of
counterparties’ nonperformance. The Company has established controls to determine and monitor
the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate the Company’s exposure to
counterparty credit risk.

The other Southern Company financial instruments for which the carrying amount does not equal
fair value at December 31 were as follows:

The fair values were based on either closing market price or closing price of comparable
instruments.

Comprehensive Income

The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of all changes in common stock
equity of an enterprise that result from transactions and other economic events of the period
other than transactions with owners. Comprehensive income consists of net income, changes in
the fair value of qualifying cash flow hedges and marketable securities, and changes in
additional minimum pension liability, less income taxes and reclassifications for amounts
included in net income.

Variable Interest Entities

The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity must consolidate the related assets and
liabilities. Southern Company has established certain wholly-owned trusts established to issue
preferred securities. See Note 6 under “Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities/Long-Term
Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts” for additional information. However, Southern Company and
the retail operating companies are not the primary beneficiaries of the trusts. Therefore, the
investments in these trusts are reflected as Other Investments, and the related loans from the
trusts are reflected as Long-term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts in the balance sheets.

In addition, Southern Company holds an 85 percent limited partnership investment in an
energy/technology venture capital fund that is consolidated in the financial statements. During
the third quarter of 2004, Southern Company terminated new investments in this fund; however,
additional contributions to existing investments will still occur. Southern Company has
committed to a maximum investment of $50 million. At December 31, 2005, Southern Company’s
investment totaled $25.6 million.

2. RETIREMENT BENEFITS

Southern Company has a defined benefit, trusteed, pension plan covering substantially all
employees. The plan is funded in accordance with requirements of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). In 2005, the plan was amended to provide an
additional monthly supplement to certain retirees. No contributions to the plan are expected
for the year ending December 31, 2006. Southern Company also provides certain non-qualified
benefit plans for a selected group of management and highly compensated employees. Benefits
under these non-qualified plans are funded on a cash basis. In addition, Southern Company
provides certain medical care and life insurance benefits for retired employees. The retail
operating companies fund related trusts to the extent required by their respective regulatory
commissions. For the year ended December 31, 2006, postretirement trust contributions are
expected to total approximately $45 million.

The measurement date for plan assets and obligations is September 30 for each year
presented.

Pension Plans

The total accumulated benefit obligation for the pension plans was $5.2 billion in 2005 and $4.6
billion

In
2005, the projected benefit obligations for the qualified and non-qualified pension plans were

Pension plan assets are managed and invested in accordance with all applicable requirements,
including ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Internal Revenue Code). The
Company’s investment policy covers a diversified mix of assets, including equity and fixed income
securities, real estate, and private equity, as described in the table below. Derivative
instruments are used primarily as hedging tools but may also be used to gain efficient exposure to
the various asset classes. The Company primarily minimizes the risk of large losses through
diversification but also monitors and manages other aspects of risk.

In the third quarter 2004, Southern Company prospectively adopted FASB Staff Position (FSP)
106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act). The Medicare Act provides a 28
percent prescription drug subsidy for Medicare eligible retirees. FSP 106-2 requires recognition
of the impacts of the Medicare Act in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO)
and future cost of service for postretirement medical plan. The effect of the subsidy reduced
Southern Company’s expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2004 and for the year ended
December 31, 2005 by approximately $10.6 million and $26 million, respectively, and is expected
to have a similar impact on future expenses.

Future benefit payments, including prescription drug benefits, reflect expected future
service and are estimated based on assumptions used to measure the accumulated benefit
obligation for the postretirement plans. Estimated benefit payments are reduced by drug subsidy
receipts expected as a result of the Medicare Act as follows:

Actuarial Assumptions

The weighted average rates assumed in the actuarial calculations used to determine both the
benefit obligations and the net periodic costs for the pension and postretirement benefit plans
were as follows:

The Company determined the long-term rate of return based on historical asset class returns

An additional assumption used in measuring the APBO was a weighted average medical care
cost trend rate of 10.25 percent for 2005, decreasing gradually to 4.75 percent through the year
2014 and remaining at that level thereafter. An annual increase or decrease in the assumed
medical care cost trend rate of 1 percent would affect the accumulated benefit obligation and
the service and interest cost components at December 31, 2005 as follows:

Employee Savings Plan

Southern Company also sponsors a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering substantially all
employees. The Company provides a 75 percent matching contribution up to 6 percent of an
employee’s base salary. Total matching contributions made to the plan for 2005, 2004, and 2003
were $58 million, $56 million, and $55 million, respectively.

3. CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY MATTERS

General Litigation Matters

Southern Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course
of business. In addition, Southern Company’s business activities are subject to extensive
governmental regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation over
environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury,
and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements such as opacity and other air quality
standards, has increased generally throughout the United States. In particular, personal injury
claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become more frequent.
The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against Southern Company and its
subsidiaries cannot be predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically
reported herein, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such
current proceedings would have a material adverse effect on Southern Company’s financial
statements.

Mirant Matters

Mirant Corporation (Mirant) is an energy company with businesses that include independent power
projects and energy trading and risk management companies in the U.S. and selected other
countries. It was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Company until its initial public
offering in October 2000. In April 2001, Southern Company completed a spin-off to its
shareholders of its remaining ownership, and Mirant became an independent corporate entity.

Mirant Bankruptcy

In July 2003, Mirant and certain of its affiliates filed voluntary petitions for relief under
Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of
Texas. The Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming Mirant’s plan of reorganization on
December 9, 2005, and Mirant announced that this plan became effective on January 3, 2006. As
part of the plan, Mirant transferred substantially all of its assets and its restructured debt
to a new corporation that adopted the name Mirant Corporation (Reorganized Mirant).

Southern Company has certain contingent liabilities associated with guarantees of
contractual commitments made by Mirant’s subsidiaries discussed in Note 7 under “Guarantees” and
with various lawsuits related to Mirant discussed below. Southern Company has paid approximately
$1.4 million in connection with the guarantees. Also, Southern Company has joint and several
liability with Mirant regarding the joint consolidated federal income tax returns through 2001,
as discussed in Note 5. In December 2004, as a result of concluding an IRS audit for the tax
years 2000 and 2001, Southern Company paid $39 million in additional tax and interest for issues
related to Mirant tax items. Based on management’s assessment of the collectibility of this
receivable, Southern Company has reserved approximately $12.5 million.

II-56


NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

Under the terms of the separation agreements entered into in connection with the spin-off,
Mirant agreed to indemnify Southern Company for costs associated with these guarantees,
lawsuits, and additional IRS assessments. However, as a result of Mirant’s bankruptcy, Southern
Company sought reimbursement as an unsecured creditor in Mirant’s Chapter 11 proceeding. Mirant
and The Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Mirant Corporation (Unsecured Creditors’
Committee) objected to and sought equitable subordination of Southern Company’s claims, and
Mirant moved to reject the separation agreements entered into in connection with the spin-off.
If Southern Company’s claims for indemnification with respect to these, or any additional future
payments, are allowed, then Mirant’s indemnity obligations to Southern Company would constitute
unsecured claims against Mirant entitled to stock in Reorganized Mirant, the value of which is
uncertain. The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Mirant Bankruptcy Litigation

In June 2005, Mirant, as a debtor in possession, and the Unsecured Creditors’ Committee filed a
complaint against Southern Company in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of
Texas, which was amended in July 2005 and February 2006. The complaint alleges that Southern
Company caused Mirant to engage in certain fraudulent transfers and to pay illegal dividends to
Southern Company prior to the spin-off. The alleged fraudulent transfers and illegal dividends
include without limitation: (1) certain dividends from Mirant to Southern Company in the
aggregate amount of $668 million, (2) the repayment of certain intercompany loans and accrued
interest in an aggregate amount of $1.035 billion, and (3) the dividend distribution of one
share of Series B Preferred Stock and its subsequent redemption in exchange for Mirant’s 80
percent interest in a holding company that owned SE Finance Capital Corporation and Southern
Company Capital Funding, Inc., which transfer Mirant asserts is valued at $248 million. The
complaint also seeks to recharacterize certain advances from Southern Company to Mirant for
investments in energy facilities from debt to equity. The complaint further alleges that
Southern Company is liable to Mirant’s creditors for the full amount of Mirant’s liability under
an alter ego theory of recovery and that Southern Company caused Mirant to breach its fiduciary
duties to creditors. The complaint seeks monetary damages in excess of $2 billion plus
interest, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. Finally, Mirant objects to Southern
Company’s claims against Mirant in the Bankruptcy Court (which relate to reimbursement under the
separation agreements of payments such as income taxes, interest, legal fees, and other
guarantees described in Note 7) and seeks equitable subordination of Southern Company’s claims
to the claims of all other creditors. Southern Company served an answer to the second amended
complaint in February 2006.

On December 29, 2005, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order transferring this proceeding,
along with certain other actions, to a special purpose subsidiary of Reorganized Mirant. Under
the order, Reorganized Mirant is obligated to fund up to $20 million in professional fees in
connection with the lawsuits, as well as certain additional amounts. Any net recoveries from
these lawsuits will be distributed to and shared equally by the unsecured creditors and the
original equity holders.

On January 10, 2006, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas granted
Southern Company’s motion to withdraw this action from the Bankruptcy Court, and on February 15,
2006 granted Southern Company’s motion to transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Georgia. Southern Company believes there is no meritorious basis for the
claims in the complaint and is vigorously defending itself in this action. However, the final
outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Mirant Securities Litigation

In November 2002, Southern Company, certain former and current senior officers of Southern
Company, and 12 underwriters of Mirant’s initial public offering were added as defendants in a
class action lawsuit that several Mirant shareholders originally filed against Mirant and
certain Mirant officers in May 2002. Several other similar lawsuits filed subsequently were
consolidated into this litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
Georgia. The amended complaint is based on allegations related to alleged improper energy
trading and marketing activities involving the California energy market, alleged false
statements and omissions in Mirant’s prospectus for its initial public offering and in
subsequent public statements by Mirant, and accounting-related issues previously disclosed by
Mirant. The lawsuit purports to include persons who acquired Mirant securities between

II-57


NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

September 26, 2000 and September 5, 2002.

In July 2003, the court dismissed all claims based on Mirant’s alleged improper energy
trading and marketing activities involving the California energy market. The remaining claims
do not allege any improper trading and marketing activity, accounting errors, or material
misstatements or omissions on the part of Southern Company but seek to impose liability on
Southern Company based on allegations that Southern Company was a “control person” as to Mirant
prior to the spin-off date. Southern Company filed an answer to the consolidated amended class
action complaint in September 2003. Plaintiffs have also filed a motion for class
certification.

During Mirant’s Chapter 11 proceeding, the securities litigation was stayed, with the
exception of limited discovery. Since Mirant’s plan of reorganization has become effective, the
stay has been lifted, and activity in this case is expected to resume.

Under certain circumstances, Southern Company will be obligated under its Bylaws to
indemnify the four current and/or former Southern Company officers who served as directors of
Mirant at the time of its initial public offering through the date of the spin-off and who are
also named as defendants in this lawsuit. The final outcome of this matter cannot now be
determined.

Southern Company Employee Savings Plan Litigation

In June 2004, an employee of a Southern Company subsidiary filed a complaint, which was amended
in December 2004 and November 2005 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
Georgia on behalf of a purported class of participants in or beneficiaries of The Southern
Company Employee Savings Plan (Plan) at any time since April 2, 2001 and whose Plan accounts
included investments in Mirant common stock. The complaint asserts claims under ERISA against
defendants Southern Company, SCS, the Employee Savings Plan Committee, the Pension Fund
Investment Review Committee, individual members of such committees, and the SCS Board of
Directors during the putative class period. The plaintiff alleges that the various defendants
had certain fiduciary duties under ERISA regarding the Mirant shares distributed to Southern
Company shareholders in the spin-off and held in the Mirant Stock Fund in the Plan. The
plaintiff alleges that the various defendants breached purported fiduciary duties by, among
other things, failing to adequately determine whether Mirant stock was appropriate to hold in
the Plan and failing to adequately inform Plan participants that Mirant stock was not an
appropriate investment for their retirement assets based on Mirant’s alleged improper energy
trading and accounting practices, mismanagement, and business conditions. The plaintiff also
alleges that certain defendants failed to monitor Plan fiduciaries and that certain defendants
had conflicting interests regarding Mirant, which prevented them from acting solely in the
interests of Plan participants and beneficiaries. The plaintiff seeks class-wide equitable
relief and an unspecified amount of monetary damages.

On October 4, 2005, the court dismissed the plaintiff’s claims for certain types of
equitable relief, but allowed the remainder of the ERISA claims to proceed. The defendants
filed answers to the second amended complaint in January 2006, and filed motions for summary
judgment and to stay discovery in February 2006. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot now
be determined.

Environmental Matters

New Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the EPA brought a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Georgia against certain Southern Company subsidiaries, including Alabama Power and
Georgia Power, alleging that these subsidiaries had violated the New Source Review (NSR)
provisions of the Clean Air Act and related state laws at certain coal-fired generating
facilities. Through subsequent amendments and other legal procedures, the EPA added Savannah
Electric as a defendant to the original action and filed a separate action against Alabama Power
in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama after it was dismissed from the
original action. In these lawsuits, the EPA alleges that NSR violations occurred at eight
coal-fired generating facilities operated by Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Savannah
Electric. The civil actions request penalties and injunctive relief, including an order
requiring the installation of the best available control technology at the affected units. On
June 3, 2005, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama issued a decision in
favor of Alabama Power on two primary legal issues in the case; however, the decision does not
resolve the case, nor does it address other legal issues

II-58

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

associated with the EPA’s allegations. In accordance with a separate court order, Alabama Power
and the EPA are currently participating in mediation with respect to the EPA’s claims. The
action against Georgia Power and Savannah Electric has been administratively closed since the
spring of 2001, and none of the parties has sought to reopen the case.

Southern Company believes that the retail operating companies complied with applicable laws
and the EPA regulations and interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place.
The Clean Air Act authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $32,500 per day, per violation
at each generating unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in any
one of these cases could require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this
time and could possibly require payment of substantial penalties. This could affect future results
of operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such costs are not recovered through
regulated rates.

Plant Wansley Environmental Litigation

In December 2002, the Sierra Club, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Georgia Forestwatch, and
one individual filed a civil suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia
against Georgia Power for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act at four of the units at Plant
Wansley. The civil action requests injunctive and declaratory relief, civil penalties, a
supplemental environmental project, and attorneys’ fees. The Clean Air Act authorizes civil
penalties of up to $27,500 per day, per violation at each generating unit. The liability phase of
the case has concluded with the court ruling in favor of Georgia Power in part and the plaintiffs
in part. In March 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit accepted Georgia
Power’s petition for review of the district court’s order, and oral arguments were held on January
24, 2006. The district court case has been administratively closed pending that appeal. If
necessary, the district court will hold a separate trial which will address civil penalties and
possible injunctive relief requested by the plaintiffs.

The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot currently be determined; however, an adverse
outcome could require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and
could possibly require the payment of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of
operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated
rates.

Environmental Remediation

Georgia Power has been designated as a potentially responsible party at sites governed by the
Georgia Hazardous Site Response Act and/or by the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act. In 1995, the EPA designated Georgia Power and four other
unrelated entities as potentially responsible parties at a site in Brunswick, Georgia, that is
listed on the federal National Priorities List. As of December 31, 2005, Georgia Power had
recorded approximately $6 million in cumulative expenses associated with its agreed-upon share
of the removal and remedial investigation and feasibility study costs for the Brunswick site.
Additional claims for recovery of natural resource damages at the site are anticipated. Georgia
Power has also recognized $36 million in cumulative expenses through December 31, 2005 for the
assessment and anticipated cleanup of other sites on the Georgia Hazardous Sites Inventory.

The final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined. However, based on the
currently known conditions at these sites and the nature and extent of activities relating to
these sites, management does not believe that additional liabilities, if any, at these sites
would be material to the financial statements.

FERC Matters

Market-Based Rate Authority

Each of the retail operating companies and Southern Power has authorization from the FERC to
sell power to non-affiliates at market-based prices. The retail operating companies and
Southern Power also have FERC authority to make short-term opportunity sales at market rates.
Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a market-based contract with an
affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation
dominance within its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other
markets is not an issue in that proceeding. In February 2005, Southern Company submitted
responsive information. In February 2006, the FERC suspended the proceeding to allow the
parties to conduct settlement discussions. Any new market-based rate

II-59


NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

transactions in its retail service territory entered into after February 27, 2005 are subject to
refund to the level of the default cost-based rates, pending the outcome of the proceeding. The
impact of such sales through December 31, 2005 is not expected to exceed $16 million. The
refund period covers 15 months. In the event that the FERC’s default mitigation measures for
entities that are found to have market power are ultimately applied, the retail operating
companies and Southern Power may be required to charge cost-based rates for certain wholesale
sales in the Southern Company retail service territory, which may be lower than negotiated
market-based rates. The final outcome of this matter will depend on the form in which the final
methodology for assessing generation market power and mitigation rules may be ultimately adopted
and cannot be determined at this time.

In addition, in May 2005, the FERC started an investigation to determine whether Southern
Company satisfies the other three parts of the FERC’s market-based rate analysis: transmission
market power, barriers to entry, and affiliate abuse or reciprocal dealing. The FERC established a
new refund period related to this expanded investigation. Any and all new market-based rate
transactions both inside and outside Southern Company’s retail service territory involving any
Southern Company subsidiary will be subject to refund to the extent the FERC orders lower rates as
a result of this new investigation, with the 15-month refund period beginning July 19, 2005. The
impact of such sales through December 31, 2005 is not expected to exceed $31 million, of which $11
million relates to sales inside the retail service territory discussed above. The FERC also
directed that this expanded proceeding be held in abeyance pending the outcome of the proceeding on
the Intercompany Interchange Contract (IIC) discussed below.

Southern Company and its subsidiaries believe that there is no meritorious basis for this
proceeding and are vigorously defending themselves in this matter. However, the final outcome of
this matter, including any remedies to be applied in the event of an adverse ruling in this
proceeding, cannot now be determined.

Intercompany Interchange Contract

The Company’s generation fleet in its retail service territory is operated under the IIC, as
approved by the FERC. In May 2005, the FERC initiated a new proceeding to examine (1) the
provisions of the IIC among Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, Savannah
Electric, Southern Power, and SCS, as agent, under the terms of which the power pool of Southern
Company is operated, and, in particular, the propriety of the continued inclusion of Southern Power
as a party to the IIC, (2) whether any parties to the IIC have violated the FERC’s standards of
conduct applicable to utility companies that are transmission providers, and (3) whether Southern
Company’s code of conduct defining Southern Power as a “system company” rather than a “marketing
affiliate” is just and reasonable. In connection with the formation of Southern Power, the FERC
authorized Southern Power’s inclusion in the IIC in 2000. The FERC also previously approved
Southern Company’s code of conduct. The FERC order directs that the administrative law judge who
presided over a proceeding involving approval of PPAs between Southern Power and Georgia Power and
Savannah Electric be assigned to preside over the hearing in this proceeding and that the testimony
and exhibits presented in that proceeding be preserved to the extent appropriate. Hearings are
scheduled for September 2006. Effective July 19, 2005, revenues from transactions under the IIC
involving any Southern Company subsidiaries will be subject to refund to the extent the FERC orders
any changes to the IIC.

Southern Company and its subsidiaries believe that there is no meritorious basis for this
proceeding and are vigorously defending themselves in this matter. However, the final outcome of
this matter, including any remedies to be applied in the event of an adverse ruling in this
proceeding, cannot now be determined.

Generation Interconnection Agreements

In July 2003, the FERC issued its final rule on the standardization of generation
interconnection agreements and procedures (Order 2003). Order 2003 shifts much of the financial
burden of new transmission investment from the generator to the transmission provider. The FERC
has indicated that Order 2003, which was effective January 20, 2004, is to be applied
prospectively to interconnection agreements. Subsidiaries of Tenaska, Inc., as counterparties
to three previously executed interconnection agreements with subsidiaries of Southern Company,
have filed complaints at the FERC requesting that the FERC modify the agreements and that
Southern Company refund a total of $19 million previously paid for interconnection facilities,
with interest. These proceedings are still pending at the FERC. Southern Company has also
received similar requests from

II-60


NOTES
(continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

other entities totaling approximately $14 million. Southern
Company has opposed all such requests. The impact of Order 2003 and its subsequent rehearings
on Southern Company and the final results of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Race Discrimination Litigation

In July 2000, a lawsuit alleging race discrimination was filed by three Georgia Power employees
against Georgia Power, Southern Company, and SCS in the Superior Court of Fulton County,
Georgia. Shortly thereafter, the lawsuit was removed to the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Georgia and amended to add four more plaintiffs. The lawsuit also raised
claims on behalf of a purported class. The plaintiffs sought compensatory and punitive damages
in an unspecified amount, as well as injunctive relief.

Following various court decisions in favor of the defendants and subsequent appeals by the
plaintiffs, on July 13, 2005, the plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the U.S.
Supreme Court. On October 17, 2005, the petition was denied. This matter is now concluded.

Right of Way Litigation

Southern Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including Georgia Power, Gulf Power,
Mississippi Power, and Southern Telecom, have been named as defendants in numerous lawsuits
brought by landowners since 2001. The plaintiffs’ lawsuits claim that defendants may not use,
or sublease to third parties, some or all of the fiber optic communications lines on the rights
of way that cross the plaintiffs’ properties and that such actions exceed the easements or other
property rights held by defendants. The plaintiffs assert claims for, among other things,
trespass and unjust enrichment and seek compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief.
Management of Southern Company and its subsidiaries believe that they have complied with
applicable laws and that the plaintiffs’ claims are without merit.

In November 2003, the Second Circuit Court in Gadsden County, Florida, ruled in favor of
the plaintiffs on their motion for partial summary judgment concerning liability in one such
lawsuit brought by landowners regarding the installation and use of fiber optic cable over Gulf
Power rights of way located on the landowners’ property. Subsequently, the plaintiffs sought to
amend their complaint and asked the court to enter a final declaratory judgment and to enter an
order enjoining Gulf Power from allowing expanded general telecommunications use of the fiber
optic cables that are the subject of this litigation. In January 2005, the trial court granted
in part the plaintiffs’ motion to amend their complaint and denied the requested declaratory and
injunctive relief. In November 2005, the trial court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and
against Gulf Power on their respective motions for partial summary judgment. In that same
order, the trial court also denied Gulf Power’s motion to dismiss certain claims. The court’s
ruling allowed for an immediate appeal to the Florida First District Court of Appeal, which Gulf
Power filed on December 20, 2005. If the appeal is not successful, damages will be decided at a
future trial.

In January 2005, the Superior Court of Decatur County, Georgia, granted partial summary
judgment in another such lawsuit brought by landowners against Georgia Power on the plaintiffs’
declaratory judgment claim that the easements do not permit general telecommunications use. The
court also dismissed Southern Telecom from this case. The question of damages and other
liability or remedies issues with respect to these actions, if any, will be decided at future
trials. Georgia Power appealed this ruling to the Georgia Court of Appeals. The Georgia Court
of Appeals reversed, in part, the court’s order and remanded the case to the trial court for the
determination of further issues. After the Court of Appeals’ decision, the plaintiffs filed a
motion for reconsideration, which was denied, and a petition for certiorari to the Georgia
Supreme Court, which is currently pending. In the event of an adverse verdict in either case,
Gulf Power or Georgia Power, as applicable, could appeal the issues of both liability and
damages or other relief granted.

To date, Mississippi Power has entered into agreements with plaintiffs in approximately 90
percent of the actions pending against Mississippi Power to clarify its easement rights in the
State of Mississippi. These agreements have been approved by the Circuit Courts of Harrison
County and Jasper County, Mississippi (First Judicial Circuit), and dismissals of the related
cases are in progress. These agreements have not resulted in any material effects on
Mississippi Power’s financial statements.

In addition, in late 2001, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company, including Alabama
Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power,

II-61


NOTES
(continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

Savannah Electric, and Southern Telecom,
were named as defendants in a lawsuit brought by a telecommunications company that uses certain
of the defendants’ rights of way. This lawsuit alleges, among other things, that the defendants
are contractually obligated to indemnify, defend, and hold
harmless the telecommunications company from any liability that may be assessed against it in
pending and future right of way litigation. The Company believes that the plaintiff’s claims
are without merit. In the fall of 2004, the trial court stayed the case until resolution of the
underlying landowner litigation discussed above. In January 2005, the Georgia Court of Appeals
dismissed the telecommunications company’s appeal of the trial court’s order for lack of
jurisdiction. An adverse outcome in this matter, combined with an adverse outcome against the
telecommunications company in one or more of the right of way lawsuits, could result in
substantial judgments; however, the final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.

Income Tax Matters

Southern Company undergoes audits by the IRS for each of its tax years. The IRS has completed
its audits of Southern Company’s consolidated federal income tax returns for all years through
2001. Southern Company participates in four international leveraged lease transactions and
receives federal income tax deductions for depreciation and amortization, as well as interest on
related debt. The IRS proposed to disallow the tax losses for one of these leases (a
lease-in-lease-out, or LILO) in connection with its audit of 1996 through 2001. In October
2004, Southern Company submitted the issue to the IRS appeals division and in February 2005
reached a negotiated settlement with the IRS which is subject to final approval. Under current
accounting rules, the settlement of this transaction will have no material impact on Southern
Company’s financial statements

In connection with its audit of 2000 and 2001, the IRS also challenged Southern Company’s
deductions related to three other international lease (sale-in-lease-out, or SILO) transactions.
If the IRS is ultimately successful in disallowing the tax deductions related to these three
transactions, beginning with the 2000 tax year, Southern Company would be subject to additional
interest charges of up to $34 million. The IRS has also proposed a penalty of approximately $16
million. Southern Company believes these transactions are valid leases for U.S. tax purposes,
the related deductions are allowable, and the assessment of a penalty is inappropriate.
Southern Company is continuing to pursue resolution of these matters with the IRS and expects to
litigate the issue if necessary. Although the payment of the tax liability, exclusive of
interest, would not affect Southern Company’s results of operations under current accounting
standards, it could have a material impact on cash flow. Through December 31, 2005, Southern
Company has claimed $241 million in tax benefits related to these SILO transactions challenged
by the IRS. See Note 1 under “Leveraged Leases” for additional information.

Alabama Power Retail Regulatory Matters

Alabama Power operates under a Rate Stabilization and Equalization plan (Rate RSE) approved by
the Alabama PSC. Rate RSE provides for periodic annual adjustments based upon Alabama Power’s
earned return on end-of-period retail common equity; however, in October 2005, Alabama Power and
the Alabama PSC agreed to a moratorium on any rate increase under Rate RSE until January 2007.
In October 2005, the Alabama PSC approved a revision to Rate RSE requested by Alabama Power.
Effective January 2007, Rate RSE adjustments will be based on forward-looking information for
the applicable upcoming calendar year. Rate adjustments for any two-year period, when averaged
together, cannot exceed 4 percent per year and any annual adjustment is limited to 5 percent.
Rates will remain unchanged if the return on equity (ROE) is between 13 percent and 14.5
percent. If Alabama Power’s actual retail ROE is above the allowed equity return range,
customer refunds will be required; however, there is no provision for additional customer
billings should the actual retail return on common equity fall below the allowed equity return
range. Alabama Power will make its initial submission of projected data for calendar year 2007
by December 1, 2006. The ratemaking procedures will remain in effect until the Alabama PSC
votes to modify or discontinue them.

The Alabama PSC has also approved a rate mechanism that provides for adjustments to
recognize the placing of new generating facilities in retail service and for the recovery of
retail costs associated with certificated purchased power agreements (Rate CNP).

To recover certificated purchased power costs under Rate CNP, increases of 2.6 percent or
$79 million annually and 0.8 percent or $25 million annually were effective July 2003 and June
2004,

II-62


NOTES
(continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

respectively. In April 2005, an annual true-up adjustment to Rate CNP decreased retail
rates by approximately 0.5 percent or $18.5 million annually.

In October 2004, the Alabama PSC approved a request by Alabama Power to amend Rate CNP to
also provide for the recovery of retail costs associated with environmental laws and
regulations, effective in January 2005. The rate mechanism began operation in January 2005 and
provides for the recovery of these costs pursuant to a factor that will be calculated annually.
Environmental costs to be recovered include operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation,
and a return on invested capital. Retail rates increased approximately 1 percent in both
January 2005 and 2006.

Alabama Power fuel costs are recovered under Rate ECR (Energy Cost Recovery), which
provides for the addition of a fuel and energy cost factor to base rates. In December 2005, the
Alabama PSC approved an increase that allows for the recovery of approximately $227 million in
existing under recovered fuel costs over a two-year period. Based on the order, a portion of
the under recovered regulatory clause revenues was reclassified from current assets to deferred
charges and other assets in the balance sheet.

Georgia Power Retail Regulatory Matters

In December 2004, the Georgia PSC approved a three-year retail rate plan ending December 31,
2007 (2004 Retail Rate Plan) for Georgia Power. Under the terms of the 2004 Retail Rate Plan,
Georgia Power’s earnings are evaluated against a retail ROE range of 10.25 percent to 12.25
percent. Two-thirds of any earnings above 12.25 percent will be applied to rate refunds, with
the remaining one-third retained by Georgia Power. Retail rates and customer fees were
increased by approximately $203 million effective January 1, 2005 to cover the higher costs of
purchased power, operating and maintenance expenses, environmental compliance, and continued
investment in new generation, transmission, and distribution facilities to support growth and
ensure reliability. In 2005, Georgia Power recorded $5.3 million in revenue subject to refund
related to earnings in excess of a 12.25 percent retail ROE.

Georgia Power is required to file a general rate case by July 1, 2007 in response to which
the Georgia PSC would be expected to determine whether the rate order should be continued,
modified, or discontinued. Until then, Georgia Power may not file for a general base rate
increase unless its projected retail return on common equity falls below 10.25 percent.

In December 2001, the Georgia PSC approved a three-year retail rate plan (2001 Retail Rate
Plan) for Georgia Power ending December 31, 2004. Under the terms of the 2001 Retail Rate Plan,
earnings were evaluated against a retail return on common equity range of 10 percent to 12.95
percent. Georgia Power’s earnings in all three years were within the common equity range.
Under the 2001 Retail Rate Plan, Georgia Power amortized a regulatory liability of $333 million,
related to previously recorded accelerated amortization expenses, equally over three years
beginning in 2002. Also, the 2001 Retail Rate Plan required Georgia Power to recognize capacity
and operating and maintenance costs related to certified purchase power contracts evenly into
rates over a three-year period ending December 31, 2004.

On May 17, 2005, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power’s request to increase customer fuel
rates by approximately 9.5 percent to recover under recovered fuel costs of approximately $508
million existing as of May 31, 2005 over a four-year period that began June 1, 2005. Based on
the order, a portion of the under recovered regulatory clause revenues was reclassified from
current assets to deferred charges and other assets in the balance sheet.

Under recovered fuel amounts for the period subsequent to June 1, 2005 totaled $327.5
million through December 31, 2005. The Georgia PSC’s order instructs that such amounts be
reviewed semi-annually beginning February 2006. If the amount under or over recovered exceeds
$50 million at the evaluation date, Georgia Power will be required to file for a temporary fuel
rate change. In addition, Savannah Electric’s under recovered fuel costs totaled $77.7 million
at December 31, 2005. In accordance with a Georgia PSC order, Savannah Electric was scheduled
to file an additional request for a fuel cost recovery increase in January 2006. In connection
with the proposed merger, Georgia Power has agreed with a Georgia PSC staff recommendation to
forego the temporary fuel rate process, and Savannah Electric has postponed its scheduled
filing. Instead, Georgia Power and Savannah Electric will file a combined request in March 2006
to increase its fuel cost recovery rate

.

The case will seek approval of a fuel cost

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

recovery rate based upon future fuel cost
projections for the combined Georgia Power and Savannah Electric generating fleet as well as the
under recovered balances existing at June 30, 2006. The new fuel cost recovery rate would be
billed beginning in July 2006 to all Georgia Power customers, including the existing Savannah
Electric customers. Under recovered amounts as of the date of the merger will be paid by the appropriate customer
groups. For additional information regarding the pending merger, see “Merger of Georgia Power
and Savannah Electric” below.

In August 2005, the Georgia PSC initiated an investigation of Savannah Electric’s fuel
practices. In February 2006, an investigation of Georgia Power’s fuel practices was initiated.
Georgia Power and Savannah Electric are responding to data requests and cooperating in the
investigations. The final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.

Storm Damage Cost Recovery

Each retail operating company maintains a reserve to cover the cost of damages from major storms to
its transmission and distribution facilities and the cost of uninsured damages to its generation
facilities and other property. Following Hurricanes Ivan, Dennis, and Katrina in September 2004,
July 2005, and August 2005, respectively, each of the affected retail operating companies has been
authorized by its respective state PSC to defer the portion of the storm restoration costs incurred
that exceeded the balance in its storm damage reserve account. As of December 31, 2005, the deficit
balance in Southern Company’s storm damage reserve accounts totaled approximately $366 million, of
which approximately $70 million and $296 million, respectively, is included in the condensed
balance sheets herein under Other Current Assets and Other Regulatory Assets. Approximately $81
million of the deficit balances are being recovered through separate surcharges or rate riders
approved by the Florida and Alabama PSCs, as discussed further below. The recovery of the
remaining deferred costs is subject to the approval of the respective state PSC.

Hurricane Ivan caused significant damage to the service areas of both Gulf Power and Alabama
Power. In February and December 2005, Alabama Power requested and received Alabama PSC approval of
accounting orders that allowed Alabama Power to immediately return certain regulatory liabilities
to the retail customers. The orders also allowed Alabama Power to simultaneously recover from
customers accruals of approximately $48 million primarily to offset the costs of Hurricane Ivan and
restore a positive balance in the natural disaster reserve. The combined effect of these orders
had no impact on net income in 2005. In March 2005, the Florida PSC approved a Stipulation and
Settlement among Gulf Power, the Office of Public Counsel for the State of Florida, and the Florida
Industrial Power Users Group. The agreement allows Gulf Power to recover approximately $51.7
million in storm damage costs, plus interest and revenue taxes, from customers over a 24-month
period that began in April 2005. Gulf Power also agreed that it will not seek any additional
increase in its base rates and charges to become effective on or before March 1, 2007.

Hurricanes Dennis and Katrina caused significant damage within Southern Company’s service
area, including portions of the service areas of Alabama Power and Gulf Power and all of
Mississippi Power’s service area. Hurricane Dennis and Katrina restoration costs are currently
estimated to total approximately $506 million, of which approximately $287 million relates to
operation and maintenance expenditures. Approximately $60 million of these costs is expected to be
covered through external insurance. Restoration efforts following Hurricane Katrina are ongoing
for approximately 19,200 Mississippi Power customers who remain unable to receive power, as well as
to make permanent improvements in areas where temporary emergency repairs were necessary. In
addition, business and governmental authorities are still reviewing redevelopment plans for
portions of the most severely damaged areas along the Mississippi shoreline. Until such plans are
complete, Mississippi Power cannot determine the related electric power needs or associated cost
estimates. The ultimate impact of redevelopment plans in these areas on the cost estimates cannot
now be determined.

In December 2005, the Alabama PSC approved Alabama Power’s request for a separate rate rider
to recover its $51 million of deferred Hurricane Dennis and Katrina operation and maintenance costs
over a two-year period and to replenish the reserve to a target balance of $75 million over a
five-year period.

Prior to Hurricane Katrina, Mississippi Power had a balance of approximately $3 million in its
property reserve. In October 2005, the Mississippi PSC issued an Interim Accounting Order
requiring Mississippi Power to recognize a regulatory asset in an amount

II-64


NOTES
(continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

equal to the retail
portion of the recorded Hurricane Katrina restoration costs, including both operation and
maintenance expenditures and capital additions. Through December 31, 2005, these incremental costs
totaled $210 million, net of insurance proceeds of $68
million. These costs include approximately $133 million of operation and maintenance
expenditures and approximately $49 million of capital
additions, of which approximately $100
million are reflected as investing activities for purposes of the statement of cash flows. In
December 2005, Mississippi Power filed with the Mississippi PSC a detailed review of all Hurricane
Katrina restoration costs as required in the Interim Accounting Order. Mississippi Power is
currently working with the Mississippi PSC to establish a method to recover all such prudently
incurred costs upon resolution of uncertainties related to federal grant assistance and proposed
state legislation to allow securitized financing. Also in December 2005, Mississippi Power
submitted its annual Performance Evaluation Plan (PEP) filing to the Mississippi PSC. Ordinarily,
PEP limits annual rate increases to 4 percent; however, Mississippi Power has requested that the
Mississippi PSC approve a temporary change to allow them to exceed this cap as a result of the
ongoing effects of Hurricane Katrina. Mississippi Power has requested a 5 percent or $32 million
retail base rate increase to become effective in April 2006 if approved. Hearings are scheduled
for March 2, 2006.

In 2005, the Florida Legislature authorized securitized financing for hurricane costs. On
February 22, 2006, Gulf Power filed a petition with the Florida PSC under this legislative
authority requesting permission to issue $87.2 million in securitized storm-recovery bonds. The
bonds would be repaid over 8 years from revenues to be received from storm-recovery charges
implemented under the securitization plan and billed to customers. If approved as proposed, the
plan would resolve Gulf Power’s remaining deferred costs, by refinancing, net of taxes, the
remaining balance of storm damage costs currently being recovered from customers related to
Hurricane Ivan and financing, net of taxes, restoration costs associated with Hurricanes Dennis and
Katrina of approximately $54 million. It would also replenish Gulf Power’s property damage reserve
with an additional $70 million. A decision on the plan is expected prior to the end of the second
quarter of 2006. The final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined; however, since Gulf
Power will recognize expenses equal to the revenues billed to customers, the securitization plan
would have no impact on net income, but would increase cash flow.

Plant Franklin Construction Project

Southern Power completed limited construction activities on Plant Franklin Unit 3 to preserve the
long-term viability of the project but has deferred final completion until the 2008-2011 period.
The length of the deferral period will depend on forecasted capacity needs and other wholesale
market opportunities. As of December 31, 2005, Southern Power’s investment in Unit 3 of Plant
Franklin was $172 million. The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Southern Company Gas Sale

On January 4, 2006, Southern Company completed the sale of substantially all the assets of Southern
Company Gas, its competitive retail natural gas marketing subsidiary, including natural gas
inventory, accounts receivable, and customer list, to Gas South, LLC, an affiliate of Cobb Electric
Membership Corporation. Southern Company Gas’ sale of such assets was pursuant to a Purchase and
Sale Agreement dated November 18, 2005 between Southern Company Gas and Gas South, for an aggregate
purchase price of approximately $127 million, subject to certain adjustments. This sale will have
no material impact on Southern Company’s net income for the quarter ending March 31, 2006. As a
result of the sale, Southern Company’s financial statements and related information reflect
Southern Company Gas as discontinued operations.

Merger of Georgia Power and Savannah Electric

On December 13, 2005, Georgia Power and Savannah Electric entered into a merger agreement, under
which Savannah Electric will merge into Georgia Power, with Georgia Power continuing as the
surviving corporation. At the effective date of the merger, each share of Georgia Power common
stock will remain issued and outstanding; the issued and outstanding shares of Savannah Electric
common stock, all of which are held by Southern Company, will be converted into the right to
receive 1,500,000 shares of Georgia Power common stock; and each share of Savannah Electric
preferred stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the merger will be converted into
the right to receive one share of a new series of Georgia Power Class A Preferred Stock. The
merger must be approved by the preferred shareholders of Savannah Electric, and is subject to
the receipt of regulatory approvals from the FERC, Georgia PSC, and Federal Communications
Commission. Pending regulatory approvals, the merger is expected to occur by July

4. JOINT OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS

Alabama Power owns an undivided interest in units 1 and 2 of Plant Miller and related facilities
jointly with Alabama Electric Cooperative, Inc.

Georgia Power owns undivided interests in Plants Vogtle, Hatch, Scherer, and Wansley in
varying amounts jointly with Oglethorpe Power Corporation (OPC), the Municipal Electric
Authority of Georgia, the city of Dalton, Georgia, Florida Power & Light Company, and
Jacksonville Electric Authority. In addition, Georgia Power has joint ownership agreements with
OPC for the Rocky Mountain facilities and with Florida Power Corporation for a combustion
turbine unit at Intercession City, Florida.

Southern Power owns an undivided interest in Stanton Unit A and related facilities jointly
with the Orlando Utilities Commission, Kissimmee Utility Authority, and Florida Municipal Power
Agency.

At December 31, 2005, Alabama Power’s, Georgia Power’s, and Southern Power’s ownership and
investment (exclusive of nuclear fuel) in jointly owned facilities with the above entities were

At December 31, 2005, the portion of total construction work in progress related to Plants
Miller, Scherer, and Wansley was $4.4 million, $0.5 million, and $8.3 million, respectively,
primarily for environmental projects.

Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Southern Power have contracted to operate and maintain
the jointly owned facilities, except for Rocky Mountain and Intercession City, as agents for
their respective co-owners. The companies’ proportionate share of their plant operating
expenses is included in the corresponding operating expenses in the statements of income.

5. INCOME TAXES

Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and combined state income tax
returns for the States of Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi. Under a joint consolidated income
tax allocation agreement, each subsidiary’s current and deferred tax expense is computed on a
stand-alone basis. In accordance with IRS regulations, each company is jointly and severally
liable for the tax liability.

Mirant was included in the consolidated federal tax return through April 2, 2001. In
December 2004, the IRS concluded its audit for the tax years 2000 and 2001, and Southern Company
paid $39 million in additional tax and interest for issues related to Mirant tax items. Under
the terms of the separation agreements, Mirant agreed to indemnify Southern Company for
subsequent assessment of any additional taxes related to its transactions prior to the spin off.
However, as a result of Mirant’s bankruptcy, Southern Company sought reimbursement as an
unsecured creditor. For additional information, see Note 3 under “Mirant Matters — Mirant
Bankruptcy.”

At December 31, 2005, the tax-related regulatory assets and liabilities were $937 million
and $313 million, respectively. These assets are attributable to tax benefits flowed through to
customers in prior years and to taxes applicable to capitalized interest. These liabilities are
attributable to deferred taxes previously recognized at rates higher than the current enacted
tax law and to unamortized investment tax credits.

At December 31, 2005, Southern Company also had available State of Georgia net operating
loss carryforward deductions totaling $1.0 billion, which could result in net state income tax
benefits of $59 million, if utilized. These deductions will expire between 2006 and 2021.
During 2005, Southern Company utilized $11 million in available net operating losses, which
resulted in a $0.7 million state income tax benefit. Beginning in 2002, the State of Georgia
allowed the filing of a combined return, which should substantially reduce any additional net
operating loss carryforwards.

In accordance with regulatory requirements, deferred investment tax credits are amortized
over the lives of the related property with such amortization normally applied as a credit to
reduce depreciation in the statements of income. Credits amortized in this manner amounted to
$25 million in 2005, $27 million in 2004, and $29 million in 2003. At December 31, 2005, all
investment tax credits available to reduce federal income taxes payable had been utilized.

Mandatorily
Redeemable Preferred Securities/Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts

Southern Company and the retail operating companies have each formed certain wholly owned trust
subsidiaries for the purpose of issuing preferred securities. The proceeds of the related
equity investments and preferred security sales were loaned back to Southern Company and the
retail operating companies through the issuance of junior

II-67


NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

subordinated notes totaling $2.0 billion, which constitute substantially all assets of these
trusts and are reflected in the balance sheets as Long-term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts
(including Securities Due Within One Year). Southern Company and the retail operating companies
each consider that the mechanisms and obligations relating to the preferred securities issued
for its benefit, taken together, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by it of the
respective trusts’ payment obligations with respect to these securities. At December 31, 2005,
preferred securities of $1.9 billion were outstanding. Southern
Company guarantees $574 million of notes related to these securities issued on its behalf. Subsequent to year-end, this
amount has been reduced to $502 million through the redemption of outstanding securities. See
Note 1 under “Variable Interest Entities” for additional information on the accounting treatment
for these trusts and the related securities.

in 2008; $591 million in 2009, and $243 million in 2010.

Assets Subject to Lien

Each of Southern Company’s subsidiaries is organized as a legal entity, separate and apart from
Southern Company and its other subsidiaries. Alabama Power, Gulf Power, and Savannah Electric
have mortgages that secure first mortgage bonds they have issued and constitute a direct first
lien on substantially all of their respective fixed property and franchises. Mississippi Power
discharged its mortgage in June 2005, and the lien was removed. The Georgia Power lien was
removed in 2002. The remaining outstanding first mortgage bonds of Gulf Power and Savannah
Electric mature in 2006. There are no agreements or other arrangements among the subsidiary
companies under which the assets of one company have been pledged or otherwise made available to
satisfy obligations of Southern Company or any of its other subsidiaries.

Bank Credit Arrangements

At the beginning of 2006, unused credit arrangements with banks totaled $3.3 billion, of which
$810 million expires during 2006 and $2.5 billion expires during 2007 and beyond. The
following table outlines the credit arrangements by company:

Approximately $228 million of the credit facilities expiring in 2006 allow the execution of
term loans for an additional two-year period, and $311 million allow execution of one-year term
loans. Most of these agreements include stated borrowing rates.

All of the credit arrangements require payment of commitment fees based on the unused
portion of the commitments or the maintenance of compensating balances with the banks.
Commitment fees are one-eighth of 1 percent or less for Southern Company, the retail operating
companies, and Southern Power. Compensating balances are not legally restricted from
withdrawal. Included in the total $3.3 billion of unused credit arrangements is $2.3 billion of
syndicated credit arrangements that require the payment of agent fees.

Most of the credit arrangements with banks have covenants that limit debt levels to 65
percent of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these
definitions, debt excludes the long-term debt payable to affiliated trusts. At December 31,
2005, Southern Company, Southern Power, and the retail operating companies were each in

II-68


NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

compliance with their respective debt limit covenants.

In addition, the credit arrangements typically contain cross default provisions that would
be triggered if the borrower defaulted on other indebtedness above a specified threshold. The
cross default provisions are restricted only to the indebtedness, including any guarantee
obligations, of the company that has such credit arrangements. Southern Company and its
subsidiaries are currently in compliance with all such covenants. Borrowings under certain
retail operating companies’ unused credit arrangements totaling $10 million would be prohibited
if the borrower experiences a material adverse change, as defined in such arrangements.

A portion of the $3.3 billion unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity
support to the retail operating companies’ variable rate pollution control bonds. The amount of
variable rate pollution control bonds requiring liquidity support as of December 31, 2005 was
$720 million.

Southern Company, the retail operating companies, and Southern Power borrow primarily
through commercial paper programs that have the liquidity support of committed bank credit
arrangements. Southern Company and the retail operating companies may also borrow through
various other arrangements with banks and extendible commercial note programs. The amount of
commercial paper outstanding and included in notes payable in the balance sheets at December 31,
2005 and December 31, 2004 was $944 million and $377 million, respectively.

During 2005, the peak amount outstanding for short-term debt was $1.26 billion, and the
average amount outstanding was $738 million. The average annual interest rate on short-term debt
was 3.5 percent for 2005 and 1.3 percent for 2004 and 2003.

Financial Instruments

The retail operating companies and Southern Power enter into energy-related derivatives to hedge
exposures to electricity, gas, and other fuel price changes. However, due to cost-based rate
regulations, the retail operating companies have limited exposure to market volatility in
commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity. In addition, Southern Power’s exposure to
market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity is limited because its
long-term sales contracts shift substantially all fuel cost responsibility to the purchaser.
Each of the retail operating companies has implemented fuel-hedging programs at the instruction
of their respective state PSCs. Together with Southern Power, the retail operating companies
may enter into hedges of forward electricity sales. In addition, Southern Company Gas had
gas-hedging programs to substantially mitigate its exposure to price volatility for its gas
purchases.

At December 31, 2005, the fair value of derivative energy contracts was reflected in the
financial statements as follows:

Regulatory liabilities, net

Other comprehensive income

(0.3

)

Total fair value

$

100.5

The fair value gains or losses for hedges that are recoverable through the regulatory fuel
clauses are recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities and are recognized in earnings at the
same time the hedged items affect earnings. For Southern Power, the fair value gains or losses
for cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income and are reclassified into
earnings at the same time the hedged items affect earnings. For 2005, 2004, and 2003,
approximately $7 million, $(3) million, and $22 million, respectively, of pre-tax gains (losses)
were reclassified from other comprehensive income to fuel expense. For the year 2006, no
material amounts are expected to be reclassified from other comprehensive income to fuel
expense. There was no significant ineffectiveness recorded in earnings for any period
presented. Southern Company has energy-related hedges in place up to and including 2008.

Southern Company and certain subsidiaries also enter into derivatives to hedge exposure to
changes in interest rates. Derivatives related to fixed-rate securities are accounted for as
fair value hedges. Derivatives related to variable rate securities or forecasted transactions
are accounted for as cash flow hedges. As the derivatives employed as hedging instruments are
generally structured to match the critical terms of the hedged debt instruments, no material
ineffectiveness has been recorded in earnings.

At December 31, 2005, Southern Company had $2.8 billion notional amount of interest rate
swaps and options outstanding with net fair value gains of $31.7 million as follows:

For fair value hedges where the hedged item is an asset, liability, or firm
commitment, the changes in the fair value of the hedging derivatives are recorded in earnings
and are offset by the changes in the fair value of the hedged item.

The fair value gain or loss for cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income and
is reclassified into earnings at the same time the hedged items affect earnings. In 2005, 2004,
and 2003, the Company incurred losses of $19 million, $7 million, and $116 million, respectively,
upon termination of certain interest derivatives at the same time it issued debt. These losses
have been deferred in other comprehensive income and will be amortized to interest expense over the
life of the original interest derivative. For 2005, 2004, and 2003, approximately $10 million, $23
million, and $26 million, respectively, of pre-tax losses were reclassified from other
comprehensive income to interest expense. For 2006, pre-tax losses of approximately $2 million are
expected to be reclassified from other comprehensive income to interest expense.

7. COMMITMENTS

Construction Program

Southern Company is engaged in continuous construction programs, currently estimated to total
$2.8 billion in 2006, $3.6 billion in 2007, and $3.1 billion in 2008. These amounts include $63
million, $39 million, and $23 million in 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively, for construction
expenditures related to contractual purchase commitments for uranium and nuclear fuel
conversion, enrichment, and fabrication services included herein under “Fuel and Purchased Power
Commitments.” The construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual
construction costs may vary from the above estimates because of numerous factors. These factors
include: changes in business conditions; acquisition of additional generating assets; revised
load growth estimates; changes in environmental regulations; changes in existing nuclear plants
to meet new regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules and regulations; increasing costs of
labor, equipment, and materials; and cost of capital. At December 31, 2005, significant
purchase commitments were outstanding in connection with the ongoing construction program, which
includes capital improvements to generation, transmission, and distribution facilities,
including those to meet environmental standards.

Long-Term Service Agreements

The retail operating companies and Southern Power have entered into several Long-Term Service
Agreements (LTSAs) with General Electric (GE) for the purpose of securing maintenance support
for the combined cycle and combustion turbine generating facilities owned by the subsidiaries.
The LTSAs provide that GE will perform all planned inspections on the covered equipment, which
includes the cost of all labor and materials. GE is also obligated to cover the costs of
unplanned maintenance on the covered equipment subject to a limit specified in each contract.

In general, except for Southern Power’s Plant Dahlberg, these LTSAs are in effect through
two major inspection cycles per unit. The Dahlberg agreement is in effect through the first
major inspection of each unit. Scheduled payments to GE are made at various intervals based on
actual

II-70


NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

operating hours of the respective units. Total payments to GE under these agreements for
facilities
owned are currently estimated at $1.8 billion over the remaining life of the agreements, which
may range up to 30 years. However, the LTSAs contain various cancellation provisions at the
option of the purchasers.

Georgia Power has also entered into an LTSA with GE through 2014 for $14.9 million worth of
neutron monitoring system parts and electronics at Plant Hatch. Total remaining payments to GE
under this agreement are currently estimated at $13.1 million. The contract contains
cancellation provisions at the option of Georgia Power.

Payments made to GE prior to the performance of any work are recorded as a prepayment in
the balance sheets. All work performed by GE is capitalized or charged to expense (net of any
joint owner billings), as appropriate based on the nature of the work.

Fuel and Purchased Power Commitments

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of the generating plants, Southern Company has
entered into various long-term commitments for the procurement of fossil and nuclear fuel. In
most cases, these contracts contain provisions for price escalations, minimum purchase levels,
and other financial commitments. Coal commitments include forward contract purchases for sulfur
dioxide emission allowances. Natural gas purchase commitments contain given volumes with prices
based on various indices at the time of delivery. Amounts included in the chart below represent
estimates based on New York Mercantile Exchange future prices at December 31, 2005. Also,
Southern Company has entered into various long-term commitments for the purchase of electricity.
Total estimated minimum long-term obligations at December 31, 2005 were as follows:

Operating Leases

In May 2001, Mississippi Power began the initial 10-year term of a lease agreement for a
combined cycle generating facility built at Plant Daniel for approximately $370 million. In
2003, the generating facility was acquired by Juniper Capital L.P. (Juniper), whose partners are
unaffiliated with Mississippi Power. Simultaneously, Juniper entered into a restructured lease
agreement with Mississippi Power. In 2003, approximately $11 million in lease termination costs
were also included in operation expenses. Juniper has also entered into leases with other
parties unrelated to Mississippi Power. The assets leased by Mississippi Power comprise less
than 50 percent of Juniper’s assets. Mississippi Power is not required to consolidate the
leased assets and related liabilities, and the lease with Juniper is considered an operating
lease. The initial lease term ends in 2011, and the lease includes a purchase and renewal
option based on the cost of the facility at the inception of the lease. Mississippi Power is
required to amortize approximately 4 percent of the initial acquisition cost over the initial
lease term. Eighteen months prior to the end of the initial lease, Mississippi Power may elect
to renew for 10 years.
If the lease is renewed, the agreement calls for Mississippi Power to amortize an additional 17
percent of the initial completion cost over the renewal period. Upon termination of the lease,
at Mississippi Power’s option, it may either exercise its purchase option or the facility can be
sold to a third party.

The lease provides for a residual value guarantee, approximately 73 percent of the
acquisition cost, by Mississippi Power that is due upon termination of the lease in the event
that Mississippi Power does not renew the lease or purchase the assets and that the fair market
value is less than the unamortized cost of the asset. A liability of approximately $11 million
for the fair market value of this residual value guarantee is included in the balance sheet as
of December 31, 2005.

Southern Company also has other operating lease agreements with various terms and expiration
dates. Total operating lease expenses were $150 million, $156 million, and $172 million for 2005,
2004, and 2003, respectively. Southern Company includes any step

II-71


NOTES (continued)

rents, escalations, and lease concessions in its computation of minimum lease payments, which are
recognized on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease term. At December 31, 2005, estimated
minimum lease payments for noncancelable operating leases were as follows:

For the retail operating companies, the rail car lease expenses are recoverable through
fuel cost recovery provisions. In addition to the above rental commitments, Alabama Power and
Georgia Power have obligations upon expiration of certain leases with respect to the residual
value of the leased property. These leases expire in 2006, 2009, and 2011, and the maximum
obligations are $66 million, $20 million, and $68 million, respectively. At the termination of
the leases, the lessee may either exercise its purchase option, or the property can be sold to a
third party. Alabama Power and Georgia Power expect that the fair market value of the leased
property would substantially reduce or eliminate the payments under the residual value
obligations.

Guarantees

Prior to the spin-off, Southern Company made separate guarantees to certain counterparties
regarding performance of contractual commitments by Mirant’s trading and marketing subsidiaries.
The total notional amount of guarantees outstanding at December 31, 2005 is less than $20
million, all of which will expire by 2009.

Southern Company has executed a keep-well agreement with a subsidiary of Southern Holdings
to make capital contributions in the event of any shortfall in payments due under a
participation agreement with an entity in which the subsidiary holds a 30 percent investment.
The maximum aggregate amount of Southern Company’s liability under this keep-well agreement is
$50 million.

As discussed earlier in this Note under “Operating Leases,” Alabama Power, Georgia Power,
and Mississippi Power have entered into certain residual value guarantees.

8. COMMON STOCK

Stock Issued

Southern Company raised $213 million (10 million shares) in 2005 and $124 million (7 million
shares) in 2004 from the issuance of new common shares under the Company’s various stock plans.

Stock Repurchased

During 2005, in a program designed primarily to offset the issuances discussed above, Southern
Company repurchased 10 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $352 million. The
repurchase program was discontinued in early January 2006.

Shares Reserved

At December 31, 2005, a total of 64.9 million shares was reserved for issuance pursuant to the
Southern Investment Plan, the Employee Savings Plan, the Outside Directors Stock Plan, and the
Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (stock option plan).

Stock Option Plan

Southern Company provides non-qualified stock options to a large segment of its employees
ranging from line management to executives. As of December 31, 2005, 6,329 current and former
employees participated in the stock option plan. The maximum number of shares of common stock
that may be issued under this plan may not exceed 55 million. The prices of options granted to
date have been at the fair market value of the shares on the dates of grant. Options granted to
date become exercisable pro rata over a maximum period of three

years from the date of grant. Options outstanding will expire no later than 10 years after the
date of grant, unless terminated earlier by the Southern Company Board of Directors in
accordance with the stock option plan. Activity from 2003 to 2005 for the stock option plan is
summarized below:

Diluted Earnings Per Share

For Southern Company, the only difference in computing basic and diluted earnings per share is
attributable to outstanding options under the stock option plan. The effect of the stock
options was determined using the treasury stock method. Shares used to compute diluted earnings
per share are as follows:

Common Stock Dividend Restrictions

The income of Southern Company is derived primarily from equity in earnings of its subsidiaries.
At December 31, 2005, consolidated retained earnings included $4.5 billion of undistributed
retained earnings of the subsidiaries. Of this amount, $68 million was restricted against the
payment of cash dividends on common stock by Savannah Electric under terms of its bond
indenture. Southern Power’s credit facility also contains potential limitations on the payment
of common stock dividends; as of December 31, 2005, Southern Power was in compliance with all
such requirements.

9. NUCLEAR INSURANCE

Under the Price-Anderson Amendment Act (Act), Alabama Power and Georgia Power maintain agreements
of indemnity with the NRC that, together with private insurance, cover third-party liability
arising from any nuclear incident occurring at the companies’ nuclear power plants. The Act
provides funds up to $10.76 billion for public liability claims that could arise from a single
nuclear incident. Each nuclear plant is insured against this liability to a maximum of $300
million by American Nuclear Insurers (ANI), with the remaining coverage provided by a mandatory
program of deferred premiums that could be assessed, after a nuclear incident, against all owners
of nuclear reactors. A company could be assessed up to $101 million per incident for each licensed
reactor it operates but not more than an aggregate of $15 million per incident to be paid in a
calendar year for each reactor. Such maximum assessment, excluding any applicable state premium
taxes, for Alabama Power and Georgia Power, based on its ownership and buyback interests, is $201
million and $203 million, respectively, per incident, but not more than an aggregate of $30 million
per company to be paid for each incident in any one year.

Alabama Power and Georgia Power are members of Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), a
mutual insurer established to provide property damage insurance in an amount up to $500 million
for members’ nuclear generating facilities.

Additionally, both companies have policies that currently provide decontamination, excess
property insurance, and premature decommissioning coverage up to $2.25 billion for losses in
excess of the $500 million primary coverage. This excess insurance is also provided by NEIL.

NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

NEIL also covers the additional costs that would be incurred in obtaining replacement power
during a prolonged accidental outage at a member’s nuclear plant. Members can purchase this
coverage, subject to a deductible waiting period of up to 26 weeks, with a maximum per occurrence
per unit limit of $490 million. After the deductible period, weekly indemnity payments would be
received until either the unit is operational or until the limit is exhausted in approximately
three years. Alabama Power and Georgia Power each purchase the maximum limit allowed by NEIL,
subject to ownership limitations. Each facility has elected a 12-week waiting period.

Under each of the NEIL policies, members are subject to assessments if losses each year
exceed the accumulated funds available to the insurer under that policy. The current maximum
annual assessments for Alabama Power and Georgia Power under the NEIL policies would be $41
million and $48 million, respectively.

Following the terrorist attacks of September 2001, both ANI and NEIL confirmed that terrorist
acts against commercial nuclear power plants would, subject to the normal policy limits, be covered
under their insurance. Both companies, however, revised their policy terms on a prospective basis
to include an industry aggregate for all “non-certified” terrorist acts, i.e., acts that are not
certified acts of terrorism pursuant to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, which was renewed
in 2005. The aggregate for all NEIL policies, which applies to non-certified property claims
stemming from terrorism within a 12-month duration, is $3.24 billion plus any amounts available
through reinsurance or indemnity from an outside source. The non-certified ANI nuclear liability
cap is a $300 million shared industry aggregate during the normal ANI policy period.

For all on-site property damage insurance policies for commercial nuclear power plants, the
NRC requires that the proceeds of such policies shall be dedicated first for the sole purpose of
placing the reactor in a safe and stable condition after an accident. Any remaining proceeds
are to be applied next toward the costs of decontamination and debris removal operations ordered
by the NRC, and any further remaining proceeds are to be paid either to the company or to its
bond trustees as may be appropriate under the policies and applicable trust indentures.

All retrospective assessments, whether generated for liability, property, or replacement
power, may be subject to applicable state premium taxes.

10. SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION

Southern Company’s reportable business segment is the sale of electricity in the Southeast by
the five retail operating companies and Southern Power. Net income and total assets for
discontinued operations are included in the reconciling eliminations column. The “All Other”
column includes parent Southern Company, which does not allocate operating expenses to business
segments. Also, this category includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate
disclosure. These segments include investments in synthetic fuels and leveraged lease projects,
telecommunications, and energy-related services. Southern Power’s revenues from sales to the
retail operating companies were $557 million, $425 million, and $313 million in 2005, 2004, and
2003, respectively. In addition, see Note 1 under “Related Party Transactions” for information
regarding revenues from services for synthetic fuel production that are included in the cost of
fuel purchased by Alabama Power and Georgia Power. All other intersegment revenues are not
material. Financial data for business segments and products and services are as follows:

ALABAMA POWER COMPANY

FINANCIAL SECTION

II-79


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Alabama Power Company

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements of capitalization of Alabama Power
Company (the “Company”) (a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company) as of December 31, 2005 and
2004, and the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder’s equity, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of
its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express
no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements (pages II-100 to II-127) present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Alabama Power Company at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Alabama Power Company 2005 Annual Report

OVERVIEW

Business Activities

Alabama Power Company (the Company) operates as a vertically integrated utility providing
electricity to retail customers within its traditional service area located within the State of
Alabama and to wholesale customers in the Southeast.

Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Company’s primary business
of selling electricity. These factors include the ability to maintain a stable regulatory
environment, to achieve energy sales growth while containing costs, and to recover rising costs.
These costs include those related to growing demand, increasingly stringent environmental
standards, fuel prices, and restoration following major storms.

On July 10, 2005 and August 29, 2005, Hurricanes Dennis and Katrina, respectively, hit the
coast of Alabama and continued north through the state, causing significant damage in parts of
the Company’s service territory including the Company’s distribution and transmission
facilities. Approximately 241,000 and 637,000, respectively, of the Company’s 1.4 million
customers were without electrical service immediately after Hurricanes Dennis and Katrina.

In 2005, the Company successfully completed a retail rate proceeding with the Alabama Public
Service Commission (PSC) to recover the costs associated with these storms and to replenish the
Company’s natural disaster reserve. In other actions, the Alabama PSC also approved a higher fuel
recovery rate and amended the Company’s Rate Stabilization and Equalization Plan (Rate RSE) to use
forward-looking test periods. These regulatory actions are expected to assist the Company’s
continued focus on providing reliable electrical service to customers while maintaining a stable
financial position.

Key Performance Indicators

In striving to maximize shareholder value while providing cost effective energy to customers,
the Company continues to focus on several key indicators. These indicators include customer
satisfaction, plant availability, system reliability, and net income. The Company’s financial
success is directly tied to the satisfaction of its customers. Key elements of ensuring
customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high reliability,
and competitive prices. Management uses customer satisfaction surveys and reliability indicators to evaluate the
Company’s results.

Peak season equivalent forced outage rate (Peak Season EFOR) is an indicator of fossil/hydro
plant availability and efficient generation fleet operations during the months when generation
needs are greatest. The rate is calculated by dividing the number of hours of forced outages by
total generation hours. Peak Season EFOR performance excludes the impact of hurricanes and
certain outage events caused by manufacturer defects. The 2005 Peak Season EFOR exceeded target
levels primarily due to equipment malfunctions at Plant Barry units 5 and 6, which resulted in
unexpected outages. Transmission and distribution system reliability performance is measured by
the frequency and duration of outages. Performance targets for reliability are set internally
based on historical performance, expected weather conditions, and expected capital expenditures.
The 2005 performance was above target on these reliability measures. Net income is the primary
component of the Company’s contribution to Southern Company’s earnings per share goal. The
Company’s 2005 results compared with its targets for each of these indicators are reflected in the
following chart.

See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for additional information on the Company’s financial
performance. The strong financial performance achieved in 2005 reflects the focus that management
places on these indicators, as well as the commitment shown by the Company’s employees in achieving
or exceeding management’s expectations.

Earnings

The Company’s financial performance remained strong in 2005 despite the challenges of major
hurricane restorations and rising fuel costs. The Company’s net income after dividends on
preferred stock of $508 million in 2005 increased $27 million (5.6 percent) over the prior year.
This improvement is primarily due to retail and wholesale revenue growth, increases in transmission
revenues, partially offset by higher non-fuel operating expenses.

II-81


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2005 Annual Report

The Company’s 2004 net income after dividends on preferred stock was $481 million,
representing an $8 million (1.8 percent) increase from the prior year. This improvement was
primarily due to retail sales growth, increases in other revenues, and lower interest expense,
partially offset by higher non-fuel operating expenses.

The Company’s 2003 net income after dividends on preferred stock was $473 million,
representing a $12 million (2.5 percent) increase from the prior year. This improvement was due
primarily to higher retail sales, higher sales for resale, increases in customer fees revenues, and
lower interest expense, partially offset by higher non-fuel operating expenses.

The ROE for 2005 was 13.72 percent compared to 13.53 percent in 2004 and 13.75 percent in
2003.

Retail revenues in 2005 were $3.6 billion. Revenues increased $328 million (10.0 percent) in
2005, $242 million (7.9 percent) in 2004, and $100 million (3.4 percent) in 2003. These increases
were primarily due to increased fuel revenue and retail base rate increases of 0.5 percent in April
2005, 1.0 percent in January 2005, 0.8 percent in July 2004, and 2.6 percent in July 2003. See
FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “PSC Matters” herein and Note 3 to the financial statements under
“Retail Regulatory Matters” for additional information.

Fuel rates billed to customers are designed to fully recover fluctuating fuel and purchased
power costs over a period of time. Fuel revenues generally have no effect on net income because
they represent the recording of revenues to offset fuel and purchased power expenses. See FUTURE
EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “PSC Matters – Retail Fuel Cost Recovery” herein and Note 3 to the financial
statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters – Fuel Cost Recovery” for additional information.

Sales for resale to non-affiliates are predominantly unit power sales under long-term
contracts to Florida utilities. Revenues from unit power sales contracts have both capacity and
energy components. Capacity revenues reflect the recovery of fixed costs and a return on
investment under the contracts. Energy is generally sold at variable cost. These capacity and
energy components of the unit power contracts were as follows:

Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in sales for resale to non-affiliates.
These opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above the
Company’s variable cost to produce the energy. Revenues associated with other power sales to
non-affiliates were as follows:

Revenues from sales to affiliated companies within the Southern Company electric system, as
well as purchases of energy, will vary from year to year depending on demand and the availability
and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliated sales and purchases are made in
accordance with the Intercompany Interchange Contract (IIC) as approved by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC). In 2005, sales for resale revenues decreased $19.4 million primarily
due to a 20.7 percent decrease in kilowatt-hour sales to affiliates as a result of a decrease in
the availability of the Company’s generating resources due to an increase in customer demand within
the Company’s service territory. Sales for resale revenues increased $31.1 million in 2004 due to
increases in fuel-related expenses. Sales for resale revenues increased $89.1 million in 2003 due
to increased capacity payments received from affiliates. Excluding the capacity revenues, these
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since the energy is generally sold at
marginal cost and energy purchases are generally offset by energy revenues through the Company’s
energy cost recovery clause.

Other operating revenues in 2005 increased $35.0 million (23.2 percent) from 2004 due to an
increase of $20 million in revenues from gas-fueled co-generation steam facilities primarily as a
result of higher gas prices, and $7.7 million increase in transmission revenues and a $3.9 million
increase from rent from associated companies primarily related to leased transmission facilities.

Other operating revenues in 2004 increased $7.0 million (4.9 percent) from 2003 due to an
increase of $7.7 million in revenues from gas-fueled co-generation steam facilities — primarily as
a result of higher gas prices – and a $2.4 million increase in revenues from rent from electric
property offset by a $2.0 million decrease in transmission revenues.

Other operating revenues in 2003 increased $47 million (48.6 percent) from 2002 due to an
increase of $19.4 million in revenues from gas-fueled co-generation steam facilities — primarily
as a result of higher gas prices — and a $14.8 million increase in revenues from Alabama PSC
approved fees charged to customers for connection, reconnection, and collection when compared to
the same period in 2002.

Since co-generation steam revenues are generally offset by fuel expense, these revenues did
not have a significant impact on earnings.

Energy Sales

Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the volume of energy sold each year. Kilowatt-hour
(KWH) sales for 2005 and the percent change by year were as follows:

Retail energy sales in 2005 were 2.7 percent higher than 2004 despite interruptions during
Hurricanes Dennis and Katrina. Energy sales in the residential sector led the growth with a 4.1
percent increase in 2005 due primarily to increased demand. Commercial sales increased 1.7 percent
in 2005 primarily due to continued customer growth. Industrial sales increased 2.2 percent during the

II-83


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2005 Annual Report

year with chemical,
primary metals and automotive leading the growth in industrial energy consumption. In addition,
the paper sector chose to purchase rather than self-generate which contributed to increased sales.

Energy sales in the residential sector grew by 2.4 percent in 2004 primarily due to continued
customer growth and a return to normal summer temperatures. Commercial sales increased 2.8 percent
in 2004 primarily due to continued customer growth. Industrial sales rebounded 5.8 percent during
the year with primary metals, chemical, and paper sectors leading the growth.

In 2003, residential energy sales experienced a 2.5 percent decrease over the prior year and
total retail energy sales grew by 0.3 percent primarily as a result of milder-than-normal summer
temperatures compared to the previous year. Although retail sales to industrial customers
increased 2.3 percent in 2003 and 3.1 percent in 2002, overall sales to industrial customers
remained depressed due to the effect of sluggish economic conditions.

Assuming normal weather, sales to retail customers are projected to grow approximately 1.3
percent annually on average during 2006 through 2010.

Total Operating Expenses

In 2005 total operating expenses increased $419 million (13.0 percent) to $3.6 billion. This
change from 2004 includes an increase in fuel expense of $271 million (22.8 percent) related to
higher natural gas and coal prices. In addition, purchased power expenses increased $45 million
(10.8 percent) primarily due to a 17.9 percent increase in purchased power prices. Maintenance
expenses increased $48 million primarily from transmission and distribution expense. These
increases are mainly a result of the Alabama PSC accounting order to recognize the previously
deferred costs of Hurricane Ivan storm damage restoration and to partially replenish a balance in
the natural disaster reserve. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory
Matters – Natural Disaster Cost Recovery” for additional information.

Total operating expenses in 2004 grew $270 million (9.2 percent) to $3.2 billion. This
increase over the previous year was primarily related to an increase in natural gas and coal
prices. In addition, purchased power expenses increased $98 million (31.0 percent) primarily due
to a 71.7 percent increase in energy purchased, while purchased power prices decreased by 1.9
percent. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $13 million (3.1 percent) primarily due
to an increase in utility plant in service.

The total operating expenses in 2003 were approximately $3.0 billion, an increase of $257
million (9.6 percent) over the previous year. This increase is mainly due to a $98 million
increase in fuel expense primarily related to an increase in the average cost of natural gas and
coal. In addition, purchased power expenses increased a total of $66 million, maintenance expense
increased $30 million primarily related to transmission and distribution overhead lines, and
depreciation and amortization expense increased $15 million.

Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses

Fuel costs constitute the single largest expense for the Company. The mix of fuel sources for
generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and
the availability of fossil and nuclear generating units and hydro generation. The amount and
sources of generation and the average cost of fuel per net KWH generated and the average cost of
purchased power were as follows:

percent increase in the average coal price. Fuel expense increased 11.1 percent in 2004 primarily
due to a 30.5 percent increase in the average price of natural gas and a 3.1 percent increase in
the average price of coal. Fuel expense increased 10.1 percent in 2003 due to a 58.3 percent
increase in the average price of natural gas and a 2.2 percent increase in the average price of
coal.

II-84


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Purchased power consists of purchases from affiliates in the Southern Company electric system
and non-affiliated companies. Purchased power transactions among the Company and its affiliates
will vary from period to period depending on demand and the availability and variable production
cost of generating resources at each company. Purchased power from non-affiliates increased $2.5
million (1.0 percent) in 2005. This was due to a 14.3 percent increase in purchased power prices
over the previous year. In 2004, purchased power from non-affiliates increased $75 million (68
percent) due to a 71.7 percent increase in energy purchased offset by a 1.9 percent decrease in
purchased power prices compared to 2003. In 2003, purchased power from non-affiliates increased
$20 million (22 percent) due to a 19.3 percent increase in price and a 9.5 percent increase in
energy purchased when compared to 2002.

A significant upward trend in the cost of coal and natural gas has emerged since 2003, and
volatility in these markets is expected to continue. Increased coal prices have been influenced by
a worldwide increase in demand as a result of rapid economic growth in China as well as by
increases in mining costs. Higher natural gas prices in the United States are the result of
increased demand and slightly lower gas supplies despite increased drilling activity. Natural gas
supply interruptions, such as those caused by the 2004 and 2005 hurricanes, result in an immediate
market response; however, the long-term impact of this price volatility may be reduced by imports
of natural gas and liquefied natural gas. Fuel expenses, including purchased power, are offset by
fuel revenues through the Company’s energy cost recovery clause and generally have no effect on net
income. The Company continuously monitors the under/over recovered balance and files for a revised
fuel rate when management deems appropriate. See Future Earnings Potential — “PSC Matters – Retail
Fuel Cost Recovery” herein and Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters
– Fuel Cost Recovery” for additional information.

Other Expenses

Depreciation and amortization expense increased 0.1 percent in 2005, 3.1 percent in 2004, and 3.6
percent in 2003. These increases reflect additions to property, plant, and equipment.

Allowance for equity funds used during construction (AFUDC) increased $4.1 million (25.6
percent) and $3.5 million (28.2 percent) in 2005 and 2004, respectively, primarily due to
increases in the amount of construction work in progress over the prior year. AFUDC also
increased $1.4 million (12.8 percent) in 2003 due to an increase in the applicable AFUDC rate.
See Note 1 to the financial statements under “AFUDC” for additional information.

In 2005 interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $3.8 million to $197.4 million
due to an increase in average debt outstanding during the year. This reversed the trend of the
past two years when refinancing activities resulted in $20.7 million (9.7 percent) and $11.4
million (5.1 percent) decreases in 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Effects of Inflation

The Company is subject to rate regulation that is based on the recovery of costs. When historical
costs are included, or when inflation exceeds projected costs used, in rate regulation, the effects
of inflation can create an economic loss since the recovery of costs could be in dollars that have
less purchasing power. The inflation rate has been relatively low in recent years and any adverse
effect of inflation on the Company has not been substantial. Any recognition of inflation by
regulatory authorities is reflected in the rate of return allowed in the Company’s approved
electric rates.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL

General

The Company operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electricity to retail customers
within its traditional service area located in the State of Alabama and to wholesale customers in
the Southeast. Prices for electricity provided by the Company to retail customers are set by the
Alabama PSC under cost-based regulatory principles. Prices for electricity relating to jointly
owned generating facilities, interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power
are set by the FERC. Retail rates and earnings are reviewed and may be adjusted periodically
within certain limitations. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES – “Application of Critical Accounting Policies
and Estimates – Electric Utility Regulation” herein and Note 3 to the financial statements under “FERC
Matters” and “Retail Regulatory Matters” for additional information about these and other regulatory matters.

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of future
earnings potential. The level of the Company’s future earnings depends on

II-85


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2005 Annual Report

numerous factors that
affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Company’s primary business of selling
electricity. These factors include the Company’s ability to maintain a stable regulatory
environment that continues to allow for the recovery of all prudently incurred costs. Future
earnings for the electricity business in the near term will depend, in part, upon growth in energy
sales, which is subject to a number of factors. These factors include weather, competition, new
energy contracts with neighboring utilities, energy conservation practiced by customers, the price
of electricity, the price elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic growth in the Company’s
service area.

Environmental Matters

New Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil action in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against the Company, alleging that the Company
had violated the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act and related state laws
with respect to coal-fired generating facilities at the Company’s Plants Miller, Barry, and Gorgas.
The EPA concurrently issued to the Company a notice of violation relating to these specific
facilities, as well as Plants Greene County and Gaston. In early 2000, the EPA filed a motion to
amend its complaint to add the violations alleged in its notice of violation. The civil action
requests penalties and injunctive relief, including an order requiring the installation of the best
available control technology at the affected units. The Northern District of Georgia granted the
Company’s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction in Georgia. The EPA refiled its claims
against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. On June 3,
2005, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama issued a decision in favor of
the Company on two primary legal issues in the case; however, the decision does not resolve the
case, nor does it address other legal issues associated with the EPA’s allegations. In accordance
with a separate court order, the Company and the EPA are currently participating in mediation with
respect to the EPA’s claims.

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act
authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $32,500 per day, per violation at each generating
unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in this matter could
require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly
require payment of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of operations, cash
flows, and possibly financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

In December 2002 and October 2003, the EPA issued final revisions to its NSR regulations under
the Clean Air Act. A coalition of states and environmental organizations filed petitions for
review of these regulations. On June 24, 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit upheld, in part, the EPA’s December 2002 revisions to its NSR regulations, which
included changes to the regulatory exclusions and methods of calculating emissions increases.
However, the court vacated portions of those revisions, including those addressing the exclusion of
certain pollution control projects. The October 2003 revisions, which clarified the scope of the
existing Routine Maintenance, Repair and Replacement exclusion, have been stayed by the Court of
Appeals pending its review of the rules. On October 20, 2005, the EPA also published a proposed
rule clarifying the test for determining when an emissions increase subject to the NSR requirements
has occurred. The impact of these revisions and proposed rules will depend on adoption of the
final rules by the EPA and the State of Alabama’s implementation of such rules, as well as the
outcome of any additional legal challenges, and, therefore, cannot be determined at this time.

Carbon Dioxide Litigation

In July 2004, attorneys general from eight states, each outside of Southern Company’s service
territory, and the corporation counsel for New York City filed a complaint in the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York against Southern Company and four other electric power
companies. A nearly identical complaint was filed by three environmental groups in the same court.
The complaints allege that the companies’ emissions of carbon
dioxide, a greenhouse gas, contribute to global warming, which the plaintiffs assert is a public
nuisance. Under common law public and private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs seek a judicial
order (1) holding each defendant jointly and severally liable for creating, contributing to, and/or
maintaining global warming and (2) requiring each of the defendants to cap its emissions of carbon
dioxide and then reduce those emissions by a specified percentage each year for at least a decade.
Plaintiffs have not, however, requested that damages be awarded in

II-86


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2005 Annual Report

connection with their claims.
Southern Company believes these claims are without merit and notes that the complaint cites no
statutory or regulatory basis for the claims. In September 2005, the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York granted Southern Company’s and the other defendants’ motions to
dismiss these cases. The plaintiffs filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit on October 19, 2005. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this
time.

Environmental Statutes and Regulations

General

The Company’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by state and federal environmental
agencies under a variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental media, including air,
water, and land resources. Applicable statutes include the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act;
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Emergency Planning &
Community Right-to-Know Act, and the Endangered Species Act. Compliance with these environmental
requirements involves significant capital and operating costs, a major portion of which is
expected to be recovered through existing ratemaking provisions. Through 2005, the Company had
invested approximately $961 million in capital projects to comply with these requirements, with
annual totals of $256 million, $177 million, and $100 million for 2005, 2004, and 2003,
respectively. Over the next decade, the Company expects that capital expenditures to assure
compliance with existing and new regulations could exceed an additional $2.2 billion, including
$285 million, $426 million, and $406 million for 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively. Because the
Company’s compliance strategy is impacted by changes to existing environmental laws and
regulations, the cost, availability, and existing inventory of emission allowances, and the
Company’s fuel mix, the ultimate outcome cannot be determined at this time. Environmental costs
that are known and estimable at this time are included in capital expenditures discussed under
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – “Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations” herein.

Compliance with possible additional federal or state legislation or regulations related to
global climate change, air quality, or other environmental and health concerns could also
significantly affect the Company. New environmental legislation or regulations, or changes to
existing statutes or regulations could affect many areas of the Company’s operations; however,
the full impact of any such changes cannot be determined at this time.

Air Quality

Compliance with the Clean Air Act and resulting regulations has been and will continue to be a
significant focus for the Company. Through 2005, the Company had spent approximately $745
million in reducing sulfur dioxide (SO


) and nitrogen oxide (NO

x

)
emissions and in monitoring emissions pursuant to the Clean Air Act. Additional controls have
been announced and are currently being installed at several plants to further reduce
SO


and NO

x

emissions, maintain compliance with existing regulations, and
to meet new requirements.

Approximately $594 million of these expenditures related to reducing NO

x

emissions pursuant to state and federal requirements in connection with the EPA’s one-hour ozone
standard and the 1998 regional NO

x

reduction rules. In 2004, the regional
NO

x

reduction rules were implemented for the northern two-thirds of Alabama. See
Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters” for information regarding
the Company’s recovery of costs associated with environmental laws and regulations.

In 2005, the EPA revoked the one-hour ozone standard and published the final set of rules for
implementation of the new, more stringent eight-hour ozone standard. The area within the Company’s
service area that has been designated as nonattainment under the eight-hour ozone standard includes
Jefferson and Shelby Counties, near Birmingham. State implementation plans, including new emission
control regulations necessary to bring those areas into attainment are required for most areas by
June 2007. These state implementation plans could require further reductions in NO

x

emissions from power plants.

In November 2005, the State of Alabama, through the Alabama Department of Environmental
Management, submitted a request to the EPA to redesignate the Birmingham eight-hour ozone
non-attainment area to attainment for the standard. On January 25, 2006, the EPA published a
proposal in the Federal Register to approve the redesignation request. If ultimately approved by
the EPA, the area would be designated to be in attainment. The final outcome of this matter cannot
now be determined.

II-87


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2005 Annual Report

During 2005, the EPA’s fine particulate matter nonattainment designations became effective
for several areas within the Company’s service area, and the EPA proposed a rule for the
implementation of the fine particulate matter standard. The EPA plans to finalize the proposed
implementation rule in 2006. State plans for addressing the nonattainment designations are
required by April 2008 and could require further reductions in SO


and NO

x

emissions from power plants. The EPA has also published proposed revisions to lower the levels
of particulate matter currently allowed.

The EPA issued the final Clean Air Interstate Rule on March 10, 2005. This cap-and-trade
rule addresses SO


and NO

x

emissions from power plants that were found to
contribute to nonattainment of the eight-hour ozone and fine particulate matter standards in
downwind states. Twenty-eight eastern states, including the State of Alabama, are subject to
the requirements of the rule. The rule calls for additional reductions of NO

x

and/or
SO


to be achieved in two phases, 2009/2010 and 2015. These reductions will be
accomplished by the installation of additional emission controls at the Company’s coal-fired
facilities or by the purchase of emission allowances from a cap-and-trade program.

The Clean Air Visibility Rule (formerly called the Regional Haze Rule) was finalized on
July 6, 2005. The goal of this rule is to restore natural visibility conditions in certain
areas (primarily national parks and wilderness areas) by 2064. The rule involves the
application of Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements and a review each decade,
beginning in 2018, of progress toward the goal. BART requires that sources that contribute to
visibility impairment implement additional emission reductions, if necessary, to make progress
toward remedying current visibility concerns. For power plants, the Clean Air Visibility Rule
allows states to determine that the Clean Air Interstate Rule satisfies BART requirements for
SO


and NO

x

. However, additional requirements could be imposed. By
December 17, 2007, states must submit implementation plans that contain emission reduction
strategies for implementing BART requirements and for achieving sufficient and reasonable
progress toward the goal.

On March 15, 2005, the EPA announced the final Clean Air Mercury Rule, a cap-and-trade
program for the reduction of mercury emissions from coal-fired plants. The rule sets caps on
mercury emissions to be implemented in two phases, 2010 and 2018, and provides for an emissions
allowance trading market. The Company anticipates that emission controls installed to achieve
compliance with the Clean Air Interstate Rule and the eight-hour ozone and fine-particulate
standards will also result in mercury emission reductions. However, the long-term capability of
emission control equipment to reduce mercury emissions is still being evaluated, and the
installation of additional control technologies may be required.

The impacts of the eight-hour ozone standard, the fine particulate matter designations, the
Clean Air Interstate Rule, the Clean Air Visibility Rule, and the Clean Air Mercury Rule on the
Company will depend on the development and implementation of rules at the state level. States
implementing the Clean Air Mercury Rule and the Clean Air Interstate Rule, in particular, have
the option not to participate in the national cap-and-trade programs and could require
reductions greater than those mandated by the federal rules. Such impacts will also depend on
resolution of pending legal challenges to the Clean Air Interstate Rule, the Clean Air Mercury
Rule, and a related petition from the State of North Carolina under Section 126 of the Clean Air
Act, also related to the interstate transport of air pollutants. Therefore, the full impacts of
these regulations on the Company cannot be determined at this time. The Company has developed
and continually updates a comprehensive environmental compliance strategy to comply with the
continuing and new environmental requirements discussed above. As part of this strategy, the
Company plans to install additional SO


, NO

x

, and mercury emission
controls within the next several years to assure continued compliance with applicable air
quality requirements.

Water Quality

In July 2004, the EPA published final rules under the Clean Water Act for the purpose of
reducing impingement and entrainment of fish and fish larvae at power plants’ cooling water
intake structures. The new rules require baseline biological information and, perhaps,
installation of fish protection technology near some intake structures at existing power plants.

The full impact of these new rules will depend on the results of studies and analyses
performed as part of the rules’ implementation and the actual requirements established by state
regulatory agencies, and therefore, cannot now be determined.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Environmental Remediation

The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling
and disposal of waste and release of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and
regulations, the Company could incur substantial costs to clean up properties. The Company
conducts studies to determine the extent of any required cleanup and has recognized in its
financial statements the costs to clean up known sites. Amounts for cleanup and ongoing
monitoring costs were not material for any year presented. The Company may be liable for some
or all required cleanup costs for additional sites that may require environmental remediation.

Global Climate Issues

Domestic efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions have been spurred by international
discussions surrounding the Framework Convention on Climate Change, and specifically the Kyoto
Protocol, which proposes constraints on the emissions of greenhouse gases for a group of
industrialized countries. The Bush Administration has not supported U.S. ratification of the
Kyoto Protocol or other mandatory carbon dioxide reduction legislation; however, in 2002, it did
announce a goal to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of the U.S., the ratio of greenhouse gas
emissions to the value of U.S. economic output, by 18 percent by 2012. A year later, the
Department of Energy (DOE) announced the Climate VISION program to support this goal.
Energy-intensive industries, including electricity generation, are the initial focus of this
program. Southern Company is involved in the development of a voluntary electric utility sector
climate change initiative in partnership with the government. In a memorandum of understanding
signed in December 2004 with the DOE under Climate VISION, the utility sector pledged to reduce
its greenhouse gas emissions rate by 3 percent to 5 percent by 2010 — 2012. The Company is
continuing to evaluate future energy and emission profiles relative to the Climate VISION
program and is analyzing voluntary programs to support the industry initiative.

FERC Matters

Market-Based Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates at market-based
prices. The Company also has FERC authority to make short-term opportunity sales at market
rates. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a market-based contract with an
affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation
dominance within its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other
markets is not an issue in that proceeding. In February 2005, Southern Company submitted
responsive information. In February 2006, the FERC suspended the proceeding to allow the
parties to conduct settlement discussions. Any new market-based rate transactions in its retail
service territory entered into after February 27, 2005 are subject to refund to the level of the
default cost-based rates, pending the outcome of the proceeding. The impact of such sales to
the Company through December 31, 2005 is not expected to exceed $3.6 million. The refund period
covers 15 months. In the event that the FERC’s default mitigation measures for entities that
are found to have market power are ultimately applied, the Company may be required to charge
cost-based rates for certain wholesale sales in the Southern Company retail service territory,
which may be lower than negotiated market-based rates. The final outcome of this matter will
depend on the form in which the final methodology for assessing generation market power and
mitigation rules may be ultimately adopted and cannot be determined at this time.

In addition, in May 2005, the FERC started an investigation to determine whether Southern
Company satisfies the other three parts of the FERC’s market-based rate analysis: transmission
market power, barriers to entry, and affiliate abuse or reciprocal dealing. The FERC established a
new refund period related to this expanded investigation. Any and all new market-based rate
transactions both inside and outside Southern Company’s retail service territory involving any
Southern Company subsidiary, including the Company, will be subject to refund to the extent the
FERC orders lower rates as a result of this new investigation, with the 15-month refund period
beginning July 19, 2005. The impact of such sales to the Company through December 31, 2005, is not
expected to exceed $8.9 million, of which $2.6 million relates to sales inside the retail service
territory discussed above. The FERC also directed that this expanded proceeding be held in
abeyance pending the outcome of the proceeding on the IIC discussed below.

The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for this proceeding and is vigorously
defending itself in this matter. However, the final outcome of this matter, including any remedies
to be applied in the event of an

II-89


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2005 Annual Report

adverse ruling in this proceeding, cannot now be determined.

Intercompany Interchange Contract

The Company’s generation fleet in its retail service territory is operated under the IIC, as
approved by the FERC. In May 2005, the FERC initiated a new proceeding to examine (1) the
provisions of the IIC among Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, Savannah
Electric, Southern Power, and SCS, as agent, under the terms of which the power pool of Southern
Company is operated, and, in particular, the propriety of the continued inclusion of Southern Power
as a party to the IIC, (2) whether any parties to the IIC have violated the FERC’s standards of
conduct applicable to utility companies that are transmission providers, and (3) whether Southern
Company’s code of conduct defining Southern Power as a “system company” rather than a “marketing
affiliate” is just and reasonable. In connection with the formation of Southern Power, the FERC
authorized Southern Power’s inclusion in the IIC in 2000. The FERC also previously approved
Southern Company’s code of conduct. The FERC order directs that the administrative law judge who
presided over a proceeding involving approval of PPAs between Southern Power, Georgia Power, and
Savannah Electric be assigned to preside over the hearing in this proceeding and that the testimony
and exhibits presented in that proceeding be preserved to the extent appropriate. Hearings are
scheduled for September 2006. Effective July 19, 2005, revenues from transactions under the IIC
involving any Southern Company subsidiaries, including the Company, are subject to refund to the
extent the FERC orders any changes to the IIC.

The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for this proceeding and is
vigorously defending itself in this matter. However, the final outcome of this matter,
including any remedies to be applied in the event of an adverse ruling in this proceeding,
cannot now be determined.

Generation Interconnection Agreements

In July 2003, the FERC issued its final rule on the standardization of generation
interconnection agreements and procedures (Order 2003). Order 2003 shifts much of the financial
burden of new transmission investment from the generator to the transmission provider. The FERC
has indicated that Order 2003, which was effective January 20, 2004, is to be applied
prospectively to interconnection agreements. Subsidiaries of Tenaska, Inc., as counterparties
to two previously executed interconnection agreements with the Company, have filed complaints at
the FERC requesting that the FERC modify the agreements and that the Company refund a total of
$11 million previously paid for interconnection facilities, with interest. These proceedings
are still pending at the FERC. The Company has also received similar requests from other
entities totaling approximately $7 million. The Company has opposed all such requests. The
impact of Order 2003 and its subsequent rehearings on the Company and the final results of these
matters cannot be determined at this time.

Transmission

In December 1999, the FERC issued its final rule on Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs).
Since that time, there have been a number of additional proceedings at the FERC designed to
encourage further voluntary formation of RTOs or to mandate their formation. However, at the
current time, there are no active proceedings that would require the Company to participate in
an RTO. Current FERC efforts that may potentially change the regulatory and/or operational
structure of transmission include rules related to the standardization of generation
interconnection, as well as an inquiry into, among other things, market power by vertically
integrated utilities. See “Market-Based Rate Authority” and “Generation Interconnection
Agreements” herein for additional information. The final outcome of these proceedings cannot
now be determined. However, the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows could be adversely affected by future changes in the federal regulatory or operational
structure of transmission.

Hydro Relicensing

In July 2005, the Company filed two applications with the FERC for new 50-year licenses for the
Company’s seven hydroelectric developments on the Coosa River (Weiss, Henry, Logan Martin, Lay,
Mitchell, Jordan, and Bouldin) and for the Lewis Smith and Bankhead developments on the Warrior
River. The FERC licenses for all of these nine projects expire in 2007.

In 2006, the Company will initiate the process of developing a relicensing application for the
Martin hydroelectric project located on the Tallapoosa River. The current Martin license will
expire in 2013.

II-90


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Upon or after the expiration of each license, the United States Government, by act of
Congress, may take over the project or the FERC may relicense the project either to the original
licensee or to a new licensee. The FERC may grant relicenses subject to certain requirements that
could result in additional costs to the Company. The final outcome of these matters cannot be
determined at this time.

Nuclear Relicensing

The Company filed an application with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in September 2003
to extend the operating license for Plant Farley for an additional 20 years. In May 2005, the
NRC granted the Company a 20-year extension of the operating license for both units at Plant
Farley. As a result of the license extension, amounts previously contributed to the external
trust are currently projected to be adequate to meet the decommissioning obligations.
Therefore, in June 2005, the Alabama PSC approved the Company’s request to suspend, effective
January 1, 2005, the inclusion in its annual cost of service of $18 million in decommissioning
costs and to also suspend the associated obligation to make semi-annual contributions to the
external trust. See Note 1 to the financial statements under “Nuclear Decommissioning” for
additional information.

PSC Matters

Retail Rate Adjustments

In October 2005, the Alabama PSC approved a revision to Rate RSE requested by the Company.
Effective January 2007, Rate RSE adjustments will be based on forward-looking information for
the applicable upcoming calendar year. Rate adjustments for any two-year period, when averaged
together, cannot exceed 4 percent per year and any annual adjustment is limited to 5 percent.
Rates remain unchanged when the return on common equity ranges between 13.0 percent and 14.5
percent. If the Company’s actual retail return on common equity is above the allowed equity
return range, customer refunds will be required; however, there is no provision for additional
customer billings should the actual retail return on common equity fall below the allowed equity
return range. The Company will make its initial submission of projected data for calendar year
2007 by December 1, 2006. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory
Matters — Rate RSE” for further information.

The Company’s retail rates, approved by the Alabama PSC, also provide for adjustments to
recognize the placing of new generating facilities into retail service and the recovery of
retail costs associated with certificated PPAs under Rate Certificated New Plant (CNP). In
October 2004, the Alabama PSC amended Rate CNP to also allow for the recovery of the Company’s
retail costs associated with environmental laws, regulations, or other such mandates. The rate
mechanism began operation in January 2005 and provides for the recovery of these costs pursuant
to a factor that is calculated annually. Environmental costs to be recovered include operation
and maintenance expenses, depreciation, and a return on invested capital. Retail rates
increased approximately 1.0 percent in January 2005 and 1.2 percent in January 2006. It is
currently anticipated that retail rates will increase approximately 0.5 percent in 2007. In
conjunction with the Alabama PSC’s approval of this rate mechanism, the Company agreed to a
moratorium through 2006 on retail rate increases under Rate RSE.

Effective July 2003, the Company’s retail rates were adjusted by approximately 2.6 percent
under Rate CNP as a result of two new certificated PPAs that began in June 2003. An additional
increase of 0.8 percent in retail rates, or $25 million annually, was effective July 2004 under
Rate CNP for new certificated PPAs. In April 2005, an adjustment to Rate CNP decreased retail
rates by approximately 0.5 percent, or $19 million annually. The projected annual true-up
adjustment to be effective in April 2006 is expected to increase retail rates by 0.5 percent, or
$19 million annually. See Note 3 to the financial statements
under “Retail Regulatory Matters —
Rate CNP” for additional information.

Retail Fuel Cost Recovery

The Company has established fuel cost recovery rates approved by the Alabama PSC. As a result of
increased fuel costs for coal and gas, the Company filed a fuel cost recovery increase under the
provisions of its energy cost recovery rate (Rate ECR). In December 2005, the Alabama PSC approved
an increase of the energy billing factor for retail customers from 1.788 cents per KWH to 2.400
cents per KWH, effective with billings beginning January 2006. This change to the billing factor
represents on average an increase of approximately $6.12 per month for a customer billing of 1,000
KWHs. This approved increase was intended to allow for the recovery of energy costs based on an
estimate of future energy costs, as well as the collection of the existing under recovered energy
costs by the end of 2007. In addition, during 2007, the

II-91


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Company will be allowed to include a carrying charge associated with the under recovered fuel costs
in the fuel expense calculation. As a result of the order, the Company reclassified $186.9 million
of the under-recovered regulatory clause revenues from current assets to deferred charges and other
assets in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2005. See Note 3 to the financial statements under
“Retail Regulatory Matters — Fuel Cost Recovery” for additional information.

Rate ECR revenues, as recorded on the financial statements, are adjusted for the difference in
actual recoverable costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, this approved
increase in the billing factor will have no significant effect on the Company’s revenues or net
income, but will increase annual cash flow.

Natural Disaster Cost Recovery

The Company maintains a reserve for operation and maintenance expense to cover the cost of damages
from major storms to its transmission and distribution facilities. On July 10, 2005 and August 29,
2005, Hurricanes Dennis and Katrina, respectively, hit the coast of Alabama and continued north
through the state, causing significant damage in parts of the service territory of the Company.
Approximately 241,000 and 637,000 of the Company’s 1.4 million customer accounts were without
electrical service immediately after Hurricanes Dennis and Katrina, respectively. The Company
sustained significant damage to its distribution and transmission facilities during these storms.

In August 2005, the Company received approval from the Alabama PSC to defer the Hurricane
Dennis storm-related operation and maintenance costs (approximately $28 million), which resulted in
a negative balance in the natural disaster reserve (NDR). In October 2005, the Company also
received similar approval from the Alabama PSC to defer the Hurricane Katrina storm-related
operation and maintenance costs (approximately $30 million). See Note 1 and Note 3 to the
financial statements under “Natural Disaster Reserve” and “Natural Disaster Cost Recovery,”
respectively, for additional information on these reserves. The natural disaster reserve deficit
balance at December 31, 2005 was $50.6 million.

In December 2005, the Alabama PSC approved a request by the Company to replenish the depleted
NDR and allow for recovery of future natural disaster costs. The Alabama PSC order gives the
Company authority to record a deficit balance in the NDR when costs of uninsured storm damage
exceed any established reserve balance. The order also approved a separate monthly NDR charge
consisting of two components beginning January 2006. The first component is intended to establish
and maintain a target reserve balance of $75 million for future storms and is an on-going part of
customer billing. The Company currently expects that the target reserve balance could be achieved
within five years. The second component of the NDR charge is intended to allow recovery of the
existing deferred hurricane related operation and maintenance costs and any future reserve deficits
over a 24-month period. The maximum total NDR charge consisting of both components is $10 per
month per non-residential customer account and $5 per month per residential customer account.

As revenue from the NDR charge is recognized, an equal amount of operation and maintenance
expense related to the NDR will also be recognized. As a result, this increase in revenue and
expense will not have an impact on net income but will increase the annual cash flow.

Other Matters

In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 87, Employers’
Accounting for Pensions, the Company recorded non-cash pre-tax pension income of approximately $21
million, $36 million, and $52 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Postretirement
benefit costs for the Company were $28 million, $22 million, and $23 million in 2005, 2004, and
2003, respectively. Both pension and postretirement benefit costs are expected to trend upward.
Such amounts are dependent on several factors including trust earnings and changes to the plans. A
portion of pension and postretirement benefit costs is capitalized based on construction-related
labor charges. Pension and postretirement benefit costs are a component of the regulated rates and
generally do not have a long-term effect on net income. For more information regarding pension and
postretirement benefits, see Note 2 to the financial statements.

The Company is involved in various other matters being litigated and regulatory matters that
could affect future earnings. See Note 3 to the financial statements for information regarding
material issues.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2005 Annual Report

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may
have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations and related disclosures.
Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different
from those recorded in the financial statements. Management has reviewed and discussed critical
accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of Southern Company’s Board of
Directors.

Electric Utility Regulation

The Company is subject to retail regulation by the Alabama PSC and wholesale regulation by the
FERC. These regulatory agencies set the rates the Company is permitted to charge customers
based on allowable costs. As a result, the Company applies FASB Statement No. 71, Accounting
for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (Statement No. 71), which requires the financial
statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the ratemaking process, the
regulators may require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when they
would be recognized by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of
expenses and the recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery
through rates or the deferral of gains or creation of liabilities and the recording of related
regulatory liabilities. The application of Statement No. 71 has a further effect on the
Company’s financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the
ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from those actually incurred by the Company;
therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation, nuclear
decommissioning, and pension and postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on the
Company’s results of operations than they would on a non-regulated company.

As reflected in Note 1 to the financial statements under “Regulatory Assets and
Liabilities,” significant regulatory assets and liabilities have been recorded. Management
reviews the ultimate recoverability of these regulatory assets and liabilities based on
applicable regulatory guidelines and accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. However, adverse legislative, judicial, or regulatory actions could materially impact
the amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could adversely impact the Company’s
financial statements.

Contingent Obligations

The Company is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other
factors and conditions that potentially subject it to environmental, litigation, income tax, and
other risks. See “FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL” herein and Note 3 to the financial statements for
more information regarding certain of these contingencies. The Company periodically evaluates
its exposure to such risks and records reserves for those matters where a loss is considered
probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or conditions that can
be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially affect the
Company’s financial statements. These events or conditions include the following:

•

Changes in existing state or federal regulation by governmental
authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality,
control of toxic substances, hazardous and solid wastes, and other
environmental matters.

•

Changes in existing income tax regulations or changes in Internal
Revenue Service interpretations of existing regulations.

•

Identification of additional sites that require environmental
remediation or the filing of other complaints in which the Company may
be asserted to be a potentially responsible party.

•

Identification and evaluation of other potential lawsuits or
complaints in which the Company may be named as a defendant.

•

Resolution or progression of existing matters through the legislative
process, the court systems, or the EPA.

II-93


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Unbilled Revenues

Revenues related to the sale of electricity are recorded when electricity is delivered to
customers. However, the determination of KWH sales to individual customers is based on the reading
of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each
month, amounts of electricity delivered to customers, but not yet metered and billed, are
estimated. Components of the unbilled revenue estimates include total KWH territorial supply,
total KWH billed, estimated total electricity lost in delivery, and customer usage. These
components can fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including weather, generation patterns,
power delivery volume, and other operational constraints. These factors can be unpredictable and
can vary from historical trends. As a result, the overall estimate of unbilled revenues could be
significantly affected, which could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations.

New Accounting Standards

Income Taxes

In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 109-1, Application of FASB Statement No.
109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities
Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (FSP 109-1), which requires that the
generation deduction be accounted for as a special tax deduction rather than as a tax rate
reduction. The Company adopted FSP 109-1 in the first quarter of 2005 with no material impact on
its financial statements.

Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations

Effective December 31, 2005, the Company adopted the provision of FASB Interpretation No. 47
(FIN 47), Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires that an asset retirement
obligation be recorded even though the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on
future events. Prior to December 2005, the Company did not recognize asset retirement
obligations for asbestos removal and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain
transformers because the timing of their retirements was dependent on future events. For
additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements under “Asset Retirement
Obligations and Other Costs of Removal.” At December 31, 2005, the Company recorded additional
asset retirement obligations (and assets) of approximately $35 million. The adoption of FIN 47
did not have any effect on the Company’s income statement.

Stock Options

On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, on a
modified prospective basis. This statement requires that compensation cost relating to
share-based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements. That cost will be
measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued.
Although the compensation expense required under the revised statement differs slightly, the
impacts on the Company’s financial statements are similar to the pro forma disclosures included
in Note 1 to the financial statements under “Stock Options.”

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

The Company’s financial condition continued to be strong at December 31, 2005. Net cash flow from
operating activities totaled $0.9 billion, $1.0 billion, and $1.1 billion for 2005, 2004, and 2003,
respectively. The $106 million decrease for 2005 in operating activities primarily relates to an
increase in under recovered fuel cost and storm damage costs related to Hurricanes Dennis and
Katrina. These increases were partially offset by the deferral of income tax liabilities arising
from accelerated depreciation deductions. The $104 million decrease from 2003 to 2004 resulted
from under recovered fuel cost and storm damage costs related to Hurricane Ivan partially offset by
accelerated depreciation reductions. Fuel and storm damage costs are recoverable in future
periods. Under recovered fuel cost is included in the balance sheets as under recovered regulatory
clause revenue and deferred under recovered regulatory clause revenues. Under recovered storm
damage cost is included in the balance sheets as other current assets and other regulatory assets.
See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “Fuel Cost Recovery” and “Natural Disaster Cost Recovery” herein
for additional information.

Significant balance sheet changes for 2005 include an increase of $668 million in gross plant.
In 2004 significant balance sheet changes included the $478 million increase in long-term debt
primarily due to the replacement of debt due within one year with long-term debt, and an increase
of $408 million in gross plant.

II-94


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2005 Annual Report

The Company’s ratio of common equity to total capitalization — including short-term debt —
was 42.2 percent in 2005, 42.6 percent in 2004, and 43.3 percent in 2003. See Note 6 to the
financial statements for additional information.

The Company has received investment grade ratings from the major rating agencies.

Sources of Capital

The Company plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from sources
similar to those used in the past, which were primarily from operating cash flows. In recent
years, the Company has primarily utilized unsecured debt, preferred stock, and preferred
securities. However, the type and timing of any financings — if needed — will depend on market
conditions and regulatory approval.

Security issuances are subject to regulatory approval by the Alabama PSC. Additionally, with
respect to the public offering of securities, the Company must file registration statements with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (1933
Act). The amounts of securities authorized by the Alabama PSC, as well as the amounts registered
under the 1933 Act, are continuously monitored and appropriate filings are made to ensure
flexibility in the capital markets.

The Company obtains financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. See Note
6 to the financial statements under “Bank Credit Arrangements” for additional information. The
Southern Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of
the Company are not commingled with funds of any other company.

The Company’s current liabilities frequently exceed current assets because of the continued
use of short-term debt as a funding source to meet scheduled maturities of long-term debt as well
as cash needs which can fluctuate significantly due to the seasonality of the business.

To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the Company has various internal and external
sources of liquidity. At the beginning of 2006, the Company had approximately $22 million of cash
and cash equivalents and $878 million of unused credit arrangements with banks, as described below.
In addition, the Company has substantial cash flow from operating activities and access to the
capital markets, including commercial paper programs, to meet liquidity needs.

The Company maintains committed lines of credit in the amount of $878 million, of which $428
million will expire at various times during 2006. $251 million of the credit facilities expiring
in 2006 allow for the execution of term loans for an additional one-year period. See Note 6 to the
financial statements under “Bank Credit Arrangements” for additional information.

The Company may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company subsidiary
organized to issue and sell commercial paper and extendible commercial notes at the request and for
the benefit of the Company and the other Southern Company retail operating companies. Proceeds
from such issuances for the benefit of the Company are loaned directly to the Company and are not
commingled with proceeds from such issuances for the benefit of any other retail operating company.
The obligations of each company under these arrangements are several and there is no cross
affiliate credit support.

As of December 31, 2005 the Company had $136 million in commercial paper outstanding, $55
million in extendible commercial notes outstanding, and $125 million in loans outstanding under an
uncommitted credit arrangement. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had no extendible commercial
notes and no commercial paper outstanding.

Financing Activities

During 2005, the Company issued $250 million of long-term debt. In addition, the Company issued
one million new shares of common stock to Southern Company at $40.00 a share and realized proceeds
of $40 million. The proceeds of these issues were used to repay short-term indebtedness, and for
other general corporate purposes. In November 2005, the Company incurred obligations in connection
with the issuance of $21.5 million of variable rate pollution control bonds. The proceeds were used
to refund $21.5 million 5.50% fixed rate pollution control bonds.

In January and February 2006, the Company issued $600 million of long-term debt. The proceeds
of these issues were used to repay short-term indebtedness and for other general corporate
purposes. In conjunction with these transactions, the Company terminated $600 million notional
amount of interest rate swaps at a gain of $18 million. The gain will be amortized to interest
expense over a 10-year period.

II-95


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Credit Rating Risk

The Company does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment
schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. However, the Company is party
to certain derivative agreements that could require collateral and/or accelerated payment in the
event of a credit rating change to below investment grade. These agreements are primarily for
natural gas price risk management activities. At December 31, 2005, the Company’s exposure to
these agreements was not material.

Market Price Risk

Due to cost-based rate regulations, the Company has limited exposure to market volatility in
interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity. To manage the volatility
attributable to these exposures, the Company nets the exposures to take advantage of natural
offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to the
Company’s policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and risk management practices. Company
policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and mandates strict
adherence to all applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are monitored using
techniques including, but not limited to, market valuation, value at risk, stress testing, and
sensitivity analysis.

To mitigate future exposure to changes in interest rates, the Company has entered into forward
starting interest rate swaps that have been designated as hedges. The weighted average interest
rate on $271.5 million of long-term variable interest rate exposure that has not been hedged at
January 1, 2006 was 4.45 percent. If the Company sustained a 100 basis point change in interest
rates for all unhedged variable rate long-term debt, the change would affect annualized interest
expense by approximately $2.7 million at January 1, 2006. The Company is not aware of any facts or
circumstances that would significantly affect such exposures in the near term. For further
information, see Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements under “Financial Instruments.”

To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the Company enters
into fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale
electricity market and, to a lesser extent, into similar contracts for gas purchases. The Company
has implemented fuel hedging programs at the instruction of the Alabama PSC.

In addition, the Company’s Rate ECR allows the recovery of specific costs associated with the
sales of natural gas that become necessary due to operating considerations at the Company’s
electric generating facilities. Rate ECR also allows recovery of the cost of financial instruments
used for hedging market price risk up to 75 percent of the budgeted annual amount of natural gas
purchases. The Company may not engage in natural gas hedging activities that extend beyond a
rolling 42-month window. Also, the premiums paid for natural gas financial options may not exceed
5 percent of the Company’s natural gas budget for that year.

At December 31, 2005, exposure from these activities was not material to the Company’s
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The changes in fair value of energy
related derivative contracts and year-end valuations were as follows at December 31:

Unrealized pre-tax gains (losses) on energy contracts recognized in income were not material
for any year presented.

The Company is exposed to market price risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties
to the derivative energy contracts. The Company’s policy is to enter into agreements with
counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s or with
counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. Therefore, the
Company does not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the counterparties. For
additional information, see Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements under “Financial
Instruments.”

Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations

The construction program of the Company is currently estimated to be $0.9 billion for 2006, $1.1
billion for 2007, and $1.1 billion for 2008. Environmental expenditures included in these amounts
are $285 million, $426 million, and $406 million for 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively (including
$305 million on selective catalytic reduction facilities and $658 million on scrubbers). In
addition, over the next three years, the Company estimates spending $244 million on Plant Farley
(including $184 million for nuclear fuel), $793 million on distribution facilities, and $394
million on transmission additions. See Note 7 to the financial statements under “Construction
Program” for additional details.

Actual construction costs may vary from this estimate because of changes in such factors as:
business conditions; environmental regulations; nuclear plant
regulations; FERC rules and transmission regulations; load projections; the cost and efficiency of
construction labor, equipment, and materials; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be
no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered.

In addition to the funds required for the Company’s construction program, approximately $1.6
billion will be required by the end of 2008 for maturities of long-term debt. The Company plans to
continue, when economically feasible, to retire higher cost securities and replace these
obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit.

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements under “Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs,” in
1993 the DOE implemented a special assessment over a 15-year period on utilities with nuclear
plants to be used for the decontamination and decommissioning of its nuclear fuel enrichment
facilities. The final installment is scheduled to occur in 2006.

The Company has also established an external trust fund for postretirement benefits as ordered
by the Alabama PSC. The cumulative effect of funding these items over a long period will diminish
internally funded capital for other purposes and may require the Company to seek capital from other
sources. For additional information, see Note 2 to the financial statements under “Postretirement
Benefits.”

Other funding requirements related to obligations associated with scheduled maturities of
long-term debt and preferred securities, as well as the related interest, preferred stock
dividends, leases, and other purchase commitments, are as follows. See Notes 1, 6, and 7 to the
financial statements for additional information.

All amounts are reflected based on final maturity dates. The Company plans to continue to
retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market
conditions permit. Variable rate interest obligations are estimated based on rates as of
January 1, 2006, as reflected in the statements of capitalization. Fixed rates include, where
applicable, the effects of interest rate derivatives employed to manage interest rate risk.

(b)

For additional information, see Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements herein.

(c)

Preferred stock does not mature; therefore, amounts are provided for the next five years
only.

(d)

The Company generally does not enter into non-cancelable commitments for other operation and
maintenance expenditures. Total other operation and maintenance expenses for 2005, 2004, and
2003 were $1.04 billion, $947 million, and $921 million, respectively.

(e)

The Company forecasts capital expenditures over a three-year period. Amounts represent
current estimates of total expenditures excluding those amounts related to contractual
purchase commitments for uranium and nuclear fuel conversion, enrichment, and fabrication
services. At December 31, 2005, significant purchase commitments were outstanding in
connection with the construction program.

(f)

Natural gas purchase commitments are based on various indices at the time of delivery.
Amounts reflected have been estimated based on the New York Mercantile Exchange future prices
at December 31, 2005.

(g)

The Company forecasts postretirement trust contributions over a three-year period. No
contributions related to the Company’s pension trust are currently expected during this
period. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information related to the
pension and postretirement plans, including estimated benefit payments. Certain benefit
payments will be made through the related trusts. Other benefit payments will be made from
the Company’s corporate assets.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Alabama Power Company 2005 Annual Report

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General

Alabama Power Company (the Company) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company, which is the
parent company of five retail operating companies, Southern Power Company (Southern Power),
Southern Company Services (SCS), Southern Communications Services (SouthernLINC Wireless), Southern
Company Holdings (Southern Holdings), Southern Nuclear Operating Company (Southern Nuclear),
Southern Telecom, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The retail operating companies —
the Company, Georgia Power Company, Gulf Power Company, Mississippi Power Company, and Savannah
Electric and Power Company — provide electric service in four Southeastern states. The Company
operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electricity to retail customers within its
traditional service area located within the State of Alabama and to wholesale customers in the
Southeast. Southern Power constructs, owns, and manages Southern Company’s competitive generation
assets and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Contracts among the
retail operating companies and Southern Power — related to jointly-owned generating facilities,
interconnecting transmission lines, or the exchange of electric power — are regulated by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). SCS — the system service company — provides, at
cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. SouthernLINC Wireless
provides digital wireless communications services to the retail operating companies and also
markets these services to the public within the Southeast. Southern Telecom provides fiber cable
services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding subsidiary for
Southern Company’s investments in synthetic fuels and leveraged leases and various other
energy-related businesses. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to Southern Company’s
nuclear power plants, including the Company’s Plant Farley. On January 4, 2006, Southern Company
completed the sale of substantially all the assets of Southern Company Gas, its competitive retail
natural gas marketing subsidiary.

The equity method is used for subsidiaries in which the Company has significant influence but
does not control and for variable interest entities where the Company is not the primary
beneficiary. Certain prior years’ data presented in the financial statements have been
reclassified to conform with current year presentation.

Southern Company was registered as a holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, as amended (PUHCA), until its repeal on February 8, 2006. Both Southern Company and
its subsidiaries, including the Company, were subject to the regulatory provisions of the PUHCA.
The Company is subject to regulation by the FERC and the Alabama Public Service Commission (PSC).
The Company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and complies with
the accounting policies and practices prescribed by its regulatory commissions. The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates.

Affiliate Transactions

The Company has an agreement with SCS under which the following services are rendered to the
Company at direct or allocated cost: general and design engineering, purchasing, accounting and
statistical analysis, finance and treasury, tax, information resources, marketing, auditing,
insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, and other services
with respect to business and operations and power pool transactions. Costs for these services
amounted to $246 million, $224 million, and $217 million during 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.
Cost allocation methodologies used by SCS were approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) prior to the repeal of PUHCA, and management believes they are reasonable.

The Company has an agreement with Southern Nuclear under which Southern Nuclear operates the
Company’s Plant Farley and provides the following nuclear-related services at cost: general
executive and advisory services, general operations, management and technical services,
administrative services including procurement, accounting, statistical analysis, employee
relations, and other services with respect to business and operations. Costs for these services
amounted to $157 million, $169 million, and $153 million during 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

The Company jointly owns Plant Greene County with Mississippi Power. The Company has an
agreement with Mississippi Power under which the Company operates Plant Greene County, and
Mississippi Power reimburses the Company for its proportionate share of expenses which were $8.2
million in 2005, $7.2 million in 2004, and $6.6 million in 2003. See Note 4 for additional
information.

II-107


NOTES (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Southern Company holds a 30 percent ownership interest in Alabama Fuel Products, LLC (AFP),
which produces synthetic fuel. The Company has an agreement with an indirect subsidiary of
Southern Company that provides services for AFP. Under this agreement, the Company provides
certain accounting functions, including processing and paying fuel transportation invoices, and the
Company is reimbursed for its expenses. Amounts billed under this agreement totaled approximately
$31.5 million, $28.7 million, and $27.5 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In addition,
the Company purchases synthetic fuel from AFP for use at several of the Company’s plants. Fuel
purchases for 2005, 2004, and 2003 totaled $265.7 million, $236.9 million, and $209.2 million,
respectively.

In June 2003, the Company entered into an agreement with Southern Power under which the
Company operates and maintains Plant Harris at cost. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company billed
Southern Power $1.9 million, $1.8 million and $0.8 million, respectively, for operation and
maintenance. Under a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Southern Power, the Company’s purchased
power costs from Plant Harris in 2005, 2004 and 2003 totaled $63.6 million, $59.0 million and $41.7
million, respectively. The Company also provides the fuel, at cost, associated with the PPA and
the fuel cost recognized by the Company in 2005 was $81.3 million, $65.7 million in 2004, and $33.9
million in 2003. Additionally, the Company recorded $8.3 million of prepaid capacity expenses
included in other deferred charges and other assets in the balance sheets at December 31, 2005 and
2004. See Note 3 under “Retail Regulatory Matters” and Note 7 under “Purchased Power Commitments”
for additional information.

The Company has an agreement with SouthernLINC Wireless to provide digital wireless
communications services to the Company. Costs for these services amounted to $5.7 million, $5.3
million, and $4.9 million during 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

Also, see Note 4 for information regarding the Company’s ownership in and PPA with Southern
Electric Generating Company (SEGCO) and Note 5 for information on certain deferred tax liabilities
due to affiliates.

The Company provides incidental services to, and receives such services from, other Southern
Company subsidiaries which are generally minor in duration and/or amount. However, with the
hurricane damage experienced by Georgia Power, Gulf Power and Mississippi Power in the last two
years, assistance provided to aid in storm restoration, including company labor, contract labor,
and materials, has caused an increase in these activities. The total amount of storm restoration
provided to Georgia Power and Gulf Power in 2004 and to Mississippi Power in 2005 was $2.4 million,
$2.3 million and $8.0 million, respectively. In 2004 and 2005, the Company received assistance
from affiliated companies in the amount of $5.6 million and $5.0 million, respectively, for aid in
major storm restoration. These activities were billed at cost.

The retail operating companies, including the Company, and Southern Power jointly enter into
various types of wholesale energy, natural gas, and certain other contracts, either directly or
through SCS as agent. Each participating company may be jointly and severally liable for the
obligations incurred under these agreements. See Note 7 under “Fuel Commitments” for additional
information.

Revenues

Energy and other revenues are recognized as services are provided. Capacity revenues are generally
recognized on a levelized basis over the appropriate contract periods. Unbilled revenues are
accrued at the end of each fiscal period. Electric rates for the Company include provisions to
adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, fuel hedging, the energy component of purchased
power costs, and certain other costs. Revenues are adjusted for differences between these actual
costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Under or over recovered regulatory clause
revenues are recorded in the balance sheets and are recovered or returned to customers through
adjustments to the billing factors. The Company continuously monitors the under/over recovered
balance and files for a revised fuel rate when management deems appropriate. See “Retail
Regulatory Matters – Fuel Cost Recovery” in Note 3 for additional information.

The Company has a diversified base of customers. No single customer or industry comprises 10
percent or more of revenues. For all periods presented, uncollectible accounts averaged less than
one percent of revenues.

Fuel Costs

Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is used. Fuel expense includes the cost of purchased emission
allowances as they are used. Fuel expense also includes the amortization of the cost of nuclear
fuel and a charge, based on nuclear generation, for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel.
Total charges for nuclear fuel included in fuel

expense totaled $64 million in 2005, $61 million in 2004, and $64 million in 2003.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

The Company is subject to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement
No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. Regulatory assets represent
probable future revenues associated with certain costs that are expected to be recovered from
customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future
reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be credited to customers
through the ratemaking process.

Note:

The recovery and amortization periods for these regulatory assets and (liabilities) are
as follows:

(a)

Asset retirement and removal liabilities are recorded, deferred income tax assets are
recovered, and deferred tax liabilities are amortized over the related property lives, which
may range up to 50 years. Asset retirement and removal liabilities will be settled and trued
up following completion of the related activities.

(b)

Recovered over the remaining life of the original issue which may range up to 50 years.

(c)

Assessments for the decontamination and decommissioning of the DOE nuclear fuel enrichment
facilities are recorded annually from 1993 through 2006.

(d)

Recorded as earned by employees and recovered as paid, generally within one year.

(e)

Recorded and recovered or amortized as approved by the Alabama PSC.

(f)

Fuel-hedging assets and liabilities are recorded over the life of the underlying hedged
purchase contracts, which generally do not exceed two years. Upon final settlement, actual
costs incurred are recovered through the fuel cost recovery clauses.

In the event that a portion of the Company’s operations is no longer subject to the
provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, the Company would be required to write off related regulatory
assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable through regulated rates. In addition,
the Company would be required to determine if any impairment to other assets exists, including
plant, and write down the assets, if impaired, to their fair values. All regulatory assets and
liabilities are currently reflected in rates.

Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs

The Company has a contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) that provides for the permanent
disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin disposing of spent nuclear fuel in 1998 as
required by the contract, and the Company is pursuing legal remedies against the government for
breach of contract. Construction of an on-site dry spent fuel storage facility at Plant Farley was
completed in 2005 and can be expanded to accommodate spent fuel through the life of the plant.

Also, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 established a Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and
Decommissioning Fund, which is funded in part by a special assessment on utilities with nuclear
plants. This assessment has been paid over a 15 year period; the final installment is scheduled to
occur in 2006. This fund will be used by the DOE for the decontamination and decommissioning of
its nuclear fuel enrichment facilities. The law provides that utilities will recover these
payments in the same manner as any other fuel expense. The Company estimates its remaining
liability at December 31, 2005 under this law to be approximately $5 million.

Income Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provides deferred
income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences. Investment tax credits utilized
are deferred and amortized to income over the average life of the related property.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost less regulatory disallowances and
impairments. Original cost includes: materials; labor; minor items of property; appropriate
administrative and general costs; payroll-related costs such as taxes, pensions, and other
benefits; and the interest capitalized and/or cost of funds used during construction.

The cost of replacements of property — exclusive of minor items of property — is
capitalized. The cost of maintenance, repairs, and replacement of minor items of property is
charged to maintenance expense as incurred or performed with the exception of nuclear refueling
costs, which are recorded in accordance with specific Alabama PSC orders. The Company accrues
estimated refueling costs in advance of the unit’s next refueling outage. The refueling cycle is
18 months for each unit. During 2005, the Company accrued $28 million and paid $19.7 million for
an outage at Unit 2. At December 31, 2005, the reserve balance totaled $7.5 million and is
included in the balance sheet in other regulatory liabilities.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation of the original cost of depreciable utility plant in service is provided primarily by
using composite straight-line rates, which approximated 2.9 percent in 2005, 3.0 percent in 2004,
and 3.1 percent in 2003. Depreciation studies are conducted periodically to update the composite
rates and the information is provided to the Alabama PSC. When property subject to depreciation is
retired or otherwise disposed of in the normal course of business, its original cost, together with
the cost of removal, less salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation. Minor items of property
included in the original cost of the plant are retired when the related property unit is retired.

Asset Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of Removal

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations, which established new accounting and reporting standards for legal
obligations associated with the ultimate costs of retiring long-lived assets. The present value
of the ultimate costs of an asset’s future retirement is recorded in the period in which the
liability is incurred. The costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and
depreciated over the asset’s useful life. In addition, effective December 31, 2005, the Company
adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 47, Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations,
which requires that an asset retirement obligation be recorded even though the timing and/or
method of settlement are conditional on future events. Prior to December 2005, the Company did
not recognize asset retirement obligations for asbestos removal and disposal of polychlorinated
biphenyls in certain transformers because the timing of their retirements was dependent on future
events. The Company has received accounting guidance from the Alabama PSC allowing the continued
accrual of other future retirement costs for long-lived assets that the Company does not have a
legal obligation to retire. Accordingly, the accumulated removal costs for these obligations
will continue to be reflected in the balance sheets as a regulatory liability. Therefore, the
Company had no cumulative effect to net income resulting from the adoption of Statement No. 143
or Interpretation No. 47.

The liability recognized to retire long-lived assets primarily relates to the Company’s
nuclear facility, Plant Farley. The fair value of assets legally restricted for settling
retirement obligations related to nuclear facilities as of December 31, 2005 was $467 million.
See “Nuclear Decommissioning” herein for further information. In addition, the Company
recognized asset retirement obligations related to various landfill sites and underground
storage tanks. In connection with the adoption of Interpretation No. 47, the Company recognized
additional asset retirement obligations (and assets) of $35 million, related to asbestos removal
and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers. The Company has also
identified retirement obligations related to certain transmission and distribution facilities
and certain wireless communication towers. However, liabilities for the removal of these assets
have not been recorded because the range of time over which the Company may settle these
obligations is unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated. The Company will continue to
recognize in the statements of income allowed removal costs in accordance with its regulatory
treatment. Any difference between costs recognized under Statement No. 143 and Interpretation
No. 47 and those reflected in rates are recognized as either a regulatory asset or liability, as
ordered by the Alabama PSC, and are reflected in the balance sheets.

Nuclear Decommissioning

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requires licensees of commercial nuclear power reactors
to establish a plan for providing reasonable assurance of funds for future decommissioning. The
Company has external trust funds to comply with the NRC’s regulations. Use of the funds is
restricted to nuclear decommissioning activities and the funds are managed and invested in
accordance with applicable requirements of various regulatory bodies, including the NRC, the
FERC, and the Alabama PSC, as well as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The trust funds are
invested in a tax-efficient manner in a diversified mix of equity and fixed income securities
and are classified as available-for-sale. The trust funds are included in the balance sheets at
fair value, as obtained from quoted market prices for the same or similar investments. Details

$249.0 million, and $330.0 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, all of which were
re-invested. Net realized gains (losses) were $9.9 million, $7.5 million and $(1.7) million in
2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Realized gains and losses are determined on a specific
identification basis. In accordance with regulatory guidance, all realized and unrealized gains
and losses are included in the regulatory liability for Asset Retirement Obligations in the
balance sheets and are not included in net income or other comprehensive income. Unrealized
gains and losses are considered non-cash transactions for purposes of the statements of cash
flow. Unrealized losses were not material in any period presented and do not represent any
impairment of the underlying investments.

The NRC’s minimum external funding requirements are based on a generic estimate of the cost to
decommission only the radioactive portions of a nuclear unit based on the size and type of reactor.
The Company has filed plans with the NRC designed to ensure that, over time, the deposits and
earnings of the external trust funds will provide the minimum funding amounts prescribed by the
NRC. At December 31, 2005, the accumulated provisions for decommissioning were as follows:

Site study cost is the estimate to decommission the facility as of the site study year. The
estimated costs of decommissioning, based on the most current study performed in 2003 for Plant
Farley were as follows:

The decommissioning cost estimates are based on prompt dismantlement and removal of the plant
from service. The actual decommissioning costs may vary from the above estimates because of
changes in the assumed date of decommissioning, changes in NRC requirements, or changes in the
assumptions used in making these estimates.

II-111


NOTES (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2005 Annual Report

All of the Company’s decommissioning costs for ratemaking are based on the site study.
Significant assumptions used to determine these costs for ratemaking were an inflation rate of 4.5
percent and a trust earnings rate of 7.0 percent. Another significant assumption used was the
change in the operating license for Plant Farley.

In May 2005, the NRC granted the Company a 20-year extension of the operating license for
both units at Plant Farley. As a result of the license extension, amounts previously contributed
to the external trust are currently projected to be adequate to meet the decommissioning
obligations. Therefore, in June 2005, the Alabama PSC approved the Company’s request to suspend,
effective January 1, 2005, the inclusion in its annual cost of service of $18 million in
decommissioning costs and to also suspend the associated obligation to make semi-annual
contributions to the external trust. The Company will continue to provide site specific estimates
of the decommissioning costs and related projections of funds in the external trust to the Alabama
PSC and, if necessary, would seek the Alabama PSC’s approval to address any changes in a manner
consistent with the NRC and other applicable requirements. The approved suspension does not
affect the transfer of internal reserves (less than $1 million annually) previously collected from
customers prior to the establishment of the external trust.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC)

In accordance with regulatory treatment, the Company records AFUDC. AFUDC represents the estimated
debt and equity costs of capital funds that are necessary to finance the construction of new
regulated facilities. While cash is not realized currently from such allowance, it increases the
revenue requirement over the service life of the plant through a higher rate base and higher
depreciation expense. All current construction costs are included in retail rates. The composite
rate used to determine the amount of AFUDC was 8.8 percent in 2005, 8.6 percent in 2004, and 9.0
percent in 2003. AFUDC, net of income tax, as a percent of net income after dividends on preferred
stock was 5.0 percent in 2005, 4.2 percent in 2004, and 3.5 percent in 2003.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles

The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of
whether impairment has occurred is based on either a specific regulatory disallowance or an
estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared with the
carrying value of the assets. If impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment recognized
is determined by either the amount of regulatory disallowance or by estimating the fair value of
the assets and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. For assets
identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value less the
cost to sell in order to determine if an impairment provision is required. Until the assets are
disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or events change.

Natural Disaster Reserve

In accordance with an Alabama PSC order, the Company has established a natural disaster reserve
(NDR) to cover the cost of uninsured damages from major storms to transmission and distribution
facilities. The Company may collect a monthly NDR charge per account that consists of two
components beginning January 1, 2006. The first component is intended to establish and maintain a
reserve for future storms and is an on-going part of customer billing. This plan has a target
reserve balance of $75 million that could be achieved in five years. The second component of the
NDR charge is intended to allow recovery of the deferred Hurricanes Dennis- and Katrina-related
operation and maintenance costs and to set in place a mechanism to replenish the natural disaster
reserve should any future storms deplete the natural disaster reserve. The Alabama PSC order gives
the Company authority to have a negative NDR balance when costs of uninsured storm damage exceed
any established NDR balance. This second component allows for the recovery of a negative balance
over a 24-month period. The maximum total NDR charge consisting of both components is $10 per
month per account for non-residential customers and $5 per month per account for residential
customers.

As revenue from the natural disaster reserve charge is recognized, an equal amount of
operation and maintenance expense related to the natural disaster reserve will also be recognized.
As a result, this increase in revenue and expense will not have an impact on net income, but will
increase the annual cash flow.

Environmental Cost Recovery

The Company has received authority from the Alabama PSC to recover approved environmental
compliance costs through specific retail rate clauses. Within limits approved by the Alabama PSC,
these rates are adjusted

II-112

annually. See Note 3 under “Retail Regulatory Matters – Rate Adjustment Procedures” for additional
information.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are considered cash
equivalents. Temporary cash investments are securities with original maturities of 90 days or
less.

Materials and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include the average cost of transmission, distribution, and
generating plant materials. Materials are charged to inventory when purchased and then expensed or
capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when installed.

Fuel Inventory

Fuel inventory includes the average costs of oil, coal, and natural gas. Fuel is charged to
inventory when purchased and then expensed as used. Emission allowances granted by the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are included in inventory at zero cost.

Stock Options

Southern Company provides non-qualified stock options to a large segment of the Company’s
employees ranging from line management to executives. The Company accounts for its stock-based
compensation plans in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25. Accordingly, no
compensation expense has been recognized because the exercise price of all options granted equaled
the fair-market value of Southern Company’s common stock on the date of grant. When options are
exercised, the Company receives a capital contribution from Southern Company equivalent to the
related income tax benefit.

For pro forma purposes, Southern Company generally recognizes stock option expense on a
straight-line basis over the vesting period. Stock options granted to employees who are eligible
for retirement are expensed at the grant date. The pro forma impact of fair-value accounting for
options granted on earnings is as follows:

Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to fluctuations in interest
rates, the prices of certain fuel purchases, and electricity purchases and sales. All derivative
financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair
value. Substantially all of the Company’s bulk energy purchases and sales contracts that meet the
definition of a derivative are exempt from fair value accounting requirements and are accounted for
under the accrual method. Other derivative contracts qualify as cash flow hedges of anticipated
transactions or are recoverable through the Alabama PSC approved fuel-hedging program. This
results in the deferral of related gains and losses in other comprehensive income or regulatory
assets and liabilities, respectively, until the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness
arising from cash flow hedges is recognized currently in net income. Other derivative contracts
are marked to market through current period income and are recorded on a net basis in the
statements of income.

The Company is exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of
counterparties’ nonperformance. The Company has established controls to determine and monitor the
creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate the Company’s exposure to counterparty
credit risk.

The fair values were based on either closing market price or closing price of comparable
instruments.

Comprehensive Income

The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of all changes in common stock equity
of an enterprise that result from transactions and other economic events of the period other than
transactions with owners. Comprehensive income consists of net income, changes in the fair value
of qualifying cash flow hedges and marketable securities, and changes in additional minimum pension
liability, less income taxes and reclassifications for amounts included in net income.

Variable Interest Entities

The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity must consolidate the related assets and
liabilities. The Company has established certain wholly-owned trusts to issue preferred
securities. See Note 6 under “Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities/Long-Term Debt
Payable to Affiliated Trusts” for additional information. However, the Company is not the
primary beneficiary of the trusts. Therefore, the investments in these trusts are reflected as
Other Investments, and the related loans from the trusts are reflected as Long-term Debt Payable
to Affiliated Trusts in the balance sheets. See Note 6 under “Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred
Securities/Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts” for additional information.

Investments

The Company maintains an investment in a debt security that matures in 2018 and is classified as
available-for-sale. This security is included in the balance sheets under Other Property and
Investments-Other and totaled $4.4 million and $4.8 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. Because the interest rate resets weekly, the carrying value approximates the fair
market value.

2. RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company has a defined benefit, trusteed, pension plan covering substantially all employees.
The plan is funded in accordance with requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended (ERISA). In 2005, the plan was amended to provide an additional monthly
supplement to certain retirees. No contributions to the plan are expected for the year ending
December 31, 2006. The Company also provides certain non-qualified benefit plans for a selected
group of management and highly-compensated employees. Benefits under these non-qualified plans are
funded on a cash basis. In addition, the Company provides certain medical care and life insurance
benefits for retired employees. The Company funds trusts to the extent required by the Alabama
PSC. For the year ended December 31, 2006, postretirement trust contributions are expected to
total approximately $24.9 million.

The measurement date for plan assets and obligations is September 30 for each year.

Pension Plans

The accumulated benefit obligation for the pension plans was $1.3 billion in 2005 and $1.2 billion
in 2004. Changes during the year in the projected benefit obligations, accumulated benefit
obligations, and fair value of plan assets were as follows:

Alabama Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Pension plan assets are managed and invested in accordance with all applicable requirements,
including ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Internal Revenue Code). The
Company’s investment policy covers a diversified mix of assets, including equity and fixed income
securities, real estate, and private equity, as described in the table below. Derivative
instruments are used primarily as hedging tools but may also be used to gain efficient exposure to
the various asset classes. The Company primarily minimizes the risk of large losses through
diversification but also monitors and manages other aspects of risk.

In the third quarter 2004, the Company prospectively adopted FASB Staff Position (FSP)
106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act). The Medicare Act provides a 28
percent prescription drug subsidy for Medicare eligible retirees. FSP 106-2 requires recognition
of the impacts of the Medicare Act in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO)
and future cost of service for postretirement medical plans. The effect of the subsidy reduced
the Company’s expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2004 and for the year ended
December 31, 2005 by approximately $3.2 million and $8.7 million, respectively, and is expected
to have a similar impact on future expenses.

Future benefit payments, including prescription drug benefits, reflect expected future
service and are estimated based on assumptions used to measure the accumulated benefit obligation
for the postretirement plans. Estimated benefit payments are reduced by drug subsidy receipts
expected as a result of the Medicare Act as follows:

The Company determined the long-term rate of return based on historical asset class returns
and current market conditions, taking into account the diversification benefits of investing in
multiple asset classes.

An additional assumption used in measuring the APBO was a weighted average medical care cost
trend rate of 10.25 percent for 2005, decreasing gradually to 4.75 percent through the year 2014,
and remaining at that level thereafter. An annual increase or decrease in the assumed medical care
cost trend rate of 1 percent would affect the accumulated benefit obligation and the service and
interest cost components at December 31, 2005 as follows:

3. CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY MATTERS

General Litigation Matters

The Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of
business. In addition, the Company’s business activities are subject to extensive governmental
regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation over environmental issues and
claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, and citizen enforcement of
environmental requirements such as opacity and other air quality standards, has increased generally
throughout the United States. In particular, personal injury claims for damages caused by alleged
exposure to hazardous materials have become more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such pending or
potential litigation against the Company cannot be predicted at this time; however, for proceedings
not specifically reported herein, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any,
arising from such proceedings would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
statements.

Environmental Matters

New Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil action in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against the Company, alleging that the Company
had violated the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act and related state laws
with respect to coal-fired generating facilities at the Company’s Plants Miller, Barry, and Gorgas.
The EPA concurrently issued to the Company a notice of violation relating to these specific
facilities, as well as Plants Greene County and Gaston. In early 2000, the EPA filed a motion to
amend its complaint to add the violations alleged in its notice of violation. The civil action
requests penalties and injunctive relief, including an order requiring the installation of the best
available control technology at the affected units. The Northern District of Georgia granted the
Company’s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction in Georgia. The EPA refiled its claims
against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. On June 3,
2005, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama issued a decision in favor of
the Company on two primary legal issues in the case; however, the decision does not resolve the
case, nor does it address other legal issues associated with the EPA’s allegations. In accordance
with a separate court order, the Company and the EPA are currently participating in mediation with
respect to the EPA’s claims.

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act
authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $32,500 per day, per violation at each generating
unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in this matter could
require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly
require payment of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of operations, cash
flows, and possibly financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

FERC Matters

Market-Based Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to nonaffiliates at market-based
prices. The Company also has FERC authority to make short-term opportunity sales at market
rates. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a market-based contract with an
affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation
dominance within its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other
markets is not an issue in that proceeding. In February 2005, Southern Company submitted
responsive information. In February 2006, the FERC suspended the proceeding to allow the
parties to conduct settlement discussions. Any new market-based rate transactions in its retail
service territory entered into after February 27, 2005 are subject to refund to the level of the
default cost-based rates, pending the outcome of the proceeding. The impact of such sales to
the Company through December 31, 2005 is not expected to exceed $3.6 million. The refund period
covers 15 months. In the event that the FERC’s default mitigation measures for entities that
are found to have market power are ultimately applied, the Company may be required to charge
cost-based rates for certain wholesale sales in the Southern Company retail service territory,
which may be lower than negotiated market-based rates. The final outcome of this matter will
depend on the form in which the final methodology for assessing generation market power and
mitigation rules may be ultimately adopted and cannot be determined at this time.

II-117


NOTES (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2005 Annual Report

In addition, in May 2005, the FERC started an investigation to determine whether Southern
Company satisfies the other three parts of the FERC’s market-based rate analysis: transmission
market power, barriers to entry, and affiliate abuse or reciprocal dealing. The FERC established a
new refund period related to this expanded investigation. Any and all new market-based rate
transactions both inside and outside Southern Company’s retail service territory involving any
Southern Company subsidiary, including the Company, will be subject to refund to the extent the
FERC orders lower rates as a result of this new investigation, with the 15-month refund period
beginning July 19, 2005. The impact of such sales to the Company through December 31, 2005, is not
expected to exceed $8.9 million, of which $2.6 million relates to sales inside the retail service
territory discussed above. The 15-month refund period will end on October 19, 2006. The FERC also
directed that this expanded proceeding be held in abeyance pending the outcome of the proceeding on
the Intercompany Interchange Contract (IIC) discussed below.

The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for this proceeding and is vigorously
defending itself in this matter. However, the final outcome of this matter, including any remedies
to be applied in the event of an adverse ruling in this proceeding, cannot now be determined.

Intercompany Interchange Contract

The Company’s generation fleet in its retail service territory is operated under the IIC, as
approved by the FERC. In May 2005, the FERC initiated a new proceeding to examine (1) the
provisions of the IIC among Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, Savannah
Electric, Southern Power, and SCS, as agent, under the terms of which the power pool of Southern
Company is operated, and, in particular, the propriety of the continued inclusion of Southern Power
as a party to the IIC, (2) whether any parties to the IIC have violated the FERC’s standards of
conduct applicable to utility companies that are transmission providers, and (3) whether Southern
Company’s code of conduct defining Southern Power as a “system company” rather than a “marketing
affiliate” is just and reasonable. In connection with the formation of Southern Power, the FERC
authorized Southern Power’s inclusion in the IIC in 2000. The FERC also previously approved
Southern Company’s code of conduct. The FERC order directs that the administrative law judge who
presided over a proceeding involving approval of PPAs between Southern Power, Georgia Power, and
Savannah Electric be assigned to preside over the hearing in this proceeding and that the testimony
and exhibits presented in that proceeding be preserved to the extent appropriate. Hearings are
scheduled for September 2006. Effective July 19, 2005, revenues from transactions under the IIC
involving any Southern Company subsidiaries are subject to refund to the extent the FERC orders any
changes to the IIC.

The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for these allegations and is
vigorously defending itself in this matter. However, the final outcome of this matter, including
any remedies to be applied in the event of an adverse ruling in this proceeding, cannot now be
determined.

Generation Interconnection Agreements

In July 2003, the FERC issued its final rule on the standardization of generation interconnection
agreements and procedures (Order 2003). Order 2003 shifts much of the financial burden of new
transmission investment from the generator to the transmission provider. The FERC has indicated
that Order 2003, which was effective January 20, 2004, is to be applied prospectively to
interconnection agreements. Subsidiaries of Tenaska, Inc., as counterparties to two previously
executed interconnection agreements with the Company, have filed complaints at the FERC requesting
that the FERC modify the agreements and that the Company refund a total of $11 million previously
paid for interconnection facilities, with interest. These proceedings are still pending at the
FERC. The Company has also received similar requests from other entities totaling approximately $7
million. The Company has opposed all such requests. The impact of Order 2003 and its subsequent
rehearings on the Company and the final results of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Retail Regulatory Matters

The following retail ratemaking procedures will remain in effect until the Alabama PSC votes to
modify or discontinue them.

Rate RSE

The Alabama PSC has adopted a Rate Stabilization and Equalization plan (Rate RSE) that provides for
periodic annual adjustments based upon the Company’s earned return on end-of-period retail common
equity. Prior to January 2007, annual adjustments are limited to 3 percent. Rates remain
unchanged when the return on common equity ranges between 13.0 percent and 14.5 percent. On
October 4, 2005, the Alabama PSC approved a revision to

II-118


NOTES (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Rate RSE. Effective January 2007 and thereafter Rate RSE adjustments are made based on
forward-looking information for the applicable upcoming calendar year. Rate adjustments for any
two-year period, when averaged together, cannot exceed 4.0 percent per year and any annual
adjustment is limited to 5.0 percent. The range of return on common equity, on which such
adjustments are based, remains unchanged. If the Company’s actual return on common equity is above
the allowed equity return range, customer refunds will be required; however, there is no provision
for additional customer billings should the actual return on common equity fall below the allowed
equity return range. The Company will make its initial submission of projected data for calendar
year 2007 by December 1, 2006. In conjunction with the Alabama PSC approval of a rate mechanism to
recover retail costs associated with environmental laws and regulations in October 2004, the
Company agreed to a moratorium on retail rate increases under Rate RSE through 2006. See “Rate
CNP” herein for additional information.

Rate CNP

The Alabama PSC has also approved a rate mechanism that provides for adjustments to recognize the
placing of new generating facilities in retail service and for the recovery of retail costs
associated with certificated purchased power agreements (Rate CNP). In October 2004, the Alabama
PSC approved a request by the Company to amend Rate CNP to provide for the recovery of retail costs
associated with environmental laws and regulations. Environmental costs to be recovered include
operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation and a return on invested capital. This component
of Rate CNP began operation in January 2005.

To recover certificated purchased power costs under Rate CNP, increases of 2.6 percent in
retail rates, or $79 million annually were effective July 2003 and 0.8 percent in retail rates, or
$25 million annually were effective July 2004 for certificated purchase power cost. In April 2005,
an adjustment to Rate CNP decreased retail rates by approximately 0.5 percent, or $19 million
annually. In April 2006, an annual true-up adjustment to Rate CNP is expected to increase retail
rates by approximately 0.5 percent, or $19 million annually.

The retail rates associated with the recovery of retail costs associated with environmental
laws and regulations under Rate CNP are adjusted annually in January. Retail rates increased
approximately 1.0 percent in 2005, or $33 million and approximately 1.2 percent in 2006, or $43
million.

Fuel Cost Recovery

The Company has established fuel cost recovery rates approved by the Alabama PSC. The Company can
change the retail energy cost recovery rate after submitting to the Alabama PSC an estimate of
future energy costs and the current over or under recovered balance. In response to such a
request, the Alabama PSC may conduct a public hearing prior to its ruling. Alternatively, the
retail energy cost recovery rates requested by the Company will become effective 45 days after the
initial request.

In December 2005, the Alabama PSC approved the Company’s request to increase the retail energy
cost recovery rate to 2.400 cents per kilowatt-hour, effective with billings beginning January 1,
2006.

Natural Disaster Cost Recovery

In September 2004, Hurricane Ivan hit the Gulf Coast of Florida and Alabama and continued north
through the Company’s service territory causing substantial damage. The related costs charged to
the Company’s NDR were $57.8 million. During 2004, the Company accrued $9.9 million to the reserve
and at December 31, 2004, the reserve balance was a regulatory asset of $37.7 million.

In February and December 2005, the Company requested and received Alabama PSC approval of an
accounting order that allowed the Company to immediately return certain regulatory liabilities to
the retail customers. These orders also allowed the Company to simultaneously recover from
customers an accrual of approximately $48 million to primarily offset the costs of Hurricane Ivan
and restore a positive balance in the natural disaster reserve. The combined effects of these
orders had no impact on the Company’s net income in 2005.

On July 10, 2005 and August 29, 2005, Hurricanes Dennis and Katrina, respectively, hit the
coast of Alabama and continued north through the state, causing significant damage in parts of the
service territory of the Company. Approximately 241,000 and 637,000 of the Company’s 1.4 million
customer accounts were without electrical service immediately after Hurricanes Dennis and Katrina,
respectively. The Company sustained significant damage to its distribution and transmission
facilities during these storms.

II-119


NOTES (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2005 Annual Report

In August 2005, the Company received approval from the Alabama PSC to defer the Hurricane
Dennis storm-related operation and maintenance costs (approximately $28 million). In October 2005,
the Company also received similar approval from the Alabama PSC to defer the Hurricane Katrina
storm-related operation and maintenance costs (approximately $30 million). The NDR balance at
December 31, 2005 was a regulatory asset of $50.6 million.

In December 2005, the Alabama PSC approved a request by the Company to replenish the depleted
NDR and allow for recovery of future natural disaster costs. The Alabama PSC order gives the
Company authority to record a deficit balance in the NDR when costs of uninsured storm damage
exceed any established reserve balance. The order also approved a separate monthly NDR charge
consisting of two components beginning January 2006. The first component is intended to establish
and maintain a target reserve balance of $75 million for future storms and is an on-going part of
customer billing. The Company currently expects that the target reserve balance could be achieved
within five years. The second component of the NDR charge is intended to allow recovery of the
existing deferred hurricane related operation and maintenance costs and any future reserve deficits
over a 24 month period. The maximum total NDR charge consisting of both components is $10 per
month per non-residential customer account and $5 per month per residential customer account.

As revenue from the NDR charge is recognized, an equal amount of operation and maintenance
expense related to the NDR will also be recognized. As a result, this increase in revenue and
expense will not have an impact on net income, but will increase the annual cash flow.

4. JOINT OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS

The Company and Georgia Power own equally all of the outstanding capital stock of SEGCO, which owns
electric generating units with a total rated capacity of 1,020 megawatts, as well as associated
transmission facilities. The capacity of these units is sold equally to the Company and Georgia
Power under a contract which, in substance, requires payments sufficient to provide for the
operating expenses, taxes, interest expense and a return on equity, whether or not SEGCO has any
capacity and energy available. The term of the contract extends automatically for two-year
periods, subject to either party’s right to cancel upon two year’s notice. The Company’s share of
purchased power totaled $90 million in 2005, $86 million in 2004, and $87 million in 2003 and is
included in “Purchased power from affiliates” in the statements of income. The Company accounts
for SEGCO using the equity method.

In addition, the Company has guaranteed unconditionally the obligation of SEGCO under an
installment sale agreement for the purchase of certain pollution control facilities at SEGCO’s
generating units, pursuant to which $24.5 million principal amount of pollution control revenue
bonds are outstanding. Also, the Company has guaranteed $50 million principal amount of unsecured
senior notes issued by SEGCO for general corporate purposes. Georgia Power has agreed to reimburse
the Company for the pro rata portion of such obligations corresponding to its then proportionate
ownership of stock of SEGCO if the Company is called upon to make such payment under its guaranty.

At December 31, 2005, the capitalization of SEGCO consisted of $60 million of equity and $89
million of debt on which the annual interest requirement is $3.2 million. SEGCO paid dividends
totaling $7.7 million in 2005, $12.0 million in 2004, and $2.3 million in 2003, of which one-half
of each was paid to the Company. In addition, the Company recognizes 50 percent of SEGCO’s net
income.

In addition to the Company’s ownership of SEGCO, the Company’s percentage ownership and
investment in jointly-owned coal-fired generating plants at December 31, 2005 is as follows:

5. INCOME TAXES

Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and combined income tax returns
for the State of Georgia and the State of Alabama. Under a joint consolidated income tax
allocation agreement, each subsidiary’s current and deferred tax expense is computed on a
stand-alone basis and no subsidiary is allocated more expense than would be paid if they filed a
separate income tax return. In accordance with IRS regulations, each company is jointly and
severally liable for the tax liability.

In 2004, in order to avoid the loss of certain federal income tax credits related to the
production of synthetic fuel, Southern Company chose to defer certain deductions otherwise
available to the subsidiaries. The cash flow benefit associated with the utilization of the tax
credits was allocated to the subsidiary that otherwise would have claimed the available deductions
on a separate company basis without the deferral. This allocation concurrently reduced the tax
benefit of the credits allocated to those subsidiaries that generated the credits. As the
deferred expenses are deducted, the benefit of the tax credits will be repaid to the subsidiaries
that generated the tax credits. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had $20.4 million and
$21.4 million in accumulated deferred income taxes and $2.0 million and $2.3 million in accrued
taxes – income taxes, respectively, payable to these subsidiaries, on the balance sheets.

At December 31, 2005, the Company’s tax-related regulatory assets and liabilities were $389
million and $102 million, respectively. These assets are attributable to tax benefits flowed
through to customers in prior years, to taxes applicable to capitalized interest, and to
deferred taxes previously recognized at rates different than the current enacted tax law. These
liabilities are primarily attributable to unamortized investment tax credits.

depreciation in the statements of income. Credits amortized in this manner amounted to $8.8
million in 2005, $11 million in 2004, and $11 million in 2003. At December 31, 2005, all
investment tax credits available to reduce federal income taxes payable had been utilized.

FINANCING

Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities/
Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts

The Company has formed certain wholly owned trust subsidiaries for the purpose of issuing preferred
securities. The proceeds of the related equity investments and preferred security sales were
loaned back to the Company through the issuance of junior subordinated notes totaling $309 million,
which constitute substantially all assets of these trusts and are reflected in the balance sheets
as Long-term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts. The Company considers that the mechanisms and
obligations relating to the preferred securities issued for its benefit, taken together, constitute
a full and unconditional guarantee by it of the respective trusts’ payment obligations with respect
to these securities. At December 31, 2005, preferred securities of $300 million were outstanding.
See Note 1 under “Variable Interest Entities” for additional information on the accounting
treatment for these trusts and the related securities.

First Mortgage Bonds

The Company had a firm power sales contract with the Alabama Municipal Electric Authority (AMEA)
entitling AMEA to scheduled amounts of capacity (up to a maximum 80 megawatts). Under the terms of
the contract, the Company received payments from AMEA representing the net present value of the
revenues associated with the capacity entitlement, discounted at an effective annual rate of 11.19
percent. These payments were recognized as operating revenues and the discount was amortized to
other interest expense as scheduled capacity was made available over the terms of the contract.

To secure AMEA’s advance payments and the Company’s performance obligation under the
contracts, the Company issued and delivered to an escrow agent first mortgage bonds representing
the maximum amount of liquidated damages payable by the Company in the event of a default under the
contracts. No principal or interest was payable on such bonds unless and until a default by the
Company occurred. As the liquidated damages declined, a portion of the bond equal to the decrease
was returned to the Company. At December 31, 2005, the bonds that were previously held in escrow
were returned to the Company due to the fulfillment of the contract obligation.

Pollution Control Bonds

Pollution control obligations represent installment purchases of pollution control facilities
financed by funds derived from sales by public authorities of revenue bonds. The Company is
required to make payments sufficient for the authorities to meet principal and interest
requirements of such bonds. With respect to $92.8 million of such pollution control obligations,
the Company has authenticated and delivered to the trustees a like principal amount of first
mortgage bonds as security for its obligations under the installment purchase agreements. No
principal or interest on these first mortgage bonds is payable unless and until a default occurs on
the installment purchase agreements.

Senior Notes

The Company issued a total of $250 million of unsecured senior notes in 2005. The proceeds of
these issues were used to repay short-term indebtedness, and for other general corporate purposes.

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had $3.6 billion and $3.5 billion of senior notes
outstanding, respectively. These senior notes are subordinate to all secured debt of the Company
which amounted to approximately $246 million at December 31, 2005.

II-122


NOTES (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Securities Due Within One Year

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had scheduled maturities and redemptions of senior notes
due within one year totaling $547 million and $225 million respectively.

Debt serial maturities through 2010 applicable to total long-term debt are as follows: $547
million in 2006; $669 million in 2007; $410 million in 2008; $250 million in 2009; and $100 million
in 2010.

Assets Subject to Lien

The Company’s mortgage, as amended and supplemented, securing the first mortgage bonds issued by
the Company, constitutes a direct lien on substantially all of the Company’s fixed property and
franchises.

Bank Credit Arrangements

The Company maintains committed lines of credit in the amount of $878 million (including $563
million of such lines which are dedicated to funding purchase obligations relating to variable rate
pollution control bonds), of which $428 million will expire at various times during 2006. $251
million of the credit facilities expiring in 2006 allow for the execution of one-year term loans.
All of the credit arrangements require payment of a commitment fee based on the unused portion of
the commitment or the maintenance of compensating balances with the banks. Commitment fees are
less than 1/4 of 1 percent for the Company. Because the arrangements are based on an average
balance, the Company does not consider any of its cash balances to be restricted as of any specific
date. For syndicated credit arrangements, a fee is also paid to the agent banks.

Most of the Company’s credit arrangements with banks have covenants that limit the Company’s
debt to 65 percent of total capitalization, as defined in the arrangements. For purposes of
calculating these covenants, long-term notes payable to affiliated trusts are excluded from debt
but included in capitalization. Exceeding this debt level would result in a default under the
credit arrangements. At December 31, 2005, the Company was in compliance with the debt limit
covenants. In addition, the credit arrangements typically contain cross default provisions that
would be triggered if the Company defaulted on other indebtedness (including guarantee
obligations) above a specified threshold. None of the arrangements contain material adverse
change clauses at the time of borrowings.

The Company borrows through commercial paper programs that have the liquidity support of
committed bank credit arrangements. In addition, the Company borrows from time to time through
extendible commercial note programs and uncommitted credit arrangements. As of December 31, 2005,
the Company had $136 million in commercial paper outstanding, $55 million in extendible commercial
notes outstanding, and $125 million in loans outstanding under an uncommitted credit arrangement.
As of December 31, 2004, the Company had no extendible commercial notes and no commercial paper
outstanding. During 2005, the peak amount outstanding for short-term borrowings was $315 million
and the average amount outstanding was $31 million. The average annual interest rate on short-term
borrowings in 2005 was 4.04 percent. Short-term borrowings are included in notes payable in the
balance sheets.

At December 31, 2005, the Company had regulatory approval to have outstanding up to $1.4
billion of short-term borrowings.

Financial Instruments

The Company enters into energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, gas, and
other fuel price changes. However, due to cost-based rate regulations, the Company has limited
exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity. The Company
has implemented fuel-hedging programs at the instruction of the Alabama PSC. The Company also
enters into hedges of forward electricity sales. There was no material ineffectiveness recorded
in earnings in 2005, 2004, and 2003.

At December 31, 2005, the fair value of derivative energy contracts was reflected in the
financial statements as follows:

the same time the hedged items affect earnings. The Company has energy-related hedges in place
up to and including 2008.

The Company also enters into derivatives to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates.
Derivatives related to variable rate securities or forecasted

NOTES (continued)

transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges. As the derivatives employed as hedging
instruments are generally structured to match the critical terms of the hedged debt instruments,
no material ineffectiveness has been recorded in earnings.

At December 31, 2005, the Company had $1.3 billion notional amount of interest rate swaps
outstanding with net fair value gains of $25.3 million as follows:

The fair value gain or loss for cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive

2005, 2004, and 2003, the Company settled gains (losses) of $(21.4) million, $5.5 million and
$(8.0) million, respectively, upon termination of certain interest derivatives at the same time it
issued debt. These gains (losses) have been deferred in other comprehensive income and will be
amortized to interest expense over the life of the original interest derivative, which approximates
to the underlying related debt.

For the years 2005, 2004 and 2003, approximately $3.5 million, $(6.3) million, and $(11.3)
million, respectively, of pre-tax gains/(losses) were reclassified from other comprehensive income
to interest expense. For 2006, pre-tax gains of approximately $9.4 million are expected to be
reclassified from other comprehensive income to interest expense. The Company has interest-related
hedges in place through 2016 and has gains/losses that are being amortized through 2035.

COMMITMENTS

Construction Program

The Company is engaged in continuous construction programs, currently estimated to total $0.9
billion in 2006, $1.1 billion in 2007, and $1.1 billion in 2008. These amounts include $18
million, $11 million, and $9 million in 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively, for construction
expenditures related to contractual purchase commitments for uranium and nuclear fuel
conversion, enrichment, and fabrication services included under “Fuel Commitments” herein. The
construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs
may vary from the above estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes
in business conditions; revised load growth estimates; changes in environmental regulations;
changes in existing nuclear plants to meet new regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules
and regulations; increasing costs of labor, equipment, and materials; and cost of capital. At
December 31, 2005, significant purchase commitments were outstanding in connection with the
construction program. The Company has no generating plants under construction. Construction of
new transmission and distribution facilities and capital improvements, including those needed to
meet environmental standards for existing generation, transmission, and distribution facilities,
will continue.

Long-Term Service Agreements

The Company has entered into several Long-Term Service Agreements (LTSAs) with General Electric
(GE) for the purpose of securing maintenance support for its combined cycle and combustion
turbine generating facilities. The LTSAs provide that GE will perform all planned inspections
on the covered equipment, which includes the cost of all labor and materials. GE is also
obligated to cover the costs of unplanned maintenance on the covered equipment subject to a
limit specified in each contract.

In general, these LTSAs are in effect through two major inspection cycles per unit.
Scheduled payments to GE are made at various intervals based on actual operating hours of the
respective units. Total payments to GE under these agreements for facilities owned are
currently estimated at $263 million over the term of the agreements, which are approximately 12
to 14 years per unit. At December 31, 2005, the remaining balance was approximately $181
million. However, the LTSAs contain various cancellation provisions at the option of the
Company.

Payments made to GE prior to the performance of any planned maintenance are recorded as
either prepayments or other deferred charges and assets in the balance sheets. Inspection costs
are capitalized or charged to expense based on the nature of the work performed.

Power, and Southern Company GAS. Under these agreements, each of the retail operating companies,
Southern Power, and Southern Company GAS may be jointly and severally liable. The creditworthiness
of Southern Power and Southern Company GAS is currently inferior to the creditworthiness of the
retail operating companies. Accordingly, Southern Company has entered into keep-well agreements
with the Company and each of the other retail operating companies to insure the Company will not
subsidize or be responsible for any costs, losses, liabilities, or damages resulting from the
inclusion of Southern Power or Southern Company GAS as a contracting party under these agreements.

Operating Leases

The Company has entered into rental agreements for coal rail cars, vehicles, and other equipment
with various terms and expiration dates. These expenses totaled $27.3 million in 2005, $28.3
million in 2004, and $29.5 million in 2003. Of these amounts, $17.8 million, $16.3 million, and
$19.4 million for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, relates to the rail car leases and are
recoverable through the Company’s Rate ECR. At December 31, 2005, estimated minimum rental

leases expire in 2006 and 2009, and the Company’s maximum obligations are $66 million and $20
million, respectively. At the termination of the leases, at the Company’s option, the Company may
negotiate an extension, exercise its purchase option, or the property can be sold to a third party.
The Company expects that the fair market value of the leased property would substantially
eliminate the Company’s payments under the residual value obligations.

Guarantees

At December 31, 2005, the Company had outstanding guarantees related to SEGCO’s purchase of certain

NUCLEAR INSURANCE

Under the Price-Anderson Amendment Act (Act), the Company maintains agreements of indemnity with
the NRC that, together with private insurance, cover third-party liability arising from any nuclear
incident occurring at Plant Farley. The Act provides funds up to $10.8 billion for public
liability claims that could arise from a single nuclear incident. Plant Farley is insured against
this liability to a maximum of $300 million by American Nuclear Insurers (ANI), with the remaining
coverage provided by a mandatory program of deferred premiums that could be assessed, after a
nuclear incident, against all owners of nuclear reactors. The Company could be assessed up to $101
million per incident for each licensed reactor it operates but not more than an aggregate of $15
million per incident to be paid in a calendar year for each reactor. Such maximum assessment,
excluding any applicable state premium taxes, for the Company is $201 million per incident but not
more than an aggregate of $30 million to be paid for each incident in any one year.

The Company is a member of Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), a mutual insurer
established to provide property damage insurance in an amount up to $500 million for members’
nuclear generating facilities.

Additionally, the Company has policies that currently provide decontamination, excess property
insurance, and premature decommissioning coverage up to $2.3 billion for losses in excess of the
$500 million primary coverage. This excess insurance is also provided by NEIL.

NEIL also covers the additional costs that would be incurred in obtaining replacement power
during a prolonged accidental outage at a member’s nuclear plant. Members can purchase this
coverage, subject to a deductible waiting period of up to 26 weeks, with a

II-126


NOTES (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2005 Annual Report

maximum per occurrence per unit limit of $490 million. After this deductible period, weekly
indemnity payments would be received until either the unit is operational or until the limit is
exhausted in approximately three years. The Company purchases the maximum limit allowed by NEIL
and has elected a 12-week waiting period.

Under each of the NEIL policies, members are subject to assessments if losses each year exceed
the accumulated funds available to the insurer under that policy. The current maximum annual
assessments for the Company under the NEIL policies would be $41 million.

Following the terrorist attacks of September 2001, both ANI and NEIL confirmed that terrorist
acts against commercial nuclear power plants would, subject to the normal policy limits, be covered
under their insurance. Both companies, however, revised their policy terms on a prospective basis
to include an industry aggregate for all “non-certified” terrorist acts, i.e., acts that are not
certified acts of terrorism pursuant to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, which was renewed
in 2005. The aggregate for all NEIL policies, which applies to non-certified property claims
stemming from terrorism within a 12 month duration, is $3.2 billion plus any amounts available
through reinsurance or indemnity from an outside source. The non-certified ANI nuclear liability
cap is a $300 million shared industry aggregate during the normal ANI policy period.

For all on-site property damage insurance policies for commercial nuclear power plants, the
NRC requires that the proceeds of such policies shall be dedicated first for the sole purpose of
placing the reactor in a safe and stable condition after an accident.
Any remaining proceeds are to be applied next toward the costs of decontamination and debris removal operations ordered by the
NRC, and any further remaining proceeds are to be paid either to the Company or to its bond
trustees as may be appropriate under the policies and applicable trust indentures.

All retrospective assessments, whether generated for liability, property, or replacement
power, may be subject to applicable state premium taxes.

GEORGIA POWER COMPANY

FINANCIAL SECTION

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Georgia Power Company:

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements of capitalization of Georgia Power
Company (the “Company”) (a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company) as of December 31, 2005 and
2004, and the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder’s equity, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control
over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An
audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements (pages II-152 to II-184) present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Georgia Power Company at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Georgia Power Company 2005 Annual Report

OVERVIEW

Business Activities

Georgia Power Company (the Company) operates as a vertically integrated utility providing
electricity to retail customers within its traditional service area located within the State of
Georgia and to wholesale customers in the Southeast.

Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Company’s primary business
of selling electricity. These factors include the ability to maintain a stable regulatory
environment, to achieve energy sales growth while containing costs, and to recover rising costs.
These costs include those related to growing demand, increasingly stringent environmental
standards, and fuel prices. In December 2004, the Company completed a major retail rate proceeding
that is expected to provide earnings stability (2004 Retail Rate Plan). This regulatory action
also enables the recovery of substantial capital investments to facilitate the continued
reliability of the transmission and distribution network and continued environmental improvements
at the generating plants. Appropriately balancing environmental expenditures with customer prices
will continue to challenge the Company for the foreseeable future. The Company expects further
rate proceedings in 2006 to address fuel cost recovery due to higher than expected fuel costs for
coal and natural gas.

On December 13, 2005, the Company and Savannah Electric and Power Company (Savannah
Electric) entered into a merger agreement, under which Savannah Electric will merge into the
Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation (the Merger). The Merger must
be approved by Savannah Electric’s preferred shareholders and is subject to receipt of certain
regulatory approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Georgia Public
Service Commission (PSC), and the Federal Communications Commission. Pending regulatory
approvals, the Merger is expected to be completed by July 2006. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL –
“Merger” and Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters – Merger” for
additional information.

Key Performance Indicators

In striving to maximize shareholder value while providing low-cost energy to more than two
million customers, the Company continues to focus on several key indicators. These indicators
include customer satisfaction, plant availability, system reliability, and net income. The
Company’s financial success is directly tied to the satisfaction of its customers. Key elements
of ensuring customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high reliability, and competitive
prices. Management uses customer satisfaction surveys and reliability indicators to evaluate
the Company’s results.

Peak season equivalent forced outage rate (Peak Season EFOR) is an indicator of
fossil/hydro plant availability and efficient generation fleet operations during the months when
generation needs are greatest. The rate is calculated by dividing the number of hours of forced
outages by total generation hours. Transmission and distribution system reliability performance
is measured by the frequency and duration of outages. Performance targets for reliability are
set internally based on historical performance, expected weather conditions, and expected
capital expenditures. Net income is the primary component of the Company’s contribution to
Southern Company’s earnings per share goal.

The Company’s 2005 results compared to its targets for some of these indicators are
reflected in the following chart.

See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for additional information on the Company’s financial
performance. The strong financial performance achieved in 2005 reflects the focus that
management places on these indicators, as well as the commitment shown by the employees in
achieving or exceeding management’s expectations.

Earnings

The Company’s 2005 earnings totaled $715 million representing a $57 million (8.7 percent) increase
over 2004. Operating income increased in 2005 due to higher base retail revenues resulting from
the retail rate increase

Georgia Power Company 2005 Annual Report

effective January 1, 2005 and more favorable weather, as well as higher wholesale revenues
resulting from new
contracts effective January 1, 2005, partially offset by increased non-fuel operating expenses.
The Company’s 2004 earnings totaled $658 million representing a $27
million (4.3 percent) increase over 2003. Operating income increased in 2004 due to higher base
retail revenues attributable to more favorable weather and customer growth during the year,
partially offset by higher non-fuel operating expenses. In addition, lower depreciation and
amortization expense resulting from a Georgia PSC three-year retail rate plan approved in 2001
(2001 Retail Rate Plan) significantly offset increased purchased power capacity expenses. The
Company’s 2003 earnings totaled $631 million, representing a $13 million (2.1 percent) increase
over 2002 despite lower base retail revenues resulting from the extremely mild summer weather.
Higher wholesale revenues and lower non-fuel operating expenses contributed to the 2003 increase.

Retail base revenues of $3.6 billion in 2005 increased by $351 million (10.9 percent)
from 2004 primarily due to the retail rate increase effective January 1, 2005, sustained economic
strength, customer growth, more favorable weather, and generally higher prices to large business
customers. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters – Rate Plans”
for additional information. Retail base revenues
of $3.2 billion in 2004 increased by $183 million (6.0 percent) from 2003 primarily due to an
improved economy, customer growth, generally higher prices to the Company’s large business
customers, and more favorable weather. Retail base revenues of $3 billion in 2003 decreased by $36
million (1.2 percent) from 2002 primarily due to extremely mild summer temperatures and the
sluggish economy.

Electric rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, the
energy component of purchased power costs, and certain other costs. Under these fuel cost recovery
provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses, including the fuel component of purchased
energy, and do not affect net income. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “PSC Matters – Fuel Cost
Recovery” herein for additional information.

Revenues from unit power sales contracts remained relatively constant in 2005 and 2004.
Revenues from unit power sales contracts decreased slightly in 2003 due to decreased energy sales.
Revenues from other non-affiliated sales increased $272 million (148.6 percent) in 2005 and
decreased $12 million (6.2 percent) and $8 million (3.9 percent) in 2004 and 2003, respectively.
The increase in 2005 is due to new contracts with thirty electric membership corporation customers
that went into effect in January 2005 which increased the demand for energy. The capacity
component of these transactions increased $73.2 million in 2005 over 2004.

Revenues from sales to affiliated companies within the Southern Company electric system, as
well as purchases of energy, will vary from year to year depending on demand and the availability
and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliated sales and purchases are made in
accordance with the Intercompany Interchange Contract (IIC), as approved by the FERC. In 2005,
kilowatt-hour (KWH) energy sales to affiliates increased 1.5 percent due to higher demand, while
the increase in associated revenues was 59.4 percent due to higher fuel prices. In 2004, KWH
energy sales to affiliates decreased 18.2 percent due to lower demand. However, the decline in
associated revenues was only 4.9 percent due to higher fuel prices. In 2003, KWH energy sales to
affiliates increased 47.5 percent due to the combination of increased demand by Southern Power to
meet contractual obligations and the availability of power due to milder-than-normal weather in the
Company’s service territory. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since
this energy is generally sold at marginal cost.

Other operating revenues increased $25.7 million (14.2 percent) in 2005 from 2004 primarily
due to higher transmission revenues of $16 million related to work performed for the other owners
of the integrated transmission system in the State of Georgia and higher revenues under the open
access tariff agreement, higher outdoor lighting revenues of $5.4 million, and higher customer fees
that went into effect in January 2005 of $5.9 million. Other operating revenues increased $11.7
million (6.9 percent) in 2004 over 2003 primarily due to higher revenues from outdoor lighting of
$4.2 million and pole attachment rentals of $4.9 million and higher gains on sales of emission
allowances of $2 million. Other operating revenues increased $4 million (2.4 percent) in 2003 from
the prior year primarily due to an increase in the open access transmission tariff rate, which
increased revenues $7 million, and higher revenues from increased customer demand for outdoor
lighting services of $4 million, partially offset by lower revenues from the rental of electric
property of $4 million.

Residential KWH sales increased 2.9 percent in 2005 over 2004 due to more favorable weather,
customer growth of 1.7 percent, and a 1.1 percent increase in the average energy consumption per
customer. Commercial KWH sales increased 6.3 percent due to more favorable weather, sustained
economic strength, customer growth of 1.8 percent, and a reclassification of customers from
industrial to commercial to be consistent with the rate structure approved by the Georgia PSC when
compared

to 2004. Industrial sales decreased 5.0 percent primarily due to this reclassification of
customers.

Residential KWH sales increased 5.3 percent in 2004 from 2003 due to more favorable weather
and a 1.9 percent increase in residential customers. Commercial KWH sales increased 4.0 percent in
2004 due to an improved economy and a 2.8 percent increase in commercial customers. Industrial
sales increased 2.5 percent in 2004 due to the improved economy.

Residential KWH sales decreased 1.7 percent in 2003 from 2002 due to the effect of the milder
summer weather, despite the 2.0 percent increase in residential customers. Commercial KWH sales in
2003 declined slightly due to the milder summer weather, while industrial KWH sales declined
slightly due to the sluggish economy. Average retail sales growth assuming normal weather is
expected to be 2.1 percent from 2006 to 2010.

Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses

Fuel costs constitute the single largest expense for the Company. The mix of fuel sources for
generation of electricity is determined primarily by system load, the unit cost of fuel consumed,
and the availability of generating units. The amount and sources of generation, the average cost
of fuel per net KWH generated, and the average cost of purchased power per net KWH were as follows:

Fuel expense increased 48.5 percent in 2005 from the prior year primarily due to an increase
in the average cost of fuel, particularly natural gas, and a 12.3 percent increase in generation to
meet higher demand. Fuel expense increased 11.6 percent in 2004 over 2003 primarily due to an
increase in the average cost of coal and natural gas. Fuel expense increased 10.1 percent in 2003
over 2002 due to an increase in generation of 3.9 percent because of higher wholesale energy
demands and a 2.8 percent higher average cost of fuel due to the higher prices of coal and natural
gas in 2003.

Purchased power expense increased $194 million (19.9 percent) in 2005, $200 million (25.9
percent) in 2004, and $92 million (13.3 percent) in 2003. These increases are primarily the
result of new purchased power agreements (PPAs) between the Company and Southern Power that went
into effect in each of 2004, 2003, and 2002. Additional capacity expenses associated with these
PPAs were $30 million, $65 million, and $75 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The
increases in purchased power expenses also reflect the impact of the significant increases in
fuel costs discussed previously.

A significant upward trend in the cost of coal and natural gas has emerged since 2003, and
volatility in these markets is expected to continue. Increased coal prices have been influenced
by a worldwide increase in demand as a result of rapid economic growth in China as well as by
increases in mining costs. Higher natural gas prices in the United States are the result of
increased demand and slightly lower gas supplies despite increased drilling activity. Natural
gas supply interruptions, such as those caused by the 2005 and 2004 hurricanes, result in an
immediate market response; however, the long-term impact of this price volatility may be reduced
by imports of natural gas and liquefied natural gas. Fuel expenses generally do not affect net
income, since they are offset by fuel revenues under the Company’s fuel cost recovery
provisions.

Other Operating Expenses

In 2005, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $81 million (5.8 percent).
Maintenance for generating plant and transmission and distribution increased $23.5 million and
$13.9 million, respectively, as a result of scheduled outages and, to a lesser extent, certain
flexible projects planned for other periods. Increased employee benefit expense of $18.4 million
related to pension and medical benefits and higher property insurance costs of $5.3 million
resulting from storm damage also contributed to the increase. Customer

II-135


MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2005 Annual Report

assistance expense and uncollectible account expense also increased an additional $9.3 million in
2005 over 2004, primarily as a result of promotional expenses related to an energy efficiency
program and an increased number of customer bankruptcies, respectively. In 2004, other operations
and maintenance expenses increased $153 million (12.3 percent) due to the timing of generating
plant maintenance of $39 million and transmission and distribution maintenance of $39 million.
Increased employee benefit expense of $30 million related to pension and medical benefits and
higher workers compensation expense of $8 million also contributed to the increase. In 2003, other
operations and maintenance expenses decreased $78 million (5.9 percent) due to the timing of
generating plant maintenance of $46 million and transmission and distribution maintenance of $8
million and lower severance costs of $8 million.

Depreciation and amortization increased $229 million (83 percent) in 2005 over 2004 primarily
due to the expiration at the end of 2004 of certain provisions of the Company’s 2001 Retail Rate
Plan. In accordance with the 2001 Retail Rate Plan, the Company amortized an accelerated cost
recovery liability as a credit to amortization expense and recognized new Georgia PSC-certified
purchased power costs in rates evenly over the three years ended December 31, 2004. This treatment
resulted in a credit to amortization expense of $187.1 million in 2004 and a total decrease in
depreciation and amortization of $74 million and $54 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. See
Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters — Rate Plans” for additional
information.

Taxes other than income taxes increased $32 million (14.1 percent) primarily due to higher
municipal gross receipts taxes of $18.1 million resulting from increased operating revenues and
higher property taxes of $14.0 million. Taxes other than income taxes increased $15 million (7.0
percent) in 2004 due to higher municipal gross receipts taxes associated with increased operating
revenues. Taxes other than income taxes increased $11 million (5.4 percent) in 2003 due mainly to
a favorable true-up of state property tax valuations in 2002.

Other Income and (Expense)

Allowance for equity funds used during construction remained relatively constant in 2005 and
increased $15.9 million in 2004, primarily due to the construction of the McIntosh combined cycle
Units 10 and 11 which were placed in service in June 2005.

Interest income remained relatively constant in 2005. Interest income decreased $9 million in
2004 and increased $12 million in 2003 when compared to the prior year primarily due to interest on
a favorable income tax settlement of $14.5 million in 2003.

Interest expense increased $38.8 million (21.3 percent) in 2005 from 2004 primarily due to the
issuance of additional senior notes in 2005 and generally higher interest rates on variable rate
debt and commercial paper. Interest expense remained relatively constant in 2004. Interest
expense increased in 2003 primarily due to an increase in senior notes outstanding that was
partially offset by a reduction in short-term debt outstanding. The Company refinanced or retired
$635 million, $400 million, and $665 million of securities in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.
Interest capitalized increased in 2005 and 2004 due to the Plant McIntosh construction referenced
above and decreased in 2003 due to the transfer of a project to Southern Power in 2002.

Other income and (expense), net increased $17.1 million in 2005 from 2004 primarily due to
$14.2 million of additional gas hedge gains. Other income and (expense), net decreased in 2004
primarily due to the $13 million disallowance of Plant McIntosh construction costs in December
2004, partially offset by a $7.5 million decrease in donations and $3.4 million in increased income
from a customer pricing program. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory
Matters – Fuel Hedging Program” and “Plant McIntosh Construction Project” for additional
information.

Effects of Inflation

The Company is subject to rate regulation that is based on the recovery of historical costs. In
addition, the income tax laws are based on historical costs. Therefore, inflation creates an
economic loss because the Company is recovering its costs of investments in dollars that have less
purchasing power. While the inflation rate has been relatively low in recent years, it continues
to have an adverse effect on the Company because of the large investment in utility plant with long
economic lives. Conventional accounting for historical cost does not recognize this economic loss
nor the partially offsetting gain that arises through financing facilities with fixed-

II-136


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2005 Annual Report

money obligations such as long-term debt, preferred stock, and preferred securities. Any
recognition of inflation by regulatory authorities is reflected in the rate of return allowed in
the Company’s approved electric rates.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL

General

The Company operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electricity to retail customers
within its traditional service territory located within the State of Georgia and to wholesale
customers in the Southeast. Prices for electricity provided by the Company to retail customers are
set by the Georgia PSC under cost-based regulatory principles. Prices for electricity relating to
PPAs, interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power are set by the FERC.
Retail rates and revenues are reviewed and adjusted periodically. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES –
“Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Electric Utility Regulation” herein
and Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters” and “FERC Matters” for
additional information about this and other regulatory matters.

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of future
earnings potential. The level of the Company’s future earnings depends on numerous factors that
affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Company’s business of selling electricity.
These factors include the ability of the Company to maintain a stable regulatory environment that
continues to allow for the recovery of all prudently incurred costs. Future earnings in the near
term will depend, in part, upon growth in energy sales, which is subject to a number of factors.
These factors include weather, competition, new energy contracts with neighboring utilities, energy
conservation practiced by customers, the price of electricity, the price elasticity of demand, and
the rate of economic growth in the Company’s service area.

Environmental Matters

New Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil action in the U.S
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against the Company and Alabama Power, alleging
that the Company and Alabama Power had violated the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean
Air Act and related state laws with respect to certain coal-fired generating facilities. Through
subsequent amendments and other legal proceedings, the EPA added Savannah Electric as a defendant
to the original action and filed a separate action against Alabama Power after it was dismissed
from the original action. In these lawsuits, the EPA alleges that NSR violations occurred at eight
coal-fired generating facilities, including the Company’s Plants Bowen and Scherer. The civil
action requests penalties and injunctive relief, including an order requiring the installation of
the best available control technology at the affected units. On June 3, 2005, the U.S. District
for the Northern District of Alabama issued a decision in favor of Alabama Power on two primary
legal issues in the case; however, the decision does not resolve the case, nor does it address
other legal issues associated with the EPA’s allegations. In accordance with a separate court
order, Alabama Power and the EPA are currently participating in mediation with respect to the EPA’s
claims. The action against the Company and Savannah Electric has been administratively closed
since the spring of 2001, and none of the parties has sought to reopen the case. See Note 3 to the
financial statements under “Environmental Matters — New Source Review Actions.”

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act
authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $32,500 per day, per violation at each generating
unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in this matter could
require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly
require payment of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of operations, cash
flows, and possibly financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

In December 2002 and October 2003, the EPA issued final revisions to its NSR regulations under
the Clean Air Act. A coalition of states and environmental organizations filed petitions for
review of these regulations. On June 24, 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit upheld, in part, the EPA’s December 2002 revisions to its NSR regulations, which
included changes to the regulatory exclusions and

II-137


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2005 Annual Report

methods of calculating emissions increases. However, the court vacated portions of those
revisions, including those addressing the exclusion of certain pollution control projects. The
October 2003 revisions, which clarified the scope of the existing Routine Maintenance, Repair and
Replacement exclusion, have been stayed by the Court of Appeals pending its review of the rules.
On October 20, 2005, the EPA also published a proposed rule clarifying the test for determining
when an emissions increase subject to the NSR requirements has occurred. The impact of these
revisions and proposed rules will depend on adoption of the final rules by the EPA and the State of
Georgia’s implementation of such rules, as well as the outcome of any additional legal challenges,
and, therefore, cannot be determined at this time.

Carbon Dioxide Litigation

In July 2004, attorneys general from eight states, each outside of Southern Company’s service
territory, and the corporation counsel for New York City filed a complaint in the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York against Southern Company and four other electric power
companies. A nearly identical complaint was filed by three environmental groups in the same court.
The complaints allege that the companies’ emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas,
contribute to global warming, which the plaintiffs assert is a public nuisance. Under common law
public and private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs seek a judicial order (1) holding each
defendant jointly and severally liable for creating, contributing to, and/or maintaining global
warming and (2) requiring each of the defendants to cap its emissions of carbon dioxide and then
reduce those emissions by a specified percentage each year for at least a decade. Plaintiffs have
not, however, requested that damages be awarded in connection with their claims. Southern Company
believes these claims are without merit and notes that the complaint cites no statutory or
regulatory basis for the claims. In September 2005, the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York granted Southern Company’s and the other defendants’ motions to dismiss these
cases. The plaintiffs filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on
October 19, 2005. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Plant Wansley Environmental Litigation

In December 2002, the Sierra Club, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Georgia Forestwatch, and
one individual filed a civil suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia
against the Company for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act at four of the units at Plant
Wansley. The civil action requests injunctive and declaratory relief, civil penalties, a
supplemental environmental project, and attorneys’ fees. The Clean Air Act authorizes civil
penalties of up to $27,500 per day, per violation at each generating unit. The liability phase of
the case has concluded with the court ruling in favor of the Company in part and the plaintiffs in
part. In March 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit accepted the Company’s
petition for review of the district court’s order, and oral arguments were held on January 24,
2006. The district court case has been administratively closed pending that appeal. If necessary,
the district court will hold a separate trial which will address civil penalties and possible
injunctive relief requested by the plaintiffs. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot
currently be determined; however, an adverse outcome could require substantial capital expenditures
that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly require the payment of substantial
penalties. This could affect future results of operations, cash flows, and possibly financial
condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

Environmental Statutes and Regulations

General

The Company’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by state and federal environmental
agencies under a variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental media, including air,
water, and land resources. Applicable statutes include the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Emergency Planning & Community
Right-to-Know Act; and the Endangered Species Act.

Compliance with these environmental requirements involves significant capital and operating
costs, a major portion of which is expected to be recovered through existing ratemaking provisions.
Through 2005, the Company had invested approximately $1.2 billion in

II-138


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2005 Annual Report

capital projects to comply with these requirements, with annual costs of $117.4 million, $47.4
million, and $105.7 million for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Over the next decade, the
Company expects that capital expenditures could exceed an additional $3.3 billion to assure
compliance with existing and new regulations, including $410 million, $674.6 million, and $515.8
million for 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively. Because the Company’s compliance strategy is
impacted by changes to existing environmental laws and regulations, the cost, availability, and
existing inventory of emission allowances, and the Company’s fuel mix, the ultimate outcome cannot
be determined at this time.
Environmental costs that are known and estimable at this time are included in capital expenditures
discussed under FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – “Capital Requirements and Contractual
Obligations” herein.

Compliance with possible additional federal or state legislation or regulations related to
global climate change, air quality, or other environmental and health concerns could also
significantly affect the Company. New environmental legislation or regulations, or changes to
existing statutes or regulations, could affect many areas of the Company’s operations; however, the
full impact of any such changes cannot be determined at this time.

Air Quality

Compliance with the Clean Air Act and resulting regulations has been and will continue to be a
significant focus for the Company. Through 2005, the Company had spent approximately $787.9
million in reducing sulfur dioxide (SO


) and nitrogen oxide (NO

x

) emissions
and in monitoring emissions pursuant to the Clean Air Act. Additional controls have been announced
and are currently being installed at several plants to further reduce SO


and
NO

x

emissions, maintain compliance with existing regulations, and to meet new
requirements.

Approximately $699.8 million of these expenditures are related to reducing NO

x

emissions pursuant to state and federal requirements in connection with the EPA’s one-hour
ozone standard and the 1998 regional NO

x

reduction rules. Although the State of Georgia
was originally included in the states subject to the regional NO

x

rules, the EPA, in
August 2005, stayed compliance with these requirements and initiated rulemakings to address issues
raised in a petition for reconsideration filed by a coalition of Georgia industries. The impact of
the 1998 regional NO

x

reduction rules for Georgia will depend on the outcome of the
petition for reconsideration and/or any subsequent development and approval of the State of
Georgia’s state implementation plan.

In 2005, the EPA revoked the one-hour ozone standard and published the final set of rules
for implementation of the new, more stringent eight-hour ozone standard. Areas within the
Company’s service area that have been designated as nonattainment under the eight-hour ozone
standard include Macon (Georgia) and a 20-county area within metropolitan Atlanta. State
implementation plans, including new emission control regulations necessary to bring those areas
into attainment are required for most areas by June 2007. These state implementation plans could
require further reductions in NO

x

emissions from power plants.

During 2005, the EPA’s fine particulate matter “nonattainment” designations became
effective for several areas within the Company’s service area in Georgia, and the EPA proposed a
rule for the implementation of the fine particulate matter standard. The EPA plans to finalize
the proposed implementation rule in 2006. State plans for addressing the nonattainment
designations are required by April 2008 and could require further reductions in SO


and NO

x

emissions from power plants. The EPA has also published proposed revisions
to lower the level of particulate matter currently allowed.

The EPA issued the final Clean Air Interstate Rule on March 10, 2005. This cap-and-trade rule
addresses power plant SO


and NO

x

emissions that were found to contribute to
nonattainment of the eight-hour ozone and fine particulate matter standards in downwind states.
Twenty-eight eastern states, including the State of Georgia, are subject to the requirements of the
rule. The rule calls for additional reductions of NO

x

and/or SO


to be
achieved in two phases, 2009/2010 and 2015. These reductions will be accomplished by the
installation of additional emission controls at the Company’s coal-fired facilities or by the
purchase of emission allowances from a cap-and-trade program.

The Clean Air Visibility Rule (formerly called the Regional Haze Rule) was finalized on
July 6, 2005. The goal of this rule is to restore natural visibility conditions in certain
areas (primarily national parks

II-139


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2005 Annual Report

and wilderness areas) by 2064. The rule involves the application of Best Available Retrofit
Technology (BART) requirements and a review each decade, beginning in 2018, of progress toward
the goal. BART requires that sources that contribute to visibility impairment implement
additional emission reductions, if necessary, to make progress toward remedying current
visibility concerns. For power plants, the Clean Air Visibility Rule allows states to determine
that the Clean Air Interstate Rule satisfies BART requirements for SO


and
NO

x

. However, additional requirements could be imposed. By December 17, 2007,
states must submit implementation plans that contain emission reduction strategies for
implementing BART requirements and for achieving sufficient and reasonable progress toward the
goal.

On March 15, 2005, the EPA announced the final Clean Air Mercury Rule, a cap-and-trade
program for the reduction of mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. The rule sets caps
on mercury emissions to be implemented in two phases, 2010 and 2018, and provides for an
emission allowance trading market. The Company anticipates that emission controls installed to
achieve compliance with the Clean Air Interstate Rule and the eight-hour ozone and
fine-particulate standards will also result in mercury emission reductions. However, the
long-term capability of emission control equipment to reduce mercury emissions is still being
evaluated, and the installation of additional control technologies may be required.

The impacts of the eight-hour ozone standard, the fine particulate matter nonattainment
designations, the Clean Air Interstate Rule, the Clean Air Visibility Rule, and the Clear Air
Mercury Rule on the Company, will depend on the development and implementation of rules at the
state level. States implementing the Clean Air Mercury Rule and the Clear Air Interstate Rule,
in particular, have the option not to participate in the national cap-and-trade programs and
could require reductions greater than those mandated by the federal rules. Such impacts will
also depend on resolution of pending legal challenges to the Clean Air Interstate Rule, the
Clean Air Mercury Rule and a related petition from the State of North Carolina under section 126
of the Clean Air Act, also related to the interstate transport of air pollutants. Therefore,
the full impacts of these regulations on the Company cannot be determined at this time.
The Company has developed and continually updates a comprehensive environmental compliance
strategy to comply with the continuing and new environmental requirements discussed above. As
part of this strategy, the Company plans to install additional SO


, NO

x ,

and mercury emission controls within the next several years to assure continued
compliance with applicable air quality requirements.

Water Quality

In July 2004, the EPA published final rules under the Clean Water Act for the purpose of
reducing impingement and entrainment of fish and fish larvae at power plants’ cooling water
intake structures. The new rules require baseline biological information and, perhaps,
installation of fish protection technology near some intake structures at existing power plants.

The Company is installing cooling towers at additional facilities under the Clean Water Act
to cool water prior to discharge. Near Atlanta, a cooling tower for one plant was completed in
2004 and two others are scheduled for completion in 2008. The total estimated cost of these
projects is $173 million, with $85 million remaining to be spent. The Company is also
conducting a study of the aquatic environment at another facility to determine if further
thermal controls are necessary at that plant.

The full impact of these new rules will depend on the results of studies and analyses
performed as part of the rules’ implementation and the actual requirements established by the
State of Georgia, and therefore, cannot be determined at this time

Environmental Remediation

The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling and
disposal of waste and release of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations,
the Company could incur substantial costs to clean up properties. The Company conducts studies to
determine the extent of any required cleanup and has recognized in its financial statements the
costs to clean up and monitor known sites. Amounts for cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs were
not material for any year presented. The Company may be liable for some or all required cleanup
costs for additional sites that may require environmental remediation. See Note 3 to the financial
statements under “Environmental Remediation” for additional information.

II-140


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Under Georgia PSC ratemaking provisions, $22 million has been deferred in a regulatory
liability account related to certain environmental insurance settlements. Under the 2004 Retail
Rate Plan, this regulatory liability is being amortized as a credit to expense over a three-year
period that began January 1, 2005. However, the Georgia PSC also approved an annual environmental
accrual of $5.4 million. Environmental remediation expenditures are being charged against the
resulting reserve as they are incurred. The annual accrual amount will be reviewed and adjusted in
future regulatory proceedings.

Global Climate Issues

Domestic efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions have been spurred by international
discussions surrounding the Framework Convention on Climate Change, and specifically the Kyoto
Protocol — which proposes constraints on the emissions of greenhouse gases for a group of
industrialized countries. The Bush Administration has not supported U.S. ratification of the
Kyoto Protocol or other mandatory carbon dioxide reduction legislation; however, in 2002, it did
announce a goal to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of the U.S. – the ratio of greenhouse gas
emissions to the value of U.S. economic output — by 18 percent by 2012. A year later, the
Department of Energy (DOE) announced the Climate VISION program to support this goal.
Energy-intensive industries, including electricity generation, are the initial focus of this
program. Southern Company is involved in the development of a voluntary electric utility sector
climate change initiative in partnership with the government. In a memorandum of understanding
signed in December 2004 with the DOE under Climate VISION, the utility sector pledged to reduce
its greenhouse gas emissions rate by 3 percent to 5 percent by 2010-2012. The Company is
continuing to evaluate future energy and emissions profiles relative to the Climate VISION
program and is analyzing voluntary programs to support the industry initiative.

FERC Matters

Market-Based Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates at market-based
prices. The Company also has FERC authority to
make short-term opportunity sales at market rates. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with
respect to a market-based contract with an affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation
dominance within its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in
other markets is not an issue in that proceeding. In February 2005, Southern Company submitted
responsive information. In February 2006, the FERC suspended the proceeding. Any new
market-based rate transactions in its retail service territory entered into after February 27,
2005 are subject to refund to the level of the default cost-based rates, pending the outcome of
the proceeding. The impact of such sales through December 31, 2005 is not expected to exceed
$4.9 million. The refund period covers 15 months. In the event that the FERC’s default
mitigation measures for entities that are found to have market power are ultimately applied, the
Company may be required to charge cost-based rates for certain wholesale sales in the Southern
Company retail service territory, which may be lower than negotiated market-based rates. The
final outcome of this matter will depend on the form in which the final methodology for
assessing generation market power and mitigation rules may be ultimately adopted and cannot be
determined at this time.

In addition, in May 2005, the FERC started an investigation to determine whether Southern
Company satisfies the other three parts of the FERC’s market-based rate analysis: transmission
market power, barriers to entry, and affiliate abuse or reciprocal dealing. The FERC established a
new refund period related to this expanded investigation. Any and all new market-based rate
transactions both inside and outside Southern Company’s retail service territory involving any
Southern Company subsidiary, including the Company, will be subject to refund to the extent the
FERC orders lower rates as a result of this new investigation, with the 15-month refund period
beginning July 19, 2005. The impact of such sales through December 31, 2005 is not expected to
exceed $10.9 million, of which $3.2 million relates to sales inside the retail service territory as
discussed above. The FERC also directed that this expanded proceeding be held in abeyance pending
the outcome of the proceeding on the IIC discussed below.

The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for this proceeding and is vigorously
defending itself in this matter. However, the final outcome of this

II-141


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2005 Annual Report

matter, including any remedies to be applied in the event of an adverse ruling in this proceeding,
cannot now be determined.

Intercompany Interchange Contract

The Company’s generation fleet in its retail service territory is operated under the IIC, as
approved by the FERC. In May 2005, the FERC also initiated a new proceeding to examine (1) the
provisions of the IIC among Alabama Power, the Company, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, Savannah
Electric, Southern Power, and Southern Company Services, Inc., as agent, under the terms of which the power pool of Southern
Company is operated, and, in particular, the propriety of the continued inclusion of Southern Power
as a party to the IIC, (2) whether any parties to the IIC have violated the FERC’s standards of
conduct applicable to utility companies that are transmission providers, and (3) whether Southern
Company’s code of conduct defining Southern Power as a “system company” rather than a “marketing
affiliate” is just and reasonable. In connection with the formation of Southern Power, the FERC
authorized Southern Power’s inclusion in the IIC in 2000. The FERC also previously approved
Southern Company’s code of conduct. The FERC order directs that the administrative law judge who
presided over the McIntosh PPA proceeding discussed herein under “PSC Matters – Plant McIntosh
Construction Project”, be assigned to preside over the hearing in this proceeding and that the
testimony and exhibits presented in that proceeding be preserved to the extent appropriate.
Hearings are scheduled for September 2006. Effective July 19, 2005, revenues from transactions
under the IIC involving any Southern Company subsidiaries, including the Company, are subject to
refund to the extent the FERC orders any changes to the IIC.

The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for this proceeding and is vigorously
defending itself in this matter. However, the final outcome of this matter, including any remedies
to be applied in the event of an adverse ruling in this proceeding, cannot now be determined.

Generation Interconnection Agreements

In July 2003, the FERC issued its final rule on the standardization of generation
interconnection agreements and procedures (Order 2003). Order 2003 shifts much of the financial
burden of new transmission investment from the generator to the transmission provider. The FERC
has indicated that Order 2003, which was effective January 20, 2004, is to be applied
prospectively to interconnection agreements. Subsidiaries of Tenaska, Inc., as counterparties
to three previously executed interconnection agreements with subsidiaries of Southern Company,
including the Company, have filed complaints at the FERC requesting that the FERC modify the
agreements and that the Company refund a total of $7.9 million previously paid for
interconnection facilities, with interest. The Company has opposed all such requests, and the
proceedings are still pending. The impact of Order 2003 and its subsequent rehearings on the
Company and the final results of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Transmission

In December 1999, the FERC issued its final rule on Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs).
Since that time, there have been a number of additional proceedings at the FERC designed to
encourage further voluntary formation of RTOs or to mandate their formation. However, at the
current time, there are no active proceedings that would require the Company to participate in an
RTO. Current FERC efforts that may potentially change the regulatory and/or operational structure
of transmission include rules related to the standardization of generation interconnection, as well
as an inquiry into, among other things, market power by vertically integrated utilities. See
“Generation Interconnection Agreements” and “Market-Based Rate Authority” herein for additional
information. The final outcome of these proceedings cannot now be determined. However, the
Company’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected by
future changes in the federal regulatory or operational structure of transmission.

PSC Matters

Merger

In connection with the Merger, the Company and Savannah Electric plan to establish a coastal
regional organization for the Company that will be operating following completion of the Merger.
Management expects that current Savannah Electric employees will fill most of the positions in the
new regional organization.

II-142


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2005 Annual Report

While the Georgia PSC does not have specific approval authority over the merger of electric
utilities, in January 2006, the Company and Savannah Electric filed an application with the Georgia
PSC for certain approvals necessary to complete the Merger. In particular, the Company and
Savannah Electric are seeking the approval of the Georgia PSC with respect to the following
matters:

•

the transfer of Savannah Electric’s generating facilities and
certification of the generating facilities as the Company’s assets;

•

amendments to the Company’s Integrated Resource Plan to add the
current Savannah Electric’s customers and generating facilities;

•

the transfer of Savannah Electric’s assigned service territory to the
Company;

•

adoption of the Company’s service rules and regulations to the current
Savannah Electric customers;

•

new fuel rate and base rate schedules that would apply to the
Company’s sale of electricity to the current Savannah Electric
customers;

•

adoption of a “merger transition adjustment” rate that would be used
to more closely align Savannah Electric’s existing base rates to those
of the Company and a “merger transition credit” rate that would credit
the additional revenues collected from former Savannah Electric
customers to the Company’s existing customers; and

•

the issuance of additional shares of the Company’s common stock to
Southern Company in exchange for Southern Company’s shares of Savannah
Electric common stock.

The Company has also requested the Georgia PSC to better align the rates for Savannah
Electric’s customers with those of the Company. Currently, Savannah Electric customers pay
slightly lower base rates and significantly higher fuel rates than the Company’s customers. The
overall effect is that Savannah Electric customers pay substantially higher overall costs for
electricity. See “Fuel Cost Recovery” herein for additional information.

Rate Plans

In December 2004, the Georgia PSC approved the 2004 Retail Rate Plan for the three-year period
ending December 31, 2007. Under the terms of the 2004 Retail Rate Plan, earnings are being
evaluated annually against a retail return on common equity (ROE) range of 10.25 percent to 12.25 percent. Two-thirds of
any earnings above 12.25 percent will be applied to rate refunds, with the remaining one-third
retained by the Company. Retail rates were increased by approximately $194 million and customer
fees were increased by approximately $9 million effective January 1, 2005 to cover the higher
costs of purchased power; operation and maintenance expenses; environmental compliance; and
continued investment in new generation, transmission and distribution facilities to support
growth and ensure reliability. In 2005 the Company recorded $2.7 million revenue subject to
refund for estimated earnings above 12.25 percent retail ROE.

The Company is required to file a general rate case by July 1, 2007, in response to which the
Georgia PSC would be expected to determine whether the 2004 Retail Rate Plan should be continued,
modified, or discontinued. Until then, the Company will not file for a general base rate increase
unless its projected retail ROE falls below 10.25 percent. However, in connection with the Merger,
the Company has requested Georgia PSC approval of a “merger transition adjustment” that would be
used to adjust Savannah Electric’s existing base rates to more closely match the existing base
rates for the Company. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters -
Rate Plans” for additional information.

Plant McIntosh Construction Project

In December 2002 after a competitive bidding process, the Georgia PSC certified PPAs between
Southern Power and the Company and Savannah Electric for capacity from Plant McIntosh Units 10
and 11, construction of which was completed in June 2005. In April 2003, Southern Power applied
for FERC approval of these PPAs. In July 2003, the FERC accepted the PPAs to become effective
June 1, 2005, subject to refund, and ordered that hearings be held. Intervenors opposed the
FERC’s acceptance of the PPAs, alleging that they did not meet the applicable standards for
market-based rates between affiliates. To ensure the timely completion of the Plant McIntosh
construction project and the availability of the units in the summer of 2005 for their retail
customers, in May 2004, the Company and Savannah Electric requested the Georgia PSC to direct
them to acquire the Plant McIntosh construction project. The Georgia PSC issued such an order
and the transfer occurred on May 24, 2004 at a total cost of approximately $415 million,
including $14 million of transmission interconnection facilities.

II-143


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Subsequently, Southern Power filed a request to withdraw the PPAs and to terminate the ongoing
FERC proceedings. In August 2004, the FERC issued a notice accepting the request to withdraw
the PPAs and permitting such request to become effective by operation of law. However, the
FERC made no determination on what additional steps may need to be taken with respect to
testimony provided in the proceedings. See “FERC Matters — Intercompany Interchange Contract”
above for additional information.

In connection with the 2004 Retail Rate Plan, the Georgia PSC approved the transfer of the
Plant McIntosh construction project at a total fair market value of approximately $385 million.
This value reflected an approximate $16 million disallowance, of which $13 million was
attributable to the Company, and reduced the Company’s 2004 net income by approximately $8
million. The Georgia PSC also certified a total completion cost of $547 million for the
project. In June 2005, Plant McIntosh Units 10 and 11 were placed in service at a total cost
that did not exceed the certified amount. Under the 2004 Retail Rate Plan, the Plant McIntosh
revenue requirements impact will be reflected in the Company’s rates evenly over the three years
ending 2007. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters — Rate
Plans” and “Plant McIntosh Construction Project” for additional information.

Fuel Cost Recovery

The Company has established fuel cost recovery rates approved by the Georgia PSC. In recent
months, the Company has experienced higher than expected fuel costs for coal and natural gas.
Those higher fuel costs have increased the under recovered fuel costs included in the balance
sheets herein.

In May 2005, the Georgia PSC approved the Company’s request to increase customer fuel rates by
approximately 9.5 percent to recover under recovered fuel costs of approximately $508 million
existing as of May 31, 2005 over a four-year period that began June 1, 2005. Under recovered fuel
amounts for the period subsequent to June 1, 2005 totaled $327.5 million through December 31, 2005.
The Georgia PSC’s order instructed that such amounts be reviewed semi-annually beginning February
2006. If the amount under or over recovered exceeds $50 million at the evaluation date, the
Company would be required to file for a temporary fuel rate change. In addition, Savannah
Electric’s under recovered fuel costs totaled $77.7 million at December 31, 2005. In accordance
with the Georgia PSC order, Savannah Electric was scheduled to file an additional request for a
fuel cost recovery increase in January 2006. The Company has agreed with a Georgia PSC staff
recommendation to forego the temporary fuel rate process, and Savannah Electric has postponed its
scheduled filing. Instead, the Company and Savannah Electric will file a combined request in March
2006 to increase the Company’s fuel cost recovery rate.

The case will seek approval of a fuel cost recovery rate based upon future fuel cost
projections for the combined Company and Savannah Electric generating fleet as well as the under
recovered fuel balances existing at June 30, 2006. The new fuel cost recovery rate would be billed
beginning in July 2006 to all of the Company’s customers, including the existing Savannah Electric
customers. Under recovered amounts as of the date of the Merger will be paid by the appropriate
customer groups.

In August 2005, the Georgia PSC initiated an investigation of Savannah Electric’s fuel
practices. In February 2006, an investigation of the Company’s fuel practices was initiated. The
Company and Savannah Electric are responding to data requests and cooperating in the
investigations. The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Fuel cost recovery revenues as recorded on the financial statements are adjusted for
differences in actual recoverable cost and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly,
any increase in the billing factor would have no significant effect on the Company’s revenues or
net income, but would increase annual cash flow.

Nuclear

As part of a potential expansion of Plant Vogtle, the Company and Southern Nuclear have notified
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) of their intent to apply for an early site permit (ESP)
this year and a combined construction and operating license (COL) in 2008. In addition, a
reactor design from Westinghouse Electric Company has been selected and a purchase agreement is
being negotiated. Participation agreements have been reached with each of the existing Plant
Vogtle co-owners. See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional information on these
co-owners. At this point, no final decision has

II-144


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2005 Annual Report

been made regarding actual construction. The NRC’s streamlined licensing process for new
nuclear units allows utilities to seek regulatory approval at various stages. These stages
include design certification, which is obtained by the reactor vendor, and the ESP and COL,
which are each obtained by the owner-operators of the units. An ESP indicates site approval is
obtained before a company decides to build and the COL provides regulatory approval for building
and operating the plant. In addition, any generation by the Company must be certified by the
Georgia PSC.

Southern Company also is participating in NuStart Energy Development, LLC (NuStart Energy),
a broad-based nuclear industry consortium formed to share the cost of developing a COL and the
related NRC review. NuStart Energy plans to complete detailed engineering design work and to
prepare COL applications for two advanced reactor designs, then to choose one of the
applications and file it for NRC review and approval. The COL ultimately is expected to be
transferred to one or more of the consortium companies; however, at this time, none of them have
committed to build a new nuclear plant.

Other Matters

In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 87, Employers’
Accounting for Pensions, the Company recorded non-cash pension income, before tax, of approximately
$21 million, $35 million, and $54 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Postretirement
benefit costs for the Company were $47 million, $44 million, and $41 million in 2005, 2004, and
2003, respectively. Both pension and postretirement costs are expected to trend upward. Such
amounts are dependent on several factors including trust earnings and changes to the plans. A
portion of pension income and postretirement benefit costs is capitalized based on
construction-related labor charges. For the Company, pension income or expense and postretirement
benefit costs are a component of the regulated rates and generally do not have a long-term effect
on net income. For more information regarding pension and postretirement benefits, see Note 2 to
the financial statements.

The Company is involved in various other matters being litigated and regulatory matters that
could affect future earnings. See Note 3 to the financial statements for information regarding
material issues.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may
have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations and related disclosures.
Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different
from those recorded in the financial statements. Management has reviewed and discussed critical
accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of Southern Company’s Board of
Directors.

Electric Utility Regulation

The Company is subject to retail regulation by the Georgia PSC and wholesale regulation by the
FERC. These regulatory agencies set the rates the Company is permitted to charge customers
based on allowable costs. As a result, the Company applies FASB Statement No. 71, Accounting
for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, which requires the financial statements to
reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the ratemaking process, the regulators may
require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when they would be
recognized by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of expenses
and the recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery through
rates or the deferral of gains or creation of liabilities and the recording of related
regulatory liabilities. The application of Statement No. 71 has a further effect on the
Company’s financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the
ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from those actually incurred by the Company;
therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation, nuclear
decommissioning, and pension and postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on the
Company’s results of operations than they would on a non-regulated company.

As reflected in Note 1 to the financial statements under “Regulatory Assets and
Liabilities,” significant regulatory assets and liabilities have been recorded.

II-145


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of these regulatory assets and liabilities based
on applicable regulatory guidelines and accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. However, adverse legislative, judicial, or regulatory actions could materially impact
the amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could adversely impact the Company’s
financial statements.

Contingent Obligations

The Company is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other
factors and conditions that potentially subject it to environmental, litigation, income tax, and
other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Note 3 to the financial statements for
more information regarding certain of these contingencies. The Company periodically evaluates
its exposure to such risks and records reserves for those matters where a loss is considered
probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or conditions that can
be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially affect the
Company’s financial statements. These events or conditions include the following:

•

Changes in existing state or federal regulation by governmental
authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality,
control of toxic substances, hazardous and solid wastes, and other
environmental matters.

•

Changes in existing income tax regulations or changes in Internal
Revenue Service interpretations of existing regulations.

•

Identification of additional sites that require environmental
remediation or the filing of other complaints in which the Company may
be asserted to be a potentially responsible party.

•

Identification and evaluation of other potential lawsuits or
complaints in which the Company may be named as a defendant.

•

Resolution or progression of existing matters through the legislative
process, the court systems, or the EPA.

Unbilled Revenues

Revenues related to the sale of electricity are recorded when electricity is delivered to
customers. However, the determination of KWH sales to individual customers is based on the reading
of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each
month, amounts of electricity delivered to customers, but not yet metered and billed, are
estimated. Components of the unbilled revenue estimates include total KWH territorial supply,
total KWH billed, estimated total electricity lost in delivery, and customer usage. These
components can fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including weather, generation patterns,
power delivery volume, and other operational constraints. These factors can be unpredictable and
can vary from historical trends. As a result, the overall estimate of unbilled revenues could be
significantly affected, which could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations.

New Accounting Standards

Income Taxes

In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 109-1, Application of FASB Statement No.
109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities
Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (FSP 109-1), which requires that the
generation deduction be accounted for as a special tax deduction rather than as a tax rate
reduction. The Company adopted FSP 109-1 in the first quarter of 2005 with no material impact
on its financial statements.

Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations

Effective December 31, 2005, the Company adopted the provision of FASB Interpretation No. 47,
Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN 47), which requires that an asset retirement
obligation be recorded even though the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on
future events. Prior to December 2005, the Company did not recognize asset retirement
obligations for asbestos removal because the timing of retirements was dependent on future
events. For additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements under “Asset
Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of Removal.”

At December 31, 2005, the Company recorded additional asset retirement obligations (and
assets) of approximately $91 million. The adoption of FIN 47 did not have any effect on the
Company’s income statement.

II-146


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Stock Options

On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, on a
modified prospective basis. This statement requires that compensation cost relating to
share-based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements. That cost will be
measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued.
Although the compensation expense required under the revised statement differs slightly, the
impacts on the Company’s financial statements are similar to the pro forma disclosures included
in Note 1 to the financial statements under “Stock Options.”

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

The Company’s financial condition continued to be stable at December 31, 2005 with emphasis on cost
control measures combined with significantly lower costs of capital, achieved through the
refinancing and/or redemption of higher-cost securities. Cash flow from operations increased $56
million resulting primarily from increased retail operating revenues (see RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
herein), partially offset by the increase in under recovered deferred fuel costs.

Fuel costs are generally recoverable in future periods and are reflected on the balance sheets
as under recovered regulatory clause revenues. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “PSC Matters – Fuel
Cost Recovery” herein for additional information.

In 2005, gross utility plant additions were $906 million. These additions were primarily
related to Plant McIntosh Units 10 and 11, transmission and distribution facilities, nuclear
fuel, and equipment to comply with environmental standards. The majority of funds needed for gross
property additions for the last several years have been provided from operating activities and
capital contributions from Southern Company. The statements of cash flows provide additional
details.

The Company’s ratio of common equity to total capitalization — including short-term debt —
was 48.3 percent in 2005, 47.7 percent in 2004, and 48.3 percent in 2003. The Company has received
investment grade ratings from the major rating agencies.

Sources of Capital

The Company plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from sources
similar to those used in the past, which were primarily from operating cash flows. However, the
type and timing of any future financings, if needed, will depend on market conditions, regulatory
approval, and other factors.

The issuance of long-term securities by the Company is subject to the approval of the Georgia
PSC. In addition, the issuance of short-term debt securities by the Company is subject to
regulatory approval by the FERC following the repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935, as amended, on February 8, 2006. Additionally, with respect to the public offering of
securities, the Company files registration statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (1933 Act). The amounts of securities authorized by
the appropriate regulatory authorities, as well as the amounts registered under the 1933 Act, are
continuously monitored and appropriate filings are made to ensure flexibility in the capital
markets.

The Company obtains financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. See Note
6 to the financial statements under “Bank Credit Arrangements” for additional information. The
Southern Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of
the Company are not commingled with funds of any other company.

The Company’s current liabilities frequently exceed current assets because of the continued
use of short-term debt as a funding source to meet cash needs which can fluctuate significantly due
to the seasonality of the business.

To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the Company had credit arrangements with
banks totaling $780 million, of which $778 million was unused, at the beginning of 2006. See Note
6 to the financial statements under “Bank Credit Arrangements” for additional information.

The Company may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company subsidiary
organized to issue and sell commercial paper and extendible commercial notes at the request and for
the benefit of the Company and the other retail operating companies.

II-147


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Proceeds from such issuances for the benefit of the Company are loaned directly to the Company and
are not commingled with proceeds from issuances for the benefits of any other operating company.
The obligations of each company under these arrangements are several; there is no cross affiliate
credit support. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had outstanding $268 million of commercial
paper and no extendible commercial notes.

At the beginning of 2006, bank credit arrangements were as follows:

Expires

Total

Unused




(in millions)

$780

$

$


The credit arrangements that expire in 2006 allow for the execution of term loans for an
additional two-year period.

Financing Activities

During 2005, the Company issued $810 million of long-term debt. The issuances were used to refund
$635 million of long-term debt and to fund the Company’s ongoing construction program.

Subsequent to December 31, 2005, the Company redeemed all of its outstanding preferred
stock at a redemption price of $107 per share.

Credit Rating Risk

The Company does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment
schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. There are certain contracts
that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change
to BBB- or Baa3 or below. Generally, collateral may be provided for by a Southern Company
guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. These contracts are primarily for physical electricity
purchases and sales. At December 31, 2005, the maximum potential collateral requirements at a BBB-
or Baa3 rating were approximately $6 million. The maximum potential collateral requirements at a
rating below BBB- or Baa3 were approximately $245 million.

The Company is also party to certain derivative agreements that could require collateral
and/or accelerated payment in the event of a credit rating change to below investment grade. These
agreements are primarily for natural gas price risk management activities. At December 31, 2005,
the Company had no material exposure related to these agreements.

Market Price Risk

Due to cost-based rate regulation, the Company has limited exposure to market rate volatility in
interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity. To manage the volatility
attributable to these exposures, the Company nets the exposures to take advantage of natural
offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to the
Company’s policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and hedging practices. Company policy is
that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and mandates strict adherence to all
applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques
including, but not limited to, market valuation, value at risk, stress tests, and sensitivity
analysis.

To mitigate future exposure to changes in interest rates, the Company has entered into forward
starting interest rate swaps that have been designated as hedges. These swaps have a notional
amount of $300 million and are related to anticipated debt issuances over the next two years. The
weighted average interest rate on outstanding variable long-term debt that has not been hedged at
January 1, 2006 was 3.56 percent. If the Company sustained a 100 basis point change in interest
rates for all unhedged variable rate long-term debt, the change would affect annualized interest
expense by approximately $3.3 million at January 1, 2006. For further information, see Notes 1 and
6 to the financial statements under “Financial Instruments.”

To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the Company enters
into fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale
electricity market and, to a lesser extent, into similar contracts for gas purchases.

The Company has implemented a fuel hedging program at the instruction of the Georgia PSC.

Unrealized gains and losses from mark to market adjustments on derivative contracts related to
the Company’s fuel hedging programs are recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities. Realized
gains and losses from these programs are included in fuel expense and are recovered through the
Company’s fuel cost recovery mechanism. Of the net gains, the Company is allowed to retain 25
percent in earnings. In 2005, the Company had a total net gain of $64.1 million, of which the
Company retained $16.0 million. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory
Matters – Fuel Hedging Program” for additional information. Gains and losses on derivative
contracts that are not designated as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as incurred.
At December 31, 2005, the fair value of derivative energy contracts was reflected in the financial
statements as follows:

Unrealized gains (losses) recognized in income in 2005, 2004, and 2003 were not material. The
Company is exposed to market price risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the
derivative energy contracts. The Company’s policy is to enter into agreements with counterparties
that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s or with counterparties
who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. Therefore, the Company does not
anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the counterparties. For additional
information, see Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements under “Financial Instruments.”

Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations

The construction program of the Company is currently estimated to be $1.3 billion for 2006, $1.4
billion for 2007, and $1.3 billion for 2008. Environmental expenditures included in these amounts
are $410 million, $674.6 million, and $515.8 million for 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively.
Actual construction costs may vary from this estimate because of changes in such factors as:
business conditions; environmental regulations; nuclear plant regulations; FERC rules and
transmission regulations; load projections; the cost and efficiency of construction labor,
equipment, and materials; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that
costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered.

As a result of requirements by the NRC, the Company has established external trust funds
for nuclear decommissioning costs. For additional information, see Note 1 to the financial
statements under “Nuclear Decommissioning.” Also as discussed in Note 1 to the financial
statements under “Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs,” in 1993 the DOE implemented a special assessment
over a 15-year period on utilities with nuclear plants to be used for the decontamination and
decommissioning of its nuclear fuel enrichment facilities.

In addition, as discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company provides
postretirement benefits to substantially all employees and funds trusts to the extent required by
the Georgia PSC and the FERC.

Other funding requirements related to obligations associated with scheduled maturities of
long-term debt and preferred securities and the related interest,
redemption of preferred stock, leases, and
other purchase commitments are as follows. See Notes 1, 6, and 7 to the financial statements
for additional information.

(a)

All amounts are reflected based on final maturity dates. The Company plans to continue to
retire higher-cost securities and replace these
obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit. Variable rate interest
obligations are estimated based on rates as of January 1, 2006, as reflected in the statements
of capitalization. Fixed rates include, where applicable, the effects of interest rate
derivatives employed to manage interest risk.

(b)

For additional information see Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements herein.

(c)

The Company generally does not enter into non-cancelable commitments for other operations and
maintenance expenditures. Total other operations and maintenance expenses for the last three
years were $1.5 billion, $1.4 billion, and $1.2 billion, respectively.

(d)

The Company forecasts capital expenditures over a five-year period. Amounts represent
current estimates of total expenditures, excluding those amounts related to contractual
purchase commitments for uranium and nuclear fuel conversion, enrichment, and fabrication
services. At December 31, 2005, significant purchase commitments were outstanding in
connection with the construction program.

(e)

Natural gas purchase commitments are based on various indices at the time of delivery.
Amounts reflected have been estimated based on the New York Mercantile Exchange future prices
at December 31, 2005.

(f)

Projections of nuclear decommissioning trust contributions are based on the 2004 Retail Rate
Plan. The Company forecasts postretirement trust contributions over a three-year period. No
contributions related to the Company’s pension trust are currently expected during this
period. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information related to the
pension and postretirement plans, including estimated benefit payments. Certain benefit
payments will be made through the related trusts. Other benefit payments will be made from
the Company’s corporate assets.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

The Company’s 2005 Annual Report contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking
statements include, among other things, statements concerning retail sales growth, storm cost
recovery and repairs, environmental regulations and expenditures, the Company’s projections for
postretirement benefit trust contributions, financing activities, access to sources of capital,
the proposed merger of Savannah Electric and the Company, the impacts of the adoption of new
accounting rules, completion of construction projects, and estimated construction and other
expenditures. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such
as “may,” “will”, “could,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,”
“estimates,” “projects,” “predicts,” “potential,” or “continue” or the negative of these terms
or other similar terminology. There are various factors that could cause actual results to
differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements; accordingly, there can
be no assurance that such indicated results will be realized. These factors include:

•

the impact of recent and future federal and state regulatory change,
including legislative and regulatory initiatives regarding
deregulation and restructuring of the electric utility industry, and
implementation of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and also changes in
environmental, tax and other laws and regulations to which the Company
is subject, as well as changes in application of existing laws and
regulations;

•

current and future litigation, regulatory investigations, proceedings,
or inquiries, including FERC matters and the pending EPA civil action
against the Company;

•

the effects, extent, and timing of the entry of additional competition
in the markets in which the Company operates;

•

variations in demand for electricity, including those relating to
weather, the general economy and population, and business growth (and
declines);

•

available sources and costs of fuels;

•

ability to control costs;

•

investment performance of the Company’s employee benefit plans;

•

advances in technology;

•

state and federal rate regulations and the impact of pending and
future rate cases and negotiations, including rate cases related to
fuel cost recovery;

•

internal restructuring or other restructuring options that may be
pursued;

•

potential business strategies, including acquisitions or dispositions
of assets or businesses, which cannot be assured to be completed or
beneficial to the Company;

•

the ability of counterparties of the Company to make payments as and
when due;

•

the ability to obtain new short- and long-term contracts with
neighboring utilities;

•

the direct or indirect effect on the Company’s business resulting from
terrorist incidents and the threat of terrorist incidents;

•

interest rate fluctuations and financial market conditions and the
results of financing efforts, including the Company’s credit ratings;

•

the ability of the Company to obtain additional generating capacity at
competitive prices;

•

catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods,
hurricanes, or other similar occurrences;

•

the direct or indirect effects on the Company’s business resulting
from incidents similar to the August 2003 power outage in the
Northeast;

•

the effect of accounting pronouncements issued periodically by
standard-setting bodies; and

•

other factors discussed elsewhere herein and in other reports,
including the Form 10-K, filed by the Company from time to time with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The Company expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General

Georgia Power Company (Company) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company, which is the
parent company of five retail operating companies, Southern Power Company (Southern Power),
Southern Company Services (SCS), Southern Communications Services (SouthernLINC Wireless), Southern
Company Holdings (Southern Holdings), Southern Nuclear Operating Company (Southern Nuclear),
Southern Telecom, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The retail operating companies —
Alabama Power, the Company, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, and Savannah Electric — provide
electric service in four Southeastern states. The Company operates as a vertically integrated
utility providing electricity to retail customers within its traditional service area located
within the State of Georgia and to wholesale customers in the Southeast. Southern Power
constructs, owns, and manages Southern Company’s competitive generation assets and sells
electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Contracts among the retail operating
companies and Southern Power — related to jointly owned generating facilities, interconnecting
transmission lines, or the exchange of electric power — are regulated by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC). SCS — the system service company — provides, at cost, specialized
services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. SouthernLINC Wireless provides digital
wireless communications services to the retail operating companies and also markets these services
to the public within the Southeast. Southern Telecom provides fiber cable services within the
Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding subsidiary for Southern Company’s
investments in synthetic fuels and leveraged leases and various other energy-related businesses.
Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to Southern Company’s nuclear power plants. In
January 2006, Southern Company completed the sale of substantially all the assets of Southern
Company Gas, its competitive retail natural gas marketing subsidiary.

The equity method is used for subsidiaries in which the Company has significant influence but
does not control and for variable interest entities where the Company is not the primary
beneficiary. Certain prior years’ data presented in the financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to current year presentation.

Southern Company was registered as a holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, as amended (PUHCA), until its repeal on February 8, 2006, and Southern Company and its
subsidiaries, including the Company, were subject to the regulatory provisions of the PUHCA. The
Company is subject to regulation by the FERC and the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC). The
Company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and complies with the
accounting policies and practices prescribed by its regulatory commissions. The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States requires the use of estimates and the actual results may differ from those estimates.

Affiliate Transactions

The Company has an agreement with SCS under which the following services are rendered to the
Company at direct or allocated cost: general and design engineering, purchasing, accounting and
statistical analysis, finance and treasury, tax, information resources, marketing, auditing,
insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, and other services
with respect to business and operations and power pool operations. Costs for these services
amounted to $330 million in 2005, $292 million in 2004, and $303 million in 2003. Cost allocation
methodologies used by SCS were approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission prior to the
repeal of the PUHCA and management believes they are reasonable.

The Company has an agreement with Southern Nuclear under which the following nuclear-related
services are rendered to the Company at cost: general executive and advisory services, general
operations, management and technical services, administrative services including procurement,
accounting, employee relations, and systems and procedures services, strategic planning and
budgeting services, and other services with respect to business and operations. Costs for these
services amounted to $328 million in 2005, $311 million in 2004, and $289 million in 2003.

The Company has an agreement with Southern Power under which the Company operates and
maintains Southern Power owned plants Dahlberg, Franklin, and Wansley at cost. Billings under
these agreements with Southern Power amounted to $5.2 million in 2005, $4.8 million in 2004, and
$5.3 million in 2003.

II-158


NOTES
(continued)

Georgia Power Company 2005 Annual Report

The Company has an agreement with SouthernLINC Wireless under which the Company receives
digital wireless communications services and purchases digital equipment. Costs for these services
amounted to $7.3 million in 2005, $7.7 million in 2004, and $7.4 million in 2003.

Southern Company holds a 30 percent ownership in Alabama Fuel Products, LLC (AFP), which
produces synthetic fuel. The Company has an agreement with an indirect subsidiary of Southern
Company that provides services for AFP. Under this agreement, the Company provides certain
accounting functions, including processing and paying fuel transportation invoices, and the Company
is reimbursed for its expenses. Amounts billed under this agreement totaled approximately $61
million in 2005, $53 million in 2004, and $38 million in 2003. In addition, the Company purchases
synthetic fuel from AFP for use at plants Branch, McDonough, and Bowen. Fuel purchases totaled
$216 million in 2005, $163 million in 2004, and $91 million in 2003.

The Company has entered into several purchased power agreements (PPAs) with Southern Power for
capacity and energy. Expenses associated with these PPAs were $419 million, $282 million, and $203
million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Additionally, the Company recorded a reduction of
$1 million and an increase of $11 million of prepaid capacity expenses included on the balance
sheets at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. See Note 7 under “Purchased Power Commitments”
for additional information.

The Company has an agreement with Gulf Power under which Gulf Power jointly owns a portion of
Plant Scherer. Under this agreement, the Company operates Plant Scherer, and Gulf Power reimburses
the Company for its proportionate share of the related expenses which were $4.3 million in 2005,
$6.8 million in 2004, and $4.9 million in 2003. The Company has an agreement with Savannah
Electric under which the Company jointly owns a portion of Plant McIntosh. Under this agreement,
Savannah Electric operates Plant McIntosh, and the Company reimburses Savannah Electric for its
proportionate share of the related expenses which were $5.5 million in 2005, $3.3 million in 2004,
and $3.7 million in 2003. See Note 4 for additional information.

The Company provides incidental services to other Southern Company subsidiaries which are
generally minor in duration and amount. However, with the hurricane damage experienced by Alabama
Power, Gulf Power, and Mississippi Power in the last two years, assistance provided to aid in storm
restoration, including company labor, contract labor, and materials, has caused an increase in
these activities. The total amount of storm assistance provided to Alabama Power, Gulf Power, and
Mississippi Power in 2005 was $4.1 million, $4.4 million, and $55 million, respectively. The total
amount of storm assistance provided to Alabama Power and Gulf Power in 2004 was $4.1 million and
$6.4 million, respectively. These activities were billed at cost.

Also see Note 4 for information regarding the Company’s ownership in and PPA with Southern
Electric Generating Company (SEGCO) and Note 5 for information on certain deferred tax liabilities
due to affiliates.

The retail operating companies, including the Company, and Southern Power may jointly enter
into various types of wholesale energy, natural gas, and certain other contracts, either directly
or through SCS as agent. Each participating company may be jointly and severally liable for the
obligations incurred under these agreements. See Note 7 under “Fuel Commitments” for additional
information.

The Company has entered into an agreement to merge with Savannah Electric. See Note 3 under “Retail Regulatory Matters – Merger” for additional information.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

The Company is subject to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement
No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. Regulatory assets represent
probable future revenues associated with certain costs that are expected to be recovered from
customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future
reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be credited to customers
through the ratemaking process.

Note: The recovery and amortization periods for these regulatory assets and (liabilities) are
as follows:

In the event that a portion of the Company’s operations is no longer subject to the
provisions of Statement No. 71, the Company would be required to write off related regulatory
assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable through regulated rates. In addition,
the Company would be required to determine if any impairment to other assets, including plant,
exists and, if impaired, write down the assets to their fair value. All regulatory assets and
liabilities are reflected in rates.

Revenues

Energy and other revenues are recognized as services are provided. Unbilled revenues are accrued
at the end of each fiscal period. Electric rates for the Company include provisions to adjust
billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, fuel hedging, the energy component of purchased power
costs, and certain other costs. Revenues are adjusted for differences between the actual
recoverable costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates.

The Company has a diversified base of customers. No single customer or industry comprises 10
percent or more of revenues. For all periods presented, uncollectible accounts averaged less than
1 percent of revenues despite an increase in customer bankruptcies.

Fuel Costs

Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is used. Fuel expense includes the cost of purchased emission
allowances as they are used. Fuel expense also includes the amortization of the cost of nuclear
fuel and a charge, based on nuclear generation, for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel.
Total charges for nuclear fuel included in fuel expense amounted to $70 million in 2005, $73
million in 2004, and $74 million in 2003.

Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs

The Company has contracts with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) that provide for the permanent
disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin disposing of spent nuclear fuel in 1998 as
required by the contracts, and the Company is pursuing legal remedies against the government for
breach of contract. Sufficient pool storage capacity for spent fuel is available at Plant Vogtle
to maintain full-core discharge capability for both units into 2015. Construction of an on-site
dry storage facility at Plant Vogtle is expected to begin in sufficient time to maintain pool
full-core discharge capability. At Plant Hatch, an on-site dry storage facility is operational and
can be expanded to accommodate spent fuel through the life of the plant.

Also, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 required the establishment of a Uranium Enrichment
Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund, which is funded in part by a special assessment on
utilities with nuclear plants. This assessment has been paid over a 15-

II-160


NOTES (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2005 Annual Report

year period; the final installment is scheduled to occur in 2006. This fund will be used by the
DOE for the decontamination and decommissioning of its nuclear fuel enrichment facilities. The law
provides that utilities will recover these payments in the same manner as any other fuel expense.
The Company, based on its ownership interest, estimates its remaining liability at December 31,
2005 under this law to be approximately $4 million.

Income Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provides deferred
income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences. Investment tax credits utilized
are deferred and amortized to income over the average lives of the related property.

Manufacturer’s Tax Credits

The State of Georgia provides a tax credit for qualified investment property to manufacturing
companies that construct new facilities. The credit ranges from 1 percent to 8 percent of
qualified construction expenditures depending upon the county in which the new facility is located.
The Company’s policy is to recognize these credits when management believes that they are more
likely than not to be allowed by the Georgia Department of Revenue. Manufacturer’s tax credits of
$12.5 million, $12.9 million, and $12.0 million were recorded in 2005, 2004, and 2003,
respectively.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

The Company’s property, plant, and equipment consisted of the following at December 31 (in
millions):

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost, less regulatory disallowances and
impairments. Original cost includes: materials; labor; minor items of property; appropriate
administrative and general costs; payroll-related costs such as taxes, pensions, and other
benefits; and the interest capitalized and/or cost of funds used during construction.

The cost of replacements of property, exclusive of minor items of property, is capitalized.
The cost of maintenance, repairs, and replacement of minor items of property is charged to
maintenance expense as incurred or performed with the exception of certain generating plant
maintenance costs. As mandated by the Georgia PSC, the Company defers and amortizes nuclear
refueling costs over the unit’s operating cycle before the next refueling. The refueling cycles
are 18 and 24 months for plants Vogtle and Hatch, respectively. In accordance with the Georgia PSC
rate order, the Company defers the costs of certain significant inspection costs for the combustion
turbines at Plant McIntosh and amortizes such costs over 10 years, which approximates the expected
maintenance cycle.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation of the original cost of plant in service is provided primarily by using composite
straight-line rates, which approximated 2.6 percent in 2005, 2.6 percent in 2004, and 2.7 percent
in 2003. Depreciation studies are conducted periodically to update the composite rates that are
approved by the Georgia PSC. In connection with the new retail rate plan for the Company ending
December 31, 2007 (2004 Retail Rate Plan), effective January 1, 2005, the depreciation rates were
revised by the Georgia PSC. The revised depreciation rates had no material impact on the
Company’s financial statements.

When property subject to depreciation is retired or otherwise disposed of in the normal
course of business, its original cost, together with the cost of removal, less salvage, is charged
to accumulated depreciation. Minor items of property included in the original cost of the plant
are retired when the related property unit is retired.

Under the three-year retail rate plan for the Company ending December 31, 2004 (2001 Retail
Rate Plan), the Company discontinued recording accelerated depreciation and amortization. Also,
the Company was ordered to amortize $333 million, the cumulative balance previously expensed,
equally over three years as a credit to amortization expense beginning January

II-161


NOTES (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2005 Annual Report

2002. Additionally, the Company was ordered to recognize new Georgia PSC certified purchased
power costs in rates evenly over the three years covered by the 2001 Retail Rate Plan. As a
result of the purchased power regulatory adjustment, the Company recorded amortization expenses of
$14 million in 2003. The Company recorded a credit to amortization expense of $77 million in
2004. See Note 3 under “Retail Regulatory Matters — Rate Plans” for additional information.

Asset
Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of Removal

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations. Statement No. 143 established new accounting and reporting standards for
legal obligations associated with the ultimate costs of retiring long-lived assets. The present
value of the ultimate costs for an asset’s future retirement is recorded in the period in which
the liability is incurred. The costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and
depreciated over the asset’s useful life. In addition, effective December 31, 2005, the Company
adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 47, Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations (FIN 47), which requires that an asset retirement obligation be recorded even though the
timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on future events. Prior to December 2005, the
Company did not recognize asset retirement obligations for asbestos removal because the timing of
their retirements was dependent on future events. The Company has received approval from the
Georgia PSC allowing the continued accrual of other future retirement costs for long-lived assets
that the Company does not have a legal obligation to retire. Accordingly, the accumulated removal
costs for these obligations will continue to be reflected on the balance sheets as a regulatory
liability. Therefore, the Company had no cumulative effect to net income resulting from the
adoption of Statement No. 143 or FIN 47.

The liability recognized to retire long-lived assets primarily relates to the Company’s
nuclear facilities, which include the Company’s ownership interests in plants Hatch and Vogtle.
The fair value of assets legally restricted for settling retirement obligations related to nuclear
facilities as of December 31, 2005 was $487 million. In addition, the Company has recognized
retirement obligations related to various landfill sites, ash ponds, and underground storage tanks.
The Company also recorded additional asset retirement obligations
(and assets) of approximately $91 million
related to asbestos removal. The Company has also identified retirement obligations related to
certain transmission and distribution facilities, leasehold improvements, equipment on customer
property, and property associated with the Company’s rail lines. However, liabilities for the
removal of these assets have not been recorded because no reasonable estimate can be made regarding
the timing of any related retirements. The Company will continue to recognize in the statements of
income the allowed removal costs in accordance with its regulatory treatment. Any difference
between costs recognized under Statement No. 143 and FIN 47 and those reflected in rates are
recognized as either a regulatory asset or liability in the balance sheets as ordered by the
Georgia PSC. See “Nuclear Decommissioning” herein for further information on amounts included in
rates.

Nuclear Decommissioning

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requires licensees of commercial nuclear power reactors to
establish a plan for providing reasonable assurance of funds for future decommissioning. The
Company has external trust funds to comply with the NRC’s regulations. Use of the funds is
restricted to nuclear decommissioning activities and the funds are managed and invested in
accordance with applicable requirements of various regulatory bodies, including the NRC, the FERC,
and state PSCs, as well as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The trust funds are invested in a
tax-

efficient manner in a diversified mix of equity and fixed income securities and are classified
as available-for-sale. The trust funds are included in the balance sheets at fair value, as
obtained from quoted market prices for the same or similar investments. Details of the securities

thereafter.

Sales of the securities held in the trust funds resulted in proceeds of $372.5 million,
$532.3 million, and $648.1 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, all of which were
re-invested. Net realized gains (losses) were $12.6 million, $14.1 million, and $21.3 million
in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Realized gains and losses are determined on a specific
identification basis. In accordance with regulatory guidance, all realized and unrealized gains
and losses are included in the regulatory liability for Asset Retirement Obligations in the
balance sheets and are not included in net income or other comprehensive income. Unrealized
gains and losses are considered non-cash transactions for purposes of the statements of cash
flow. Unrealized losses were not material in any period presented and do not represent any
impairment of the underlying investments.

Amounts previously recorded in internal reserves are being transferred into the external
trust funds over periods approved by the Georgia PSC. The NRC’s minimum external funding
requirements are based on a generic estimate of the cost to decommission only the radioactive
portions of a nuclear unit based on the size and type of reactor. The Company has filed plans
with the NRC to ensure that, over time — the deposits and earnings of the external trust funds
will provide the minimum funding amounts prescribed by the NRC. Annual provisions for nuclear
decommissioning are based on an annuity method as approved by the Georgia PSC. The amount
expensed in 2005 and fund balances were as follows:

The decommissioning cost estimates are based on prompt dismantlement and removal of the plant
from service. The actual decommissioning costs may vary from the above estimates because of
changes in the assumed date of decommissioning, changes in NRC requirements, or changes in the
assumptions used in making these estimates.

Under the 2001 Retail Rate Plan, the Georgia PSC approved the annual decommissioning costs for
ratemaking of $9 million. This amount was based on the NRC generic estimate to decommission the
radioactive

II-163


NOTES (continued)

portion of the facilities as of 2000. The estimates were $383 million and $282 million
for plants Hatch and Vogtle, respectively. Significant assumptions used to determine the costs for
ratemaking included an estimated
inflation rate of 4.7 percent and an estimated trust earnings rate of 6.5 percent.

Under the 2004 Retail Rate Plan, effective January 1, 2005, the Georgia PSC decreased the
annual decommissioning costs for ratemaking to $7 million. This amount is based on the NRC generic
estimate to decommission the radioactive
portion of the facilities as of 2003. The estimates are
$421 million and $326 million for plants Hatch and Vogtle, respectively. Significant assumptions
used to determine the costs for ratemaking include an estimated inflation rate of 3.1 percent and
an estimated trust earnings rate of 5.1 percent. Another significant assumption used was the
change in the operating license for Plant Hatch. In January 2002, the NRC granted the Company a
20-year extension of the licenses for both units at Plant Hatch which permits the operation of
units 1 and 2 until 2034 and 2038, respectively. The Company expects the Georgia PSC to
periodically review and adjust, if necessary, the amounts collected in rates for the anticipated
cost of decommissioning.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) and Interest Capitalized

In accordance with regulatory treatment, the Company records AFUDC. AFUDC represents the estimated
debt and equity costs of capital funds that are necessary to finance the construction of new
regulated facilities. While cash is not realized currently from such allowance, it increases the
revenue requirement over the service life of the plant through a higher rate base and higher
depreciation expense. Interest related to the construction of new facilities not included in the
Company’s retail rates is capitalized in accordance with standard interest capitalization
requirements. For the years 2005, 2004, and 2003, the average AFUDC rates were 8.02 percent, 8.22
percent, and 5.51 percent, respectively. AFUDC and interest capitalized, net of taxes, were 4.7
percent and 4.9 percent of net income after dividends on preferred stock for 2005 and 2004,
respectively, and less than 3 percent for 2003.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles

The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of
whether an impairment has occurred is based on either a specific regulatory disallowance or an
estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared with the
carrying value of the assets. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment
recognized is determined by either the amount of regulatory disallowance or by estimating the fair
value of the assets and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. For
assets identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value less
the cost to sell in order to determine if an impairment provision is required. Until the assets
are disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or events change.
See Note 3 under “Retail Regulatory Matters” and “Plant McIntosh Construction Project” for
information regarding a regulatory disallowance by the Georgia PSC in December 2004.

Storm Damage Reserve

The Company maintains a reserve for property damage to cover the cost of damages from major
storms to its transmission and distribution lines and the cost of uninsured damages to its
generation facilities and other property as mandated by the Georgia PSC. The Company accrues
$6.3 million annually that is recoverable through base rates. The Company expects the Georgia
PSC to periodically review and adjust, if necessary, the amounts collected in rates for storm
damage costs.

Environmental Cost Recovery

Under Georgia PSC ratemaking provisions, $22 million has been deferred in a regulatory liability
account related to certain environmental insurance settlements. Under the 2004 Retail Rate Plan,
this regulatory liability is being amortized over a three-year period beginning January 1, 2005.
However, the Georgia PSC also approved an annual environmental accrual of $5.4 million.
Environmental remediation expenditures are charged against the reserve as they are incurred. The
annual accrual amount will be reviewed and adjusted in future regulatory proceedings.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are considered cash
equivalents. Temporary cash investments are securities with original maturities of 90 days or
less.

Materials and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include the average costs of transmission, distribution, and
generating plant materials. Materials are charged to inventory when purchased and then expensed or
capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when installed.

Fuel Inventory

Fuel inventory includes the average costs of oil, coal, natural gas, and emission allowances.
Fuel is charged to inventory when purchased and then expensed as used. Emission allowances granted
by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are included in inventory at zero cost.

Stock Options

Southern Company provides non-qualified stock options to a large segment of the Company’s employees
ranging from line management to executives. The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation
plans in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25. Accordingly, no compensation
expense has been recognized because the exercise price of all options granted equaled the
fair-market value of Southern Company’s common stock on the date of grant. When options are
exercised, the Company receives a capital contribution from Southern Company equivalent to the
related income-tax benefit.

For pro forma purposes, the Company generally recognizes stock option expense on a
straight-line basis over the vesting period. Stock options granted to employees who are eligible
for retirement are expensed at the grant date.

Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to fluctuations in interest
rates, the prices of certain fuel purchases, and electricity purchases and sales. All derivative
financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair
value. Substantially all of the Company’s bulk energy purchases and sales contracts that meet the
definition of a derivative are exempt from fair value accounting requirements and are accounted for
under the accrual method. Other derivative contracts qualify as cash flow hedges of anticipated
transactions or are recoverable through the Georgia PSC-approved fuel hedging program. This
results in the deferral of related gains and losses in other comprehensive income or regulatory
assets and liabilities, respectively, until the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness
arising from cash flow hedges is recognized currently in net income. Other derivative contracts
are marked to market

II-165

through current period income and are recorded on a net basis in the statements of income.

The Company is exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of
counterparties’ nonperformance. The Company has established controls to determine and monitor
the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate the Company’s exposure to
counterparty credit risk.

The Company’s financial instruments for which the carrying amounts did not equal fair value at
December 31 were as follows:

The fair values were based on either closing market prices or closing prices of comparable
instruments.

Comprehensive Income

The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of all changes in common stock equity
of an enterprise that result from transactions and other economic events of the period other than
transactions with owners. Comprehensive income consists of net income, changes in the fair value
of marketable securities and qualifying cash flow hedges, and changes in additional minimum pension
liability, less income taxes and reclassifications for amounts included in net income.

Variable Interest Entities

The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity must consolidate the related assets and
liabilities. The Company has established certain wholly-owned trusts to issue preferred
securities. However, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts. Therefore, the
investments in these trusts are reflected as Other Investments, and the related loans from the
trusts are reflected as Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts on the balance sheets. See
Note 6 under “Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities/Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated
Trusts” for additional information.

2. RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company has a defined benefit, trusteed, pension plan covering substantially all employees.
The plan is funded in accordance with requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended (ERISA). In 2005, the plan was amended to provide an additional monthly
supplement to certain retirees. No contributions to the plan are expected for the year ending
December 31, 2006. The Company also provides certain non-qualified benefit plans for a selected
group of management and highly compensated employees. Benefits under these non-qualified plans are
funded on a cash basis. In addition, the Company provides certain medical care and life insurance
benefits for retired employees. The Company funds related trusts to the extent required by the
Georgia PSC and the FERC. For the year ended December 31, 2006, such contributions are expected to
total approximately $18.4 million. The measurement date for plan
assets and obligations is September 30 for each year
presented.

Pension Plans

The accumulated benefit obligation for the pension plans was $1.9 billion in 2005 and $1.7 billion
in 2004. Changes during the year in the projected benefit obligations, accumulated benefit
obligations, and the fair

In
2005, the projected benefit obligations for the qualified and non-qualified pension plans were
$1.945 billion and $110 million, respectively. All plan assets are related to the qualified plan.

Pension plan assets are managed and invested in accordance with all applicable requirements
including ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Internal Revenue Code). The
Company’s investment policy covers a diversified mix of assets, including equity and fixed income
securities, real estate, and private equity, as described in the table below. Derivative
instruments are used primarily as hedging tools but may also be used to gain efficient exposure to
the various asset classes.

The Company primarily minimizes the risk of large losses through diversification but also
monitors and manages other aspects of risk.

In the third quarter 2004, the Company prospectively adopted FASB Staff Position
(FSP)106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act). The Medicare Act provides a 28
percent prescription drug subsidy for Medicare eligible retirees. FSP 106-2 requires
recognition of the impacts of the Medicare Act in the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation (APBO) and future cost of service for postretirement medical plans. The effect of
the subsidy reduced the Company’s expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2004 and for
the year ended December 31, 2005 by approximately $5 million and $10 million, respectively, and
is expected to have a similar impact on future expenses.

Future benefit payments, including prescription drug benefits, reflect expected future service
and are estimated based on assumptions used to measure the accumulated benefit obligation for the
postretirement plans. Estimated benefit payments are reduced by drug

Actuarial Assumptions

The weighted average rates assumed in the actuarial calculations used to determine both the
benefit obligations and the net periodic costs for the pension and postretirement benefit plans
were:




Discount

5.50

%

5.75

The Company determined the long-term rate of return based on historical asset class returns
and current market conditions, taking into account the diversification benefits of investing in
multiple asset classes.

An additional assumption used in measuring the APBO was a weighted average medical care cost
trend rate of 10.25 percent for 2005, decreasing gradually to 4.75 percent through the year 2014,
and remaining at that level thereafter. An annual increase or decrease in the assumed medical care
cost trend rate of 1 percent would affect the accumulated benefit obligation and the service
and interest cost components at December 31, 2005, as follows:

Employee Savings Plan

The Company also sponsors a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering substantially all employees.
The Company provides a 75 percent matching contribution up to 6 percent of an employee’s base
salary. Total matching contributions made to the plan for the years 2005, 2004, and 2003 were $19
million, $18 million, and $18 million, respectively.

3. CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY
MATTERS

General Litigation Matters

The Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of
business. In addition, the Company’s business activities are subject to extensive governmental
regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation over environmental issues and
claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, and citizen enforcement of
environmental requirements such as opacity and other air quality standards, has increased generally
throughout the United States. In particular, personal injury claims for damages caused by alleged
exposure to hazardous materials have become more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such pending or
potential litigation against the Company cannot be predicted at this time; however, for current
proceedings not specifically reported herein, management does not anticipate that the liabilities,
if any, arising from such current proceedings would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
financial statements.

Environmental Matters

New Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil action in the U.S
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against the Company and Alabama Power, alleging
that the Company and Alabama Power had violated the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean
Air Act and related state laws with respect to certain coal-fired generating facilities. Through
subsequent amendments and other legal proceedings, the EPA added Savannah Electric as a defendant
to the original action and filed a separate action against Alabama Power after it was dismissed
from the original action. In these lawsuits, the

II-169


NOTES (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2005 Annual Report

EPA alleges that NSR violations occurred
at eight coal-fired generating facilities including the
Company’s Plants Bowen and Scherer. The civil action requests penalties and injunctive
relief, including an order requiring the installation of the best available control technology at
the affected units. On June 3, 2005, the U.S. District for the Northern District of Alabama issued
a decision in favor of Alabama Power on two primary legal issues in the case; however, the decision
does not resolve the case, nor does it address other legal issues associated with the EPA’s
allegations. In accordance with a separate court order, Alabama Power and the EPA are currently
participating in mediation with respect to the EPA’s claims. The action against the Company and
Savannah Electric has been administratively closed since the spring of 2001, and none of the
parties has sought to reopen the case.

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act
authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $32,500 per day, per violation at each generating
unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in this case could
require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly
require payment of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of operations, cash
flows, and possibly financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

Plant Wansley Environmental Litigation

In December 2002, the Sierra Club, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Georgia Forestwatch, and
one individual filed a civil suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia
against the Company for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act at four of the units at Plant
Wansley. The civil action requests injunctive and declaratory relief, civil penalties, a
supplemental environmental project, and attorneys’ fees. The Clean Air Act authorizes civil
penalties of up to $27,500 per day, per violation at each generating unit. The liability phase of
the case has concluded with the court ruling in favor of the Company in part and the plaintiffs in
part. In March 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit accepted the Company’s
petition for review of the district court’s order, and oral arguments were held on January 24,
2006. The district court case has been administratively closed pending that appeal. If
necessary, the district court will hold a separate trial which will address civil penalties and
possible injunctive relief requested by the plaintiffs. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot
currently be determined; however, an adverse outcome could require substantial capital expenditures
that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly require payment of substantial penalties.
This could affect future results of operations, cash flows, and possibly financial condition if
such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

Environmental Remediation

The Company has been designated as a potentially responsible party at sites governed by the Georgia
Hazardous Site Response Act and/or by the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act. In 1995, the EPA designated the Company and four other unrelated
entities as potentially responsible parties at a site in Brunswick, Georgia that is listed on the
federal National Priorities List. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had recorded approximately
$6 million in cumulative expenses associated with the Company’s agreed-upon share of the removal
and remedial investigation and feasibility study costs for the Brunswick site. Additional claims
for recovery of natural resource damages at the site are anticipated. The Company has also
recognized $36 million in cumulative expenses through December 31, 2005 for the assessment and
anticipated cleanup of sites on the Georgia Hazardous Sites Inventory.

The final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined. However, based on the currently
known conditions at these sites and the nature and extent of the Company’s activities relating to
these sites, management does not believe that the Company’s additional liability, if any, at these
sites would be material to the financial statements.

FERC Matters

Market-Based Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates at market-based
prices. The Company also has FERC authority to make short-term opportunity sales at market
rates. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a market-based contract with an
affiliate.

II-170


NOTES (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2005 Annual Report

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation
dominance within its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in
other markets is not an issue in that proceeding. In February 2005, Southern Company submitted
responsive information. In February 2006, the FERC agreed to allow the parties to conduct
settlement discussions. Any new market-based rate transactions in its retail service territory
entered into after February 27, 2005 are subject to refund to the level of the default
cost-based rates, pending the outcome of the proceeding. The impact of such sales through
December 31, 2005 is not expected to exceed $4.9 million. The refund period covers 15 months.
In the event that the FERC’s default mitigation measures for entities that are found to have
market power are ultimately applied, the Company may be required to charge cost-based rates for
certain wholesale sales in the Southern Company retail service territory, which may be lower
than negotiated market-based rates. The final outcome of this matter will depend on the form in
which the final methodology for assessing generation market power and mitigation rules may be
ultimately adopted and cannot be determined at this time.

In addition, in May 2005, the FERC started an investigation to determine whether Southern
Company satisfies the other three parts of the FERC’s market-based rate analysis: transmission
market power, barriers to entry, and affiliate abuse or reciprocal dealing. The FERC established a
new refund period related to this expanded investigation. Any and all new market-based rate
transactions both inside and outside Southern Company’s retail service territory involving any
Southern Company subsidiary, including the Company, will be subject to refund to the extent the
FERC orders lower rates as a result of this new investigation, with the 15-month refund period
beginning July 19, 2005. The impact of such sales through December 31, 2005 is not expected to
exceed $10.9 million, of which $3.2 million relates to sales inside the retail service territory as
discussed above. The FERC also directed
that this expanded proceeding be held in abeyance pending the outcome of the proceeding on the IIC
discussed below.

The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for this proceeding and is vigorously
defending itself in this matter. However, the final outcome of this matter, including any remedies
to be applied in the event of an adverse ruling in this proceeding, cannot now be determined.

Intercompany Interchange Contract

The Company’s generation fleet in its retail service territory is operated under the IIC, as
approved by the FERC. In May 2005, the FERC also initiated a new proceeding to examine (1) the
provisions of the IIC among Alabama Power, the Company, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, Savannah
Electric, Southern Power, and SCS, as agent, under the terms of which the power pool of Southern
Company is operated, and, in particular, the propriety of the continued inclusion of Southern Power
as a party to the IIC, (2) whether any parties to the IIC have violated the FERC’s standards of
conduct applicable to utility companies that are transmission providers, and (3) whether Southern
Company’s code of conduct defining Southern Power as a “system company” rather than a “marketing
affiliate” is just and reasonable. In connection with the formation of Southern Power, the FERC
authorized Southern Power’s inclusion in the IIC in 2000. The FERC also previously approved
Southern Company’s code of conduct. The FERC order directs that the administrative law judge who
presided over the McIntosh PPA proceeding involving an approval of PPAs between Southern Power and
the Company and Savannah Electric, be assigned to preside over the hearing in this proceeding and
that the testimony and exhibits presented in that proceeding be preserved to the extent
appropriate. Hearings are scheduled for September 2006. Effective July 19, 2005, revenues from
transactions under the IIC involving any Southern Company subsidiaries, including the Company, are
subject to refund to the extent the FERC orders any changes to the IIC.

The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for this proceeding and is vigorously
defending itself in this matter. However, the final outcome of this matter, including any remedies
to be applied in the event of an adverse ruling in this proceeding, cannot now be determined.

Generation Interconnection Agreements

In July 2003, the FERC issued its final rule on the standardization of generation
interconnection agreements and procedures (Order 2003). Order 2003 shifts much of the financial
burden of new transmission investment from the generator to the

II-171


NOTES (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2005 Annual Report

transmission provider. The FERC has indicated that Order 2003, which was effective January 20,
2004, is to be applied prospectively to interconnection agreements. Subsidiaries of Tenaska,
Inc., as counterparties to previously executed interconnection agreements with the Company and
another Southern Company subsidiary, have filed complaints at the FERC requesting that the FERC
modify the agreements and that the Company refund a total of $7.9 million previously paid for
interconnection facilities, with interest. The Company has opposed such relief and the
proceedings are still pending. The impact of Order 2003 and its subsequent rehearings on the
Company and the final results of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Race Discrimination Litigation

In July 2000, a lawsuit alleging race discrimination was filed by three of the Company’s
employees against the Company, Southern Company, and SCS in the Superior Court of Fulton County,
Georgia. Shortly thereafter, the lawsuit was removed to the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Georgia and amended to add four more plaintiffs. The lawsuit also raised
claims on behalf of a purported class. The plaintiffs sought compensatory and punitive damages
in an unspecified amount, as well as injunctive relief.

Following various court decisions in favor of the defendants and subsequent appeals by the
plaintiffs, on July 13, 2005, the plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the U.S.
Supreme Court. On October 17, 2005, the petition was denied. This matter is now concluded.

Right of Way Litigation

Southern Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including the Company, Gulf Power, Mississippi
Power, and Southern Telecom, have been named as defendants in numerous lawsuits brought by
landowners since 2001. The plaintiffs’ lawsuits claim that defendants may not use, or sublease
to third parties, some or all of the fiber optic communications lines on the rights of way that
cross the plaintiffs’ properties and that such actions exceed the easements or other property
rights held by defendants. The plaintiffs assert claims for, among other things, trespass and
unjust enrichment, and seek compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief. Management
believes that the Company has complied with applicable laws and that the plaintiffs’ claims are
without merit.

In January 2005, the Superior Court of Decatur County, Georgia granted partial summary
judgment in a lawsuit brought by landowners against the Company based on the plaintiffs’
declaratory judgment claim that the easements do not permit general telecommunications use. The
Company appealed this ruling to the Georgia Court of Appeals. The Georgia Court of Appeals
reversed, in part, the court’s order and remanded the case to the trial court for the
determination of further issues. After the Court of Appeals’ decision, the plaintiffs filed a
motion for reconsideration, which was denied, and a petition for certiorari to the Georgia
Supreme Court, which is currently pending. The question of damages and other liabilities or
remedies issues with respect to this action, if any, will be decided at a future trial. In the
event of an adverse verdict in the case, the Company could appeal both liability and damages or
other relief granted. An adverse outcome in these matters could result in substantial
judgments; however, the final outcome cannot now be determined.

In addition, in late 2001, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company, including Alabama
Power, the Company, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, Savannah Electric, and Southern Telecom, were
named as defendants in a lawsuit brought by a telecommunications company that uses certain of
the defendants’ rights of way. This lawsuit alleges, among other things, that the defendants
are contractually obligated to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the telecommunications
company from any liability that may be assessed against it in pending and future right of way
litigation. The Company believes that the plaintiff’s claims are without merit. In the fall of
2004, the trial court stayed the case until resolution of the underlying landowner litigation
discussed above. In January 2005, the Georgia Court of Appeals dismissed the telecommunications
company’s appeal of the trial court’s order for lack of jurisdiction. An adverse outcome in
this matter, combined with an adverse outcome against the telecommunications company in one or
more of the right of way lawsuits, could result in substantial judgments; however, the final
outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.

Georgia Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Property Tax Dispute

The Company is involved in a significant property tax dispute with Monroe County, Georgia (Monroe
County). The Monroe County Board of Tax Assessors (Monroe Board) has issued assessments reflecting
substantial increases in the ad valorem tax valuation of the Company’s 22.95 percent ownership
interest in Plant Scherer, which is located in Monroe County, for tax years 2003, 2004, and 2005.
The Company is aggressively pursuing administrative appeals in Monroe County and has filed notices
of arbitration for all three years. The appeals are currently stayed, pending the outcome of the
litigation discussed below.

In November 2004, the Company filed suit, on its behalf, against the Monroe Board in the
Superior Court of Monroe County. The Company contends that Monroe County acted without statutory
authority in changing the valuation of a centrally assessed utility as established by the Revenue
Commissioner of the State of Georgia and requests injunctive relief prohibiting Monroe County and
the Monroe Board from unlawfully changing the value of Plant Scherer and ultimately collecting
additional ad valorem taxes from the Company. On December 22, 2005, the court granted Monroe
County’s motion for summary judgment. The Company has filed an appeal of the Superior Court’s
decision to the Georgia Supreme Court.

If the Company is not successful in its administrative appeals and if Monroe County is
successful in defending the litigation, the Company could be subject to total additional taxes
through December 31, 2005 of up to $13 million, plus penalties and interest. The ultimate outcome
of this matter cannot currently be determined.

Retail Regulatory Matters

Merger

On December 13, 2005, the Company and Savannah Electric entered into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger. Savannah Electric will merge into the Company, with the Company continuing as the
surviving corporation (the Merger). At the effective time of the Merger, each share of the
Company’s common stock will remain issued and outstanding; each share of the Company’s preferred
stock issued and outstanding will have been redeemed prior to the Merger; the issued and
outstanding shares of Savannah Electric common stock, all of which are held by Southern Company,
will be converted into the right to receive 1,500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock; and
each share of Savannah Electric preferred stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Merger will be converted into the right to receive one share of a new series of the Company’s
Class A Preferred Stock. The Merger must be approved by the preferred shareholders of
Savannah Electric and is subject to the receipt of certain regulatory approvals from the FERC,
the Georgia PSC, and the Federal Communications Commission. Pending regulatory approvals, the
Merger is expected to be completed by July 2006. The Merger is not expected to have a material
impact on the Company’s financial statements.

While the Georgia PSC does not have specific approval authority over the merger of electric
utilities, the Company and Savannah Electric have filed an application with the Georgia PSC with
respect to certain approvals that will be necessary to effectively complete the Merger. In
particular, the Company and Savannah Electric plan to seek the approval of the Georgia PSC with
respect to the following matters:

II-173


NOTES (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Rate Plans

Under the terms of the 2004 Retail Rate Plan, which the Georgia PSC approved in December 2004,
the Company’s earnings are evaluated against a retail return on common equity (ROE) range of
10.25 percent to 12.25 percent. Two-thirds of any earnings above 12.25 percent will be applied
to rate refunds, with the remaining one-third retained by the Company. Retail rates were
increased by approximately $194 million and customer fees by approximately $9 million effective
January 1, 2005 to cover the higher costs of purchased power; operating and maintenance
expenses; environmental compliance; and continued investment in new generation, transmission,
and distribution facilities to support growth and ensure reliability. In 2005, the Company
recorded $2.7 million in revenue subject to refund related to earnings in excess of 12.25
percent retail ROE.

The Company is required to file a general rate case by July 1, 2007, in response to which the
Georgia PSC would be expected to determine whether the rate order should be continued, modified, or
discontinued. Until then, the Company may not file for a general base rate increase unless its
projected retail ROE falls below 10.25 percent.

Under the 2001 Retail Rate Plan, retail rates were decreased by $118 million effective January
1, 2002. Under the terms of the 2001 Retail Rate Plan, earnings were evaluated against a retail
ROE range of 10 percent to 12.95 percent. Two-thirds of any earnings above the 12.95 percent
return were to be applied to rate refunds, with the remaining one-third retained by the Company.
The Company’s earnings in 2004, 2003, and 2002 were within the retail ROE range.

Under the 2001 Retail Rate Plan, the Company discontinued recording accelerated depreciation
and amortization and began amortizing the accumulated balance equally over three years as a credit
to expense beginning in 2002. Also, the 2001 Retail Rate Plan required the Company to recognize
capacity and operating and maintenance costs related to new Georgia PSC-certified PPAs evenly in
rates over a three-year period ended December 31, 2004.

Fuel Hedging Program

In 2003, the Georgia PSC approved an order allowing the Company to implement a natural gas and oil
procurement and hedging program. This order allows the Company to use financial instruments to
hedge price and commodity risk associated with these fuels. The order limits the program in terms
of time, volume, dollars, and physical amounts hedged. The costs of the program, including any net
losses, are recovered as a fuel cost through the fuel cost recovery clause. Annual net financial
gains from the hedging program will be shared with the retail customers receiving 75 percent and
the Company retaining 25 percent of the total net gains. In 2005, the Company had a total net gain
of $64.1 million, of which the Company retained $16 million.

Fuel Cost Recovery

On May 17, 2005, the Georgia PSC approved the Company’s request to increase customer fuel
rates by approximately 9.5 percent to recover under recovered fuel costs of approximately $508
million existing as of May 31, 2005 over a four-year period that began June 1, 2005. Based on
the order, a portion of the under recovered regulatory clause revenues was reclassified from
current assets to deferred charges and other assets in the balance sheet. Under recovered fuel
amounts for the periods subsequent to June 1, 2005 totaled $327.5 million through December 31,
2005. The Georgia PSC’s order instructs that such amounts be reviewed semi-annually beginning
February 2006. If the amount under or over recovered exceeds $50 million at the evaluation
date, the Company would be required to file for a temporary fuel rate change. In addition,
Savannah Electric’s under recovered fuel costs totaled $77.7 million at December 31, 2005. In
accordance with the Georgia PSC order, Savannah Electric was scheduled to file an additional
request for a fuel cost recovery increase in January 2006. The Company has agreed with a
Georgia PSC staff recommendation to forego the temporary fuel rate process, and Savannah
Electric has postponed its scheduled filing. Instead, the Company and Savannah Electric will
file a combined request in March 2006 to increase the Company’s fuel cost recovery rate.

The case will seek approval of a fuel cost recovery rate based upon future fuel cost
projections for the combined Company and Savannah Electric generating fleet as well as the under
recovered fuel balances existing at June 30, 2006. The new fuel cost recovery

II-174


NOTES (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2005 Annual Report

rate would be billed beginning in July 2006 to all of the Company’s customers, including the
existing Savannah Electric customers. Under recovered amounts as of the date of the Merger will be
paid by the appropriate customer groups.

In August 2005, the Georgia PSC initiated an investigation of Savannah Electric’s fuel
practices. In February 2006, an investigation of the Company’s fuel practices was initiated. The
Company and Savannah Electric are responding to data requests and cooperating in the
investigations. The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Fuel cost recovery revenues as recorded on the financial statements are adjusted for
differences in actual recoverable cost and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly,
any increase in the billing factor would have no significant effect on the Company’s revenues or
net income, but would increase annual cash flow.

Nuclear Performance Standards

Through December 2004, the Georgia PSC had adopted a three-year performance standard for the
Company’s nuclear generating units. The performance standard was based on each unit’s capacity
factor as compared to the average of all comparable U.S. nuclear units operating at a capacity
factor of 50 percent or higher during the three-year period of evaluation. Depending on the
performance of the units, the Company could receive a monetary award or penalty under the
performance standards criteria. For the period 2002-2004, the Company’s performance fell within
the criteria prescribed by the Georgia PSC; there was no associated award or penalty. Effective
January 1, 2005, the Georgia PSC discontinued the nuclear performance standard.

Plant McIntosh Construction Project

In December 2002 after a competitive bidding process, the Georgia PSC certified PPAs between
Southern Power and the Company and Savannah Electric for capacity from Plant McIntosh Units 10
and 11, construction of which was completed in June 2005. In April 2003, Southern Power applied
for FERC approval of these PPAs. In July 2003, the FERC accepted the PPAs to become effective
June 1, 2005, subject to refund, and ordered that hearings be held. Intervenors opposed the
FERC’s acceptance of the PPAs, alleging that they did not meet the applicable standards for
market-based rates between affiliates. To ensure the timely completion of the Plant McIntosh
construction project and the availability of the units in the summer of 2005 for their retail
customers, in May 2004, the Company and Savannah Electric requested the Georgia PSC to direct
them to acquire the Plant McIntosh construction project. The Georgia PSC issued such an order
and the transfer occurred on May 24, 2004 at a total cost of approximately $415 million,
including approximately $14 million of transmission interconnection facilities. Subsequently,
Southern Power filed a request to withdraw the PPAs and to terminate the ongoing FERC
proceedings. In August 2004, the FERC issued a notice accepting the request to withdraw the
PPAs and permitting such request to become effective by operation of law. However, the FERC
made no determination on what additional steps may need to be taken with respect to testimony
provided in the proceedings. See “FERC Matters –
Intercompany Interchange Contract” herein for additional
information.

In connection with the 2004 Retail Rate Plan, the Georgia PSC approved the transfer of the
Plant McIntosh construction project at a total fair market value of approximately $385 million.
This value reflected an approximate $16 million disallowance, of which $13 million was
attributable to the Company, and reduced the Company’s net income by approximately $8 million.
The Georgia PSC also certified a total completion cost not to exceed $547 million for the
project. In June 2005, Plant McIntosh Units 10 and 11 were placed into service at a total cost
that did not exceed the certified amount. Under the 2004 Retail Rate Plan, the Plant McIntosh
revenue requirements impact is being reflected in the Company’s rates evenly over the three
years ending 2007. See “Retail Regulatory Matters—Rate Plans” herein for additional information
regarding the transfer of the Plant McIntosh construction project.

4. JOINT OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS

The Company and an affiliate, Alabama Power, own equally all of the outstanding capital stock of
SEGCO which owns electric generating units with a total rated capacity of 1,020 megawatts, as well
as associated transmission facilities. The capacity of the units has been sold equally to the
Company and Alabama Power under a contract which, in substance, requires payments sufficient to
provide for the operating expenses, taxes,

The Company owns undivided interests in plants Vogtle, Hatch, Scherer, and Wansley in varying
amounts jointly with Oglethorpe Power Corporation (OPC), the Municipal Electric Authority of
Georgia (MEAG), the city of Dalton, Georgia, Florida Power & Light Company, Jacksonville Electric
Authority, and Gulf Power. Under these agreements, the Company has contracted to operate and
maintain the plants as agent for the co-owners and is jointly and severally liable for third party
claims related to these plants. In addition, the Company jointly owns the Rocky Mountain pumped
storage hydroelectric plant with OPC who is the operator of the plant. The Company also jointly
owns Plant McIntosh combustion- turbine common facilities and Plant McIntosh combined cycle units
with Savannah Electric who operates the plants. The Company and Progress Energy Florida, Inc.
jointly own a combustion turbine unit (Intercession City) operated by Progress Energy Florida, Inc.

At December 31, 2005, the Company’s percentage ownership and investment (exclusive of nuclear

Wansley, Scherer, and Rocky Mountain was $8.3 million, $0.5 million, and $0.1 million,
respectively, primarily for environmental projects.

The Company’s proportionate share of its plant operating expenses is included in the
corresponding operating expenses in the statements of income.

5. INCOME TAXES

Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and combined income tax returns for
the States of Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation
agreement, each subsidiary’s current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis
and no subsidiary is allocated more expense than would be paid if they filed a separate income tax
return. In accordance with Internal Revenue Service regulations, each company is jointly and
severally liable for the tax liability.

In 2004, in order to avoid the loss of certain federal income tax credits related to the
production of synthetic
fuel, Southern Company chose to defer certain

II-176


NOTES (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2005 Annual Report

deductions otherwise available to the subsidiaries.
The cash flow benefit associated with the utilization of the tax credits was allocated to the
subsidiary that otherwise would have claimed the available deductions on a separate company basis
without the deferral. This allocation concurrently reduced the tax benefit of the credits
allocated to those subsidiaries that generated the credits. As the deferred expenses are deducted,
the benefit of the tax credits will be repaid to the subsidiaries that generated the tax credits.
The Company has recorded $10 million payable to these subsidiaries in Accumulated Deferred Income
Taxes on the balance sheets at December 31, 2005.

The transfer of the Plant McIntosh construction project from Southern Power to the Company
resulted in a deferred gain to Southern Power for federal income tax purposes. The Company will
reimburse Southern Power for the remaining balance of the related deferred taxes of $5.3 million
reflected in Southern Power’s future taxable income. $3.7 million of this payable to Southern
Power is included in Other Deferred Credits and $1.6 million is included in Affiliated Accounts
Payable in the balance sheet at December 31, 2005.

The transfer of the Dahlberg, Wansley, and Franklin projects to Southern Power from the
Company in 2001 and 2002 also resulted in a deferred gain for federal income tax purposes.
Southern Power will reimburse the Company for the remaining balance of the related deferred taxes
of $12.2 million reflected in the Company’s future taxable income. $10.8 million of this
receivable from Southern Power is included in Other Deferred Debits and $1.4 million is included in
Affiliated Accounts Receivable in the balance sheet at December 31, 2005.

At December 31, 2005, tax-related regulatory assets were $501 million and tax-related
regulatory liabilities were $159 million. The assets are attributable to tax benefits flowed
through to customers in prior years and to taxes applicable to capitalized interest. The
liabilities are attributable to deferred taxes previously recognized at rates higher than current
enacted tax law and to unamortized investment tax credits.

6. FINANCING

Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities/Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts

The Company has formed certain wholly owned trust subsidiaries for the purpose of issuing preferred
securities. The proceeds of the related equity investments and preferred security sales were
loaned back to the Company through the issuance of junior subordinated notes totaling $969 million,
which constitute substantially all of the assets of the trusts and are reflected in the balance
sheets as Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts. The Company considers that the mechanisms
and obligations relating to the preferred securities issued for its benefit, taken together,
constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by it of the respective trusts’ payment obligations
with respect to these securities. At December 31, 2005, preferred securities of $940 million were
outstanding. See Note 1 under “Variable Interest Entities” for additional information on the
accounting treatment for these trusts and the related securities.

$4 million in 2010.

Pollution Control Bonds

Pollution control obligations represent loans to the Company from public authorities of funds
derived from sales by such authorities of revenue bonds issued to finance pollution control
facilities. The Company is required to make payments sufficient for the authorities to meet
principal and interest requirements of such bonds. The Company has incurred obligations in
connection with the sale by public authorities of tax-exempt pollution control revenue bonds. The
amount of tax-exempt pollution control revenue bonds outstanding at December 31, 2005 was $1.7
billion.

Senior Notes

The Company issued a total of $625 million of unsecured senior notes in 2005. The proceeds of
these issues were used to redeem or repay at maturity long-term debt, to repay short-term
indebtedness, and for other general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had $2.6 billion and $2.4 billion of senior notes
outstanding, respectively. These senior notes are subordinate to all secured debt of the Company.

Capital Leases

Assets acquired under capital leases are recorded in the balance sheets as utility plant in
service, and the related obligations are classified as long-term debt. At December 31, 2005 and
2004, the Company had a

II-178


NOTES (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2005 Annual Report

capitalized lease obligation for its corporate headquarters building of $74 million and $77
million, respectively, with an interest rate of 8.1 percent. For ratemaking purposes, the Georgia
PSC has treated the lease as an operating lease and has allowed only the lease payments in cost of
service. The difference between the accrued expense and the lease payments allowed for ratemaking
purposes has been deferred and is being amortized to expense as ordered by the Georgia PSC. See
Note 1 under “Regulatory Assets and Liabilities.”

Bank Credit Arrangements

At the beginning of 2006, the Company had credit arrangements with banks totaling $780 million, of
which $778 million was unused. Of these facilities, $70 million expires at various times
throughout 2006; $350 million expires in 2007, with the remaining $360 million expiring in 2010.
The facilities that expire in 2006 provide the option of converting borrowings into a two-year term
loan. The Company expects to renew its facilities, as needed, prior to expiration. The agreements
contain stated borrowing rates. All the agreements require payment of commitment fees based on the
unused portion of the commitments or the maintenance of compensating balances with the banks.
Commitment fees are less than 1/8 of 1 percent for the Company. Compensating balances are not
legally restricted from withdrawal. A fee is also paid to the agent bank.

The credit arrangements contain covenants that limit the level of indebtedness to
capitalization to 65 percent, as defined in the arrangements. For purposes of these definitions,
indebtedness excludes the long-term debt payable to affiliated trusts. In addition, the credit
arrangements contain cross default provisions that would trigger an event of default if the Company
defaulted on other indebtedness above a specified threshold. At December 31, 2005, the Company was
in compliance with all such covenants. None of the arrangements contain material adverse change
clauses at the time of borrowings.

The $778 million in unused credit arrangements provides liquidity support to the Company’s
variable rate pollution control bonds. The amount of variable rate pollution control bonds
outstanding requiring liquidity support as of December 31, 2005 was $106 million. In addition, the
Company borrows under a commercial paper program and an extendible commercial note program. The
amount of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2005 was $268 million. The amount of
commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2004 was $208 million. There were no outstanding
extendible commercial notes at December 31, 2005. Commercial paper is included in notes payable on
the balance sheets.

During 2005, the peak amount of short-term debt outstanding was $549 million and the average
amount outstanding was $242 million. The average annual interest rate on short-term debt in 2005
was 3.20 percent.

Financial Instruments

The Company enters into energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, gas, and
other fuel price changes. However, due to cost-based rate regulations, the Company has limited
exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity. See Note 3 under
“Retail Regulatory Matters – Fuel Hedging Program” for information on the Company’s fuel hedging
program. The Company also enters into hedges of forward electricity sales. There was no material
ineffectiveness recorded in earnings in 2005, 2004, and 2003.

At December 31, 2005, the fair value of derivative energy contracts was reflected in the
financial statements as follows:

The fair value gain or loss for hedges that are recoverable through the regulatory fuel
clauses are recorded in regulatory assets and liabilities and are recognized in earnings at the
same time the hedged items affect earnings. The Company has energy-related hedges in place up to
and including 2008.

The Company enters into derivatives to hedge exposure to interest rate changes. Derivatives
related to variable rate securities or forecasted transactions are accounted for as cash flow
hedges. The derivatives are generally structured to mirror the critical terms of the hedged debt
instruments; therefore, no material

II-179


NOTES (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2005 Annual Report

ineffectiveness has been recorded in earnings. In addition to interest rate swaps, the
Company has also entered into certain options agreements that effectively cap its interest rate
exposure in return for payment of a premium. In some cases, costless collars have been used that
effectively establish a floor and a ceiling to interest rate expense.

At December 31, 2005, the Company had $1.0 billion notional amounts of interest derivatives
accounted for as cash flow hedges outstanding with net fair value gains as follows:

The fair value gain or loss for cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive
income and is reclassified into earnings at the same time the hedged items affect earnings. In
2005, 2004, and 2003, the Company settled gains (losses) totaling $0.9 million, $(12.4) million,
and $(11.3) million, respectively, upon termination of certain interest derivatives at the same
time it issued debt. For the years 2005, 2004, and 2003, approximately $1.9 million, $3.9 million,
and $3.4 million, respectively, of pre-tax losses were reclassified from other comprehensive income
to interest expense. For 2006, pre-tax losses of approximately $0.5 million are expected to be
reclassified from other comprehensive income to interest expense. The Company has gains/losses
that are being amortized through 2017.

7. COMMITMENTS

Construction Program

The Company currently estimates property additions to be approximately $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion,
and $1.3 billion in 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively. These amounts include $44 million, $28
million, and $14 million in 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively, for construction expenditures
related to contractual purchase commitments for uranium and nuclear fuel conversion, enrichment,
and fabrication services included under “Fuel Commitments” herein. The construction program is
subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from estimates
because of numerous factors, including, but not limited to, changes in business conditions, changes
in FERC rules and transmission regulations, revised load growth estimates, changes in environmental
regulations, changes in existing nuclear plants to meet new regulatory requirements, increasing
costs of labor, equipment, and materials, and cost of capital. At December 31, 2005, significant
purchase commitments were outstanding in connection with the construction program.

The Company completed construction of Plant McIntosh Units 10 and 11 in June 2005 and has no
other generating plants currently under construction. Construction related to new transmission and
distribution facilities and capital improvements to existing generation, transmission and
distribution facilities, including those needed to meet environmental standards, is ongoing.

Long-Term Service Agreements

The Company and Savannah Electric have entered into a Long-Term Service Agreement (LTSA) with
General Electric (GE) for the purpose of securing maintenance support for the combustion
turbines at the Plant McIntosh combined cycle facility. In summary, the LTSA stipulates that GE
will perform all planned inspections on the covered equipment, which includes the cost of all
labor and materials. GE is also obligated to cover the costs of unplanned maintenance on the
covered equipment subject to a limit specified in each contract.

In general, this LTSA is in effect through two major inspection cycles per unit. Scheduled
payments to GE are made at various intervals based on actual operating hours of the respective
units. Total payments to GE under this agreement are currently estimated at $186 million over
the remaining term of the agreement, which may range up to 30 years. However, the LTSA contains
various cancellation provisions at the option of the Company.

The Company has also entered into an LTSA with GE through 2014 for neutron monitoring
system parts and electronics at Plant Hatch. Total remaining payments to GE under this
agreement are currently

II-180


NOTES (continued )

Georgia Power Company 2005 Annual Report

estimated at $13.1 million. The contract contains
cancellation provisions at the option of the Company.

Payments made to GE prior to the performance of any work are recorded as a prepayment in
the balance sheets. Work performed by GE is capitalized or charged to expense as appropriate
net of any joint owner billings, based on the nature of the work.

Fuel Commitments

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of its generating plants, the Company has entered into
various long-term commitments for the procurement of fossil and nuclear fuel. In most cases, these
contracts contain provisions for price escalations, minimum purchase levels, and other financial
commitments. Coal commitments include forward contract purchases for sulfur dioxide emission
allowances. Natural gas purchase commitments contain fixed volumes with prices based on various
indices at the time of delivery. Amounts included in the chart below represent estimates based on
New York Mercantile Exchange future prices at December 31, 2005.

Total estimated minimum long-term obligations at December 31, 2005 were as follows:

Additional commitments for coal and for nuclear fuel will be required to supply the Company’s
future needs.

SCS may enter into various types of wholesale energy and natural gas contracts acting as an
agent for the Company and all of the other Southern Company retail operating companies, Southern
Power, and Southern Company Gas. Under these agreements, each of the retail operating companies,
Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas may be jointly and severally liable. The creditworthiness
of Southern Power and Southern Company Gas is currently inferior to the creditworthiness of the
retail operating companies. Accordingly, Southern Company has entered into keep-well agreements
with the Company and each of the retail operating companies to insure they will not subsidize or be
responsible for any costs, losses, liabilities, or damages resulting from the inclusion of Southern
Power or Southern Company Gas as a contracting party under these agreements.

Purchased Power Commitments

The Company has commitments regarding a portion of a 5 percent interest in Plant Vogtle owned by
MEAG that are in effect until the latter of the retirement of the plant or the latest stated
maturity date of MEAG’s bonds issued to finance such ownership interest. The payments for capacity
are required whether or not any capacity is available. The energy cost is a function of each
unit’s variable operating costs. Except as noted below, the cost of such capacity and energy is
included in purchased power from non-affiliates in the Company’s statements of income. Capacity
payments totaled $54 million, $55 million, and $57 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.
The current projected Plant Vogtle capacity payments are:

Operating Leases

The Company has entered into various operating leases with various terms and expiration dates.
Rental expenses related to these operating leases totaled $38 million for 2005, $38 million for
2004, and $36 million for 2003.

At December 31, 2005, estimated minimum lease payments for these noncancelable operating
leases were as follows:

In addition to the rental commitments above, the Company has obligations upon expiration of
certain rail car leases with respect to the residual value of the leased property. These leases
expire in 2011 and the Company’s maximum obligation is $68 million. At the termination of the
leases, at the Company’s option, the Company may either exercise its purchase option or the
property can be sold to a third party. The Company expects that the fair market value of the
leased property would substantially reduce or eliminate the Company’s payments under the residual
value obligation. A portion of the rail car lease obligations is shared with the joint owners of
plants Scherer and Wansley. Rental expenses related to the rail car leases are fully recoverable
through the fuel cost recovery clause as ordered by the Georgia PSC.

Guarantees

Alabama Power has guaranteed unconditionally the obligation of SEGCO under an installment sale
agreement for the purchase of certain pollution control facilities at SEGCO’s generating units,
pursuant to which $24.5 million principal amount of pollution control revenue bonds are
outstanding. Alabama Power has also guaranteed $50 million in senior notes issued by SEGCO. The
Company has agreed to reimburse Alabama Power for the pro rata portion of such obligations
corresponding to the Company’s then proportionate ownership of stock of SEGCO if Alabama Power is
called upon to make such payment under its guaranty.

As discussed earlier in this note under “Operating Leases,” the Company has entered into
certain residual value guarantees related to rail car leases.

8. STOCK OPTION PLAN

Southern Company provides non-qualified stock options to a large segment of the Company’s employees
ranging from line management to executives. As of December 31, 2005, 1,551 current and former
employees of the Company participated in the stock option plan. The maximum number of shares of
Southern Company common stock that may be issued under this plan may not exceed 55 million. The
prices of options granted to date have been at the fair market value of the shares on the dates of
grant. Options granted to date become exercisable pro rata over a maximum period of three years
from the date of grant. Options outstanding will expire no later than 10 years after the date of
grant, unless terminated earlier by the Southern Company Board of Directors in accordance with the
stock option plan. Activity from 2003 to 2005 for the options granted

9. NUCLEAR INSURANCE

Under the Price-Anderson Amendments Act, the Company maintains agreements of indemnity with the NRC
that, together with private insurance, cover third-party liability arising from any nuclear
incident occurring at the Company’s nuclear power plants. The Act provides funds up to $10.76
billion for public liability claims that could arise from a single nuclear incident. Each nuclear
plant is insured against this liability to a maximum of $300 million by American Nuclear Insurers
(ANI), with the remaining coverage provided by a mandatory program of deferred premiums that could
be assessed, after a nuclear incident, against all owners of nuclear reactors. The Company could
be assessed up to $101 million per incident for each licensed reactor it operates but not more than
an aggregate of $15 million per incident to be paid in a calendar year for each reactor. Such
maximum assessment for the Company, excluding any applicable state premium taxes — based on its
ownership and buyback interests — is $203 million per incident but not more than an aggregate of
$30 million to be paid for each incident in any one year.

The Company is a member of Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), a mutual insurer
established to provide property damage insurance in an amount up to $500 million for members’
nuclear generating facilities.

Additionally, the Company has policies that currently provide decontamination, excess property
insurance, and premature decommissioning coverage up to $2.25 billion for losses in excess of the
$500 million primary coverage. This excess insurance is also provided by NEIL.

NEIL also covers additional costs that would be incurred in obtaining replacement power during
a prolonged accidental outage at a member’s nuclear plant. Members can purchase this coverage,
subject to a deductible waiting period of up to 26 weeks, with a maximum per occurrence per unit
limit of $490 million. After the deductible period, weekly indemnity payments would be received
until either the unit is operational or until the limit is exhausted in approximately three years.
The Company purchases the maximum limit allowed by NEIL subject to ownership limitations and has
elected a 12 week waiting period.

Under each of the NEIL policies, members are subject to assessments if losses each year exceed
the accumulated funds available to the insurer under that policy. The current maximum annual
assessments for the Company under the NEIL policies would be $48 million.

Following the terrorist attacks of September 2001, both ANI and NEIL confirmed that terrorist
acts against commercial nuclear power plants would, subject to the normal policy limits, be covered
under their insurance. Both companies, however, revised their policy terms on

II-183


NOTES (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2005 Annual Report

a prospective basis to include an industry aggregate for all “non-certified” terrorist acts
i.e., acts that are not certified acts of terrorism pursuant to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of
2002, which was renewed in 2005. The aggregate for all NEIL policies, which applies to
non-certified property claims stemming from terrorism within a 12-month duration, is $3.24 billion
plus any amounts available through reinsurance or indemnity from an outside source. The
non-certified ANI nuclear liability cap is a $300 million shared industry aggregate during the
normal ANI policy period.

For all on-site property damage insurance policies for commercial nuclear power plants, the
NRC requires that the proceeds of such policies shall be dedicated first for the sole purpose of
placing the reactor in a safe and stable condition after an accident. Any remaining proceeds are
to be applied next toward the costs of decontamination and debris removal operations ordered by the
NRC, and any further remaining proceeds are to be paid either to the Company or to its bond
trustees as may be appropriate under the policies and applicable trust indentures.

All retrospective assessments, whether generated for liability, property, or replacement
power, may be subject to applicable state premium taxes.

GULF POWER COMPANY

FINANCIAL SECTION

II-187


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Gulf Power Company:

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements of capitalization of Gulf Power
Company (the “Company”) (a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company) as of December 31, 2005 and
2004, and the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder’s equity, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control
over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express
no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements (pages II-208 to II-231) present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Gulf Power Company at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Gulf Power Company 2005 Annual Report

OVERVIEW

Business Activities

Gulf Power Company (the Company) operates as a vertically integrated utility providing
electricity to customers within its traditional service area located in northwest Florida and to
wholesale customers in the Southeast.

Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Company’s business of
selling electricity. These factors include the ability to maintain a stable regulatory
environment, to achieve energy sales growth while containing costs, and to recover rising costs.
These costs include those related to growing demand, increasingly stringent environmental
standards, fuel prices, and storm restoration costs. Appropriately balancing environmental
expenditures with customer prices will continue to challenge the Company for the foreseeable
future.

Hurricanes Dennis and Katrina hit the Gulf Coast of Florida in July 2005 and August 2005,
respectively, damaging portions of the Company’s service area. In September 2004, Hurricane
Ivan hit the Gulf Coast of Florida, causing substantial damage within the Company’s service
area. In February 2005, the Florida Public Service Commission (PSC) approved the recovery of
the Company’s storm damage costs related to Hurricane Ivan through a two-year surcharge that
began in April 2005. Later in 2005, the Florida Legislature also approved securitized financing
for hurricane costs and in February 2006, the Company filed with the Florida PSC requesting
permission to issue securitized bonds to recover the remaining costs of these storms and to
replenish its property damage reserve. See Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements under
“Property Damage Reserve” and “Retail Regulatory Matters – Storm Damage Cost Recovery,”
respectively for additional information.

Key Performance Indicators

In striving to maximize shareholder value while providing cost-effective energy to over 400,000
customers, the Company continues to focus on several key indicators. These indicators include
customer satisfaction, plant availability, system reliability, and net income. The Company’s
financial success is directly tied to the satisfaction of its customers. Key elements of
ensuring customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high reliability, and competitive
prices. Management uses customer satisfaction surveys and reliability indicators to evaluate
the Company’s results. Peak season equivalent forced outage rate (Peak Season EFOR) is an
indicator of plant availability and efficient generation fleet operations during the months when
generation needs are greatest. The rate is calculated by dividing the number of hours of forced
outages by total generation hours. Peak Season EFOR performance was adjusted to exclude the
impact of outages at Plants Crist and Smith, which were attributed to manufacturer and/or vendor
defects as well as removing the effects of Hurricanes Dennis and Katrina. Transmission and
distribution system reliability performance is measured by the frequency and duration of
outages. Performance targets for reliability are set internally based on historical
performance, expected weather conditions, and expected economic conditions. Net income is the
primary component of the Company’s contribution to Southern Company’s earnings per share goal.
The Company’s 2005 results compared with its targets for some of these indicators are reflected

Earnings

The Company’s 2005 net income after dividends on preferred stock was $75.2 million, an increase of
$7.0 million from the previous year. In 2004, earnings were $68.2 million, a decrease of $0.8
million from the previous year. In 2003, earnings were $69.0 million, an increase of $2.0 million
from the previous year. The

II-189


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2005 Annual Report

increase in earnings in 2005 is due primarily to higher retail sales
and lower non-fuel operating expenses, excluding expenses related to Hurricane Ivan storm damage,
which are offset by revenues and do not affect earnings. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “PSC
Matters – Storm Damage Cost Recovery” herein. The decrease in earnings in 2004 was due primarily
to higher operating expenses related to replenishing property damage reserves and increased
expenses related to employee benefits. The improvement in earnings in 2003 was primarily due to
higher operating revenues related to an increase in base rates, offset somewhat by higher operating
expenses and increases in depreciation expense primarily related to the commercial operation of
Plant Smith Unit 3.

these changes are shown in the table above.

Fuel and other cost recovery includes recovery provisions for fuel expenses and the energy
component of purchased power costs, energy conservation costs, purchased power capacity costs, and
environmental compliance costs. Annually, the Company petitions for recovery of projected costs
including any true-up amount from prior periods, and approved rates are implemented each January.
Other cost recovery also includes revenues related to the recovery of expenses related to Hurricane
Ivan as approved by the Florida PSC. The recovery provisions generally equal the related expenses
and have no material effect on net income. See Note 1 to the financial statements under
“Revenues,” “Property Damage Reserve,” and “Environmental Cost Recovery” and Note 3 to the
financial statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters – Environmental Cost Recovery” and “– Storm Damage Cost Recovery” for additional
information.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Sales for resale were $175.7 million in 2005, a decrease of $8.1 million, or 4.4 percent, as
compared to 2004, primarily due to lower energy sales to affiliates resulting from decreases in the
Company’s available generation as a result of outages at Plants Crist and Smith, which were
attributed to manufacturer and/or vendor defects. Sales for resale were $183.8 million in 2004, an
increase of $43.8 million, or 31.3 percent, as compared to 2003, primarily due to energy sales to
affiliates at a higher unit cost resulting from higher incremental fuel prices. Sales for resale
were $140.0 million in 2003, an increase of $22.5 million, or 19.1 percent, as compared to 2002,
primarily due to increased energy sales to affiliates reflecting the availability of additional
generation following the commercial operation of Plant Smith Unit 3. Sales to and purchases from
affiliated companies vary from year to year depending on demand and the availability and cost of
generating resources at each company. These affiliate sales and purchases are made in accordance
with the Intercompany Interchange Contract (IIC), as approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC). These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings, since the
energy is generally sold at marginal cost and energy purchases are generally offset by revenues
through the Company’s fuel cost recovery clause.

Sales for resale to non-affiliates are predominantly unit power sales under long-term
contracts to other Florida utilities. Revenues from contracts have both capacity and energy
components. Capacity revenues reflect the recovery of fixed costs and a return on investment under
the contracts. Energy is generally sold at variable cost. The capacity and energy components
under these unit power contracts were as follows:

2010 through December 2015. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “Other Matters” herein for additional information.

Other operating revenues increased $3.6 million, $1.0 million, and $1.4 million in 2005, 2004,
and 2003, respectively, primarily due to an increase in franchise fees, which are proportional to
changes in revenue.

primarily due to milder summer weather, as compared to 2002.

Commercial sales increased 1.1 percent in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to customer
growth. Commercial sales increased 2.2 percent in 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to more

as compared to 2002, primarily due to customer growth, which offset milder summer weather.

Industrial sales increased 2.3 percent in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to
additional sales to customers with gas-fired cogeneration resulting from high natural gas prices.
Industrial sales decreased 1.6 percent in 2004, as compared to
2003, primarily due to the short-term outage experienced as a result of Hurricane Ivan in September 2004. Industrial sales
increased 4.5 percent in 2003, when compared to 2002, primarily due to additional

II-191


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2005 Annual Report

sales to customers with gas-fired cogeneration resulting from high natural gas prices.

Total energy sales to retail customers are projected to increase at a compound average growth
rate of 1.8 percent during the period 2006 through 2010 due to customer growth, assuming normal
weather conditions.

Sales for resale to non-affiliates increased 1.7 percent in 2005, decreased 9.9 percent in
2004, and increased 16.1 percent in 2003, each as compared to the prior year primarily as a result
of fluctuations in the fuel cost to produce energy sold to non-affiliated utilities under long-term
contracts and energy sold to other non-affiliated utilities under short-term contracts. The degree
to which oil and natural gas prices, which are the primary fuel sources for these customers, differ
from the Company’s fuel costs will influence these changes in sales. The fluctuations in sales
have a minimal effect on earnings because the energy is generally sold at variable cost.

Expenses

Total operating expenses increased $109.9 million, or 13.5 percent, in 2005, $89.6 million, or 12.3
percent, in 2004, and $50.8 million, or 7.5 percent, in 2003 over the amount recorded in the prior
year primarily due to higher fuel and operation and maintenance expenses.

Fuel and Purchased Power

Fuel costs constitute the single largest expense for the Company. The mix of fuel sources for
generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and
the availability of generation resources. Fuel expense increased $48.6 million, or 13.2
percent, in 2005, $50.7 million, or 16.0 percent, in 2004, and $42.6 million, or 15.6 percent,
in 2003, compared to the prior year primarily due to increased demand for energy and higher
average costs of fuel.

The amount and sources of generation, the average cost of fuel per net KWH generated,
and the average costs of purchased power were as follows:

Purchased power expense in 2005 increased $32.5 million, or 49.3 percent, as compared to 2004,
primarily due to an increase in volume and cost of energy purchased from affiliates to meet the
Company’s higher territorial load. Purchased power expense in 2004 increased $15.7 million, or
31.4 percent, as compared to 2003, primarily due to increased power purchases from merchant
generation resources to minimize total system production cost. Purchased power expense decreased
in 2003 by $12.8 million, or 20.4 percent, as compared to 2002, primarily due to a decrease in the
volume of energy needed to meet the Company’s load requirements.

A significant upward trend in the cost of coal and natural gas has emerged since 2003, and
volatility in these markets is expected to continue. Increased coal prices have been influenced by
a worldwide increase in demand as a result of rapid economic growth in China, as well as by
increases in mining costs. Higher natural gas prices in the United States are the result of
increased demand and slightly lower gas supplies despite increased drilling activity. Natural gas
supply interruptions, such as those caused by the 2004 and 2005 hurricanes, result in an immediate
market response; however, the long-term impact of this price volatility may be reduced by imports
of natural gas and liquefied natural gas. Fuel expenses generally do not affect net income, since
they are offset by fuel revenues by the Company’s fuel cost recovery provisions.

Other Operation and Maintenance

In 2005, other operation and maintenance expenses increased $20.1 million, or 8.7 percent, as
compared to

II-192


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2005 Annual Report

the prior year primarily due to the recovery of $20.4 million in Hurricane Ivan
restoration costs as approved by the Florida PSC. Since these expenses are recognized as
revenues are collected, there is no impact on net income. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “PSC
Matters – Storm Damage Cost Recovery” herein and Note 3 to the financial statements under
“Retail Regulatory Matters – Storm Damage Cost Recovery” for additional information. In 2004,
other operation and maintenance expenses increased $19.0 million, or 9.0 percent, as compared to
the prior year primarily due to increases of $7.9 million in the property damage reserve, $2.9
million in the accrued expenses for uninsured litigation and workers compensation claims, $3.4
million for employee benefit expenses, and $2.5 million for production expenses. In 2003, other
operation and maintenance expenses increased $10.6 million, or 5.3 percent, as compared to the
prior year primarily due to an increase of $1.6 million of customer accounts expense and an
increase of $7.1 million in the property damage reserve. See Notes 1 and 3 to the financial
statements under “Property Damage Reserve” and “Retail Regulatory Matters – Storm Damage Cost
Recovery,” respectively, for additional information on the property damage reserve.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expense increased $2.2 million, or 2.7 percent, in 2005 as
compared to the prior year primarily due to the completion of environmental control projects at
Plant Crist Unit 7. Depreciation and amortization expense remained relatively flat in 2004 as
compared to the prior year due to no significant change in depreciable assets. Depreciation and
amortization expense increased $5.3 million, or 6.9 percent, in 2003 as compared to the prior
year primarily due to the commercial operation of Plant Smith Unit 3. The 2003 increase also
reflects the amortization of a regulatory asset related to corporate facilities, in accordance
with an order from the Florida PSC.

Taxes Other Than Income Taxes

Taxes other than income taxes increased $6.5 million, or 9.3 percent, in 2005, $3.7 million,
or 5.7 percent, in 2004, and $5.1 million, or 8.3 percent, in 2003 primarily due to
increases in franchise and gross receipts taxes, which are directly related to the increase in
retail revenues. Taxes other than income taxes for 2003 also increased as a result of higher
property taxes.

Other Income and (Expense)

The equity portion of allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) decreased $0.7 million,
or 37.1 percent, in 2005 and increased $1.1 million, or 160.7 percent, in 2004 as compared
to the prior year primarily due to environmental control projects at Plant Crist Unit 7. AFUDC
decreased $2.3 million, or 76.1 percent, in 2003 as compared to the prior year primarily due to the
completion of Plant Smith Unit 3. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “Environmental Matters –
Environmental Statutes and Regulations” herein and Note 1 to the financial statements under
“Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC)” for additional information.

Interest income increased $2.6 million, or 210.9 percent, in 2005 as compared to the prior
year primarily due to interest received from a tax refund resulting from Hurricane Ivan and
interest received related to the recovery of financing costs associated with Hurricane Ivan. See
FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “Storm Damage Cost Recovery” herein and Note 3 to the financial
statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters – Storm Damage Cost Recovery” for additional
information. Interest income remained relatively flat in 2004 and 2003 as compared to the prior
year.

Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $4.2 million, or 13.5 percent, in 2005
as compared to the prior year as the result of higher interest rates on variable-rate pollution
control bonds and an increase in outstanding short-term debt as a result of hurricane related
costs. Interest expense decreased $2.1 million, or 5.5 percent, in 2004 as compared to the prior
year and $1.8 million, or 4.6 percent, in 2003 as compared to the prior year primarily as the
result of refinancing higher cost securities.

Other deductions decreased $1.4 million, or 32.2 percent, in 2005 and $1.5 million, or 25.7
percent, in 2004 and increased $1.4 million, or 33.9 percent, in 2003 as compared to the prior
years as a result of changes in charitable contributions.

Effects of Inflation

The Company is subject to rate regulation based on the recovery of historical costs. In addition,
the income tax laws are based on historical costs. Therefore, inflation

II-193


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2005 Annual Report

creates an economic loss because the Company is recovering its costs of investments in dollars
that have less purchasing power. While the inflation rate has been relatively low in recent years,
it continues to have an adverse effect on the Company because of the large investment in utility
plant with long economic lives. Conventional accounting for historical cost does not recognize
this economic loss nor the partially offsetting gain that arises through financing facilities with
fixed-money obligations, such as long-term debt and preferred securities. Any recognition of
inflation by regulatory authorities is reflected in the rate of return allowed in the Company’s
approved electric rates.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL

General

The Company operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electricity to customers within
its traditional service area located in northwest Florida and to wholesale customers in the
Southeast. Prices for electricity provided by the Company to retail customers are set by the
Florida PSC under cost-based regulatory principles. Prices for electricity relating to jointly
owned generating facilities, interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power
are set by the FERC. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES – “Application of Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates – Electric Utility Regulation” herein and Note 3 to the financial statements under “FERC
Matters” and “Retail Regulatory Matters” for additional information about these and other
regulatory matters.

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of future
earnings potential. The level of the Company’s future earnings depends on numerous factors that
affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Company’s primary business of selling
electricity. These factors include the ability of the Company to maintain a stable regulatory
environment that continues to allow for the recovery of all prudently incurred costs. Future
earnings in the near term will depend, in part, upon growth in energy sales, which is subject to
a number of factors. These factors include weather, competition, new energy contracts with
neighboring utilities, energy conservation practiced by customers, the price of electricity, the
price elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic growth in the Company’s service area.

Environmental Matters

New Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil action in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against certain Southern Company
subsidiaries, including Alabama Power and Georgia Power, alleging that these subsidiaries had
violated the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act and related state laws at
certain coal-fired generating facilities. Through subsequent amendments and other legal
procedures, the EPA added Savannah Electric as a defendant to the original action and filed a
separate action against Alabama Power in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
Alabama after it was dismissed from the original action. In these lawsuits, the EPA alleges
that NSR violations occurred at eight coal-fired generating facilities operated by Alabama
Power, Georgia Power, and Savannah Electric. The civil actions request penalties and injunctive
relief, including an order requiring the installation of the best available control technology
at the affected units. The EPA concurrently issued notices of violation relating to the
Company’s Plant Crist and a unit partially owned by the Company at Plant Scherer. See Note 4 to
the financial statements for information on the Company’s ownership interest in Plant Scherer
Unit 3. In early 2000, the EPA filed a motion to amend its complaint to add the allegations in
the notices of violation and to add the Company as a defendant. However, in March 2001, the
court denied the motion based on lack of jurisdiction, and the EPA has not refiled.

On June 3, 2005, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama issued a
decision in favor of Alabama Power on two primary legal issues in the case; however, the
decision does not resolve the case, nor does it address other legal issues associated with the
EPA’s allegations. In accordance with a separate court order, Alabama Power and the EPA are
currently participating in mediation with respect to the EPA’s claims. The action against
Georgia Power and Savannah Electric has been administratively closed since the spring of 2001,
and none of the parties has sought to reopen the case. See Note 3 to the financial statements
under “Environmental Matters – New Source Review Actions” for additional information.

II-194


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2005 Annual Report

The Company believes that it has complied with applicable laws and the EPA regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act
authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $32,500 per day, per violation at each generating
unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in this matter could
require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly
require payment of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of operations, cash
flows, and possibly financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

In December 2002 and October 2003, the EPA issued final revisions to its NSR regulations under
the Clean Air Act. A coalition of states and environmental organizations filed petitions for
review of these regulations. On June 24, 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit upheld, in part, the EPA’s December 2002 revisions to its NSR regulations, which
included changes to the regulatory exclusions and methods of calculating emissions increases.
However, the court vacated portions of those revisions, including those addressing the exclusion of
certain pollution control projects. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP)
formally adopted the 2002 NSR rules in January 2006, but did not adopt the provisions vacated by
the court. The October 2003 revisions, which clarified the scope of the existing Routine
Maintenance, Repair and Replacement exclusion, have been stayed by the Court of Appeals pending its
review of the rules. On October 20, 2005, the EPA also published a proposed rule clarifying the
test for determining when an emissions increase subject to the NSR requirements has occurred. The
impact of these revisions and proposed rules will depend on adoption of the final rules by the EPA
and the State of Florida’s implementation of such rules, as well as the outcome of any additional
legal challenges, and, therefore, cannot be determined at this time.

Carbon Dioxide Litigation

In July 2004, attorneys general from eight states, each outside of Southern Company’s service
territory, and the corporation counsel for New York City filed a complaint in the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York against Southern Company and four other electric power
companies. A nearly identical complaint was filed by three environmental groups in the same court. The complaints allege that the companies’
emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, contribute to global warming, which the plaintiffs
assert is a public nuisance. Under common law public and private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs
seek a judicial order (1) holding each defendant jointly and severally liable for creating,
contributing to, and/or maintaining global warming and (2) requiring each of the defendants to cap
its emissions of carbon dioxide and then reduce those emissions by a specified percentage each year
for at least a decade. Plaintiffs have not, however, requested that damages be awarded in
connection with their claims. Southern Company believes these claims are without merit and notes
that the complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis for the claims. In September 2005, the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted Southern Company’s and the other
defendants’ motions to dismiss these cases. The plaintiffs filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit on October 19, 2005. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot
be determined at this time.

Environmental Statutes and Regulations

General

The Company’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by state and federal environmental
agencies under a variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental media, including air,
water, and land resources. Applicable statutes include the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Emergency Planning & Community
Right-to-Know Act; and the Endangered Species Act.

Compliance with these environmental requirements involves significant capital and operating
costs, a major portion of which is expected to be recovered through existing ratemaking provisions.
Through 2005, the Company had invested approximately $171.5 million in capital projects to comply
with these requirements, with annual totals of $45.3 million, $67.2 million, and $37.7 million for
2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Over the next decade, the Company expects that capital
expenditures to assure compliance with existing and new regulations could exceed an additional $761
million, including $48 million, $131 million, and $141 million for 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively. Because the Company’s compliance strategy is impacted by
changes to existing environmental laws and regulations, the cost,

II-195


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2005 Annual Report

availability, and existing inventory of emission allowances, and the Company’s fuel mix, the ultimate outcome cannot be
determined at this time. Environmental costs that are known and estimable at this time are
included in capital expenditures discussed under FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – “Capital
Requirements and Contractual Obligations” herein. The Florida Legislature has adopted legislation
that allows a utility to petition the Florida PSC for recovery of prudent environmental compliance
costs that are not being recovered through base rates or any other recovery mechanism. The
legislation is discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters –
Environmental Cost Recovery.” Substantially all of the costs for the Clean Air Act and other new
environmental legislation discussed below are expected to be recovered through the environmental
cost recovery clause.

Compliance with possible additional federal or state legislation or regulations related to
global climate change, air quality, or other environmental and health concerns could also
significantly affect the Company. New environmental legislation or regulations, or changes to
existing statutes or regulations, could affect many areas of the Company’s operations; however,
the full impact of any such changes cannot be determined at this time.

Air Quality

Compliance with the Clean Air Act and resulting regulations has been and will continue to be a
significant focus for the Company. Through 2005, the Company had spent approximately $52.4 million
in reducing sulfur dioxide (SO


) and nitrogen oxide (NO

x

) emissions and in
monitoring emissions pursuant to the Clean Air Act. Additional controls have been announced and
are currently being installed at several plants to further reduce SO


and NO

x

emissions, to maintain compliance with existing regulations, and to meet new requirements.

In 2005, the Company substantially completed the terms of a 2002 agreement with the State of
Florida calling for NO

x

emission reductions at Plant Crist to help ensure attainment of the
new standards in the Pensacola, Florida area. The conditions of the agreement, which required
installing additional controls on Plant Crist units and retiring Plant Crist Units 1, 2, and 3,
will be fully implemented by the end of 2006 at a cost of approximately $134.4 million, of which
$4.3 million remains to be spent.

In 2005, the EPA revoked the one-hour ozone standard and published the final set of rules for
implementation of the new, more stringent eight-hour ozone standard. With the exception of Macon,
Georgia, where Plant Scherer is located, no area within the Company’s service area has been
designated as nonattainment under the eight-hour ozone standard. State implementation plans,
including new emission control regulations necessary to bring nonattainment areas into attainment
are required for most areas by June 2007. These state implementation plans could require further
reductions in NO

x

emissions from power plants.

During 2005, the EPA’s fine particulate matter nonattainment designations became effective for
areas within Georgia, and the EPA proposed a rule for the implementation of the fine particulate
matter standard. The EPA plans to finalize the proposed implementation rule in 2006. State plans
for addressing the nonattainment designations are required by April 2008 and could require further
reductions in SO


and NO

x

emissions from power plants. The EPA has also
published proposed revisions to lower the levels of particulate matter currently allowed.

The EPA issued the final Clean Air Interstate Rule on March 10, 2005. This cap-and-trade rule
addresses power plant SO


and NO

x

emissions that were found to contribute to
nonattainment of the eight-hour ozone and fine particulate matter standards in downwind states.
Twenty-eight eastern states, including Florida and Georgia, are subject to the requirements of the
rule. The rule calls for additional reductions of NO

x

and/or SO


to be
achieved in two phases, 2009/2010 and 2015. These reductions will be accomplished by the
installation of additional emission controls at the Company’s coal-fired facilities or by the
purchase of emission allowances from a cap-and-trade program.

The Clean Air Visibility Rule (formerly called the Regional Haze Rule) was finalized on July
6, 2005. The goal of this rule is to restore natural visibility conditions in certain areas
(primarily national parks and wilderness areas) by 2064. The rule involves the application of Best
Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements and a review each decade, beginning in 2018, of
progress toward the goal. BART requires that sources that contribute to visibility impairment
implement additional emission reductions, if necessary, to make progress toward remedying current visibility concerns.
For power

plants, the Clean Air Visibility Rule allows states to determine that the Clean Air
Interstate Rule satisfies BART requirements for SO


and NO

x

. However,
additional requirements could be imposed. By December 17, 2007, states must submit implementation
plans that contain emission reduction strategies for implementing BART requirements and for
achieving sufficient and reasonable progress toward the goal.

On March 15, 2005, the EPA announced the final Clean Air Mercury Rule, a cap-and-trade program
for the reduction of mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. The rule sets caps on mercury
emissions to be implemented in two phases, 2010 and 2018, and provides for an emission allowance
trading market. The Company anticipates that emission controls installed to achieve compliance
with the Clean Air Interstate Rule and the eight-hour ozone and fine-particulate standards will
also result in mercury emission reductions. However, the long-term capability of emission control
equipment to reduce mercury emissions is still being evaluated, and the installation of additional
control technologies may be required.

The impacts of the eight-hour ozone standard, the fine particulate matter nonattainment
designations, the Clean Air Interstate Rule, the Clean Air Visibility Rule, and the Clean Air
Mercury Rule on the Company will depend on the development and implementation of rules at the state
level. States implementing the Clean Air Mercury Rule and the Clean Air Interstate Rule, in
particular, have the option not to participate in the national cap-and-trade programs and could
require reductions greater than those mandated by the federal rules. Such impacts will also depend
on resolution of pending legal challenges to the Clean Air Interstate Rule, the Clean Air Mercury
Rule and a related petition from the State of North Carolina under Section 126 of the Clean Air
Act, also related to the interstate transport of air pollutants. Therefore, the full impacts of
these regulations on the Company cannot be determined at this time. The Company has developed and
continually updates a comprehensive environmental compliance strategy to comply with the continuing
and new environmental requirements discussed above. As part of this strategy, the Company plans to
install additional SO


, NO

x

, and mercury emission controls within the next several years to
assure continued compliance with applicable air quality requirements.

Water Quality

In July 2004, the EPA published final rules under the Clean Water Act for the purpose of reducing
impingement and entrainment of fish and fish larvae at power plants’ cooling water intake
structures. The new rules require baseline biological information and, perhaps, installation of
fish protection technology near some intake structures at existing power plants. The full impact
of these new rules will depend on the results of studies and analyses performed as part of the
rules’ implementation and the actual requirements established by state regulatory agencies, and
therefore, cannot now be determined.

Environmental Remediation

The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling and
disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations,
the Company could incur substantial costs to clean up properties. The Company conducts studies to
determine the extent of any required cleanup and has recognized in the financial statements the
costs to clean up known sites. Amounts for cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs were not material
for any year presented. The Company may be liable for some or all required clean up costs for
additional sites that may require environmental remediation. See Note 3 to the financial
statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters – Environmental Remediation” for additional
information.

Global Climate Issues

Domestic efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions have been spurred by international discussions
surrounding the Framework Convention on Climate Change, and specifically the Kyoto Protocol, which
proposes constraints on the emissions of greenhouse gases for a group of industrialized countries.
The Bush Administration has not supported U.S. ratification of the Kyoto Protocol or other
mandatory carbon dioxide reduction legislation; however, in 2002, it did announce a goal to reduce
the greenhouse gas intensity of the U.S., the ratio of greenhouse gas emissions to the value of
U.S. economic output, by 18 percent by 2012. A year later, the Department of Energy (DOE)
announced the Climate VISION program to support this goal. Energy-intensive industries, including
electricity generation, are the initial focus of this program. Southern Company is involved in the
development of a voluntary electric utility sector climate change initiative in partnership with
the government. In a memorandum of understanding signed in December 2004 with the DOE under
Climate VISION, the utility sector pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions rate by 3 percent to 5 percent by
2010 – 2012. The Company is continuing to evaluate future energy and emissions profiles relative
to the Climate VISION

II-197

program and is analyzing voluntary programs to support the industry initiative.

FERC Matters

Market-Based Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates at market-based
prices. The Company also has FERC authority to make short-term opportunity sales at market
rates. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a market-based contract with an
affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation
dominance within its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other
markets is not an issue in that proceeding. In February 2005, Southern Company submitted
responsive information. In February 2006, the FERC suspended the proceeding to allow the
parties to conduct settlement discussions. Any new market-based rate transactions in its retail
service territory entered into after February 27, 2005 are subject to refund to the level of the
default cost-based rates, pending the outcome of the proceeding. The impact of such sales
through December 31, 2005 is expected to be immaterial to the Company. The refund period covers
15 months. In the event that the FERC’s default mitigation measures for entities that are found
to have market power are ultimately applied, the Company may be required to charge cost-based
rates for certain wholesale sales in the Southern Company retail service territory, which may be
lower than negotiated market-based rates. The final outcome of this matter will depend on the
form in which the final methodology for assessing generation market power and mitigation rules
may be ultimately adopted and cannot be determined at this time.

In addition, in May 2005, the FERC started an investigation to determine whether Southern
Company satisfies the other three parts of the FERC’s market-based rate analysis: transmission
market power, barriers to entry, and affiliate abuse or reciprocal dealing. The FERC established a
new refund period related to this expanded investigation. Any and all new market-based rate
transactions both inside and outside Southern Company’s retail service territory involving any
Southern Company subsidiary, including the Company, will be subject to refund to the extent the
FERC orders lower rates as a result of this new investigation, with the 15-month refund period
beginning July 19, 2005. The impact of such sales through December 31, 2005 is expected to be
immaterial to the Company. The FERC also directed that this expanded proceeding be held in
abeyance pending the outcome of the proceeding on the IIC discussed below.

The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for this proceeding and is vigorously
defending itself in this matter. However, the final outcome of this matter, including any remedies
to be applied in the event of an adverse ruling in this proceeding, cannot now be determined.

Intercompany Interchange Contract

The Company’s generation fleet in its retail service territory is operated under the IIC, as
approved by the FERC. In May 2005, the FERC initiated a new proceeding to examine (1) the
provisions of the IIC among Alabama Power, Georgia Power, the Company, Mississippi Power, Savannah
Electric, Southern Power, and Southern Company Services, as agent, under the terms of which the
power pool of Southern Company is operated, and, in particular, the propriety of the continued
inclusion of Southern Power as a party to the IIC, (2) whether any parties to the IIC have violated
the FERC’s standards of conduct applicable to utility companies that are transmission providers,
and (3) whether Southern Company’s code of conduct defining Southern Power as a “system company”
rather than a “marketing affiliate” is just and reasonable. In connection with the formation of
Southern Power, the FERC authorized Southern Power’s inclusion in the IIC in 2000. The FERC also
previously approved Southern Company’s code of conduct. The FERC order directs that the
administrative law judge who presided over a proceeding involving approval of PPAs between Southern
Power and Georgia Power and Savannah Electric be assigned to preside over the hearing in this
proceeding and that the testimony and exhibits presented in that proceeding be preserved to the
extent appropriate. Hearings are scheduled for September 2006. Effective July 19, 2005, revenues
from transactions under the IIC involving any Southern Company subsidiaries, including the Company,
are subject to refund to the extent the FERC orders any changes to the IIC.

The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for this proceeding and is vigorously
defending itself in this matter. However, the final outcome of this matter, including any remedies
to be applied in the event of an

II-198


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2005 Annual Report

adverse ruling in this proceeding, cannot now be determined.

Generation Interconnection Agreements

In July 2003, the FERC issued its final rule on the standardization of generation
interconnection agreements and procedures (Order 2003). Order 2003 shifts much of the financial
burden of new transmission investment from the generator to the transmission provider. The FERC
has indicated that Order 2003, which was effective January 20, 2004, is to be applied
prospectively to interconnection agreements. Subsidiaries of Tenaska, Inc., as counterparties
to three previously executed interconnection agreements with subsidiaries of Southern Company,
including the Company, have filed complaints at the FERC requesting that the FERC modify the
agreements and that Southern Company refund amounts previously paid for interconnection
facilities, with interest. These proceedings are still pending at the FERC. The Company has
received similar requests from other entities totaling approximately $6.7 million. The Company
has opposed all such requests. The impact of Order 2003 and its subsequent rehearings on the
Company and the final results of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Transmission

In December 1999, the FERC issued its final rule on Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs).
Since that time, there have been a number of additional proceedings at the FERC designed to
encourage further voluntary formation of RTOs or to mandate their formation. However, at the
current time, there are no active proceedings that would require the Company to participate in
an RTO. Current FERC efforts that may potentially change the regulatory and/or operational
structure of transmission include rules related to the standardization of generation
interconnection, as well as an inquiry into, among other things, market power by vertically
integrated utilities. See “Market-Based Rate Authority” and “Generation Interconnection
Agreements” above for additional information. The final outcome of these proceedings cannot now
be determined. However, the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash
flows could be adversely affected by future changes in the federal regulatory or operational
structure of transmission.

PSC Matters

Fuel Cost Recovery

The Company has established fuel cost recovery rates approved by the Florida PSC. Over the past
year, the Company has continued to experience higher than expected fuel costs for coal and natural
gas. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the under recovered balance was $31.6 million and $7.9
million, respectively, primarily due to increased costs for coal and natural gas. The Company
continuously monitors the under recovered fuel cost balance in light of these higher fuel costs.
If the projected fuel revenue over or under recovery exceeds 10 percent of the projected fuel costs
for the period, the Company is required to notify the Florida PSC to determine if an adjustment to
the fuel cost recovery factor is necessary.

In December 2005, the Florida PSC approved an increase of approximately 9 percent in the fuel
factor for retail customers, effective with billings beginning January 2006. Fuel cost recovery
revenues, as recorded on the financial statements, are adjusted for differences in actual
recoverable costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, any change in the
billing factor would have no significant effect on the Company’s revenues or net income, but would
change annual cash flow.

Storm Damage Cost Recovery

Under authority granted by the Florida PSC, the Company maintains a reserve for property damage to
cover the cost of uninsured damages from major storms to its transmission and distribution
facilities, generation facilities, and other property. See Note 1 to the financial statements
under “Property Damage Reserve” for additional information.

In September 2004, Hurricane Ivan hit the Gulf Coast of Florida and Alabama causing
substantial damage to the Company’s service territory. The related costs charged to the Company’s
property damage reserve as of December 31, 2004 were $93.5 million. In February 2005, the Citizens
of the State of Florida through the Office of Public Counsel, the Florida Industrial Power Users
Group, and the Company filed a Stipulation and Settlement (Stipulation) with the Florida PSC, which
the Florida PSC subsequently approved in March 2005, allowing the Company to recover the retail
portion of $51.7 million of Hurricane Ivan storm damage costs, plus interest and revenue taxes,
through a monthly surcharge applied to

II-199


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2005 Annual Report

retail customer bills for a 24-month period that began in April 2005. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had recovered $21.2 million of these costs.
Under the Stipulation, the Company also agreed that it will not seek any additional increase in its
base rates and charges to become effective on or before March 1, 2007.

In July and August 2005, Hurricanes Dennis and Katrina, respectively, hit the Gulf Coast of
the United States and caused additional damage in the Company’s service area. Hurricanes Dennis and
Katrina restoration costs were approximately $64 million, of which approximately $56 million
relates to operation and maintenance expenses. Approximately $1 million of these costs is expected
to be covered through insurance.

Prior to Hurricane Ivan, the Company’s reserve balance was approximately $27.8 million. The
Company made discretionary accruals to the reserve of $6 million and $15 million in 2005 and 2004,
respectively. As of December 31, 2005, the deficit balance in the Company’s property damage
reserve accounts totaled approximately $43.6 million, of which approximately $3.5 million and $40.1
million, respectively, is included in the balance sheets herein under Current Assets and Deferred
Charges and Other Assets. The established policy of the Florida PSC, as recently reaffirmed by its
decision following the 2004 hurricane experience of Florida’s investor owned electric utilities,
provides for recovery of these costs through the mechanism of the property insurance reserve and,
where necessary, through a special recovery surcharge.

In 2005, the Florida Legislature authorized securitized financing for hurricane costs. On
February 22, 2006, the Company filed a petition with the Florida PSC under this legislative
authority requesting permission to issue $87.2 million in securitized storm-recovery bonds. The
bonds would be repaid over eight years from revenues to be received from storm-recovery charges
implemented under the securitization plan and billed to customers. If approved as proposed, the
plan would resolve the Company’s remaining deferred costs, by refinancing, net of taxes, the
remaining balance of storm damage costs currently being recovered from customers related to
Hurricane Ivan and financing, net of taxes, restoration costs associated with Hurricanes Dennis and
Katrina of approximately $54 million. It would also replenish the Company’s property damage
reserve with an additional $70 million. A decision on the plan is expected prior to the end of the
second quarter of 2006. The final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined; however,
since the Company will recognize expenses equal to the revenues billed to customers, the securitization plan would have no impact on the Company’s net
income, but would increase cash flow.

See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters – Storm Damage Cost
Recovery” for additional information.

Other Matters

On September 15, 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors, and on October 27, 2005, the sole
shareholder of the Company at that time, approved a Plan of Domestication pursuant to Maine law in order to
domesticate the Company as a Florida corporation. By domesticating the Company in the same state
where it operates as an electric utility subject to state regulation, the Company simplified
certain state and federal regulatory compliance requirements. The Company was formed in 1925 as a
Maine corporation and was qualified to do business in Florida as a foreign corporation the
following year when it began operations as an electric utility. The Company was also admitted to
do business in Mississippi in 1976 and in Georgia in 1984. The Company has maintained its
principal place of business in Florida continuously since 1926. The domestication was effective as
of November 2, 2005. The Company is now a Florida corporation. Under the applicable provisions of
Florida law, the Company’s legal existence was uninterrupted, with only its state of incorporation
changed.

In 2004, Georgia Power and the Company entered into PPAs with FP&L and Progress Energy
Florida. Under the agreements, Georgia Power and the Company will provide FP&L and Progress Energy
Florida with 165 megawatts and 74 megawatts, respectively, of capacity annually from the jointly
owned Plant Scherer Unit 3 for the period from June 2010 through December 2015. The contract
provides for fixed capacity payments and variable energy payments based on actual energy delivered.
The Florida PSC approved the contracts in 2005.

Also in 2004, Georgia Power and the Company entered into a PPA with Flint Electric Membership
Corporation. Under the agreement, Georgia Power and the Company will provide Flint Electric
Membership Corporation with 75 megawatts of capacity annually from

II-200


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2005 Annual Report

the jointly owned Plant Scherer Unit 3 for the period from June 2010 through December 2019.
The contract provides for fixed capacity payments and variable energy payments based on actual
energy delivered.

In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 87, Employers’
Accounting for Pensions, the Company recorded non-cash pre-tax pension income of approximately
$0.8 million, $2.5 million, and $4.9 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.
Postretirement benefit costs for the Company were $4.8 million, $5.1 million, and $4.9 million
in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Both pension and postretirement costs are expected to
continue to trend upward. Such amounts are dependent on several factors including trust
earnings and changes to the plans. A portion of pension and postretirement benefit costs is
capitalized based on construction-related labor charges. Pension and postretirement benefit
costs are a component of regulated rates and generally do not have a long-term effect on net
income. For more information regarding pension and postretirement benefits, see Note 2 to the
financial statements.

The Company is involved in various other matters being litigated and regulatory matters that
could affect future earnings. See Note 3 to the financial statements for information regarding
material issues.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may
have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations and related disclosures.
Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different
from those recorded in the financial statements. Management has reviewed and discussed critical
accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of Southern Company’s Board of
Directors.

Electric Utility Regulation

The Company is subject to retail regulation by the Florida PSC and wholesale regulation by the
FERC. These regulatory agencies set the rates the Company is permitted to charge customers
based on allowable costs. As a result, the Company applies FASB Statement No. 71, Accounting
for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (Statement No. 71), which requires the financial
statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the ratemaking process, the
regulators may require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when they
would be recognized by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of
expenses and the recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery
through rates or the deferral of gains or creation of liabilities and the recording of related
regulatory liabilities. The application of Statement No. 71 has a further effect on the
Company’s financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the
ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from those actually incurred by the Company;
therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation and pension
and postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on the Company’s results of operations
than they would on a non-regulated company.

As reflected in Note 1 to the financial statements, significant regulatory assets and
liabilities have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of these
regulatory assets and liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines and accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. However, adverse legislative, judicial, or
regulatory actions could materially impact the amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities
and could adversely impact the Company’s financial statements.

Contingent Obligations

The Company is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other
factors and conditions that potentially subject it to environmental, litigation, income tax, and
other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Note 3 to the financial statements for
more information regarding certain of these contingencies. The Company periodically evaluates
its exposure to such risks and records reserves for those matters where a loss is considered
probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with generally accepted accounting

II-201


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2005 Annual Report

principles.
The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or conditions that can
be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially affect the
Company’s financial statements. These events or conditions include the following:

•

Changes in existing state or federal regulation by governmental
authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality,
control of toxic substances, hazardous and solid wastes, and other
environmental matters.

•

Changes in existing income tax regulations or changes in Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) interpretations of existing regulations.

•

Identification of additional sites that require environmental
remediation or the filing of other complaints in which the Company may
be asserted to be a potentially responsible party.

•

Identification and evaluation of other potential lawsuits or
complaints in which the Company may be named as a defendant.

•

Resolution or progression of existing matters through the legislative
process, the court systems, the EPA, or the FDEP.

Unbilled Revenues

Revenues related to the sale of electricity are recorded when electricity is delivered to
customers. However, the determination of KWH sales to individual customers is based on the
reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the
end of each month, amounts of electricity delivered to customers, but not yet metered and
billed, are estimated. Components of the unbilled revenue estimates include total KWH
territorial supply, total KWH billed, estimated total electricity lost in delivery, and customer
usage. These components can fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including weather,
generation patterns, power delivery volume, and other operational constraints. These factors
can be unpredictable and can vary from historical trends. As a result, the overall estimate of
unbilled revenues could be significantly affected, which could have a material impact on the
Company’s results of operations.

New Accounting Standards

Income Taxes

In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 109-1, Application of FASB Statement No.
109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities
Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (FSP 109-1), which requires that the
generation deduction be accounted for as a special tax deduction rather than as a tax rate
reduction. The Company adopted FSP 109-1 in the first quarter of 2005 with no material impact
on the Company’s financial statements.

Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations

Effective December 31, 2005, the Company adopted the provision of FASB Interpretation No. 47
(FIN 47), Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires that an asset retirement
obligation be recorded even though the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on
future events. Prior to December 2005, the Company did not recognize asset retirement
obligations for asbestos removal and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain
transformers because the timing of their retirements was dependent on future events. At
December 31, 2005, the Company recorded additional asset retirement obligations (and assets) of
approximately $9.1 million. The adoption of FIN 47 did not have any effect on the Company’s
income statement. For additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements under
“Asset Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of Removal.”

Stock Options

On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, on a
modified prospective basis. This statement requires that compensation cost relating to
share-based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements. That cost will be
measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued.
Although the compensation expense required under the revised statement differs slightly, the
impacts on the Company’s financial statements are similar to the pro forma disclosures included
in Note 1 to the financial statements under “Stock Options.”

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

The Company’s financial condition continued to be stable at December 31, 2005. Net cash flow from
operating activities totaled $152.7 million, $143.2 million, and $191.2 million for 2005, 2004, and
2003, respectively. The increase from 2004 to 2005 is due primarily to the recovery of Hurricane
Ivan restoration costs. The majority

II-202


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2005 Annual Report

of the decrease from 2003 to 2004 is due to payments related
to storm damage from Hurricane Ivan. See “Financing Activities” herein for additional information.
Property additions were $142.6 million in 2005. Funds for the Company’s property additions were
provided by operating activities, capital contributions, and other financing activities. See the
statements of cash flows for additional information.

The Company’s ratio of common equity to total capitalization, including short-term debt,
was 43.0 percent in 2005, 43.2 percent in 2004, and 45.3 percent in 2003. See Note 6 to the
financial statements for additional information.

The Company has received investment grade ratings from the major rating agencies.

Sources of Capital

The Company plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from sources
similar to those used in the past, which were primarily from operating cash flows. However, the
type and timing of any future financings, if needed, will depend on market conditions, regulatory
approval, and other factors.

The Company has no restrictions on the amounts of unsecured indebtedness it may incur.
However, the Company is required to meet certain coverage requirements specified in its mortgage
indenture and corporate charter in order to issue new first mortgage bonds and preferred or
preference stock. The Company’s coverage ratios are high enough to permit, at present interest
rate levels, any foreseeable security sales. The amount of securities that the Company will be
permitted to issue in the future will depend upon market conditions and other factors prevailing at
that time.

The issuance of securities is subject to regulatory approval by the Florida PSC pursuant to
its rules and regulations. Additionally, with respect to the public offering of securities, the
Company files registration statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (1933 Act). The amounts of securities authorized by the Florida
PSC, as well as the amounts registered under the 1933 Act, are continuously monitored and
appropriate filings are made to ensure flexibility in the capital markets.

The Company obtains financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. See Note
6 to the financial statements under “Bank Credit Arrangements” for additional information. The
Southern Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of
the Company are not commingled with funds of any other company.

The Company’s current liabilities exceed current assets due to the scheduled maturity of $37.1
million of long-term debt in 2006. See “Financing Activities” herein for additional information.

To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the Company has various internal and external
sources of liquidity. At the beginning of 2006, the Company had approximately $3.8 million of cash
and cash equivalents, along with $120.5 million of unused committed lines of credit with banks to
meet its short-term cash needs. These bank credit arrangements will expire during 2006. The
Company plans to renew these lines of credit during 2006. In addition, the Company has substantial
cash flow from operating activities. See Note 6 to the financial statements under “Bank Credit
Arrangements” for additional information.

The Company may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company subsidiary
organized to issue and sell commercial paper and extendible commercial notes at the request and for
the benefit of the Company and the other retail operating companies. Proceeds from such issuances
for the benefit of the Company are loaned directly to the Company and are not commingled with
proceeds from such issuances for the benefit of any other retail operating company. There is no
cross affiliate credit support. At December 31, 2005, the Company had $15 million in commercial
paper notes and $75 million in bank notes outstanding.

Financing Activities

During 2005, the Company issued $60 million of senior notes. A portion of the proceeds of this
issuance was used for the legal defeasance of $30 million of principal of first mortgage bonds.
The remainder of the funds from the sale of senior notes was used for general corporate purposes.
In October 2005, the Company entered into a $60 million revolving credit agreement and a $75
million 364-day bank loan. A portion of these facilities was used to fund or refinance costs
related to Hurricanes Ivan, Dennis, and Katrina with the remainder used to support the Company’s

increased obligations with respect to its commercial paper program, which will also be used to fund
storm-related costs. In addition, in October 2005, the Company redeemed all outstanding shares of
its three preferred stock issues, totaling $4.2 million, in conjunction with the domestication of
the Company as a Florida corporation. In November 2005, the Company issued $55 million of
preference stock. The funds resulting from this issuance were used for general corporate purposes.
See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “PSC Matters – Storm Damage Cost Recovery” and “– Other Matters” herein
for additional information.

Credit Rating Risk

The Company does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment
schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. There are certain contracts
that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change
to BBB- or Baa3, or below. Generally, collateral may be provided for by a Southern Company
guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. These contracts are primarily for physical electricity
purchases and sales. At December 31, 2005, the maximum potential collateral requirements at a BBB-
or Baa3 rating were approximately $5 million. The maximum potential collateral requirements at a
rating below BBB- or Baa3 were approximately $10 million. The Company is also party to certain
derivative agreements that could require collateral and/or accelerated payment in the event of a
credit rating change to below investment grade. These agreements are primarily for natural gas
price management activities. At December 31, 2005, the Company had no material exposure related to
these agreements.

Market Price Risk

The Company is exposed to market risks, primarily commodity price risk and interest rate risk. To
manage the volatility attributable to these exposures, the Company nets the exposures to take
advantage of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining
exposures pursuant to the Company’s policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and risk
management practices. Company policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging
purposes and mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies. Derivative
positions are monitored using techniques including but not limited to market valuation, value at
risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis.

Due to cost-based rate regulation, the Company has limited exposure to market volatility in
interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity. To mitigate residual risks
relative to movements in electricity prices, the Company enters into fixed-price contracts for the
purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity market and, to a lesser extent,
into similar contracts for natural gas purchases. The Company has implemented a fuel-hedging
program with the approval of the Florida PSC.

The weighted average interest rate on $144.6 million variable long-term debt that has not been
hedged at January 1, 2006 was 3.3 percent. If the Company sustained a 100 basis point change in
interest rates for all variable rate long-term debt, the change would affect annualized interest
expense by approximately $1.4 million at January 1, 2006. The Company is not aware of any facts or
circumstances that would significantly affect such exposures in the near term. See Notes 1 and 6
to the financial statements under “Financial Instruments” for additional information.

The changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts and year-end valuations were

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Unrealized gains and losses from mark-to-market adjustments on derivative contracts related to
the Company’s fuel hedging programs are recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities. Realized
gains and losses from these programs are included in fuel expense and are recovered through the
Company’s fuel cost recovery clause. Gains and losses on derivative contracts that are not
designated as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as incurred. At December 31, 2005,
the fair value of derivative energy contracts was reflected in the financial statements as follows:

$

11,526

Unrealized gains (losses) recognized in income were not material in any year presented. The
Company is exposed to market price risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the
derivative energy contracts. The Company’s policy is to enter into agreements with counterparties
that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s or with counterparties
who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. Therefore, the Company does not
anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the counterparties. See Notes 1 and 6 to
the financial statements under “Financial Instruments” for additional information.

Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations

The construction program of the Company is currently
estimated to be $163 million in 2006, $221 million in 2007, and $221 million in 2008. The
construction program also includes $48 million in 2006, $131 million in 2007, and $141 million
in 2008 for environmental expenditures. Actual construction costs
may vary from these estimates because of changes in such factors as the following: business
conditions; environmental regulations; FERC rules and transmission regulations; load
projections; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; and the
cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital
expenditures will be fully recovered.

The Company does not have any new generating capacity under construction. Construction of
new transmission and distribution facilities and capital improvements, including those needed to
meet environmental standards for the Company’s existing generation, transmission, and
distribution facilities, is ongoing.

As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company provides postretirement
benefits to substantially all employees and funds trusts to the extent required by the FERC and
the Florida PSC.

Other funding requirements related to obligations associated with scheduled maturities of
long-term debt and preferred securities, as well as the related interest, derivative
obligations, preference stock dividends, leases, and other purchase commitments are as follows.
See Notes 1, 6, and 7 to the financial statements for additional information.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Gulf Power Company 2005 Annual Report

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General

Gulf Power Company (the Company) is a wholly owned
subsidiary of Southern Company, which is the parent company of five retail operating companies,
Southern Power Company (Southern Power), Southern Company Services (SCS), Southern Communications
Services (SouthernLINC Wireless), Southern Company Holdings (Southern Holdings), Southern Nuclear
Operating Company (Southern Nuclear), Southern Telecom, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries.
The retail operating companies, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, the Company, Mississippi Power, and
Savannah Electric, provide electric service in four Southeastern states. The Company operates as a
vertically integrated utility providing service to customers in northwest Florida and to wholesale
customers in the Southeast. Southern Power constructs, owns, and manages Southern Company’s
competitive generation assets and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market.
Contracts among the retail operating companies and Southern Power, related to jointly owned
generating facilities, interconnecting transmission lines, or the exchange of electric power, are
regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). SCS, the system service company,
provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies.
SouthernLINC Wireless provides digital wireless communications services to the retail operating
companies and also markets these services to the public within the Southeast. Southern Telecom
provides fiber cable services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding
subsidiary for Southern Company’s investments in synthetic fuels and leveraged leases and various
other energy-related businesses. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to Southern
Company’s nuclear power plants. On January 4, 2006, Southern Company completed the sale of
substantially all the assets of Southern Company Gas, its competitive retail natural gas marketing
subsidiary.

The equity method is used for subsidiaries in which the Company has significant influence but
does not control and for variable interest entities where the Company is not the primary
beneficiary. Certain prior years’ data presented in the financial statements have been
reclassified to conform with current year presentation.

Southern Company was registered as a holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, as amended (PUHCA), until its repeal on February 8, 2006, and Southern Company and its
subsidiaries, including the Company, were subject to the regulatory provisions of the PUHCA. The
Company is also subject to regulation by the FERC and the Florida Public Service Commission (PSC).
The Company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and complies with
the accounting policies and practices prescribed by its regulatory commissions. The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates.

Affiliate Transactions

The Company has an agreement with SCS under which the following services are rendered to the
Company at direct or allocated cost: general and design engineering, purchasing, accounting and
statistical analysis, finance and treasury, tax, information resources, marketing, auditing,
insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, and other services
with respect to business and operations and power pool transactions. Costs for these services
amounted to $54 million, $56 million, and $55 million during 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.
Cost allocation methodologies used by SCS were approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) prior to the repeal of PUHCA, and management believes they are reasonable.

The Company has agreements with Georgia Power and Mississippi Power under which the Company
owns a portion of Plant Scherer and Plant Daniel. Georgia Power operates Plant Scherer and
Mississippi Power operates Plant Daniel. The Company reimbursed Georgia Power $4.3 million, $6.8
million, and $4.9 million and Mississippi Power $18.4 million, $17.8 million, and $17.7 million in
2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, for its proportionate share of related expenses. See Note 4
and Note 7 under “Operating Leases” for additional information.

The Company provides incidental services to and receives such services from other Southern
Company subsidiaries which are generally minor in duration and amount. However, with the hurricane
damage experienced in the last two years, assistance provided to aid in storm restoration,
including Company labor, contract labor, and materials, has caused an increase in

II-214


NOTES (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2005 Annual Report

these activities.
The total amount of storm restoration provided to Mississippi Power in 2005 was $11.1 million.
These activities were billed at cost. The Company received storm restoration assistance from other
Southern Company subsidiaries totaling $5.8 million and $12.7 million in 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

The retail operating companies, including the Company, and Southern Power may jointly enter
into various types of wholesale energy, natural gas, and certain other contracts, either directly
or through SCS, as agent. Each participating company may be jointly and severally liable for the
obligations incurred under these agreements. See Note 7 under “Fuel Commitments” for additional
information.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

The Company is subject to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement
No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. Regulatory assets represent
probable future revenues associated with certain costs that are expected to be recovered from
customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future
reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be credited to customers
through the ratemaking process. Regulatory assets and (liabilities) reflected in the balance
sheets at December 31 relate to:

Note: The recovery and amortization periods for these regulatory assets and (liabilities) are
as follows:

(a)

Recovered through the environmental cost recovery clause when the expense is incurred.

(b)

Recovered over the remaining life of the original issue, which may range up to 40 years.

(c)

Recorded as earned by employees and recovered as paid, generally within one year.

(d)

Asset retirement and removal liabilities are recorded, deferred income tax assets are
recovered, and deferred tax liabilities are amortized over the related property lives, which
may range up to 50 years. Asset retirement and removal liabilities will be settled and trued
up following completion of the related activities.

(e)

Fuel-hedging assets and liabilities are recorded over the life of the underlying hedged
purchase contracts, which generally do not exceed two years. Upon final settlement, costs are
recovered through the fuel cost recovery clause.

(f)

Recorded and recovered or amortized as approved by the Florida PSC.

(g)

Recorded and recovered over 24 months ending March 2007 as approved by the Florida PSC.

In the event that a portion of the Company’s operations is no longer subject to the
provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, the Company would be required to write off related regulatory
assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable through regulated rates. In addition,
the Company would be required to determine if any impairment to other assets, including plant,
exists and write down the assets, if impaired, to their fair value. All regulatory assets and
liabilities are currently reflected in rates.

Revenues

Energy and other revenues are recognized as services are rendered. Unbilled revenues are accrued
at the end of each fiscal period. Capacity revenues are generally recognized on a levelized basis
over the appropriate contract period. The Company’s retail electric rates include provisions to
annually adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, the energy component of purchased power
costs, and certain other costs. If the projected fuel revenue over or under recovery exceeds 10
percent of the projected fuel costs for the period, the Company is required to notify the Florida
PSC to determine if an adjustment to the fuel cost recovery factor is necessary. The Company has
similar retail cost recovery clauses for energy conservation costs, purchased power capacity costs,
and environmental compliance costs. Revenues are adjusted for differences between these actual
costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Under or over recovered regulatory clause
revenues are recorded in the balance sheets and are recovered or returned to customers through
adjustments to the billing factors. Annually, the Company petitions for recovery of

II-215


NOTES (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2005 Annual Report

projected costs including any true-up amount from prior periods, and approved rates are implemented each
January.

The Company has a diversified base of customers and no single customer or industry comprises
10 percent or more of revenues. For all periods presented, uncollectible accounts averaged
significantly less than 1 percent of revenues.

Fuel Costs

Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is used.

Income Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provides
deferred income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences. Investment tax
credits utilized are deferred and amortized to income over the average life of the related
property.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost less regulatory disallowances and
impairments. Original cost includes: materials; labor; minor items of property; appropriate
administrative and general costs; payroll-related costs such as taxes, pensions, and other
benefits, and the interest capitalized and/or estimated cost of funds used during construction.
The Company’s property, plant, and equipment consisted of the following at December 31:

The cost of replacements of property, exclusive of minor items of property, is capitalized.
The cost of maintenance, repairs, and replacement of minor items of property is charged to
maintenance expense as incurred or performed.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation of the original cost of utility plant in service is provided primarily by using
composite straight-line rates, which approximated 3.8 percent in each of 2005, 2004, and 2003.
Depreciation studies are conducted periodically to update the composite rates. These studies
are approved by the Florida PSC. When property subject to depreciation is retired or otherwise
disposed of in the normal course of business, its original cost, together with the cost of
removal, less salvage, is charged to the accumulated provision for depreciation. For other
property dispositions, the applicable cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the
balance sheet accounts and a gain or loss is recognized. Minor items of property included in
the original cost of the plant are retired when the related property unit is retired.

Asset Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of Removal

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations, which established new accounting and reporting standards for legal
obligations associated with the ultimate cost of retiring long-lived assets. The present value
of the ultimate cost for an asset’s future retirement is recorded in the period in which the
liability is incurred. The costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and
depreciated over the asset’s useful life. In addition, effective December 31, 2005, the Company
adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 47, Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations,
which requires that an asset retirement obligation be recorded even though the timing and/or
method of settlement are conditional on future events. Prior to December 2005, the Company did
not recognize asset retirement obligations for asbestos removal and disposal of polychlorinated
biphenyls in certain transformers because the timing of their retirements was dependent on
future events. The Company has received accounting guidance from the Florida PSC allowing the
continued accrual of other future retirement costs for long-lived assets that the Company does
not have a legal obligation to retire. Accordingly, the accumulated removal costs for these
obligations will continue to be reflected in the balance sheets as a regulatory liability.
Therefore, the Company had no cumulative effect to net income resulting from the adoption of
Statement No. 143 or Interpretation No. 47.

The liability recognized to retire long-lived assets primarily relates to the Company’s
combustion turbines at its Pea Ridge facility, various landfill sites, and a barge unloading
dock. In connection with the adoption of Interpretation of No. 47, the Company has also
recorded additional asset retirement obligations (and

II-216


NOTES (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2005 Annual Report

assets) of $9.1 million, primarily related
to asbestos removal, ash ponds, and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain
transformers. The Company has also identified retirement obligations related to certain
transmission and distribution facilities, certain wireless communication towers, and certain
structures authorized by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. However, liabilities for
the removal of these assets have not been recorded because the range of time over which the
Company may settle these obligations is unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated. The Company
will continue to recognize in statements of income allowed removal costs in accordance with its
regulatory treatment. Any differences between costs recognized under Statement No. 143 and
Interpretation No. 47 and those reflected in rates are recognized as either a regulatory asset
or liability, as ordered by the Florida PSC, and are reflected in the balance sheets.

Details of the asset retirement obligations included in the balance sheets are as follows:

If Interpretation No. 47 had been adopted as of December 31, 2004, the pro forma asset
retirement obligations would have been $14.3 million.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC)

In accordance with regulatory treatment, the Company records AFUDC on certain construction
projects. AFUDC represents the estimated debt and equity costs of capital funds that are necessary
to finance the construction of new regulated facilities. While cash is not realized currently from
such allowance, it increases the revenue requirement over the service life of the plant through a
higher rate base and higher depreciation expense. For the years 2005, 2004, and 2003, the average
annual AFUDC rate was 7.48 percent. AFUDC, net of taxes, as a percentage of net income after
dividends on preferred and preference stock was 1.97 percent, 3.46 percent, and 1.31 percent,
respectively, for 2005, 2004, and 2003.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles

The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of
whether an impairment has occurred is based on either a specific regulatory disallowance or an
estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared to the carrying
value of the assets. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment recognized is
determined by either the amount of regulatory disallowance or by estimating the fair value of the
assets and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. For assets
identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value less the
cost to sell in order to determine if an impairment provision is required. Until the assets are
disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or events change.

Property Damage Reserve

The Company accrues for the cost of repairing damages from major storms and other uninsured
property damages, including uninsured damages to transmission and distribution facilities,
generation facilities, and other property. The cost of such damages is charged to the reserve.
The Florida PSC approved annual accrual to the property damage reserve is $3.5 million, with a
target level for the reserve between $25.1 million and $36.0 million. The Florida PSC also
authorized the Company to make additional accruals above the $3.5 million at the Company’s
discretion. The Company accrued total expenses of $9.5 million in 2005, $18.5 million in 2004, and
$10.6 million in 2003. At December 31, 2005, the deficit balance in the property damage reserve
was $43.6 million, of which approximately $3.5 million and $40.1 million is included in Current
Assets and Deferred Charges and Other Assets, respectively, in the balance sheets. See Note 3
under “Retail Regulatory Matters – Storm Damage Cost Recovery” for additional information regarding
the depletion of these reserves following Hurricanes Ivan, Dennis, and Katrina, and the deferral of
additional costs, as well as additional surcharges or other cost recovery mechanisms approved by
the Florida PSC to replenish these reserves.

Environmental Cost Recovery

The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling
and disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and
regulations, the Company

II-217


NOTES (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2005 Annual Report

may also incur substantial costs to clean up properties. The Company
received authority from the Florida PSC to recover approved environmental compliance costs
through the environmental cost recovery clause. The Florida PSC reviews costs and adjusts rates
up or down annually each January. In September 2004, the Company increased its liability for
the estimated costs of environmental remediation projects by approximately $47 million. This
increase related to new regulations and more stringent site closure criteria by the Florida
Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) for impacts to soil and groundwater from herbicide
applications at company substations. The schedule for completion of the remediation projects
will be subject to FDEP approval. The projects have been approved by the Florida PSC for
recovery, as expended, through the Company’s environmental cost recovery clause; therefore,
there was no impact on the Company’s net income as a result of these revised estimates. The
liability balances as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 were $58.2 million and $59.4 million,
respectively. See Note 3 under “Retail Regulatory Matters – Environmental Remediation” for
additional information.

Injuries and Damages Reserve

The Company is subject to claims and suits arising in the ordinary course of business. As
permitted by regulatory authorities, the Company accrues for the uninsured costs of injuries and
damages by charges to income amounting to $1.6 million annually. The Florida PSC has also given
the Company the flexibility to increase its annual accrual above $1.6 million to the extent the
balance in the reserve does not exceed $2 million and to defer expense recognition of liabilities
greater than the balance in the reserve. The cost of settling claims is charged to the reserve.
At both December 31, 2005 and 2004, the injuries and damages reserve was $1.7 million and is
included in Current Liabilities in the balance sheets. Liabilities in excess of the reserve
balance of $3.0 million and $4.8 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, are included
in Deferred Credits and Other Liabilities in the balance sheets. Corresponding regulatory assets
of $1.6 million at both December 31, 2005 and 2004 are included in Current Assets in the balance
sheets. At December 31, 2005
and 2004, respectively, $1.4 million and $3.2 million are included in Deferred Charges and Other
Assets in the balance sheets.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are considered cash
equivalents. Temporary cash investments are securities with original maturities of 90 days or
less.

Materials and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include the average cost of transmission, distribution, and
generating plant materials. Materials are charged to inventory when purchased and then expensed or
capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when installed.

Fuel Inventory

Fuel inventory includes the average costs of oil, coal, and natural gas. Fuel is charged to
inventory when purchased and then expensed as used.

Stock Options

Southern Company provides non-qualified stock options to a large segment of the Company’s employees
ranging from line management to executives. The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation
plans in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25. Accordingly, no compensation
expense has been recognized because the exercise price of all options granted equaled the
fair-market value of Southern Company’s common stock on the date of grant. When options are
exercised, the Company receives a capital contribution from Southern Company equivalent to the
related income tax benefit.

For pro forma purposes, the Company generally recognizes stock option expense on a
straight-line basis over the vesting period. Stock options granted to employees who are
eligible for retirement are expensed at the grant date. The pro forma impact of fair-value
accounting for options granted on net income is as follows:

Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to fluctuations in interest
rates, the prices of certain fuel purchases, and electricity purchases and sales. All
derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured
at fair value. Substantially all of the Company’s bulk energy purchases and sales contracts
that meet the definition of a derivative are exempt from fair value accounting requirements and
are accounted for under the accrual method. Other derivative contracts qualify as cash flow
hedges of anticipated transactions or are recoverable through the Florida PSC approved hedging
program. This results in the deferral of related gains and losses in other comprehensive income
or regulatory assets and liabilities, respectively, until the hedged transactions occur. Any
ineffectiveness arising from the cash flow hedges is recognized currently in net income. Other
derivative contracts are marked to market through current period income and are recorded on a
net basis in the statements of income.

The Company is exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of
counterparties’ nonperformance. The Company has established controls to determine and monitor
the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate the Company’s exposure to
counterparty credit risk.

Comprehensive Income

The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of all changes in common stock
equity of an enterprise that result from transactions and other economic events of the period
other than transactions with owners. Comprehensive income consists of net income, changes in
the fair value of qualifying cash flow hedges and marketable securities, and changes in
additional minimum pension liability, less income taxes and reclassifications for amounts
included in net income.

Variable Interest Entities

The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity must consolidate the related assets and
liabilities. The Company has established certain wholly-owned trusts to issue preferred
securities. However, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts. Therefore, the
investments in these trusts are reflected as Other Investments for the Company, and the related
loans from the trusts are reflected as Long-term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts in the
balance sheets. See Note 6 under “Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities/Long-Term Debt
Payable to Affiliated Trusts” for additional information.

2. RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company has a defined benefit, trusteed, pension plan covering substantially all employees.
The plan is funded in accordance with requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended (ERISA). In 2005, the plan was amended to provide an additional monthly
supplement to certain retirees. No contributions to the plan are expected for the year ending
December 31, 2006. The Company also provides certain non-qualified benefit plans for a selected
group of management and highly compensated employees.

II-219


NOTES (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Benefits under these non-qualified plans are funded on a cash basis. The Company provides certain
medical care and life insurance benefits for retired employees. In addition, trusts are funded to
the extent required by the Florida PSC and the FERC. For the year ended December 31, 2006,
postretirement trust contributions are expected to total approximately $70,000.

The measurement date for plan assets and obligations is September 30 of each year presented.

Pension Plans

The total accumulated benefit obligation for the pension plans was $226 million in 2005 and $204
million in 2004. Changes during the year in the projected benefit obligations, accumulated benefit
obligations, and fair value of plan assets were as follows:

In
2005, the projected benefit obligations for the qualified and non-qualified pension plans were $236
million and $12 million, respectively. All plan assets are related to the qualified plan.

Pension plan assets are managed and invested in accordance with all applicable requirements,
including ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Internal Revenue Code). The
Company’s investment policy covers a diversified mix of assets, including equity and fixed income
securities, real estate, and private equity, as described in the table below. Derivative
instruments are used primarily as hedging tools but may also be used to gain efficient exposure to
the various asset classes. The Company primarily minimizes the risk of large losses through
diversification but also monitors and manages other aspects of risk.

Gulf Power Company 2005 Annual Report

the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act). The
Medicare Act provides a 28 percent prescription drug subsidy for Medicare eligible retirees.
FSP 106-2 requires recognition of the impacts of the Medicare Act in the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) and future cost of service for postretirement medical
plan. The effect of the subsidy reduced the Company’s expenses for the six months ended
December 31, 2004 and for the year ended December 31, 2005 by approximately $0.5 million and
$1.1 million, respectively, and is expected to have a similar impact on future years.

Future benefit payments, including prescription drug benefits, reflect expected future
service and are estimated based on the assumptions used to measure the accumulated benefit
obligation for the postretirement plan. Estimated benefit payments are reduced by drug subsidy
receipts expected as a result of the Medicare Act as follows:

The Company determined the long-term rate of return based on historical asset class returns
and current market conditions, taking into account the diversification benefits of investing in
multiple asset classes.

An additional assumption used in measuring the APBO was a weighted average medical care cost
trend rate of 10.25 percent for 2005, decreasing gradually to 4.75 percent through the year 2014,
and remaining at that level thereafter. An annual increase or decrease in the assumed medical care
cost trend rate of 1 percent would affect the accumulated benefit obligation and the service and
interest cost components at December 31, 2005 as follows:

Employee Savings Plan

The Company also sponsors a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering substantially all
employees. The Company provides a 75 percent matching contribution up to 6 percent of an
employee’s base salary. Total matching contributions made to the plan for 2005, 2004, and 2003,
were $2.9 million, $2.7 million, and $2.6 million, respectively.

3. CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY
MATTERS

General Litigation Matters

The Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of
business. In addition, the Company’s business activities are subject to extensive governmental
regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation over environmental issues
and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, and citizen enforcement
of environmental requirements such as opacity and other air quality standards, has increased
generally throughout the United States. In particular, personal injury claims for damages
caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become more frequent. The ultimate
outcome of such pending or potential litigation against the Company cannot be predicted at this
time; however, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such
current proceedings would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements.

II-222


NOTES (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Environmental Matters

New Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil action in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against certain Southern Company
subsidiaries, including Alabama Power and Georgia Power, alleging that these subsidiaries had
violated the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act and related state laws at
certain coal-fired generating facilities. Through subsequent amendments and other legal
procedures, the EPA added Savannah Electric as a defendant to the original action and filed a
separate action against Alabama Power in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
Alabama after it was dismissed from the original action. In these lawsuits, the EPA alleges
that NSR violations occurred at eight coal-fired generating facilities operated by Alabama
Power, Georgia Power, and Savannah Electric. The civil actions request penalties and injunctive
relief, including an order requiring the installation of the best available control technology
at the affected units. The EPA concurrently issued notices of violation relating to the
Company’s Plant Crist and a unit partially owned by the Company at Plant Scherer. See Note 4
herein for information on the Company’s ownership interest in Plant Scherer Unit 3. In early
2000, the EPA filed a motion to amend its complaint to add the allegations in the notices of
violation and to add the Company as a defendant. However, in March 2001, the court denied the
motion based on lack of jurisdiction, and the EPA has not refiled.

On June 3, 2005, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama issued a
decision in favor of Alabama Power on two primary legal issues in the case; however, the
decision does not resolve the case, nor does it address other legal issues associated with the
EPA’s allegations. In accordance with a separate court order, Alabama Power and the EPA are
currently participating in mediation with respect to the EPA’s claims. The action against
Georgia Power and Savannah Electric has been administratively closed since the spring of 2001,
and none of the parties has sought to reopen the case.

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA’s regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act
authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $32,500 per day, per violation at each
generating unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in this
matter could require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and
could possibly require payment of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of
operations, cash flows, and possibly financial condition if such costs are not recovered through
regulated rates.

FERC Matters

Market-Based Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates at market-based
prices. The Company also has FERC authority to make short-term opportunity sales at market
rates. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a market-based contract with an
affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation
dominance within its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in
other markets is not an issue in that proceeding. In February 2005, Southern Company submitted
responsive information. In February 2006, the FERC suspended the proceeding to allow the
parties to conduct settlement discussions. Any new market-based rate transactions in the
Southern Company retail service territory entered into after February 27, 2005 are subject to
refund to the level of the default cost-based rates, pending the outcome of the proceeding. The
impact of such sales through December 31, 2005 is expected to be immaterial to the Company. The
refund period covers 15 months. In the event that the FERC’s default mitigation measures for
entities that are found to have market power are ultimately applied, the Company may be required
to charge cost-based rates for certain wholesale sales in the Southern Company retail service
territory, which may be lower than negotiated market-based rates. The final outcome of this
matter will depend on the form in which the final methodology for assessing generation market
power and mitigation rules may be ultimately adopted and cannot be determined at this time.

In addition, in May 2005, the FERC started an investigation to determine whether Southern
Company satisfies the other three parts of the FERC’s market-based rate analysis: transmission
market power, barriers to entry, and affiliate abuse or reciprocal dealing. The FERC established a
new refund period related to this expanded investigation. Any and all new market-based rate
transactions both inside and outside Southern Company’s retail service territory involving any
Southern Company subsidiary, including the Company, will be subject to refund to the extent the
FERC orders lower rates as a

II-223


NOTES (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2005 Annual Report

result of this new investigation, with the 15-month refund period beginning July 19, 2005. The
impact of such sales through December 31, 2005 is expected to be immaterial to the Company. The
FERC also directed that this expanded proceeding be held in abeyance pending the outcome of the
proceeding on the Intercompany Interchange Contract (IIC) discussed below.

The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for this proceeding and is
vigorously defending itself in this matter. However, the final outcome of this matter,
including any remedies to be applied in the event of an adverse ruling in this proceeding,
cannot now be determined.

Intercompany Interchange Contract

The Company’s generation fleet in its retail service territory is operated under the IIC, as
approved by the FERC. In May 2005, the FERC initiated a new proceeding to examine (1) the
provisions of the IIC among Alabama Power, Georgia Power, the Company, Mississippi Power, Savannah
Electric, Southern Power, and SCS, as agent, under the terms of which the power pool of Southern
Company is operated, and, in particular, the propriety of the continued inclusion of Southern Power
as a party to the IIC, (2) whether any parties to the IIC have violated the FERC’s standards of
conduct applicable to utility companies that are transmission providers, and (3) whether Southern
Company’s code of conduct defining Southern Power as a “system company” rather than a “marketing
affiliate” is just and reasonable. In connection with the formation of Southern Power, the FERC
authorized Southern Power’s inclusion in the IIC in 2000. The FERC also previously approved
Southern Company’s code of conduct. The FERC order directs that the administrative law judge who
presided over a proceeding involving approval of PPAs between Southern Power and Georgia Power and
Savannah Electric be assigned to preside over the hearing in this proceeding and that the testimony
and exhibits presented in that proceeding be preserved to the extent appropriate. Hearings are
scheduled for September 2006. Effective July 19, 2005, revenues from transactions under the IIC
involving any Southern Company subsidiaries, including the Company, are subject to refund to the
extent the FERC orders any changes to the IIC.

The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for this proceeding and is vigorously
defending itself in this matter. However, the final outcome of this matter, including any remedies
to be applied in the event of an adverse ruling in this proceeding, cannot now be determined.

Generation Interconnection Agreements

In July 2003, the FERC issued its final rule on the standardization of generation
interconnection agreements and procedures (Order 2003). Order 2003 shifts much of the financial
burden of new transmission investment from the generator to the transmission provider. The FERC
has indicated that Order 2003, which was effective January 20, 2004, is to be applied
prospectively to interconnection agreements. Subsidiaries of Tenaska, Inc., as counterparties
to three previously executed interconnection agreements with subsidiaries of Southern Company,
including the Company, have filed complaints at the FERC requesting that the FERC modify the
agreements and that Southern Company refund amounts previously paid for interconnection
facilities, with interest. These proceedings are still pending at the FERC. The Company has
received similar requests from other entities totaling $6.7 million. The Company has opposed
all such requests. The impact of Order 2003 and its subsequent rehearings on the Company and
the final results of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Right of Way Litigation

Southern Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including the Company, Georgia Power,
Mississippi Power, and Southern Telecom (collectively, defendants), have been named as
defendants in numerous lawsuits brought by landowners since 2001. The plaintiffs’ lawsuits
claim that defendants may not use, or sublease to third parties, some or all of the fiber optic
communications lines on the rights of way that cross the plaintiffs’ properties, and that such
actions exceed the easements or other property rights held by defendants. The plaintiffs assert
claims for, among other things, trespass and unjust enrichment, and seek compensatory and
punitive damages and injunctive relief. The Company’s management believe that it has complied
with applicable laws and that the plaintiffs’ claims are without merit.

In November 2003, the Second Circuit Court in Gadsden County, Florida, ruled in favor of
the plaintiffs on their motion for partial summary judgment concerning liability in one such
lawsuit brought by landowners regarding the installation and use of fiber optic cable over the
Company’s rights of way located on the landowners’ property. Subsequently, the plaintiffs
sought to amend their complaint and asked

II-224


NOTES (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2005 Annual Report

the court to enter a final declaratory judgment and to enter an order enjoining the Company from
allowing expanded general telecommunications use of the fiber optic cables that are the subject
of this litigation. In January 2005, the trial court granted in part the plaintiffs’ motion to
amend their complaint and denied the requested declaratory and injunctive relief. In November
2005, the trial court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and against the Company on their
respective motions for partial summary judgment. In that same order, the trial court also
denied the Company’s motion to dismiss certain claims. The court’s ruling allowed for an
immediate appeal to the Florida First District Court of Appeal, which the Company filed on
December 20, 2005. If the appeal is not successful, damages will be decided at a future trial.

In addition, in late 2001, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company, including the Company,
Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, Savannah Electric, and Southern Telecom
(collectively, defendants), were named as defendants in a lawsuit brought by a telecommunications
company that uses certain of the defendants’ rights of way. This lawsuit alleges, among other
things, that the defendants are contractually obligated to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the
telecommunications company from any liability that may be assessed against it in pending and future
right of way litigation. The defendants believe that the plaintiff’s claims are without merit. In
the fall of 2004, the trial court stayed the case until resolution of the underlying landowner
litigation discussed above. In January 2005, the Georgia Court of Appeals dismissed the
telecommunications company’s appeal of the trial court’s order for lack of jurisdiction. An
adverse outcome in this matter, combined with an adverse outcome against the telecommunications
company in one or more of the right of way lawsuits, could result in substantial judgments;
however, the final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.

Property Tax Dispute

Georgia Power and the Company are involved in a significant property tax dispute with Monroe
County, Georgia (Monroe County). The Monroe County Board of Tax Assessors (Monroe Board) has
issued assessments reflecting substantial increases in the ad valorem tax valuation of Plant
Scherer, of which Georgia Power and the Company own 22.95 percent and 6.25 percent, respectively,
for tax years 2003, 2004, and 2005. Georgia Power and the Company are aggressively pursuing
administrative appeals in Monroe County and have filed or will file Notices of Arbitration for all
three years. The appeals are currently stayed, pending the outcome of the litigation discussed
below.

In addition, in November 2004, Georgia Power filed suit, on its own behalf, against the Monroe
Board in the Superior Court of Monroe County. The suit could impact all co-owners. Georgia Power
contends that Monroe County acted without statutory authority in changing the valuation of a
centrally assessed utility as established by the Revenue Commissioner of the State of Georgia and
requests injunctive relief prohibiting Monroe County and the Monroe Board from unlawfully changing
the value of Plant Scherer and ultimately collecting additional ad valorem taxes from Georgia
Power. On December 22, 2005, the Court granted Monroe County’s motion for summary judgment.
Georgia Power has filed an appeal of the Superior Court’s decision to the Georgia Supreme Court.

If Georgia Power is not successful in its administrative appeals and if Monroe County is
successful in defending the litigation, the Company could be subject to total additional taxes
through December 31, 2005 of up to $3 million, plus penalties and interest. In accordance with the
Company’s unit power sales contract for Plant Scherer, such property taxes would be recoverable
from the customer. The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Retail Regulatory Matters

Environmental Cost Recovery

The Florida Legislature adopted legislation for an environmental cost recovery clause, which allows
an electric utility to petition the Florida PSC for recovery of prudent environmental compliance
costs that are not being recovered through base rates or any other recovery mechanism. Such
environmental costs include operation and maintenance expense, emission allowance expense,
depreciation, and a return on invested capital. This legislation also allows recovery of costs
incurred as a result of an agreement between the Company and the FDEP for the purpose of ensuring
compliance with ozone ambient air quality standards adopted by the EPA. During 2005, 2004, and
2003, the Company recorded environmental cost recovery clause revenues of $26.3 million, $14.7
million, and $10.9 million, respectively. Annually, the Company seeks recovery of projected costs
including any true-up amounts from prior periods. At

II-225


NOTES (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2005 Annual Report

December 31, 2005, the over recovered balance was $3.0 million primarily due to a delay in
environmental projects.

Environmental Remediation

At December 31, 2005, the Company’s liability for the estimated costs of environmental
remediation projects for known sites was $58.2 million. The schedule for completion of the
remediation projects will be subject to FDEP approval. These projects have been approved by the
Florida PSC for recovery through the environmental cost recovery clause. Therefore, the Company
has recorded $1.6 million in Current Assets and Current Liabilities and $56.6 million in
Deferred Charges and Other Assets and Deferred Credits and Other Liabilities representing the
future recoverability of these costs.

The final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined. However, based on the
currently known conditions at these sites and the nature and extent of the Company’s activities
relating to these sites, management does not believe that the Company’s additional liability, if
any, at these sites would be material to the financial statements.

Storm Damage Cost Recovery

The Company maintains a reserve to recover the cost of uninsured damages from major storms to its
transmission and distribution facilities, generation facilities, and other property.

Hurricane Ivan hit the Gulf Coast of Florida and Alabama in September 2004, causing
significant damage to the Company’s service territory. In March 2005, the Florida PSC approved a
Stipulation and Settlement (Stipulation) among the Company, the Office of Public Counsel for the
State of Florida, and the Florida Industrial Power Users Group. The agreement allows the Company
to recover the retail portion of $51.7 million in storm damage costs, plus interest and revenue
taxes, from customers over a 24-month period that began in April 2005. As of December 31, 2005,
the Company had recovered $21.2 million of these costs. Under the Stipulation, the Company also
agreed that it will not seek any additional increase in its base rates and charges to become
effective on or before March 1, 2007.

In July and August 2005, Hurricanes Dennis and Katrina, respectively, hit the Gulf Coast of
the United States and caused additional damage in the Company’s service area. Hurricanes Dennis
and Katrina restoration costs were approximately $64 million, of which approximately $56 million
relates to operation and maintenance expenses. Approximately $1 million of these costs is expected
to be covered through insurance.

As of December 31, 2005, the deficit balance in the Company’s property damage reserve accounts
totaled approximately $43.6 million, of which approximately $3.5 million and $40.1 million,
respectively, is included in the balance sheets under Current Assets and Deferred Charges and Other
Assets. The established policy of the Florida PSC, as recently reaffirmed by its decision
following the 2004 hurricane experience of Florida’s investor owned electric utilities, provides
for the recovery of these costs through the mechanism of the property insurance reserve and, where
necessary, through a special recovery surcharge.

In 2005, the Florida Legislature authorized securitized financing for hurricane costs. On
February 22, 2006, the Company filed a petition with the Florida PSC under this legislative
authority requesting permission to issue $87.2 million in securitized storm-recovery bonds. The
bonds would be repaid over eight years from revenues to be received from storm-recovery charges
implemented under the securitization plan and billed to customers. If approved as proposed, the
plan would resolve the Company’s remaining deferred costs, by refinancing, net of taxes, the
remaining balance of storm damage costs currently being recovered from customers related to
Hurricane Ivan and financing, net of taxes, restoration costs associated with Hurricanes Dennis and
Katrina of approximately $54 million. It would also replenish the Company’s property damage
reserve with an additional $70 million. A decision on the plan is expected prior to the end of the
second quarter of 2006. The final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined; however,
since the Company will recognize expenses equal to the revenues billed to customers, the
securitization plan would have no impact on the Company’s net income, but would increase cash flow.

See Note 1 herein under “Property Damage Reserve” for additional information.

5. INCOME TAXES

Southern Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return and combined
State of Mississippi and State of Georgia income tax returns. Under a joint consolidated income
tax allocation agreement, each subsidiary’s current and deferred tax expense is computed on a
stand-alone basis and no subsidiary is allocated more expense than would be paid if they filed a
separate income tax return. In accordance with Internal Revenue Service regulations, each company
is jointly and severally liable for the tax liability.

At December 31, 2005, the tax-related regulatory assets to be recovered from customers were
$17.4 million. These assets are attributable to tax benefits flowed through to customers in prior
years and to taxes applicable to capitalized allowance for funds used during construction. At
December 31, 2005, the tax-related regulatory liabilities to be credited to customers were $20.6
million. These liabilities are attributable to deferred taxes previously recognized at rates
higher than current enacted tax law and to unamortized investment tax credits.

6. FINANCING

Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities/ Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts

The Company has formed certain wholly owned trust subsidiaries for the purpose of issuing
preferred securities. The proceeds of the related equity investments and preferred security
sales were loaned back to the Company through the issuance of junior subordinated notes totaling
$72.2 million, which constitute substantially all of the assets of these trusts and are
reflected in the balance sheets as Long-term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts. The Company
considers that the mechanisms and obligations relating to the preferred securities issued for
its benefit, taken together, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by it of the trusts’
payment obligations with respect to these securities. At December 31, 2005, $72.2 million of
these securities were outstanding. See Note 1 under “Variable Interest Entities” for additional
information on the accounting treatment for these trusts and the related securities.

Pollution Control Bonds

Pollution control obligations represent loans to the Company from public authorities of funds
derived from sales by such authorities of revenue bonds issued to finance pollution control
facilities. The Company is required to make payments sufficient for the authorities to meet
principal and interest requirements of such bonds. With respect to $12.1 million of such
pollution control obligations, the Company has authenticated and delivered to the trustees a
like principal amount of first mortgage bonds as security for its obligations under the loan
agreements. No principal or interest on these first mortgage bonds is payable unless and until
a default occurs on the loan agreements.

Securities Due Within One Year

At December 31, 2005, the Company had an improvement fund requirement of $250,000. The first
mortgage bond improvement fund requirement amounts to 1 percent of each outstanding series of bonds
authenticated under the mortgage indenture prior to January 1 of each year, other than those issued
to collateralize pollution control revenue bond obligations. The requirement may be satisfied by
depositing cash, reacquiring bonds, or by pledging additional property equal to 1 and 2/3 times the
requirement. The improvement fund requirements of first mortgage bonds were satisfied by
certifying property additions in 2004 and 2003. It is anticipated that the 2005 requirement will
be satisfied by certifying property additions.

The Company’s remaining first mortgage bonds mature in 2006; therefore, the only sinking fund
requirements and/or maturities through 2010 are $37.1 million in 2006.

Assets Subject to Lien

The Company’s mortgage indenture dated as of September 1, 1941, as amended and supplemented, which
secures the first mortgage bonds issued by the Company, constitutes a direct first lien on
substantially all of the Company’s fixed property and franchises. In connection with the maturity
of the Company’s remaining outstanding first mortgage bonds in November 2006, such lien will be
removed. In addition, the Company has granted a second lien on its property at Plant Daniel in
connection with the issuance of one series of pollution control bonds.

There are no agreements or other arrangements among the affiliated companies under which the
assets of one company have been pledged or otherwise made available to satisfy obligations of
Southern Company or any of its subsidiaries.

Bank Credit Arrangements

At the beginning of 2006, the Company had $120.5 million of lines of credit with banks subject to
renewal each year, all of which remained unused. Of the $120.5 million, $116.5 million provides
liquidity support for the Company’s commercial paper program and $4.0 million of daily variable
rate pollution control bonds. In connection with these credit lines, the Company has agreed to pay
commitment fees.

II-228


NOTES (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Certain credit arrangements contain covenants that limit the level of indebtedness to
capitalization to 65 percent, as defined in the arrangements. For purposes of these definitions,
debt excludes the long-term debt payable to affiliated trusts. At December 31, 2005, the Company
was in compliance with these covenants.

In addition, certain credit arrangements contain cross default provisions to other
indebtedness that would trigger an event of default if the Company defaulted on indebtedness over a
specified threshold. The cross default provisions are restricted only to indebtedness of the
Company. The Company is currently in compliance with all such covenants. Borrowings under unused
credit arrangements totaling $10 million would be prohibited if the Company experiences a material
adverse change (as defined in such arrangements).

The Company borrows primarily through a commercial paper program that has the liquidity
support of committed bank credit arrangements. The Company may also borrow through various other
arrangements with banks and through an extendible commercial note program. At December 31, 2005,
the Company had $89.5 million in commercial paper and bank notes outstanding. At December 31,
2004, the Company had no commercial paper or extendible commercial notes outstanding. During 2005,
the peak amount outstanding for commercial paper was $110 million and the average amount
outstanding was $51.8 million. The average annual interest rate on commercial paper was 3.56
percent.

Financial Instruments

The Company enters into energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, gas, and
other fuel price changes. However, due to cost-based rate regulations, the Company has limited
exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity. The Company
has implemented fuel-hedging programs with the approval of the Florida PSC. The Company enters
into hedges of forward electricity sales. There was no material ineffectiveness recorded in
earnings in 2005 and 2004.

At December 31, 2005, the fair value of derivative energy contracts was reflected in the
financial statements as follows:

(in thousands)

Regulatory liabilities,

$

The fair value gains or losses for cash flow hedges that are recoverable through the
regulatory fuel clauses are recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities and are recognized in
earnings at the same time the hedged items affect earnings. The Company has energy-related hedges
in place up to and including 2008.

The Company also may enter into derivatives to hedge exposure to interest rate changes.
Derivatives related to variable rate securities or forecasted transactions are accounted for as
cash flow hedges and are generally structured to match the critical terms of the hedged debt
instruments.

The Company had no interest rate derivatives outstanding in 2005 or 2004. During 2003, the
Company settled interest rate derivatives at the same time it issued debt and recognized losses
totaling $3.3 million. These losses have been deferred in other comprehensive income and
approximately $0.3 million annually is reclassified to interest expense over the life of the
related debt, which matures in 2013.

7. COMMITMENTS

Construction Program

The Company is engaged in a continuous construction program, the cost of which is currently
estimated to total $163 million in 2006, $221 million in 2007, and $221 million in 2008. The
construction program is subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may
vary from the above estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include changes in
business conditions; acquisition of additional generation assets; revised load growth estimates;
changes in environmental regulations; changes in FERC rules and transmission regulations;
increasing costs of labor, equipment, and materials; and cost of capital. At December 31, 2005,
significant purchase commitments were outstanding in connection with the ongoing construction
program.

II-229


NOTES (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Included in the amounts above, are $48 million in 2006, $131 million in 2007, and $141 million
in 2008 for environmental expenditures. The Company does not have any new generating capacity
under construction. Construction of new transmission and distribution facilities and other capital
improvements, including those needed to meet environmental standards for the Company’s existing
generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, are ongoing.

Long-Term Service Agreements

The Company has a Long-Term Service Agreement (LTSA) with General Electric (GE) for the purpose of
securing maintenance support for combined cycle and combustion turbine generating facilities. The
LTSA provides that GE will perform all planned inspections on the covered equipment, which includes
the cost of all labor and materials. GE is also obligated to cover the costs of unplanned
maintenance on the covered equipment subject to a limit specified in the contract.

In general, the LTSA is in effect through two major inspection cycles of the unit. Scheduled
payments to GE are made at various intervals based on actual operating hours of the unit. Total
payments to GE under this agreement for facilities owned are currently estimated at $78.1 million
over the remaining life of the agreement. However, the LTSA contains various cancellation
provisions at the option of the Company.

Payments made to GE prior to the performance of any planned inspections are recorded as
prepayments. These amounts are included in Current Assets and Deferred Charges and Other Assets in
the balance sheets. Inspection costs are capitalized or charged to expense based on the nature of
the work performed.

Fuel Commitments

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of the generating plants, the Company has entered into
various long-term commitments for the procurement of fossil fuel. In most cases, these contracts
contain provisions for price escalations, minimum purchase levels, and other financial commitments.
Coal commitments include forward contract purchases for sulfur dioxide emission allowances.
Natural gas purchase commitments contain given volumes with prices based on various indices at the
time of delivery. Amounts included in the chart below represent estimates based on New York
Mercantile Exchange future prices at December 31, 2005.

Total estimated minimum long-term obligations at December 31, 2005 were as follows:

SCS may enter into various types of wholesale energy and natural gas contracts acting as an
agent for the Company and all of the other Southern Company retail operating companies, Southern
Power, and Southern Company Gas. Under these agreements, each of the retail operating companies,
Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas may be jointly and severally liable. The creditworthiness
of Southern Power and Southern Company Gas is currently inferior to the creditworthiness of the
retail operating companies. Accordingly, Southern Company has entered into keep-well agreements
with the Company and each of the other retail operating companies to insure the Company will not
subsidize or be responsible for any costs, losses, liabilities, or damages resulting from the
inclusion of Southern Power or Southern Company Gas as a contracting party under these agreements.

Operating Leases

The Company has operating lease agreements with various terms and expiration dates. Total
operating lease expenses were $3.0 million, $2.0 million, and $2.2 million for 2005, 2004, and
2003, respectively. The Company includes any step rents, escalations, and lease concessions in its
computation of minimum lease payments, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the
minimum lease term.

The Company and Mississippi Power jointly entered into operating lease agreements for aluminum
railcars for the transportation of coal to Plant Daniel. The Company has the option to purchase
the railcars at the greater of lease termination value or fair market value or to renew the leases
at the end of each lease term. The Company and Mississippi Power also have separate lease
agreements for other railcars that do not include purchase options.

These railcar lease costs are charged to fuel inventory and are allocated to fuel expense as
the fuel is used. These expenses are then recovered through the Company’s fuel cost recovery
clause. The Company’s share of the lease costs charged to fuel inventories was $3.0 million in
2005 and $1.9 million in each of 2004 and 2003.

8. STOCK OPTION PLAN

Southern Company provides non-qualified stock options to a large segment of its employees
ranging from line management to executives. As of December 31, 2005, 269 current and former
employees of the Company participated in the stock option plan. The maximum number of shares of
Southern Company common stock that may be issued under this plan may not exceed 55 million. The
prices of options granted to date have been at the fair market value of the shares on the dates

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Mississippi Power Company:

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements of capitalization of Mississippi
Power Company (the “Company”) (a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company) as of December 31,
2005 and 2004, and the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder’s
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control
over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An
audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements (pages
II-257 to II-283) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Mississippi
Power Company at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Mississippi Power Company 2005 Annual Report

OVERVIEW

Business Activities

Mississippi Power Company (Company) operates as a vertically integrated utility providing
electricity to retail customers within its traditional service area located within the State of
Mississippi and to wholesale customers in the Southeast.

Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Company’s business of
selling electricity. These factors include the ability to maintain a stable regulatory
environment, to achieve energy sales growth while containing costs, and to recover rising costs.
These include costs related to growing demand, increasingly stringent environmental standards, fuel
prices, and storm restoration following Hurricane Katrina.

Hurricane Katrina hit on August 29, 2005, causing substantial damage to the Company’s service
territory as the worst natural disaster in the Company’s history. All of the Company’s 195,000
customers were without service immediately after the storm. Through a co-coordinated effort with
Southern Company, as well as non-affiliates, the Company restored power to all who could receive it
within twelve days. However, 19,200 customers remained unable to receive service as of December
31, 2005. The Company expects further rate proceedings in 2006 to recover the estimated $277
million in costs related to Hurricane Katrina and replenishment of the Company’s storm damage
reserve. In 2004, the Company completed a successful retail rate proceeding designed to help
provide future earnings stability. Appropriately balancing environmental expenditures with
reasonable retail rates will continue to challenge the Company for the foreseeable future.

In December 2005, the Company made its annual Performance Evaluation Plan (PEP) filing for the
projected 2006 test period and requested a 5 percent increase in total retail revenues or $32
million increase in retail base revenues.

Key Performance Indicators

In striving to maximize shareholder value while providing cost effective energy to customers, the
Company’s management continues to focus on several key indicators. These indicators are used to
measure the Company’s performance for customers and employees. Recognizing the critical role in
the Company’s success played by the Company employees, employee-related measures are a significant
management focus. These measures include diversity and safety. The 2005 performance was at or
above target for each of these employee performance standards. In recognition that the Company’s
long-term financial success is dependent upon how well it satisfies its customers’ needs, the
Company’s retail base rate mechanism, PEP, includes performance indicators that directly tie
customer service indicators to the Company’s allowed return. PEP measures the Company’s
performance on a 10 point scale as a weighted average of results in three areas: average customer
price, as compared to prices of other regional utilities (weighted at 40 percent); service
reliability, measured in outage minutes per customer (40 percent); and customer satisfaction,
measured in surveys of residential customers (20 percent). The Company’s PEP performance score in
2005 was 8.44 out of 10, resulting in an 84 basis point increase to the Company’s retail allowed
return on investment for 2006. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory
Matters – Performance Evaluation Plan” for more information on PEP.

In addition to the PEP performance indicators, the Company focuses on other performance
measures, including broader measures of customer satisfaction, plant availability, system
reliability, and net income. The Company’s financial success is directly tied to the satisfaction
of its customers. Management uses customer satisfaction surveys to evaluate the Company’s results.
Peak season equivalent forced outage rate (Peak Season EFOR) is an indicator of plant availability
and efficient generation fleet operations during the months when generation needs are greatest.
The rate is calculated by dividing the number of hours of forced outages by total generation hours.
Peak Season EFOR performance excludes the impact of Hurricane Katrina. Net income is the primary
component of the Company’s contribution to Southern Company’s earnings per share goal.

performance. The Company’s performance in 2005 reflects the focus that management places on all of
these indicators, as well as the commitment shown by the Company’s employees in achieving or
exceeding management’s expectations.

Earnings

The Company’s net income after dividends on preferred stock was $73.8 million in 2005 compared to
$76.8 million in 2004. The decrease in 2005 is primarily due to a $15.7 million decrease in retail
base revenue due to the loss of customers as a result of Hurricane Katrina. Non-fuel related
expenses increased $2.5 million primarily resulting from increased employee benefit expenses.
Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by $5.8 million due to the amortization of a
regulatory liability related to Plant Daniel capacity, other revenues increased $1.2 million,
wholesale base revenues increased $3.3 million, and dividends on preferred stock decreased $2.0
million as compared to 2004 as a result of the loss on redemption of preferred stock recognized in
the third quarter of 2004.

The net income after dividends on preferred stock of $76.8 million in 2004 increased when
compared to $73.5 million in 2003 due to retail sales growth and higher non-territorial energy
sales. However, operating revenues and expenses recorded by the Company in 2003 were unusually
high as compared to 2002. An increase of $62 million in other electric revenues resulted from the
termination of the Company’s purchased power agreement with Dynegy, Inc. (Dynegy), the income
effect of which was offset by a $60 million expense related to the establishment of a regulatory
liability in connection with an accounting order issued by the Mississippi Public Service
Commission (PSC). See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters” for
additional information.

%

Total retail revenues for 2005 increased 5.9 percent when compared to 2004 as a result of
higher fuel revenue due to the increase in fuel cost. This increase in retail revenues was offset
by reductions for the loss of customers in all major classes as a result of Hurricane Katrina.
Total retail revenues for 2004 increased 13.2 percent when compared to 2003. While higher fuel
costs accounted for 92 percent of this increase, sales growth, particularly in the industrial
class, also contributed to the increase. Retail revenues for 2003 decreased approximately 3.8
percent when compared to 2002 as a result of decreased fuel revenues and, to a lesser extent,
decreases in kilowatt-hour (KWH) energy sales due to milder than normal weather in the Company’s
service area and the sluggish economy.

Fuel revenues generally represent the direct recovery of fuel expenses including purchased
power. Therefore, changes in recoverable fuel expenses are offset with corresponding changes in
fuel revenues and have no effect on net income. The fuel cost recovery and other revenues
increased in 2005 when compared to 2004 as a result of higher fuel costs. In 2004, fuel cost
recovery and other revenues increased as compared to 2003 due to an increase in fuel expenses
resulting from consistently higher fuel prices and a slight increase in retail rates that became
effective in 2004. During 2003, the fuel cost recovery and other revenues decreased $20 million
compared to 2002 due to lower generation and fewer fuel purchases as a result of milder than normal
weather in 2003.

Sales for resale to non-affiliates are influenced by the non-affiliate utilities’ own customer
demand, plant availability, and fuel costs. In 2005, total revenues from sales for resale to
non-affiliates increased $17.5 million or 6.6 percent as compared to 2004. This increase primarily
resulted from an increase in price per KWH resulting from higher fuel costs. Total revenues from
sales for resale to non-affiliates increased in 2004 by $14.4 million, or 5.7 percent. This
increase primarily resulted from a $32.7 million increase in energy revenues, of which
approximately $6 million was associated with increased KWH sales and $26.7 million was associated
with higher fuel prices. Total revenues from sales for resale to non-affiliates increased in 2003
from 2002 as a result of increases in average sales price per KWH and increased KWH sales to
wholesale non-affiliate customers. The increase in energy revenues was partially offset by an
$18.3 million decrease in capacity revenues as a result of the termination of a contract with
Dynegy in 2003.

Included in sales for resale to non-affiliates are revenues from rural electric cooperative
associations and municipalities located in southeastern Mississippi. As compared to the prior
year, KWH sales to these utilities decreased 5.0 percent due to Hurricane Katrina in 2005,
increased 3.3 percent in 2004, and remained relatively flat in 2003, with the related revenues
increasing 16.2 percent, 12.4 percent, and 1.6 percent, respectively. The customer demand
experienced by these utilities is determined by factors very similar to those experienced by the
Company. Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in sales for resale to
non-affiliates. These opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a
margin above the Company’s variable cost to produce the energy. KWH sales to non-territorial
customers decreased 41 percent as compared to 2004 primarily due to Hurricane Katrina.

II-239


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Energy sales to affiliated companies within the Southern Company electric system as well as
purchases of energy vary from year to year depending on demand and the availability and cost of
generating resources at each company. These sales are made in accordance with the Intercompany
Interchange Contract (IIC), as approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). These
energy sales do not have a significant impact on earnings since the energy is generally sold at
marginal cost.

Total retail KWH sales decreased in 2005 when compared to 2004 as the result of the loss of
customers following Hurricane Katrina. Total retail KWH sales increased in 2004 when compared to
2003 as a result of economic recovery in the area which affected all customer classes, particularly
the industrial class. Total retail KWH sales decreased in 2003 due to milder weather in 2003 when
compared to 2002. Industrial sales also decreased in 2003 due to lower KWH sales and decreased
fuel costs.

The Company anticipates fairly strong growth over the next five years as the Company’s service
area begins to recover from the effects of Hurricane Katrina. Retail sales are expected to grow at
an annual rate of approximately 4.6 percent through 2010, as the rebuilding of residential homes
and commercial businesses takes place. Various industrial expansions in oil and gas exploration,
production, and refining are also expected to contribute to the growth.

Expenses

In 2005 and 2004, total operating expenses increased $71.2 million or 9.3 percent and $31.8 million
or 4.3 percent, respectively, primarily as the result of increases in fuel and purchased power,
administrative and general expenses, and taxes other than income. In 2003, operating expenses
increased $53.4 million or 7.9 percent over the prior year. This increase was due primarily to $60
million in Plant Daniel capacity expense recorded in connection with an accounting order from the
Mississippi PSC. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters
–Performance Evaluation Plan” for further information.

Fuel costs constitute the single largest expense for the Company. The mix of fuel sources for
generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and
the availability of fossil generating units. The amount and sources of generation, the average
cost of fuel per net KWH generated, and the average cost of purchased power were as follows:

Fuel expense increased $33.7 million in 2005 as compared to 2004. Approximately $71 million
in additional fuel expenses resulted from higher coal, gas, transportation prices, and emission
allowances, which were partially offset by a $37 million decrease resulting from unit outages that
reduced generation. Fuel expense for 2004 increased $95 million as compared to 2003.
Approximately $25 million of the increase was associated with increased generation and
approximately $70 million of the increase was due to higher coal and gas prices. Fuel expense for
2003 decreased $53 million due to decreased generation and lower average cost of fuel.

II-240


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2005 Annual Report

A significant upward trend in the cost of coal and natural gas has emerged since 2003, and
volatility in these markets is expected to continue. Increased coal prices have been influenced by
a worldwide increase in demand as a result of rapid economic growth in China as well as by
increases in mining costs. Higher natural gas prices in the United States are the result of
increased demand and slightly lower gas supplies despite increased drilling activity. Natural gas
supply interruptions, such as those caused by the 2004 and 2005 hurricanes result in an immediate
market response; however, the long-term impact of this price volatility may be reduced by imports
of natural gas and liquefied natural gas. Fuel expenses generally do not affect net income since
they are offset by fuel revenues under the Company’s fuel cost recovery clause. See Note 1 to the
financial statements under “Fuel Costs” for additional information.

Purchased power expense increased $37 million, or 34.4 percent, in 2005 when compared to 2004.
The increase is primarily the result of the reduction in generation due to the damage caused by
Hurricane Katrina. In 2004, purchased power expense increased $13.6 million, or 14.6 percent when
compared to 2003. The increase was primarily due to an increase in purchases from non-affiliates
to meet increased load and offset higher priced self-generation resulting from increased fuel
costs. In 2003, purchased power expense increased $41.9 million when compared to 2002. The
increase was primarily due to an increase in purchased power expense from affiliate companies.
Those purchases were more economical than self generation due to the increased cost of natural gas
in 2003. Energy purchases vary from year to year depending on demand and the availability and cost
of the Company’s generating resources. These expenses do not have a significant impact on earnings
since the energy purchases are generally offset by energy revenues through the Company’s fuel cost
recovery clause.

Other operations expense increased $7.9 million, or 4.9 percent, in 2005 as compared to 2004
primarily as a result a $5.2 million increase in employee benefit expenses, a $1.7 million increase
in rent expense on the Plant Daniel combined cycle lease, and higher bad debt expense of $1 million
primarily resulting from Hurricane Katrina. In 2004, other operations expense decreased $69.2
million, or 30 percent, and increased $71.2 million, or 45.0 percent, in 2003 due to approximately
$11 million incurred in 2003 to restructure the Plant Daniel combined cycle lease agreement and $60
million in expense recorded in 2003 in connection with the recognition of a regulatory liability
following an accounting order from the Mississippi PSC related to Plant Daniel capacity expense.
See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – “Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements” and Notes 3 and
7 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters – Performance Evaluation Plan” and
“Operating Leases – Plant Daniel Combined Cycle Generating Units,” respectively, for additional
information.

Maintenance expense decreased $5.7 million, or 7.5 percent, in 2005 as a result of a $1.1
million decrease in long-term service agreement expense associated with the Plant Daniel combined
cycle units as a result of fewer fired operating hours in 2005 when compared to 2004 and a $4.5
million decrease in maintenance expense associated with changes in scheduled maintenance as a
result of restoration efforts. These restoration expenses have been deferred in accordance with a
Mississippi PSC order. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “PSC Matters – Storm Damage Cost Recovery”
herein and Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters – Storm Damage Cost
Recovery” for additional information. Maintenance expense increased $7.0 million, or 9.9 percent,
in 2004 primarily resulting from higher operating hours at Plant Daniel and increased distribution
line maintenance during 2004 as compared to 2003. In 2003, maintenance expense decreased $3.6
million, or 4.9 percent over the prior year, primarily due to a decrease of approximately 50
percent in operating hours at Plant Daniel Units 3 and 4. See Note 7 to the financial statements
under “Long-Term Service Agreements” for further information.

II-241


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $5.8 million in 2005 and $16.3 million in 2004
as compared to the prior years primarily as a result of amortization related to a regulatory
liability recorded in 2003 in connection with the Mississippi PSC’s accounting order on the Plant
Daniel Capacity. See Note 3 under “Retail Regulatory Matters – Performance Evaluation Plan” for
additional information. In 2003, depreciation and amortization expense decreased $1.9 million due
to the amortization related to the Company’s Environmental Compliance Overview Plan (ECO Plan)
approved by the Mississippi PSC. The Company filed a depreciation study in 2005 with the
Mississippi PSC and is awaiting approval. Depreciation expense would increase approximately $2.2
million annually effective January 1, 2006 if the depreciation study is approved as filed. See
Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters – Environmental Compliance
Overview Plan” for further information.

In 2005, taxes other than income taxes increased 8.1 percent over the prior year due to a $2.9
million increase in ad valorem taxes and a $1.1 million increase in municipal franchise taxes. The
retail portion, or approximately 82 percent, of the increase in ad valorem taxes is recoverable
under the Company’s ad valorem tax cost recovery clause and, therefore, does not affect net income.
The increase in municipal franchise taxes is directly related to the increase in total retail
revenues. Taxes other than income taxes increased 2.9 percent in 2004 as compared to 2003
primarily due to additional municipal franchise taxes. Taxes other than income taxes decreased 2.8
percent in 2003 due to lower property taxes in 2003 as compared to 2002. The decrease in total
other income and expense is due to interest on long-term debt decreasing in all years presented as
a result of lower interest rates on debt outstanding and lower principal amount of debt
outstanding.

Effects of Inflation

The Company is subject to rate regulation that is based on the recovery of costs. PEP is based on
annual projected costs, including estimates for inflation. When inflation exceeds the projected
costs used in rate regulation, the effects of inflation can create an economic loss since the
recovery of costs could be in dollars that have less purchasing power. The inflation rate has been
relatively low in recent years and any adverse effect of inflation on the Company has not been
significant.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL

General

The Company operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electricity to retail customers
within its traditional service area located in southeast Mississippi and wholesale customers in the
southeastern United States. Prices for electricity relating to jointly owned generating
facilities, interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power are set by the
FERC. Prices for electricity provided by the Company to retail customers are set by the
Mississippi PSC under cost-based regulatory principles. Retail rates and earnings are reviewed and
may be adjusted periodically within certain limitations. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES – “Application of
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Electric Utility Regulation” herein and Note 3 to the
financial statements under “FERC Matters” and “Retail Regulatory Matters” for additional
information about these and other regulatory matters.

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of future
earnings potential. The level of the Company’s future earnings depends on numerous factors. These
factors include the ability of the Company to maintain a stable regulatory environment that
continues to allow for the recovery of all prudently incurred costs. Future earnings in the near
term will depend, in part, upon growth in energy sales, which is subject to a number of factors.
These factors include weather, competition, new energy contracts with neighboring utilities, energy
conservation practiced by customers, the price of electricity, the price elasticity of demand, and
the rate of economic growth in the Company’s service area in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.

Environmental Matters

New Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil action in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against certain Southern Company
subsidiaries, including Alabama Power and Georgia Power, alleging violations of the New Source
Review (NSR)

II-242


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2005 Annual Report

provisions of the Clean Air Act and related state laws at certain coal-fired generating
facilities. Through subsequent amendments and other legal procedures, the EPA added Savannah
Electric as a defendant to the original action and filed a separate action against Alabama Power
in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama after it was dismissed from the
original action. In these lawsuits, the EPA alleges that NSR violations occurred at eight
coal-fired generating facilities operated by Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Savannah
Electric, including three co-owned by the Company. The civil actions request penalties and
injunctive relief, including an order requiring the installation of the best available control
technology at the affected units. The EPA concurrently issued notices of violation relating to
the Company’s Plants Watson and Greene County. In early 2000, the EPA filed a motion to amend
its complaint to add the allegations in its notices of violation and to add the Company as a
defendant. However, in March 2001, the court denied the motion based on lack of jurisdiction,
and the EPA has not refiled. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Environmental
Matters – New Source Review Actions.”

The Company believes that it has complied with applicable laws and the EPA regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act
authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $32,500 per day, per violation at each generating
unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in this matter could
require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly
require payment of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of operations, cash
flows, and financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

In December 2002 and October 2003, the EPA issued final revisions to its NSR regulations under
the Clean Air Act. A coalition of states and environmental organizations filed petitions for
review of these regulations. On June 24, 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit upheld, in part, the EPA’s December 2002 revisions to its NSR regulations, which
included changes to the regulatory exclusions and methods of calculating emissions increases.
However, the court vacated portions of those revisions, including those addressing the exclusion of
certain pollution control projects. The Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ)
formally adopted the 2002 NSR rules effective July 28, 2005, but did not adopt the provisions
vacated by the District of Columbia Circuit. The October 2003 revisions, which clarified the scope
of the existing Routine Maintenance, Repair and Replacement exclusion, have been stayed by the
Court of Appeals pending its review of the rules. On October 20, 2005, the EPA also published a
proposed rule clarifying the test for determining when an emissions increase subject to the NSR
requirements has occurred. The impact of these revisions and proposed rules will depend on
adoption of the final rules by the EPA and the State of Mississippi’s implementation of such rules,
as well as the outcome of any additional legal challenges, and therefore, cannot be determined at
this time.

Carbon Dioxide Litigation

In July 2004, attorneys general from eight states, each outside of Southern Company’s service
territory, and the corporation counsel for New York City filed a complaint in the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York against Southern Company and four other electric power
companies. A nearly identical complaint was filed by three environmental groups in the same court.
The complaints allege that the companies’ emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas,
contribute to global warming, which the plaintiffs assert is a public nuisance. Under common law
public and private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs seek a judicial order (1) holding each
defendant jointly and severally liable for creating, contributing to, and/or maintaining global
warming and (2) requiring each of the defendants to cap its emissions of carbon dioxide and then
reduce those emissions by a specified percentage each year for at least a decade. Plaintiffs have
not, however, requested that damages be awarded in connection with their claims. Southern Company
believes these claims are without merit and notes that the complaint cites no statutory or
regulatory basis for the claims. In September 2005, the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York granted Southern Company’s and the other defendants’ motions to dismiss these
cases. The plaintiffs filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on
October 19, 2005. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

II-243


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Environmental Statutes and Regulations

General

The Company’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by state and federal environmental
agencies under a variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental media, including air,
water, and land resources. Applicable statutes include the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Emergency Planning & Community
Right-to-Know Act; and the Endangered Species Act.

Compliance with these environmental requirements involves significant capital and operating
costs, a major portion of which is expected to be recovered through the Company’s ECO Plan. See
Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters –
Environmental Compliance Overview Plan” for additional information. Through 2005, the Company had
invested approximately $46.8 million in capital projects to comply with these requirements, with
annual totals of $4.0 million, $2.9 million, and $10.4 million for 2005, 2004, and 2003,
respectively. Over the next decade the Company expects that capital expenditures to assure
compliance with existing and new regulations could exceed an additional $466 million, including
$6.4 million, $27.0 million, and $40.1 million for 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively. Because the
Company’s compliance strategy is impacted by changes to existing environmental laws and
regulations, the cost, availability, and existing inventory of emission allowances, and the
Company’s fuel mix, the ultimate outcome cannot be determined at this time. Environmental costs
that are known and estimable at this time are included in capital expenditures discussed under
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – “Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations” herein.

Compliance with possible additional federal or state legislation or regulations related to
global climate change, air quality, or other environmental and health concerns could also
significantly affect the Company. New environmental legislation or regulations, or changes to
existing statutes or regulations, could affect many areas of the Company’s operations; however, the
full impact of any such changes cannot be determined at this time.

Air Quality

Compliance with the Clean Air Act and resulting regulations has been and will continue to be a
significant focus for the Company. Through 2005, the Company had spent approximately $7.7 million
in reducing sulfur dioxide (SO


) and nitrogen oxide (NO

x

) emissions and in
monitoring emissions pursuant to the Clean Air Act.

In 2005, the EPA revoked the one-hour ozone standard and published the final set of rules for
implementation of the new, more stringent eight-hour ozone standard. During, 2005, the EPA’s fine
particulate matter nonattainment designations also became effective for several areas across the
United States. No areas within the Company’s service area, however, have been designated as
nonattainment under either the eight-hour ozone standard or the fine particulate matter standard.

The EPA issued the final Clean Air Interstate Rule on March 10, 2005. This cap-and-trade
rule addresses power plant SO


and NO

x

emissions that were found to
contribute to nonattainment of the eight-hour ozone and fine particulate matter standards in
downwind states. Twenty-eight eastern states, including the State of Mississippi are subject to
the requirements of the rule. The rule calls for additional reductions of NO

x

and/or
SO


to be achieved in two phases, 2009/2010 and 2015. These reductions will be
accomplished by the installation of additional emission controls at the Company’s coal-fired
facilities or by the purchase of emission allowances from a cap-and-trade program.

The Clean Air Visibility Rule (formerly called the Regional Haze Rule) was finalized on July
6, 2005. The goal of this rule is to restore natural visibility conditions in certain areas
(primarily national parks and wilderness areas) by 2064. The rule involves the application of
Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements and a review each decade, beginning in 2018,
of progress toward the goal. BART requires that sources that contribute to visibility impairment
implement additional emission reductions, if necessary, to make progress toward remedying current
visibility concerns. For power plants, the Clean Air Visibility Rule allows states to determine
that the Clean Air Interstate Rule satisfies BART requirements for SO


and

II-244


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2005 Annual Report

NO

x

. However, additional requirements could be imposed. By December 17, 2007, states
must submit implementation plans that contain emission reduction strategies for implementing BART
requirements and for achieving sufficient and reasonable progress toward the goal.

On March 15, 2005, the EPA announced the final Clean Air Mercury Rule, a cap-and-trade program
for the reduction of mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. The rule sets caps on mercury
emissions to be implemented in two phases, 2010 and 2018, and provides for an emission allowance
trading market. The Company anticipates that emission controls installed to achieve compliance
with the Clean Air Interstate Rule and the eight-hour ozone and fine-particulate standards will
also result in mercury emission reductions. However, the long-term capability of emission control
equipment to reduce mercury emissions is still being evaluated, and the installation of additional
control technologies may be required.

The impacts of the eight-hour ozone standard, the fine particulate matter nonattainment
designations, the Clean Air Interstate Rule, the Clean Air Visibility Rule, and the Clean Air
Mercury Rule on the Company will depend on the development and implementation of rules at the
state level. Such impacts will also depend on resolution of pending legal challenges to the
Clean Air Interstate Rule, the Clean Air Mercury Rule, and a related petition from the State of
North Carolina under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act, also related to the interstate transport
of air pollutants. Therefore, the full impacts of these regulations on the Company cannot be
determined at this time. The Company has developed and continually updates a comprehensive
environmental compliance strategy to comply with the continuing and new environmental
requirements discussed above. As part of this strategy, the Company plans to install additional
SO


, NO

x,

and mercury emission controls within the next several years to
assure continued compliance with applicable air quality requirements.

Water Quality

In July 2004, the EPA published final rules under the Clean Water Act for the purpose of reducing
impingement and entrainment of fish and fish larvae at power plants’ cooling water intake
structures. The new rules require baseline biological information and, perhaps, installation of
fish protection technology near some intake structures at existing power plants. The full impact
of these new rules will depend on the results of studies and analyses performed as part of the
rules’ implementation and the actual requirements established by state regulatory agencies, and
therefore, cannot now be determined.

Environmental Remediation

The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling and
disposal of waste and release of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations,
the Company could incur substantial costs to clean up properties. The Company conducts studies to
determine the extent of any required cleanup and has recognized in the financial statements the
costs to clean up known sites. Amounts for cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs were not material
for any year presented. The Company may be liable for some or all required cleanup costs for
additional sites that may require environmental remediation. The Company has received authority
from the Mississippi PSC to recover approved environmental compliance costs through specific retail
rate clauses. Within limits approved by the Mississippi PSC, these rates are adjusted annually.
See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Environmental Matters – Environmental Remediation”
and “Retail Regulatory Matters – Environmental Compliance Overview Plan” for additional
information.

Global Climate Issues

Domestic efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions have been spurred by international discussions
surrounding the Framework Convention on Climate Change and specifically the Kyoto Protocol, which
proposes constraints on the emissions of greenhouse gases for a group of industrialized countries.
The Bush Administration has not supported U.S. ratification of the Kyoto Protocol or other
mandatory carbon dioxide reduction legislation; however, in 2002, it did announce a goal to reduce
the greenhouse gas intensity of the U.S., the ratio of greenhouse gas emissions to the value of
U.S. economic output, by 18 percent by 2012. A year later, the Department of Energy (DOE)
announced the Climate VISION program to support this goal. Energy-intensive industries, including
electricity generation are the initial focus of this program. Southern Company is involved in the
development of a voluntary electric utility sector climate change initiative in partnership with
the government. In a memorandum of understanding signed in December 2004 with the DOE under
Climate VISION, the utility sector pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions rate by 3 percent
to 5 percent by 2010-2012. The Company is continuing to evaluate future energy and emission
profiles relative to

II-245


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2005 Annual Report

the Climate VISION program and is analyzing voluntary programs to support the industry initiative.

FERC Matters

Market-Based Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates at market-based
prices. The Company also has FERC authority to make short-term opportunity sales at market
rates. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a market-based contract with an
affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation
dominance within its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in
other markets is not an issue in that proceeding. In February 2005, Southern Company submitted
responsive information. In February 2006, the FERC suspended the proceeding to allow the
parties to conduct settlement discussions. Any new market-based rate transactions in its retail
service territory entered into after February 27, 2005, are subject to refund to the level of
the default cost-based rates, pending the outcome of the proceeding. The impact of such sales
to the Company through December 31, 2005, is not expected to exceed $5.7 million. The refund
period covers 15 months. In the event that the FERC’s default mitigation measures for entities
that are found to have market power are ultimately applied, the Company may be required to
charge cost-based rates for certain wholesale sales in the Southern Company retail service
territory, which may be lower than negotiated market-based rates. The final outcome of this
matter will depend on the form in which the final methodology for assessing generation market
power and mitigation rules may be ultimately adopted and cannot be determined at this time.

In addition, in May 2005, the FERC started an investigation to determine whether Southern
Company satisfies the other three parts of the FERC’s market-based rate analysis: transmission
market power, barriers to entry, and affiliate abuse or reciprocal dealing. The FERC established a
new refund period related to this expanded investigation. Any and all new market-based rate
transactions both inside and outside Southern Company’s retail service territory involving any
Southern Company subsidiary, including the Company, will be subject to refund to the extent the
FERC orders lower rates as a result of this new investigation, with the 15-month refund period
beginning July 19, 2005. The impact of such sales to the Company through December 31, 2005, is not
expected to exceed $7.4 million, of which $4.4 million relates to sales inside the service
territory as discussed above. The FERC also directed that this expanded proceeding be held in
abeyance pending the outcome of the proceeding on the IIC discussed below.

The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for this proceeding and is vigorously
defending itself in this matter. However, the final outcome of this matter, including any remedies
to be applied in the event of an adverse ruling in this proceeding, cannot now be determined.

Intercompany Interchange Contract

The Company’s generation fleet in its retail service territory is operated under the IIC, as
approved by the FERC. In May 2005, the FERC initiated a new proceeding to examine (1) the
provisions of the IIC among Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, the Company, Savannah
Electric, Southern Power, and Southern Company Services, as agent, under the terms of which the
power pool of Southern Company is operated, and, in particular, the propriety of the continued
inclusion of Southern Power as a party to the IIC, (2) whether any parties to the IIC have violated
the FERC’s standards of conduct applicable to utility companies that are transmission providers,
and (3) whether Southern Company’s code of conduct defining Southern Power as a “system company”
rather than a “marketing affiliate” is just and reasonable. In connection with the formation of
Southern Power, the FERC authorized Southern Power’s inclusion in the IIC in 2000. The FERC also
previously approved Southern Company’s code of conduct. The FERC order directs that the
administrative law judge who presided over a proceeding involving approval of PPAs between Southern
Power and Georgia Power and Savannah Electric be assigned to preside over the hearing in this
proceeding and that the testimony and exhibits presented in that proceeding be preserved to the
extent appropriate. Hearings are scheduled for September 2006. Effective July 19, 2005, revenues
from transactions under the IIC involving any Southern Company subsidiaries, including the Company,
are subject to refund to the extent the FERC orders any changes to the IIC.

II-246


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2005 Annual Report

The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for this proceeding and is
vigorously defending itself in this matter. However, the final outcome of this matter,
including any remedies to be applied in the event of an adverse ruling in this proceeding,
cannot be determined at this time.

Generation Interconnection Agreements

In July 2003, the FERC issued its final rule on the standardization of generation interconnection
agreements and procedures (Order 2003). Order 2003 shifts much of the financial burden of new
transmission investment from the generator to the transmission provider. The FERC has indicated
that Order 2003, which was effective January 20, 2004, is to be applied prospectively to
interconnection agreements. The impact of Order 2003 and its subsequent rehearings on the Company
cannot be determined at this time.

Transmission

In December 1999, the FERC issued its final rule on Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs).
Since that time, there have been a number of additional proceedings at the FERC designed to
encourage further voluntary formation of RTOs or to mandate their formation. However, at the
current time, there are no active proceedings that would require the Company to participate in an
RTO. Current FERC efforts that may potentially change the regulatory and/or operational structure
of transmission include rules related to the standardization of generation interconnection, as well
as an inquiry into, among other things, market power by vertically integrated utilities. See
“Market-Based Rate Authority” and “Generation Interconnection Agreements” herein for additional
information. The final outcome of these proceedings cannot now be determined. However, the
Company’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected by
future changes in the federal regulatory or operational structure of transmission.

PSC Matters

Performance Evaluation Plan (PEP)

See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters – Performance Evaluation
Plan” for information on the Company’s base rates. In May 2004, the Mississippi PSC approved
the Company’s request to reclassify 266 megawatts of Plant Daniel Units 3 and 4 capacity to
jurisdictional cost of service effective January 1, 2004, and authorized the Company to include
the related costs and revenue credits in jurisdictional rate base, cost of service, and revenue
requirement calculations for purposes of retail rate recovery. The Company is amortizing the
regulatory liability established pursuant to the Mississippi PSC’s interim December 2003 order,
as approved in the May 2004 order, to earnings as follows: $16.5 million in 2004, $25.1 million
in 2005, $13.0 million in 2006, and $5.7 million in 2007, resulting in reductions of costs in
each of those years.

On December 1, 2005, the Company submitted its annual PEP filing to the Mississippi PSC.
Ordinarily, PEP limits annual rate increases to 4 percent; however, the Company has requested
that the Mississippi PSC approve a temporary change to allow it to exceed this cap as a result
of the ongoing effects of Hurricane Katrina. The Company has requested a 5 percent increase in
total retail revenues or $32 million increase in retail base revenues to become effective in
April 2006 if approved. Hearings are scheduled for March 2, 2006.

Fuel Cost Recovery

The Company establishes annually a fuel cost recovery factor that is approved by the Mississippi
PSC. Over the past year, the Company has continued to experience higher than expected fuel costs
for coal and natural gas. The Company is required to file for an adjustment to the fuel cost
recovery factor annually; such filing occurred in November 2005. As a result, the Mississippi PSC
approved an increase in the fuel cost recovery factor effective January 2006 in an amount equal to
12 percent of total retail revenues. The Company’s operating revenues are adjusted for differences
in actual recoverable fuel cost and amounts billed in accordance with the currently approved cost
recovery rate. Accordingly, this increase to the billing factor will have no significant effect on
the Company’s revenues or net income.

Storm Damage Cost Recovery

The Company maintains a reserve for property damage to cover the cost of damages from major storms
to its transmission and distribution lines and the cost of uninsured damages to its generation
facilities and other

II-247


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2005 Annual Report

property. The Company’s current annual accrual to the provision for property damage, as approved
by the Mississippi PSC, is $1.5 million to $4.6 million.

Hurricane Katrina hit the coast of Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana on August 29,
2005, causing substantial damage. The Company sustained significant damage to its distribution and
transmission facilities. The Company’s Plant Watson was also damaged. Plant Watson has six
generating units, including three gas-fired units totaling 262 megawatts (MW), two coal-fired units
totaling 750 MW, and a 40 MW gas turbine. Both of the coal-fired units at the plant have been
returned to service. The gas units operate primarily to serve summer peak loads. Repairs to the
gas units are expected to be completed by June 1, 2006.

As of December 31, 2005, approximately 19,200 of the Company’s customers remained unable to
receive service. Prior to Hurricane Katrina, the Company had a balance of approximately $3 million
in its property reserve. The Company currently estimates the total incremental cost of repairing
the damages to its facilities and restoring service to customers will be approximately $277 million
net of approximately $68 million of insurance proceeds. Business and government authorities are
still reviewing redevelopment plans for portions of the severely damaged areas along the
Mississippi shoreline. The ultimate impact of the redevelopment plans in these areas on the
Company’s cost estimates cannot now be determined.

The Mississippi PSC issued an Interim Accounting Order on October 21, 2005, requiring the
Company to recognize a regulatory asset in an amount equal to the retail portion of the recorded
Hurricane Katrina restoration costs, including both operation and maintenance expenditures and
capital additions. Total Hurricane Katrina costs incurred through December 31, 2005, include
approximately $132.6 million of operations and maintenance expenditures and approximately $148.8
million of capital-related expenditures. On December 7, 2005, the Company filed with the
Mississippi PSC a detailed review of all Hurricane Katrina restoration costs as required in the
Interim Accounting Order. The Company is currently working with the Mississippi PSC to establish a
method to recover all such prudently incurred costs upon resolution of uncertainties related to
proposed state legislation to allow securitized financing and federal grant assistance. See Notes
1 and 3 to the financial statements under “Provision for Property Damage” and “Retail Regulatory
Matters – Storm Damage Cost Recovery,” respectively, for additional information.

Other Matters

In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 87, Employers’
Accounting for Pensions, the Company recorded non-cash pre-tax pension (income)/expense, before
tax, of approximately $2.7 million, $0.6 million, and ($1.7) million, in 2005, 2004 and 2003
respectively. Future pension income is dependent on several factors including trust earnings and
changes to the pension plan. Postretirement benefit costs for the Company were $5.3 million, $4.5
million, and $4.0 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Both pension and postretirement
costs are expected to continue to trend upward. Such amounts are dependent on several factors
including trust earnings and changes to the plans. A portion of pension and postretirement benefit
costs is capitalized based on construction-related labor charges. Pension and postretirement
benefits are components of regulated rates and generally do not have a long-term effect on net
income. For more information regarding pension and postretirement benefits, see Note 2 to the
financial statements.

The Company is involved in various other matters being litigated and regulatory matters that
could affect future earnings. See Note 3 to the financial statements for information regarding
these matters.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may
have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations and related disclosures. Different
assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those
recorded in the financial statements. Management has reviewed and discussed critical

II-248


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2005 Annual Report

accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of Southern Company’s Board of
Directors.

Electric Utility Regulation

The Company is subject to retail regulation by the Mississippi PSC and wholesale regulation by the
FERC. These regulatory agencies set the rates the Company is permitted to charge customers based
on allowable costs. As a result, the Company applies FASB Statement No. 71, Accounting for the
Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (Statement No. 71), which requires the financial statements
to reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the ratemaking process, the regulators may
require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when they would be recognized
by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of expenses and the
recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery through rates or the
deferral of gains or creation of liabilities and the recording of related regulatory liabilities.
The application of Statement No. 71 has a further effect on the Company’s financial statements as a
result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the ratemaking process. These estimates may
differ from those actually incurred by the Company; therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in
specific costs such as depreciation and pension and postretirement benefits have less of a direct
impact on the Company’s results of operations than they would on a non-regulated company.

As reflected in Note 1 to the financial statements, significant regulatory assets and
liabilities have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of these regulatory
assets and liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines and accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. However, adverse legislative, judicial, or regulatory
actions could materially impact the amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could
adversely impact the Company’s financial statements.

Contingent Obligations

The Company is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other
factors and conditions that potentially subject it to environmental, litigation, income tax, and
other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Note 3 to the financial statements for
more information regarding certain of these contingencies. The Company periodically evaluates
its exposure to such risks and records reserves for those matters where a loss is considered
probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or conditions that can
be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially affect the
Company’s financial statements. These events or conditions include the following:

Unbilled Revenues

Revenues related to the sale of electricity are recorded when electricity is delivered to
customers. However, the determination of KWH sales to individual customers is based on the reading
of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each
month, amounts of electricity delivered to customers, but not yet metered and billed, are
estimated. Components of the unbilled revenue estimates include total KWH territorial supply,
total KWH billed, estimated total electricity lost in delivery, and customer usage. These
components can fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including weather, generation patterns,
power delivery volume, and other operational constraints. These factors can be unpredictable and
can vary from historical trends. As a result, the overall estimate of unbilled revenues could be
significantly affected, which could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations.

Plant Daniel Operating Lease

As discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements under “Operating Leases – Plant Daniel Combined
Cycle Generating Units,” the Company leases a 1,064 megawatt natural gas combined cycle facility at
Plant Daniel (Facility) from Juniper Capital L.P. (Juniper). For both accounting and rate recovery
purposes, this transaction is treated as an operating lease, which means that the related
obligations under this agreement are not reflected in the balance sheets. See FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND LIQUIDITY – “Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements” herein for further information. The
operating lease determination was based on assumptions and estimates related to the following:

The determination of operating lease treatment was made at the inception of the lease
agreement and is not subject to change unless subsequent changes are made to the agreement.
However the Company also is required to monitor Juniper’s ongoing status as a voting interest
entity. Changes in that status could require the Company to consolidate the Facility’s assets
and the related debt and to record interest and depreciation expense of approximately $37
million annually, rather than annual lease expense of approximately $27 million.

New Accounting Standards

Income Taxes

In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FSP 109-1, Application of FASB Statement
No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities
Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (FSP 109-1), which requires that the
generation deduction be accounted for as a special tax deduction rather than as a tax rate
reduction. The Company adopted FSP 109-1 in the first quarter of 2005 with no material impact
on the Company’s financial statements.

Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations

Effective December 31, 2005, the Company adopted the provision of FASB Interpretation No. 47 (FIN
47), Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires that an asset retirement obligation
be recorded even though the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on future events.
Prior to December 2005, the Company did not recognize asset retirement obligations for asbestos
removal and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers because the timing of
their retirements was dependent on future events. At December 31, 2005, the Company recorded
additional asset retirement obligations (and assets) of approximately $9.5 million. The adoption
of FIN 47 did not have any effect on the Company’s income statement. For additional information,
see Note 1 to the financial statements under “Asset Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of
Removal.”

Stock Options

On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, on a modified
prospective basis. This statement requires that compensation cost relating to share-based payment
transactions be recognized in financial statements. That cost will be measured based on the grant
date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. Although the compensation expense
required under the revised statement differs slightly, the impacts on the Company’s financial
statements are similar to the pro forma disclosures included in Note 1 to the financial statements
under “Stock Options.”

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

The Company’s financial condition remained stable at December 31, 2005. Net cash flow from
operating activities totaled $42 million, $119 million, and $186 million for 2005, 2004, and 2003,
respectively. The $77 million decrease for 2005 was primarily due to the storm damage costs
related to Hurricane Katrina. These costs are expected to be recovered from customers in future
periods and are included in the balance sheet under

II-250


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Deferred Property Damage. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL “PSC Matters – Storm Damage Cost Recovery”
for additional information.

Significant changes in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily
relate to Hurricane Katrina storm restoration activities. These storm-related changes include
increases in other accounts and notes receivable of $14.7 million, insurance receivable of $60
million, accumulated provision for uncollectible accounts of $1.5 million, prepaid income taxes of
$32 million, notes payable of $202 million, affiliated accounts payable of $73.5 million, and
accumulated deferred income taxes of $68.9 million. Current liabilities exceed current assets
primarily due to the notes payable related to storm restoration activities. See FUTURE EARNINGS
POTENTIAL – “PSC Matters – Storm Damage Cost Recovery” herein and Note 3 to the financial
statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters – Storm Damage Recovery” for additional information
related to the deferral of the restoration costs, including both capital and operation and
maintenance expenditures.

The Company’s ratio of common equity to total capitalization, excluding long-term debt due
within one year, increased from 63.7 percent in 2004 to 64.3 percent at December 31, 2005. The
Company has received investment grade ratings from the major rating agencies.

Sources of Capital

The Company plans to obtain the funds required for construction, continued storm damage
restoration, and other purposes from sources similar to those used in the past. In addition, the
Company is considering other financing options, such as securitization, for storm recovery costs.
The amount, type, and timing of any future financings, if needed, will depend upon maintenance of
adequate earnings, regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions, and other factors.

The issuance of securities by the Company is subject to regulatory approval by the FERC
following the repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended (PUHCA), on
February 8, 2006. Additionally, with respect to the public offering of securities, the Company
files registration statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the
Securities Act of 1933 (1933 Act). The amounts registered under the 1933 Act and the amounts
authorized by the FERC, are continuously monitored and appropriate filings are made to ensure
flexibility in the capital markets.

The Company obtains financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. The
Southern Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of
the Company are not commingled with funds of any other company.

To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the Company has various sources of liquidity.
At the beginning of 2006, the Company had approximately $14.3 million of cash and cash equivalents
and $276 million of unused credit arrangements with banks. See Note 6 to the financial statements
under “Bank Credit Arrangements” for additional information.

The Company may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company subsidiary
organized to issue and sell commercial paper and extendible commercial notes at the request and for
the benefit of the Company and the other retail operating companies. Proceeds from such issuances
for the benefit of the Company are loaned directly to the Company and are not commingled with
proceeds from such issuances for the benefit of any other retail operating company. The
obligations of each company under these arrangements are several; there is no cross affiliate
credit support. At December 31, 2005, the Company had $152 million outstanding in commercial paper
notes.

On February 24, 2006, the Company borrowed $100 million under a promissory note to Barclays
Bank PLC due August 24, 2006. The borrowing bears interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR plus
0.3 percent, is unsecured, and may be prepaid at any time upon three days’ prior written notice.
The promissory note includes representations and warranties, covenants, and events of default,
including a maximum debt to total capitalization ratio of 65 percent. The promissory note also
includes limitations on liens, consolidations, mergers, and sale of all or substantially all of the
Company’s assets. The borrowing may become due and payable upon an event of default and expiration
of any applicable cure periods. Events of default include: (i) nonpayment of obligations under
the promissory note, (ii) failure to perform any covenant or agreement in the promissory note,
(iii) material misrepresentations, (iv) failure to pay, or

II-251


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2005 Annual Report

certain other defaults under, certain other indebtedness, and (v) certain bankruptcy or insolvency
events.

Financing Activities

During 2005, the Company continued a program to retire higher-cost securities and replace them with
lower-cost capital. See the statements of cash flows for further details.

In June 2005, the Company issued $30 million of senior notes. The proceeds from this sale
were used to redeem $30 million principal amount of first mortgage bonds due December 1, 2025. The
related first mortgage bond indenture was legally defeased in June 2005 and retired in December
2005. As a result of this transaction, there are no longer any first mortgage bond liens on the
Company’s property.

In addition to any financings that may be necessary to meet capital requirements and
contractual obligations, the Company plans to continue, when economically feasible, a program to
retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market
conditions permit.

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements

In June 2003, the Company entered into a restructured lease agreement for the Facility with
Juniper, as discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements under “Operating Leases – Plant Daniel
Combined Cycle Generating Units.” Juniper has also entered into leases with other parties
unrelated to the Company. The assets leased by the Company comprise less than 50 percent of
Juniper’s assets. The Company does not consolidate the leased assets and related liabilities, and
the lease with Juniper is considered an operating lease. Accordingly, the lease is not reflected
in the balance sheets.

The initial lease term ends in 2011, and the lease includes a purchase and renewal option
based on the cost of the Facility at the inception of the lease, which was approximately $370
million. The Company is required to amortize approximately four percent of the initial acquisition
cost over the initial lease term. Eighteen months prior to the end of the initial lease, the
Company may elect to renew for 10 years. If the lease is renewed, the agreement calls for the
Company to amortize an additional 17 percent of the initial completion cost over the renewal
period. Upon termination of the lease, at the Company’s option, it may either exercise its
purchase option or the Facility can be sold to a third party.

The lease also provides for a residual value guarantee, approximately 73 percent of the
acquisition cost, by the Company that is due upon termination of the lease in the event that the
Company does not renew the lease or purchase the Facility and that the fair market value is less
than the unamortized cost of the Facility.

Credit Rating Risk

The Company does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment
schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. The Company is party to
certain derivative agreements that could require collateral and/or accelerated payment in the event
of a credit rating change to below investment grade. These agreements are primarily for natural
gas price risk management activities. At December 31, 2005, the Company’s exposure related to
these agreements was not material.

Market Price Risk

Due to cost-based rate regulation, the Company has limited exposure to market volatility in
interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity. To manage the volatility
attributable to these exposures, the Company nets the exposures to take advantage of natural
offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to the
Company’s policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and hedging practices. Company policy is
that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and mandates strict adherence to all
applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques that
include, but are not limited to, market valuation and sensitivity analysis.

The Company’s market risk exposures relative to interest rate changes have changed compared
with the December 31, 2004, reporting period as a result of storm damage from Hurricane Katrina.
The Company will manage this increased exposure through a number of means, including interest rate
hedges, where appropriate.

II-252


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2005 Annual Report

The Company does not currently hedge interest rate risk. The weighted average interest rate
on variable long-term debt at January 1, 2006, was 3.96 percent. If the Company sustained a 100
basis point change in interest rates for all unhedged variable rate long-term debt, the change
would affect annualized interest expense by approximately $1.2 million at December 31, 2005. The
Company is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly affect such exposures
in the near term. See Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements under “Financial Instruments” for
additional information.

To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the Company enters
into fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale
electricity market. At December 31, 2005, exposure from these activities was not material to the
Company’s financial statements.

In addition, at the instruction of the Mississippi PSC, the Company has implemented a
fuel-hedging program. At December 31, 2005, exposure from these activities was not material to the
Company’s financial statements.

The change in fair value of energy contracts and year-end valuations are as follows:

These contracts are related primarily to fuel hedging programs under which unrealized gains
and losses from mark to market adjustments are recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities.
Realized gains and losses from these programs are included in fuel expense and are recovered
through the Company’s energy cost management clause.

Gains and losses on forward contracts for the sale of electricity that do not represent hedges
are recognized in the statements of income as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2005,
2004, and 2003, these amounts were not material.

At December 31, 2005, the fair value of derivative energy contracts was reflected in the
financial statements as follows:

Unrealized pre-tax gains and losses recognized in income were not material for any year
presented. The Company is exposed to market price risk in the event of nonperformance by
counterparties to the derivative energy contracts. The Company’s policy is to enter into
agreements with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody’s and Standard &
Poor’s or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure.
Therefore, the Company does not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the
counterparties. See Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements under “Financial Instruments” for
additional information.

Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations

The construction program of the Company is currently estimated to be $126 million for 2006, of
which $30 million is related to Hurricane Katrina restoration, $112 million for 2007, and $139
million for 2008. Environmental expenditures included in these amounts are $6.4 million, $27.0
million, and $40.4 million for 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively. Actual construction costs may
vary from this estimate because of changes in such factors as: business conditions; environmental

regulations; FERC rules and transmission regulations; load projections; storm impacts; the cost and
efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; and the cost of capital. In addition,
there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered.

Other funding requirements related to obligations associated with scheduled maturities of
long-term debt, as well as the related interest, derivative obligations, preferred stock dividends,
leases, and other purchase commitments are as follows. See Notes 1, 6, and 7 to the financial
statements for additional information.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Mississippi Power Company 2005 Annual Report

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General

Mississippi Power Company (Company) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company, which is the
parent company of five retail operating companies, Southern Power Company (Southern Power),
Southern Company Services (SCS), Southern Communications Services (SouthernLINC Wireless), Southern
Company Holdings (Southern Holdings), Southern Nuclear Operating Company (Southern Nuclear),
Southern Telecom, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The retail operating companies,
Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, the Company, and Savannah Electric, provide electric
service in four southeastern states. The Company operates as a vertically integrated utility
providing service to retail customers in southeast Mississippi and to wholesale customers in the
Southeast. Southern Power constructs, owns, and manages Southern Company’s competitive generation
assets and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Contracts among the
retail operating companies and
Southern Power, related to jointly owned generating facilities, interconnecting transmission lines,
or the exchange of electric power, are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC). SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern
Company and its subsidiary companies. SouthernLINC Wireless provides digital wireless
communications services to the retail operating companies and also markets these services to the
public within the Southeast. Southern Telecom provides fiber cable services within the Southeast.
Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding subsidiary for Southern Company’s investments in
synthetic fuels and leveraged leases and various other energy related businesses. Southern Nuclear
operates and provides services to Southern Company’s nuclear power plants. On January 4,
2006, Southern Company completed the sale of substantially all the assets of Southern Company Gas,
its competitive retail natural gas marketing subsidiary.

The equity method is used for subsidiaries which are variable interest entities and for which
the Company is not the primary beneficiary. Certain prior years’ data presented in the financial
statements have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation.

Southern Company was registered as a holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, as amended (PUHCA), until its repeal on February 8, 2006, and Southern Company and its
subsidiaries, including the Company, were subject to the regulatory provisions of PUHCA. The
Company is also subject to regulation by the FERC and the Mississippi Public Service Commission
(PSC). The Company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and
complies with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by its regulatory commissions. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those
estimates.

Affiliate Transactions

The Company has an agreement with SCS under which the following services are rendered to the
Company at direct or allocated cost: general and design engineering, purchasing, accounting and
statistical analysis, finance and treasury, tax, information resources, marketing, auditing,
insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, and other services
with respect to business and operations and power pool transactions. Costs for these services
amounted to $51.6 million, $45.3 million, and $46.1 million during 2005, 2004, and 2003,
respectively. Cost allocation methodologies used by SCS were approved by the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) prior to the repeal of PUHCA, and management believes they are
reasonable.

The Company provides incidental services to and receives such services from other Southern
Company subsidiaries which are generally minor in duration and amount. However, with the
hurricane damage experienced in the last two years, assistance for storm restoration has caused an
increase in these activities. The total amount of storm restoration provided to Alabama Power,
Georgia Power, and Gulf Power in 2004 and 2005 was $3.3 million and $1.0 million, respectively.
These activities were billed at cost. The Company received storm restoration assistance from
other Southern Company subsidiaries in 2005 totaling $73.5 million.

II-263


NOTES (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2005 Annual Report

The Company has an agreement with Alabama Power under which the Company owns a portion of
Greene County Steam Plant. Alabama Power operates Greene County Steam Plant, and the Company
reimburses Alabama Power for its proportionate share of all associated expenditures and costs. The
Company reimbursed Alabama Power for the Company’s proportionate share of related expenses which
totaled $8.2 million, $7.2 million, and $6.6 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The
Company also has an agreement with Gulf Power under which Gulf Power owns a portion of Plant
Daniel. The Company operates Plant Daniel, and Gulf Power reimburses the Company for its
proportionate share of all associated expenditures and costs. Gulf Power reimbursed the Company
for Gulf Power’s proportionate share of related expenses which totaled $18.4 million, $17.8
million, and $17.7 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. See Notes 4 and 5 for additional
information on certain deferred tax liabilities payable to affiliates.

The retail operating companies, including the Company, and Southern Power may jointly enter
into various types of wholesale energy, natural gas, and certain other contracts, either directly
or through SCS, as agent. Each participating company may be jointly and severally liable for the
obligations incurred under these agreements. See Note 7 under “Fuel Commitments” for additional
information.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

The Company is subject to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement
No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. Regulatory assets represent
probable future revenues associated with certain costs that are expected to be recovered from
customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future
reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be credited to customers
through the ratemaking process.

Regulatory assets and (liabilities) reflected in the balance sheets at December 31 relate to:

(i)

For additional information, see Note 3 under “Retail Regulatory Matters — Storm Damage Cost

In the event that a portion of the Company’s operations is no longer subject to the
provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, the Company would be required to write off related
regulatory assets and liabilities that are

II-264


NOTES (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2005 Annual Report

not specifically recoverable through regulated rates. In addition, the Company would be required to determine if any impairment to other assets, including plant, exists and write down the assets, if impaired, to their fair value. All regulatory assets and liabilities are to be reflected in rates. See Note 3 herein under “Retail Regulatory Matters — Storm Damage Cost Recovery.”

Revenues

Energy and other revenues are recognized as services are rendered. Capacity revenues from
long-term contracts are recognized at the lesser of the levelized amount or the amount billable
under the contract over the respective contract period. Unbilled revenues are accrued at the end
of each fiscal period. The Company’s retail and wholesale rates include provisions to adjust
billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, fuel hedging, the energy component of purchased power
costs, and certain other costs. Retail rates also include provisions to adjust billings for
fluctuations in costs for ad valorem taxes and certain qualifying environmental costs. Revenues
are adjusted for differences between these actual costs and amounts billed in current regulated
rates. Under or over recovered regulatory clause revenues are recorded in the balance sheets and
are recovered or returned to customers through adjustments to the billing factors. The Company is
required to file with the Mississippi PSC for an adjustment to the fuel cost recovery factor
annually.

The Company has a diversified base of customers. For years ended December 31, 2005 and
December 31, 2004, no single customer or industry accounted for 10 percent or more of revenue.
However, for the year ended December 31, 2003, Dynegy, Inc. (Dynegy) accounted for approximately
14.8 percent of revenues as a result of non-recurring contract termination revenues. For all
periods presented, uncollectible accounts continued to average less than 1 percent of revenues.

Fuel Costs

Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is used. Fuel expense includes the cost of purchased emission
allowances as they are used. Fuel costs also included gains and/or losses from fuel hedging
programs as approved by the Mississippi PSC.

Income Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provides deferred
income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences. Investment tax credits utilized
are deferred and amortized to income over the average lives of the related property.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost less regulatory disallowances and
impairments. Original cost includes: materials; labor; minor items of property; payroll-related
costs such as taxes, pensions, and other benefits; and the interest capitalized and/or cost of
funds used during construction for projects over $10 million.

The Company’s property, plant, and equipment consisted of the following at December 31 (in
thousands):

The cost of replacements of property, exclusive of minor items of property, is capitalized.
The cost of maintenance, repairs, and replacement of minor items of property is charged to
maintenance expense except for the cost of maintenance of coal cars and a portion of the railway
track maintenance costs, which are charged to fuel stock and recovered through the Company’s fuel
clause.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation of the original cost of plant in service is provided primarily by using composite
straight-line rates, which approximated 3.4 percent in each of 2005, 2004, and 2003. Depreciation
studies are conducted periodically to update the composite rates. The Company filed a study in
2005 with the Mississippi PSC and is awaiting approval. When property subject to depreciation is
retired or otherwise disposed of in the normal course of business, its cost, together with the cost
of removal, less salvage, is charged to the accumulated

II-265


NOTES (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2005 Annual Report

depreciation
provision. Minor items of property included in the original cost of the plant are retired when the
related property unit is retired. Depreciation expense includes an amount for the expected cost of
removal of facilities.

In January 2006, the Mississippi PSC issued an accounting order directing the Company to
exclude from its calculation of depreciation expense approximately $1.2 million related to
capitalized Hurricane Katrina costs since these costs will be recovered separately.

In December 2003, the Mississippi PSC issued an interim accounting order directing the
Company to expense and record a regulatory liability of $60.3 million while it considered the
Company’s request to include 266 megawatts of Plant Daniel Units 3 and 4 generating capacity in
jurisdictional cost of service. In May 2004, the Mississippi PSC approved the Company’s request
effective January 1, 2004 and ordered the Company to amortize the regulatory liability
previously established to reduce depreciation and amortization expenses as follows: $16.5
million in 2004, $25.1 million in 2005, $13.0 million in 2006, and $5.7 million in 2007.

Asset
Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of Removal

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted FASB Statement No.143, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations, which established new accounting and reporting standards for legal
obligations associated with the ultimate cost of retiring long-lived assets. The present value of
the ultimate cost for an asset’s future retirement is recorded in the period in which the liability
is incurred. The costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated
over the asset’s useful life. In addition, effective December 31, 2005, the Company adopted the
provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 47, Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires
that an asset retirement obligation be recorded even though the timing and/or method of settlement
are conditional on future events. Prior to December 2005, the Company did not recognize asset
retirement obligations for asbestos removal and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain
transformers because of the timing of their requirements was dependent on future events. The
Company has received accounting guidance from the Mississippi PSC allowing the continued accrual of
other future retirement costs for long-lived assets that the Company does not have a legal
obligation to retire. Accordingly, the accumulated removal costs for these obligations will
continue to be reflected in the balance sheets as a regulatory liability. Therefore, the Company
had no cumulative effect to net income resulting from the adoption of Statement No. 143 or
Interpretation No. 47.

The Company has retirement obligations related to various landfill sites and underground
storage tanks. In connection with the adoption of Interpretation No. 47, the Company also recorded
additional asset retirement obligations (and assets) of $9.5 million, primarily related to
asbestos. The Company has also identified retirement obligations related to certain transmission
and distribution facilities, co-generation facilities, certain wireless communication towers, and
certain structures authorized by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. However, liabilities
for the removal of these assets have not been recorded because the range of time over which the
Company may settle these obligations is unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated. The Company
will continue to recognize in the statements of income allowed removal costs in accordance with its
regulatory treatment. Any differences between costs recognized under Statement No. 143 and
Interpretation No. 47 and those reflected in rates are recognized as either a regulatory asset or
liability, as ordered by the Mississippi PSC, and are reflected in the balance sheets.

Details of the asset retirement obligations included in the balance sheets are as follows:

NOTES (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles

The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of
whether an impairment has occurred is based on either a specific regulatory disallowance or an
estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared to the carrying
value of the assets. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment recognized is
determined by either the amount of regulatory disallowance or by estimating the fair value of the
asset and recording a loss for the amount of the carrying value that is greater than the fair
value. For assets identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the estimated
fair value less the cost to sell in order to determine if an impairment provision is required.
Until the assets are disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or
events change.

Provision for Property Damage

The Company carries insurance for the cost of certain types of damage to generation plants and
general property. However, the Company is self-insured for the cost of storm, fire, and other
uninsured casualty damage to its property, including transmission and distribution facilities. As
permitted by the Mississippi PSC and the FERC, the Company accrues for the cost of such damage
through an annual expense accrual credited to a regulatory liability account. The cost of
repairing actual damage resulting from such events that individually exceed $50,000 is charged to
the reserve. The annual accruals may range from $1.5 million to $4.6 million with a maximum
reserve totaling $23 million. The Company accrued $1.5 million in 2005, $4.6 million in 2004, and
$2.5 million in 2003. See Note 3 under “Storm Damage Cost Recovery” for additional information
regarding the depletion of these reserves following Hurricane Katrina and the deferral of
additional costs, as well as additional rate riders or other cost recovery mechanisms which may be
approved by the Mississippi PSC to replenish these reserves.

Environmental Cost Recovery

The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling
and disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and
regulations, the Company may also incur substantial costs to clean up properties. The Company
has authority from the Mississippi PSC to recover approved environmental compliance costs
through retail rates. The Company filed its 2006 ECO Plan in February 2006, which if approved
as filed, is anticipated to result in a slight decrease in customer prices.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are considered cash
equivalents. Temporary cash investments are securities with original maturities of 90 days or
less.

Materials and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include the average cost of transmission, distribution, and
generating plant materials. Materials are charged to inventory when purchased and then expensed or
capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when installed or used.

Fuel Inventory

Fuel inventory includes the average costs of oil, coal, natural gas, and emission allowances. Fuel
is charged to inventory when purchased and then expensed as used. Emission allowances granted by
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are included in inventory at zero cost.

Stock Options

Southern Company provides non-qualified stock options to a large segment of the Company’s employees
ranging from line management to executives. The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation
plans in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25. Accordingly, no compensation
expense has been recognized because the exercise price of all options granted equaled the
fair-market value of Southern Company’s common stock on the date of grant. When options are
exercised, the Company receives a capital contribution from Southern Company equivalent to the
related income tax benefit.

Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to the prices of certain fuel
purchases and electricity purchases and sales. All derivative financial instruments are recognized
as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. Substantially all of the Company’s
bulk energy purchases and sales contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are exempt from
fair value accounting requirements and are accounted for under the accrual method. Other
derivative contracts qualify as cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions or are recoverable
through the Mississippi PSC approved fuel hedging program as discussed below. This results in the
deferral of related gains and losses in other comprehensive income or regulatory assets and
liabilities, respectively, as appropriate until the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness
arising from cash flow hedges is recognized currently in net income. Other derivative contracts
are marked to market through current period income and are recorded on a net basis in the
statements of income.

The Mississippi PSC has approved the Company’s request to implement an ECM which, among other
things, allows the Company to utilize financial instruments to hedge its fuel commitments. Changes
in the fair value of these financial instruments are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities.
Amounts paid or received as a result of financial settlement of these instruments are classified as
fuel expense and are included in the ECM factor applied to customer billings. The Company’s
jurisdictional wholesale customers have a similar ECM mechanism, which has been approved by the
FERC.

The Company is exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of
counterparties’ nonperformance. The Company has established controls to determine and monitor the
creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate the Company’s exposure to counterparty
credit risk.

Other financial instruments for which the carrying amount did not equal the fair value at
December 31 were as follows:

The fair values were based on either closing market price or closing price of comparable
instruments.

Comprehensive Income

The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of all changes in common stock equity
of an enterprise that result from transactions and other economic events of the period other than
transactions with owners. Comprehensive income consists of net income, changes in the fair value
of qualifying cash flow hedges and marketable securities and changes in additional minimum pension
liability, less income taxes, and reclassifications for amounts included in net income.

Variable Interest Entities

The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity must consolidate the related assets and
liabilities. The Company has established a wholly-owned trust established to issue preferred
securities. However, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the trust. Therefore, the
investments in this trust are reflected as Other Investments and the related loan from the trust
are reflected as Long-term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trust in the balance sheets. See Note 6
under “Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities/Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts” for
additional information.

2. RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company has a defined benefit, trusteed, pension plan covering substantially all employees.
The plan is funded in accordance with requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended (ERISA). In 2005, the plan was amended to provide an additional monthly
supplement to certain retirees. No contributions to the plan are expected for the year ending
December 31, 2006. The Company also provides certain non-qualified benefit plans for a selected
group of management and highly compensated employees. Benefits under these non-qualified plans are
funded on a cash basis. The Company provides certain medical care and life insurance benefits for
retired employees. In addition, trusts are funded to the extent required by the Mississippi PSC
and the FERC. For the year ending December 31, 2006, postretirement trust contributions are
expected to total approximately $260,000.

The measurement date for plan assets and obligations is September 30 of each year presented.

Pension Plans

The total accumulated benefit obligation for the pension plans was $235 million and $211 million
for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Changes during the year in the projected benefit obligations,
accumulated benefit obligations, and fair value of plan assets were as follows:

In the third quarter 2004, the Company prospectively adopted FASB Staff Position (FSP) 106-2,
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and
Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act). The Medicare Act provides a 28 percent prescription drug
subsidy for Medicare eligible retirees. FSP 106-2 requires recognition of the impacts of the
Medicare Act in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) and future cost of service
for postretirement medical plan. The effect of the subsidy reduced the Company’s expenses for the
six months ended December 31, 2004 and for the year ended December 31, 2005 by approximately $0.5
million and $1.2 million, respectively, and is expected to have a similar impact on future
expenses.

multiple asset classes.

An additional assumption used in measuring the APBO was a weighted average medical care cost
trend rate of 10.25 percent for 2005, decreasing gradually to 4.75 percent through the year 2014,
and remaining at that level thereafter. An annual increase or decrease in the assumed medical care
cost trend rate of one percent would affect the accumulated benefit obligation and the service and
interest cost components at December 31, 2005 as follows :

The Company provides a 75 percent matching contribution up to 6 percent of an employee’s base
salary. Total matching contributions made to the plan for 2005, 2004, and 2003 were $2.9 million,
$2.8 million, and $2.7 million, respectively.

3. CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY MATTERS

General Litigation Matters

The Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of
business. In addition, the Company’s business activities are subject to extensive governmental
regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation over environmental issues and
claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, and citizen enforcement of
environmental requirements such as opacity and other air quality standards, has increased generally
throughout the United States. In particular, personal injury claims for damages caused by alleged
exposure to hazardous materials have become more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such pending or
potential litigation against the Company cannot be predicted at this time; however management does
not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings would have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements.

II-272


NOTES (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Environmental Matters

New Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the EPA brought a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Georgia against certain Southern Company subsidiaries, including Alabama Power and
Georgia Power alleging that these subsidiaries had violated the New Source Review (NSR)
provisions of the Clean Air Act and related state laws at certain coal-fired generating
facilities. Through subsequent amendments and other legal procedures, the EPA added Savannah
Electric as a defendant to the original action and filed a separate action against Alabama Power
in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama after it was dismissed from the
original action. In these lawsuits, the EPA alleges that NSR violations occurred at eight
coal-fired generating facilities operated by Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Savannah
Electric, including three co-owned by the Company. The civil actions request penalties and
injunctive relief, including an order requiring the installation of the best available control
technology at the affected units. The EPA concurrently issued notices of violation relating to
the Company’s Plants Watson and Greene County. In early 2000, the EPA filed a motion to amend
its complaint to add the allegations in its notices of violation and to add the Company as a
defendant. However, in March 2001, the court denied the motion based on lack of jurisdiction
and the EPA has not refiled. On June 3, 2005, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District
of Alabama issued a decision in favor of Alabama Power on two primary legal issues in the case;
however, the decision does not resolve the case, nor does it address other legal issues
associated with the EPA’s allegations. In accordance with a separate court order, Alabama Power
and the EPA are currently participating in mediation with respect to the EPA’s claims. The
action against Georgia Power and Savannah Electric has been administratively closed since the
spring of 2001, and none of the parties has sought to reopen the case.

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act
authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $32,500 per day, per violation at each generating
unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in any one of these
matters could require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and
could possibly require payment of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of
operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated
rates.

Environmental Remediation

In 2003, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) designated the Company as a
potentially responsible party at a site in Texas. The site was owned by an electric transformer
company that handled the Company’s transformers as well as those of many other entities. The site
owner is now in bankruptcy and the State of Texas has entered into an agreement with the Company
and several other utilities to investigate and remediate the site. Amounts expensed during 2003,
2004, and 2005 related to this work were not material. Hundreds of entities have received notices
from the TCEQ requesting their participation in the anticipated site remediation. The final
outcome of this matter to the Company will depend upon further environmental assessment and the
ultimate number of potentially responsible parties and cannot now be determined. The remediation
expenses incurred by the Company are expected to be recovered through the Company’s ECO Plan.

FERC Matters

Market-Based Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates at market-based
prices. The Company also has FERC authority to make short-term opportunity sales at market rates.
Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a market-based contract with an
affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation
dominance within its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other
markets is not an issue in that proceeding. In February 2005, Southern Company submitted
responsive information. In February 2006, the FERC suspended the proceeding to allow the parties
to conduct settlement discussions. Any new market-based rate transactions in the Southern Company
retail service territory entered into after February 27, 2005 are subject to refund to the level
of

II-273


NOTES (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2005 Annual Report

the default cost-based rates, pending the outcome of the proceeding. The impact of such sales
to the Company through December 31, 2005 is not expected to exceed $5.7 million. The refund period covers 15 months. In the
event that the FERC’s default mitigation measures for entities that are found to have market power
are ultimately applied, the Company may be required to charge cost-based rates for certain
wholesale sales in the Southern Company retail service territory, which may be lower than
negotiated market-based rates. The final outcome of this matter will depend on the form in which
the final methodology for assessing generation market power and mitigation rules may be ultimately
adopted and cannot be determined at this time.

In addition, in May 2005, the FERC started an investigation to determine whether Southern
Company satisfies the other three parts of the FERC’s market-based rate analysis: transmission
market power, barriers to entry, and affiliate abuse or reciprocal dealing. The FERC established a
new refund period related to this expanded investigation. Any and all new market-based rate
transactions both inside and outside Southern Company’s retail service territory involving any
Southern Company subsidiary, including the Company, will be subject to refund to the extent the
FERC orders lower rates as a result of this new investigation, with the 15-month refund period
beginning July 19, 2005. The impact of such sales to the Company through December 31, 2005 is not
expected to exceed $7.4 million, of which $4.4 million relates to sales inside the service
territory as discussed above. The FERC also directed that this expanded proceeding be held in
abeyance pending the outcome of the proceeding on the IIC discussed below.

The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for this proceeding and is vigorously
defending itself in this matter. However, the final outcome of this matter, including any remedies
to be applied in the event of an adverse ruling in this proceeding, cannot now be determined.

Intercompany Interchange Contract

The Company’s generation fleet in its retail service territory is operated under the IIC, as
approved by the FERC. In May 2005, the FERC initiated a new proceeding to examine (1) the
provisions of the IIC among Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, the Company, Savannah
Electric, Southern Power, and SCS, as agent, under the terms of which the power pool of Southern
Company is operated and, in particular, the propriety of the continued inclusion of Southern Power
as a party to the IIC, (2) whether any parties to the IIC have violated the FERC’s standards of
conduct applicable to utility companies that are transmission providers, and (3) whether Southern
Company’s code of conduct defining Southern Power as a “system company” rather than a “marketing
affiliate” is just and reasonable. In connection with the formation of Southern Power, the FERC
authorized Southern Power’s inclusion in the IIC in 2000. The FERC also previously approved
Southern Company’s code of conduct. The FERC order directs that the administrative law judge who
presided over a proceeding involving approval of PPAs between Southern Power and Georgia Power and
Savannah Electric be assigned to preside over the hearing in this proceeding and that the testimony
and exhibits presented in that proceeding be preserved to the extent appropriate. Hearings are
scheduled for September 2006. Effective July 19, 2005, revenues from transactions under the IIC
involving any Southern Company subsidiary, including the Company, are subject to refund to the
extent the FERC orders any changes to the IIC.

The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for this proceeding and is vigorously
defending itself in this matter. However, the final outcome of this matter, including any remedies
to be applied in the event of an adverse ruling in this proceeding, cannot now be determined.

Generation Interconnection Agreements

In July 2003, the FERC issued its final rule on the standardization of generation
interconnection agreements and procedures (Order 2003). Order 2003 shifts much of the financial
burden of new transmission investment from the generator to the transmission provider. The FERC
has indicated that Order 2003, which was effective January 20, 2004, is to be applied
prospectively to interconnection agreements. The impact of Order 2003 and its subsequent
rehearings on the Company and the final results of these matters cannot be determined at this
time.

II-274


NOTES (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Right of Way Litigation

Southern Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including the Company, Georgia Power, Gulf Power,
and Southern Telecom, have been named as defendants in numerous lawsuits brought by landowners
since 2001. The plaintiffs’ lawsuits claim that defendants may not use, or sublease to third
parties, some or all of the fiber optic communications lines on the rights of way that cross the
plaintiffs’ properties and that such actions exceed the easements or other property rights held by
defendants.

To date, the Company has entered into agreements with plaintiffs in approximately 90 percent
of the actions pending against the Company to clarify the Company’s easement rights in the State of
Mississippi. These agreements have been approved by the Circuit Courts of Harrison County and
Jasper County, Mississippi (First Judicial Circuit) and dismissals of the related cases are in
progress. These agreements have not had any material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

In addition, in late 2001, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company, including Alabama
Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, the Company, Savannah Electric, and Southern Telecom, were
named as defendants in a lawsuit brought by a telecommunications company that uses certain of
the defendants’ rights of way. This lawsuit alleges, among other things, that the defendants
are contractually obligated to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the telecommunications
company from any liability that may be assessed against it in pending and future right of way
litigation. The Company believes that the plaintiff’s claims are without merit. In the fall of
2004, the trial court stayed the case until resolution of the underlying landowner litigation
discussed above. In January 2005, the Georgia Court of Appeals dismissed the telecommunications
company’s appeal of the trial court’s order for lack of jurisdiction. An adverse outcome in
this matter, combined with an adverse outcome against the telecommunications company in one or
more of the right of way lawsuits, could result in substantial judgments; however, the final
outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.

Retail Regulatory Matters

Performance Evaluation Plan

The Company’s retail base rates are set under Performance Evaluation Plan (PEP), a rate plan
approved by the Mississippi PSC. PEP was designed with the objective that PEP would reduce the
impact of rate changes on the customer and provide incentives for the Company to keep customer
prices low and customer satisfaction and reliability high. PEP is a mechanism for rate adjustments
based on three indicators: price, customer satisfaction, and service reliability.

In May 2004, the Mississippi PSC approved the Company’s request to modify certain portions of
its PEP and to reclassify, to jurisdictional cost of service the 266 megawatts of Plant Daniel
Units 3 and 4 capacity, effective January 1, 2004. The Mississippi PSC authorized the Company to
include the related costs and revenue credits in jurisdictional rate base, cost of service, and
revenue requirement calculations for purposes of retail rate recovery. The Company is amortizing
the regulatory liability established pursuant to the Mississippi PSC’s interim December 2003
accounting order, as approved in the May 2004 order, to earnings as follows: $16.5 million in 2004,
$25.1 million in 2005, $13.0 million in 2006, and $5.7 million in 2007, resulting in increases to
earnings in each of those years.

In addition, the Mississippi PSC also approved the Company’s requested changes to PEP,
including the use of a forward-looking test year, with appropriate oversight; annual, rather
than semi-annual, filings; and certain changes to the performance indicator mechanisms. Rate
changes will be limited to four percent of retail revenues annually under the revised PEP. The
Mississippi PSC will review all aspects of PEP in 2007. PEP will remain in effect until the
Mississippi PSC modifies, suspends, or terminates the plan.

In December 2005, the Company submitted its annual PEP filing to the Mississippi PSC.
Ordinarily, PEP limits annual rate increases to 4 percent; however, the Company has requested
that the Mississippi PSC approve a temporary change to allow them to exceed this cap as a result
of the ongoing effects of Hurricane Katrina. The Company has requested a 5 percent increase in
total retail revenues or $32 million retail base revenue increase to become

effective in April 2006 if approved. Hearings are scheduled for March 2, 2006. The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Environmental Compliance Overview Plan

The Company’s Environmental Compliance Overview (ECO) Plan establishes procedures to facilitate the
Mississippi PSC’s overview of the Company’s environmental strategy and provides for recovery of
costs (including cost of capital) associated with environmental projects approved by the
Mississippi PSC. Under the ECO Plan, any increase in the annual revenue requirement is limited to
two percent of retail revenues. However, the ECO Plan also provides for carryover of any amount
over the two percent limit into the next year’s revenue requirement. The Company conducts studies,
when possible, to determine the extent of any required environmental remediation. Should such
remediation be determined to be probable, reasonable estimates of costs to clean up such sites are
developed and recognized in the financial statements. In accordance with the Mississippi PSC
order, the Company recovers such costs under the ECO Plan as they are incurred. The Company’s 2005
ECO Plan filing was approved, as filed, by the Mississippi PSC on April 18, 2005 and resulted in a
slight increase in rates effective May 2005.

Storm Damage Cost Recovery

The Company maintains a reserve to cover the cost of damages from major storms to its transmission
and distribution lines and the cost of uninsured damages to its generation facilities and other
property. The Company’s current annual accrual to the provision for property damage, as approved
by the Mississippi PSC, is $1.5 million to $4.6 million.

In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast of the United States and caused
significant damage within the Company’s service area. The Company sustained significant damage to
its distribution and transmission facilities. The Company’s Plant Watson was also damaged. Plant
Watson has six generating units, including three gas-fire units totaling 262 megawatts (MW), two
coal-fired units totaling 750 MW, and a 40 MW gas turbine. Both of the coal-fired units at the
plant have been returned to service. The gas units operate primarily to serve summer peak loads.
Repairs to the gas units are expected to be completed by June 1, 2006.

Prior to Hurricane Katrina, the Company had a balance of approximately $3 million in its
property reserve. Incremental Hurricane Katrina restoration costs are currently estimated to total
approximately $277 million, net of approximately $68 million of insurance proceeds. Restoration
efforts following Hurricane Katrina are ongoing for approximately 19,200 of the Company’s customers
who remain unable to receive power, as well as to make permanent improvements in areas where
temporary emergency repairs were necessary. In addition, business and governmental authorities are
still reviewing redevelopment plans for portions of the most severely damaged areas along the
Mississippi shoreline. The ultimate impact of redevelopment plans in these areas on the cost
estimates cannot now be determined.

The Mississippi PSC issued an Interim Accounting Order on October 21, 2005, requiring the
Company to recognize a regulatory asset in an amount equal to the retail portion of the recorded
Hurricane Katrina restoration costs, including both operation and maintenance expenditures and
capital related expenditures. Total Hurricane Katrina costs incurred through December 31, 2005
include approximately $132.6 million of operations and maintenance expenditures and approximately
$148.8 million of capital-related expenditures. The cash portions are included in the Statement of
Cash Flow under Hurricane Katrina Accounts Payable, Property Additions, and Cost of Removal, net of
Salvage and totaled approximately $82.1 million, $81.7 million, and $18.4 million, respectively.
On December 7, 2005 the Company filed with the Mississippi PSC a detailed review of all Hurricane
Katrina restoration costs as required in the Interim Accounting Order. The Company is currently
working with the Mississippi PSC to establish a method to recover all such prudently incurred costs
upon resolution of uncertainties related to proposed state legislation to allow securitized
financing and federal grant assistance.

5. INCOME TAXES

Southern Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return and combined
income tax returns for the State of Alabama and the State of Mississippi. Under a joint
consolidated income tax allocation agreement, each subsidiary’s current and deferred tax expense
is computed on a stand-alone basis and no subsidiary is allocated more expense than would be
paid if they filed a separate income tax return. In accordance with Internal Revenue Service
regulations, each company is jointly and severally liable for the tax liability.

At December 31, 2005, the tax-related regulatory assets and liabilities were $10.4 million and
$20.6 million, respectively. These assets are attributable to tax benefits flowed through to
customers in prior years and to taxes applicable to capitalized interest. These liabilities are
attributable to deferred taxes previously recognized at rates higher than current enacted tax law
and to unamortized investment tax credits.

Mississippi Power Company 2005 Annual Report

In accordance with regulatory requirements, deferred investment tax credits are amortized over
the lives of the related property with such amortization normally applied as a credit to reduce
depreciation in the statements of income. Credits amortized in this manner amounted to $1.2
million in each year presented. At December 31, 2005, all investment tax credits available to
reduce federal income taxes payable had been utilized.

6. FINANCING

Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities/ Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trust

The Company has formed a wholly-owned trust subsidiary for the purpose of issuing preferred
securities. The proceeds of the related equity investment and preferred security sale were loaned
back to the Company through the issuance of junior subordinated notes totaling $36 million, which
constitute substantially all assets of the trust and are reflected in the balance sheets as
Long-term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trust (including Securities Due Within One Year). The Company
considers that the mechanisms and obligations relating to the preferred securities issued for its
benefit, taken together, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by it of the trust’s payment
obligations with respect to these securities. At December 31, 2005, preferred securities of $35
million were outstanding. See Note 1 under “Variable Interest Entities” for additional information
on the accounting treatment for the trust and the related securities.

Pollution Control Bonds

Pollution control obligations represent loans to the Company from public authorities of funds
derived from sales by such authorities of revenue bonds issued to finance pollution control
facilities. The Company is required to make payments sufficient for authorities to meet principal
and interest requirements of such bonds. The amount of tax-exempt pollution control revenue bonds
outstanding at December 31, 2005 was $82.7 million.

Assets Subject to Lien

In June 2005, the Company’s first mortgage bond indenture was defeased. In December 2005, the
remaining outstanding first mortgage bonds were retired by the first mortgage bond trustee. As a
result, there are no longer any liens on the Company’s property and the Company no longer has to
comply with the covenants and restrictions of the first mortgage bond indenture.

Bank Credit Arrangements

At the beginning of 2006, the Company had total committed credit agreements with banks for
approximately $326 million, and $276 million remained unused. Of the total, $101 million expires
in 2006 and $225 million in 2008. The Company expects to renew its credit facilities, as needed,
prior to expiration. Some of the 2006 agreements allow short-term borrowings to be converted into
term loans.

In connection with these credit arrangements, the Company agrees to pay commitment fees based
on the unused portions of the commitments or to maintain compensating balances with the banks.
Commitment fees are 1/8 of 1 percent or less for the Company. Compensating balances are not
legally restricted from withdrawal.

This $276 million in unused credit arrangements provides required liquidity support to the
Company’s borrowings through a commercial paper program. At December 31, 2005, the Company had
$152 million outstanding in commercial notes. The credit arrangements also provide support to the
Company’s variable daily rate tax-exempt pollution control bonds totaling $40 million.

II-278


NOTES (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2005 Annual Report

During 2005, the peak amount outstanding for short-term debt was $154 million and the average
amount outstanding was $42 million. The average annual interest rate on short-term debt was 3.85 percent
in 2005.

Financial Instruments

The Company also enters into energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, gas, and
other fuel price changes. However, due to cost-based rate regulations, the Company has limited
exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity. The Company has
implemented fuel-hedging programs with the approval of the Mississippi PSC. The Company enters
into hedges of forward electricity sales. There was no material ineffectiveness recorded in
earnings in 2005, 2004, or 2003.

In addition, at the instruction of the Mississippi PSC, the Company has implemented a
fuel-hedging program. At December 31, 2005, exposure from these activities was not material to the
Company’s financial statements.

At December 31, 2005, the fair value of derivative energy contracts was reflected in the
financial statements as follows:

The fair value gains or losses for cash flow hedges are recorded as regulatory assets and
liabilities if they are recoverable through the regulatory clauses, otherwise they are recorded in
other comprehensive income, and are recognized in earnings at the same time the hedged items affect
earnings. For the year 2006, approximately $0.3 million of pre-tax losses are expected to be
reclassified from other comprehensive income to fuel expense. The Company has energy-related
hedges in place up to and including 2008.

COMMITMENTS

Construction Program

The Company is engaged in continuous construction programs, currently estimated to total $126
million in 2006, of which $30 million is related to Hurricane Katrina restoration, $112 million in
2007, and $139 million in 2008. The construction program is subject to periodic review and
revision, and actual construction costs may vary from the above estimates because of numerous
factors. These factors include changes in business conditions; acquisition of additional
generation assets; revised load growth estimates; changes in environmental regulations; changes in
FERC rules and transmission regulations; increasing costs of labor, equipment and materials; and
cost of capital. At December 31, 2005, significant purchase commitments were outstanding in
connection with the construction program. The Company has no generating plants under construction.
Capital improvements to generating, transmission, and distribution facilities, including those to
meet environmental standards, will continue.

Long-Term Service Agreements

The Company has entered into a Long-Term Service Agreement (LTSA) with General Electric (GE) for
the purpose of securing maintenance support for the leased combined cycle units at Plant Daniel.
The LTSA provides that GE will perform all planned inspections on the covered equipment, which
includes the cost of all labor and materials. GE is also obligated to cover the costs of unplanned
maintenance on the covered equipment subject to a limit specified in the contract.

In general, the LTSA is in effect through two major inspection cycles of the units. Scheduled
payments to GE are made monthly based on estimated operating hours of the units and are recognized
as expense based on actual hours of operation. The Company has recognized $7.9 million, $9.0
million, and $6.0 million for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, which is included in maintenance
expense in the statements of income. Remaining payments to GE under this agreement are currently
estimated to total $152 million over the next 12 years. However, the LTSA contains various
cancellation provisions at the option of the Company.

II-279


NOTES (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2005 Annual Report

The Company also has entered into a LTSA with ABB Power Generation Inc. (ABB) for the purpose
of securing maintenance support for its Chevron Unit 5 combustion turbine plant. In summary, the
LTSA stipulates that ABB will perform all planned maintenance on the covered equipment, which
includes the cost of all labor and materials. ABB is also obligated to cover the costs of
unplanned maintenance on the covered equipment subject to a limit specified in the contract.

In general, this LTSA is in effect through two major inspection cycles. Scheduled payments
to ABB are made at various intervals based on actual operating hours of the unit. Payments to ABB
under this agreement are currently estimated to total $3.0 million over the remaining term of the
agreement, which is approximately fifteen months. However, the LTSA contains various cancellation
provisions at the option of the Company. Payments made to ABB prior to the performance of any
planned maintenance are recorded as a prepayment in the balance sheets. Inspection costs are
capitalized or charged to expense based on the nature of the work performed.

Fuel Commitments

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of the generating plants, the Company has entered
into various long-term commitments for the procurement of fuel. In most cases, these contracts
contain provisions for price escalations, minimum purchase levels, and other financial
commitments. Coal commitments include forward contract purchases for sulfur dioxide emission
allowances. Natural gas purchase commitments contain given volumes with prices based on various
indices at the time of delivery. Amounts included in the chart below represent estimates based on
New York Mercantile Exchange future prices at December 31, 2005. Total estimated minimum
long-term obligations at December 31, 2005 were as follows:

SCS may enter into various types of wholesale energy and natural gas contracts acting as an
agent for the Company and the other retail operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern
Company Gas. Under these agreements, each of the retail operating companies, Southern Power, and
Southern Company Gas may be jointly and severally liable. The creditworthiness of Southern Power
and Southern Company Gas is currently inferior to the creditworthiness of the retail operating
companies. Accordingly, Southern Company has entered into keep-well agreements with the Company
and each of the other retail operating companies to insure they will not subsidize or be
responsible for any costs, losses, liabilities, or damages resulting from the inclusion of
Southern Power or Southern Company Gas as a contracting party under these agreements.

Operating Leases

Railcar Leases

The Company and Gulf Power have jointly entered into operating lease agreements for the use of 745
aluminum railcars. The Company has the option to purchase the railcars at the greater of lease
termination value or fair market value, or to renew the leases at the end of the lease term. The
Company also has multiple operating lease agreements for the use of an additional 120 aluminum
railcars that do not contain a purchase option. All of these leases are for the transport of coal
to Plant Daniel.

The Company’s share (50 percent) of the leases, charged to fuel stock and recovered through
the fuel cost recovery clause, was $3.0 million in 2005 and $1.9 million in 2004 and 2003. The
Company’s annual lease payments for 2006 through 2010 will average approximately $3.2 million and
after 2011, lease payments total in aggregate approximately $4.2 million.

In addition to railcar leases, the Company has other operating leases for fuel handling
equipment at Plants Daniel and Watson. The Company’s share (50 percent at Plant Daniel and 100
percent at Plant Watson) of these leases was charged to fuel handling expense in the amount of
$611,000 in 2005. The Company’s annual lease payments for 2006 through 2010 will average
approximately $693,000 and after 2011, lease payments total in aggregate approximately $52,000.

Plant Daniel Combined Cycle Generating Units

In May 2001, the Company began the initial 10-year term of the lease agreement for a 1,064
megawatt natural gas combined cycle generating facility built at Plant Daniel (Facility). The
Company entered into this transaction during a period when retail access was under review by the
Mississippi PSC. The lease arrangement provided a lower cost alternative to its cost based rate
regulated customers than a traditional rate base asset. See Note 3 under “Retail Regulatory
Matters – Performance Evaluation Plan” for a description of the Company’s formula rate plan.

In 2003, the Facility was acquired by Juniper Capital L.P. (Juniper), whose partners are
unaffiliated with the Company. Simultaneously, Juniper entered into a restructured lease
agreement with the Company. Juniper has also entered into leases with other parties unrelated to
the Company. The assets leased by the Company comprise less than 50 percent of Juniper’s assets.
The Company is not required to consolidate the leased assets and related liabilities, and the
lease with Juniper is considered an operating lease. The lease agreement is treated as an
operating lease for accounting purposes, as well as for both retail and wholesale rate recovery
purposes. For income tax purposes, the Company retains tax ownership. The initial lease term
ends in 2011 and the lease includes a purchase and renewal option based on the cost of the
Facility at the inception of the lease, which was $370 million. The Company is required to
amortize approximately four percent of the initial acquisition cost over the initial lease term.
Eighteen months prior to the end of the initial lease, the Company may elect to renew for 10
years. If the lease is renewed, the agreement calls for the Company to amortize an additional 17
percent of the initial completion cost over the renewal period. Upon termination of the lease, at
the Company’s option, it may either exercise its purchase option or the Facility can be sold to a
third party.

The lease provides for a residual value guarantee, approximately 73 percent of the
acquisition cost, by the Company that is due upon termination of the lease in the event that the
Company does not renew the lease or purchase the Facility and that the fair market value is less
than the unamortized cost of the Facility. A liability of approximately $11 million and $13
million for the fair market value of this residual value guarantee is included in the balance
sheets at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In 2003, approximately $11 million in lease
termination costs and were included in other operation expense. Lease expenses were $27 million,
$27 million, and $26 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

SAVANNAH ELECTRIC AND POWER COMPANY

FINANCIAL SECTION

II-286


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Savannah Electric and Power Company:

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements of capitalization of Savannah
Electric and Power Company (the “Company”) (a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company) as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common
stockholder’s equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2005. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control
over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An
audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements (pages II-306 to II-329) present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Savannah Electric and Power Company at December 31,
2005 and 2004, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America.

As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, on December 13, 2005, the Company’s Board
approved the merger with Georgia Power Company, subject to regulatory approval.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2005 Annual Report

OVERVIEW

Business Activities

Savannah Electric and Power Company (the Company) operates as a vertically integrated utility
providing electricity to retail customers within its traditional service area of southeastern
Georgia.

Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Company’s business of
selling electricity. These factors include the Company’s ability to maintain a stable regulatory
environment, to achieve energy sales growth while containing costs, and to recover rising costs.
These costs include those related to growing demand, increasingly stringent environmental
standards, and rising fuel prices. In 2005, the Company completed a retail base rate case and a
retail fuel cost recovery rate case. These regulatory actions are expected to benefit future
earnings stability, to help enable the recovery of substantial capital investments in generating
plant, to facilitate the continued reliability of the transmission and distribution network, and to
allow for the recovery of increasing fuel costs. In connection with the merger, as discussed
below, additional rate actions are expected to be completed in 2006.

Merger with Georgia Power

On December 13, 2005, the Company entered into a merger agreement with Georgia Power Company
(Georgia Power) under which the Company will merge into Georgia Power, with Georgia Power
continuing as the surviving corporation (the Merger). The Merger must be approved by Savannah
Electric’s preferred shareholders and is subject to the receipt of regulatory approval of the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC), and the
Federal Communications Commission. Pending regulatory approvals, the Merger is expected to occur
by July 2006. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “PSC Matters — Merger” herein and Note 3 under
“Retail Regulatory Matters — Merger” for additional information.

Key Performance Indicators

In striving to maximize shareholder value while providing cost effective energy to more than
147,000 customers, the Company focuses on several key indicators. These indicators include
customer satisfaction, plant availability, system reliability, and net income. The Company’s
financial success is directly tied to the satisfaction of its customers. Key elements of ensuring
customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high reliability, and competitive prices.
Management uses customer satisfaction surveys and reliability indicators to evaluate the Company’s
results.

Peak season equivalent forced outage rate (Peak Season EFOR) is an indicator of plant
availability and efficient generation fleet operations during the months when generation needs are
greatest. The rate is calculated by dividing the number of hours of forced outages by total
generation hours. Peak Season EFOR excludes the impact of hurricanes and certain outage events
caused by manufacturer defects. Transmission and distribution system reliability performance is
measured by the frequency and duration of outages. Performance targets for reliability are set
internally based on historical performance, normal weather conditions, and expected capital
expenditures. The 2005 performance was on target on these reliability measures. Net income is the
primary component of the Company’s contribution to Southern Company’s earnings per share goal.

The Company’s 2005 results compared to its targets for some of its key indicators are
reflected in the following chart.

The failure to achieve top quartile in customer satisfaction is believed to have been the
result of three rate increases since November 2004, which was a significant consideration in the
Merger decision. The financial performance and Peak Season EFOR achieved in 2005 reflect the focus
management places on these indicators, as well as the commitment shown by the Company’s employees
in achieving or exceeding management’s expectations.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Earnings

The Company’s net income after preferred stock dividends for 2005 totaled $29.9 million,
representing an increase of $5.7 million, or 23.5 percent, from the prior year. Higher operating
revenues resulting from the base rate increase in June 2005, as well as increases in transmission
revenues and other income were somewhat offset by higher operating expenses and higher interest
expense resulting from additional securities outstanding and higher interest rates. Earnings were
$24.2 million in 2004, reflecting an increase of $0.8 million, or 3.3 percent, from the prior year.
Higher operating revenues from customer growth were somewhat offset by higher operating expenses
and higher interest expenses resulting from additional securities outstanding. In 2003, earnings
were $23.5 million, representing an increase of $2.1 million, or 10.0 percent, from the prior year.
Higher operating revenues, lower depreciation and amortization expenses, and lower interest
expenses were somewhat offset by higher operating expenses and income taxes.

Total operating revenues for 2005 were $445.0 million, reflecting a 24.7 percent increase
when compared to 2004. Retail revenues increased 23.3 percent, or $79.8 million, in 2005,
increased 14.4 percent, or $43.0 million, in 2004, and increased 5.5 percent, or $15.6 million, in
2003. On May 17, 2005, the Georgia PSC approved a new three-year retail rate plan for the Company
ending May 31, 2008 (2005 Retail Rate Plan). Retail base rates also increased in June 2002. See
Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters — Rate Plans” for additional
information.

Electric rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, the
energy component of purchased power costs, and certain other costs. Under the fuel recovery
provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses—including the fuel component of purchased
energy—and do not affect net income. The Georgia PSC approved a Fuel Cost Recovery (FCR) rate
increase that became effective in December 2005. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “PSC Matters —
Fuel Cost Recovery” herein and Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements under “Fuel Costs” and
“Retail Regulatory Matters —Fuel Cost Recovery,” respectively, for additional information.

Revenues from sales to non-affiliated utilities are primarily energy related. These sales do

significant impact on net income since the energy is generally sold at variable cost.

Sales to affiliated companies vary from year to year depending on demand and the availability
and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliated sales are made in accordance
with the Intercompany Interchange Contract (IIC), as approved by the FERC. These energy sales do
not have a significant impact on earnings since the energy is generally sold at variable cost.

Energy Sales

Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the amount of energy sold each year. Kilowatt-hour

In 2005, residential and commercial energy sales increased from the prior year primarily
due to continued customer growth and favorable weather conditions. Industrial sales were lower as
compared to the prior year due to lower usage by several industrial customers resulting from
cogeneration, plant outages, and reductions in production.

In 2004, residential and commercial energy sales increased from the prior year primarily due
to continued customer growth. Industrial sales were lower than the prior year because of lower
usage by several industrial customers due to cogeneration and cutbacks in production.

In 2003, residential sales decreased from the prior year primarily due to weather-related
demand. Industrial sales were higher than the prior year because of an increase in usage by
several industrial customers, reflecting the beginning of an economic recovery from the previous
two-year slowdown. All three customer classes benefited from continued customer growth.

Energy sales to retail customers are projected to increase at a compound average growth rate
of 2.4 percent during the period 2006 through 2010.

Expenses

Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses

Fuel and purchased power costs constitute the single largest expense for the Company. The mix of
energy supply is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the
availability and cost of generation units.

The amount and sources of generation, the average cost of fuel per net KWH generated, and the
amount and average cost of purchased power were as follows:

Fuel expense increased 90.3 percent in 2005 as compared to 2004 due to a 58.4 percent increase
in the average cost of fuel per net KWH generated and a 20.3 percent increase in generation due to
the commercial operation of the Plant McIntosh Combined Cycle Units 10 and 11 in June 2005. In
2004, fuel expense increased 0.2 percent over the prior year due to a 9.2 percent increase in the
average cost of fuel per net KWH generated that more than offset an 8.2 percent decrease in
generation. In 2003, fuel expense increased 1.7 percent as compared to the prior year due to a
slight increase in generation offset somewhat by a lower cost of coal.

Purchased power expense increased $20.6 million, or

II-290


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2005 Annual Report

16.4 percent, in 2005 as compared to 2004 resulting from the increases in fuel costs which drove
higher energy costs. In 2004, purchased power expense increased $36.2 million, or 40.4 percent
over the prior year due to increased energy demands and higher energy costs. In 2003, purchased
power expense increased $13.9 million, or 18.4 percent, over the prior year due to increased energy
demands and a purchased power agreement (PPA) between the Company and Southern Power for energy and
capacity from Plant Wansley Units 6 and 7 which began in June 2002.

A significant upward trend in the cost of coal and natural gas has emerged since 2003, and
volatility in these markets is expected to continue. Increased coal prices have been influenced by
a worldwide increase in demand as a result of rapid economic growth in China as well as increased
mining costs. Higher natural gas prices in the United States are the result of increased demand
and slightly lower gas supplies despite increased drilling activity. Natural gas supply
interruptions, such as those caused by the 2004 and 2005 hurricanes result in an immediate market
response; however, the long-term impact of this price volatility may be reduced by imports of
natural gas and liquefied natural gas. Fuel expenses generally do not affect net income, since
they are offset by fuel revenues under the Company’s fuel cost recovery provisions.

Other Operating Expenses

Other operation and maintenance expenses increased $7.0 million, or 8.2 percent, in 2005 over the
prior year primarily due to increases of $4.0 million in production expenses related to scheduled
maintenance outages at both Plant Kraft and Plant McIntosh, $1.4 million in transmission expenses
related in part to a transformer failure and new transmission facilities agreements, $0.6 million
in distribution expenses related to tree trimming, and increases of $0.5 million in administrative
and general expenses primarily related to employee benefits expenses and Sarbanes-Oxley related
accounting activities, offset partially by a decrease of $0.7 million in the storm damage accrual
as ordered in the 2005 Retail Rate Plan.

In 2004, other operation and maintenance expenses increased $2.3 million, or 2.8 percent over
the prior year, as a result of a $2.8 million increase in administrative and general expenses,
primarily relating to accounting and auditing services and employee benefits expense, and a $0.6
million increase in distribution expenses partially offset by a decrease of $1.4 million in
maintenance expense due to a scheduled turbine maintenance outage at Plant Kraft in 2003.

In 2003, other operation and maintenance expenses increased $2.6 million, or 3.2 percent, over
the prior year. Administrative and general expenses increased by $1.0 million primarily due to
increases in accounting and auditing services, insurance reserves, and employee benefits expense,
somewhat offset by the annual true-up in billings to Georgia Power for charges associated with the
jointly owned combustion turbines at the Company’s Plant McIntosh. Maintenance expense increased
$1.5 million primarily due to a scheduled turbine maintenance outage at Plant Kraft and higher
transmission and distribution maintenance expenses.

Depreciation and amortization increased $1.2 million, or 5.4 percent, in 2005 over the prior
year due to the completion of the amortization of the regulatory liability for accelerated
depreciation in May 2005 in accordance with the 2002 Georgia PSC rate order and the addition of the
McIntosh combined cycle facilities in June 2005 partially offset by lowering the composite
depreciation rate as part of the 2005 Retail Rate Plan. In 2004, depreciation and amortization
increased $0.8 million, or 3.7 percent, from the prior year due to an increase in depreciable
property. Depreciation and amortization decreased $2.2 million, or 9.7 percent, in 2003 from the
prior year primarily as a result of discontinuing accelerated depreciation and beginning
amortization of the related regulatory liability in June 2002. See Note 3 to the financial
statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters” for additional information.

Other Income (Expense), Net

Other income increased in 2005 over the prior year as a result of a $2.6 million gain on the
settlement of gas hedges, as allowed by the Georgia PSC, and a $2.5 million disallowance of Plant
McIntosh construction costs recorded in December 2004. These increases were partially offset by
$0.9 million in expenses associated with the Company’s non-qualified benefit plans in connection
with the Merger. In 2004, other income decreased over the prior year due to the Plant McIntosh
disallowance. Other income increased in 2003 over the prior year as a result of a distribution of
the proceeds

from the sale of a mutual life insurance company in which the Company held policies used to fund
its non-qualified benefit plans. See Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements under “Retail
Regulatory Matters — Fuel Hedging Program” and — “Plant McIntosh Construction Project” for
additional information.

Non-Operating Expenses

In 2005, interest expense and preferred dividends increased $3.9 million, or 29.0 percent, over the
prior year due to the issuance of senior notes and preferred stock in 2004, as well as an increase
in short-term borrowings and higher interest rates. Interest expense and preferred dividends
increased $4.0 million, or 41.3 percent, in 2004 over the prior year primarily related to an
increase in senior notes and preferred stock outstanding. These increases were partially offset by
a decrease in distributions on mandatorily redeemable preferred securities due to the redemption of
$40 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities. Interest expense decreased $2.0
million, or 17.4 percent, in 2003 from the prior year primarily as a result of a lower principal
amount of debt outstanding during the year. Lower interest rates also contributed to lower
expenses in 2003. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY — “Financing Activities” herein for
additional information.

Effects of Inflation

The Company is subject to rate regulation that is based on the recovery of historical costs. In
addition, the income tax laws are based on historical costs. Therefore, inflation creates an
economic loss because the Company is recovering its costs of investments in dollars that have less
purchasing power. While the inflation rate has been relatively low in recent years, it continues
to have an adverse effect on the Company because of the large investment in utility plant with long
economic lives. Conventional accounting for historical cost does not recognize this economic loss
nor the partially offsetting gain that arises through financing facilities with fixed-money
obligations such as long-term debt and preferred stock. Any recognition of inflation by regulatory
authorities is reflected in the rate of return allowed in the Company’s approved electric rates.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL

General

The Company operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electricity to retail customers
within the traditional service area of southeastern Georgia. Prices for electricity provided by
the Company to retail customers are set by the Georgia PSC under cost-based regulatory principles.
Prices for electricity relating to jointly owned generating facilities, interconnecting
transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power are set by the FERC. Retail rates and
earnings are reviewed and may be adjusted periodically within certain limitations. See ACCOUNTING
POLICIES — “Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates — Electric Utility
Regulation” herein and Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters” and
“FERC Matters” for additional information about these and other regulatory matters.

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of future
earnings potential. The level of the Company’s future earnings depends on numerous factors. These
factors include the Company’s ability to maintain a stable regulatory environment that continues to
allow for the recovery of all prudently incurred costs. Future earnings in the near term will
depend, in part, upon growth in energy sales, which is subject to a number of factors. These
factors include weather, competition, energy conservation practiced by customers, the price of
electricity, the price elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic growth in the Company’s
service area.

Environmental Matters

New Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil action in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against certain Southern Company
subsidiaries, including Alabama Power and Georgia Power, alleging that these subsidiaries had
violated the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act and related state laws at
certain coal-fired generating facilities. Through subsequent amendments and other legal
procedures, the EPA added the Company as a defendant to the original action and filed a separate
action against Alabama Power in the U.S. District

II-292


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Court for the Northern District of Alabama after it was dismissed from the original action. In
these lawsuits, the EPA alleges that NSR violations occurred at eight coal-fired generating
facilities including the Company’s Plant Kraft. The civil actions request penalties and
injunctive relief, including an order requiring the installation of the best available control
technology at the affected units. On June 3, 2005, the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Alabama issued a decision in favor of Alabama Power on two primary legal issues in
the case; however, the decision does not resolve the case, nor does it address other legal
issues associated with the EPA’s allegations. In accordance with a separate court order,
Alabama Power and the EPA are currently participating in mediation with respect to the EPA’s
claims. The action against Georgia Power and the Company has been administratively closed since
the spring of 2001, and none of the parties has sought to reopen the case. See Note 3 to the
financial statements under “Environmental Matters — New Source Review Actions” for additional
information.

The Company believes it complied with applicable laws and the EPA’s regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act
authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $32,500 per day, per violation at each generating
unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in this matter could
require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly
require payment of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of operations, cash
flows, and possibly financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

In December 2002 and October 2003, the EPA issued final revisions to its NSR regulations under
the Clean Air Act. A coalition of states and environmental organizations filed petitions for
review of these regulations. On June 24, 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit upheld, in part, the EPA’s December 2002 revisions to its NSR regulations, which
included changes to the regulatory exclusions and methods of calculating emissions increases.
However, the court vacated portions of those revisions, including those addressing the exclusion of
certain pollution control projects. The October 2003 revisions, which clarified the scope of the
existing Routine Maintenance, Repair and Replacement exclusion, have been stayed by the Court of
Appeals pending its review of the rules. On October 20, 2005, the EPA also published a proposed
rule clarifying the test for determining when an emissions increase subject to the NSR requirements
has occurred. The impact of these revisions and proposed rules will depend on adoption of the
final rules by the EPA and the individual state implementation of such rules, as well as the
outcome of any additional legal challenges, and, therefore, cannot be determined at this time.

Carbon Dioxide Litigation

In July 2004, attorneys general from eight states, each outside of Southern Company’s service
territory, and the corporation counsel for New York City filed a complaint in the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York against Southern Company and four other electric power
companies. A nearly identical complaint was filed by three environmental groups in the same court.
The complaints allege that the companies’ emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas,
contribute to global warming, which the plaintiffs assert is a public nuisance. Under common law
public and private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs seek a judicial order (1) holding each
defendant jointly and severally liable for creating, contributing to, and/or maintaining global
warming and (2) requiring each of the defendants to cap its emissions of carbon dioxide and then
reduce those emissions by a specified percentage each year for at least a decade. Plaintiffs have
not, however, requested that damages be awarded in connection with their claims. Southern Company
believes these claims are without merit and notes that the complaint cites no statutory or
regulatory basis for the claims. In September 2005, the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York granted Southern Company and the other defendants’ motions to dismiss these
cases. The plaintiffs filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on
October 19, 2005. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Environmental Statutes and Regulations

General

The Company’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by state and federal environmental
agencies under a variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental media, including air,
water, and land resources. Applicable statutes include the Clean Air Act; Clean Water Act; the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act; the Resource

II-293


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Conservation and Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Emergency Planning &
Community Right-to-Know Act; and the Endangered Species Act. Compliance with these environmental
requirements involves significant capital and operating costs, a major portion of which is
expected to be recovered through existing ratemaking provisions. Through 2005, the Company had
invested approximately $10.8 million in capital projects to comply with these requirements, with
annual totals of $1.5 million, $3.4 million, and $0.7 million for 2003, 2004, and 2005,
respectively. Over the next decade, the Company expects that capital expenditures to assure
compliance with existing and new regulations could exceed an additional $31.2 million, including
$0.6 million and $4.5 million for 2006 and 2008, respectively. Because the Company’s compliance
strategy is impacted by changes to existing environmental laws and regulations, the cost,
availability, and existing inventory of emission allowances, and the Company’s fuel mix, the
ultimate outcome cannot be determined at this time. Environmental costs that are known and
estimable at this time are included in capital expenditures discussed under FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND LIQUIDITY — “Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations” herein.

Compliance with possible additional federal or state legislation or regulations related to
global climate change, air quality, or other environmental and health concerns could also
significantly affect the Company. New environmental legislation or regulations, or changes to
existing statutes or regulations could affect many areas of the Company’s operations; however,
the full impact of any such changes cannot be determined at this time.

Air Quality

Compliance with the Clean Air Act and resulting regulations has been and will continue to be a
significant focus for the Company. Through 2005, the Company had spent approximately $2.8
million in reducing nitrogen oxide (NO

x

) emissions and in monitoring emissions
pursuant to the Clean Air Act. Additional measures are under consideration to further reduce
SO


and NOx emissions, to maintain compliance with existing regulations and to meet
new requirements.

In 2005, the EPA revoked the one-hour ozone standard and published the final set of rules
for implementation of the new, more stringent eight-hour ozone standard. During 2005, the EPA’s
fine particulate matter nonattainment designations also became effective for several areas
across the United States. No areas within the Company’s service area, however, have been
designated as nonattainment under either the eight-hour ozone standard or the fine particulate
matter standard. Although the State of Georgia was originally included in the states subject to
the regional NO

x

rules, the EPA, in August 2005, stayed compliance with these
requirements and initiated rulemakings to address issues raised in a petition for
reconsideration filed by a coalition of Georgia industries. The impact of the 1998 regional
NO

x

reduction rules for the State of Georgia will depend on the outcome of the
petition for reconsideration and/or any subsequent development and approval of its state
implementation plan.

The EPA issued the final Clean Air Interstate Rule on March 10, 2005. This cap-and-trade rule
addresses power plant SO


and NO

x

emissions that were found to contribute to
nonattainment of the eight-hour ozone and fine particulate matter standards in downwind states.
Twenty-eight eastern states, including Georgia, are subject to the requirements of the rule. The
rule calls for additional reductions of NO

x

and/or SO


to be achieved in two
phases, 2009/2010 and 2015. These reductions may be accomplished by the installation of additional
emission controls at the Company’s coal-fired facilities or by the purchase of emission allowances
from a cap-and-trade program.

The Clean Air Visibility Rule (formerly called the Regional Haze Rule) was finalized on
July 6, 2005. The goal of this rule is to restore natural visibility conditions in certain
areas (primarily national parks and wilderness areas) by 2064. The rule involves the
application of Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements and a review each decade,
beginning in 2018, of progress toward the goal. BART requires that sources that contribute to
visibility impairment implement additional emission reductions, if necessary, to make progress
toward remedying current visibility concerns. For power plants, the Clean Air Visibility Rule
allows states to determine that the Clean Air Interstate Rule satisfies BART requirements for
SO


and NO

x

. However, additional requirements could be imposed. By
December 17, 2007, states must submit implementation plans that contain emission reduction
strategies for implementing BART requirements and for achieving sufficient and

II-294


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2005 Annual Report

reasonable progress toward the goal.

On March 15, 2005, the EPA announced the final Clean Air Mercury Rule, a cap-and-trade program
for the reduction of mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. The rule sets caps on mercury
emissions to be implemented in two phases, 2010 and 2018, and provides for an emission allowance
trading market. The Company anticipates that emission controls installed to achieve compliance
with the Clean Air Interstate Rule and the eight-hour ozone and fine-particulate standards will
also result in mercury emission reductions. However, long-term capability of emission control
equipment to reduce mercury emissions is still being evaluated, and the installation of additional
control technologies may be required.

The impacts of the Clean Air Interstate Rule, the Clean Air Visibility Rule, and the Clean
Air Mercury Rule on the Company will depend on the development and implementation of rules at
the state level. States implementing the Clean Air Mercury Rule and the Clean Air Interstate
Rule, in particular, have the option not to participate in the national cap-and-trade programs
and could require reductions greater than those mandated by federal
rules. Such impacts will
also depend on resolution of pending legal challenges to the Clean Air Interstate Rule, the
Clean Air Mercury Rule, and a related petition from the State of North Carolina under Section
126 of the Clean Air Act, also related to the interstate transport of air pollutants.
Therefore, the full impacts of these regulations on the Company cannot be determined at this
time. The Company has developed and continually updates a comprehensive environmental
compliance strategy to comply with the continuing and new environmental requirements discussed
above. As part of this strategy, the Company plans to install additional SO


,
NO

x

, and mercury emission controls within the next several years to assure continued
compliance with applicable air quality requirements.

Water Quality

In July 2004, the EPA published final rules under the Clean Water Act for the purpose of
reducing impingement and entrainment of fish and fish larvae at power plants’ cooling water
intake structures. The new rules require baseline biological information and, perhaps,
installation of fish protection technology near some intake structures at existing power plants.
The full impact of these new rules will depend on the results of studies and analyses performed
as part of the rules’ implementation and the actual requirements established by state regulatory
agencies and therefore, cannot now be determined.

Environmental Remediation

The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling
and disposal of waste and release of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and
regulations, the Company could incur substantial costs to clean up properties. The Company
conducts studies to determine the extent of any required cleanup and has recognized in the
financial statements the costs to clean up known sites. Amounts for cleanup and ongoing
monitoring costs were not material for any year presented. The Company may be liable for some
or all required cleanup costs for additional sites that may require environmental remediation.

Global Climate Issues

Domestic efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions have been spurred by international discussions
surrounding the Framework Convention on Climate Change, and specifically the Kyoto Protocol, which
proposes constraints on the emissions of greenhouse gases for a group of industrialized countries.
The Bush Administration has not supported U.S. ratification of the Kyoto Protocol or other
mandatory carbon dioxide reduction legislation; however, in 2002, it did announce a goal to reduce
the greenhouse gas intensity of the U.S., the ratio of greenhouse gas emissions to the value of
U.S. economic output, by 18 percent by 2012. A year later, the Department of Energy (DOE)
announced the Climate VISION program to support this goal. Energy-intensive industries, including
electricity generation, are the initial focus of this program. Southern Company is involved in the
development of a voluntary electric utility sector climate change initiative in partnership with
the government. In a memorandum of understanding signed in December 2004 with the DOE under
Climate VISION, the utility sector pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions rate by 3 percent
to 5 percent by 2010 — 2012. Southern Company is continuing to evaluate future energy and
emission profiles relative to the Climate VISION program and is analyzing voluntary programs to
support the industry initiative.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2005 Annual Report

FERC Matters

Market-Based Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates at market-based
prices. Through Southern Company Services, Inc. (SCS), as agent, the Company also has FERC
authority to make short-term opportunity sales at market rates. Specific FERC approval must be
obtained with respect to a market-based contract with an affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation
dominance within its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other
markets is not an issue in that proceeding. In February 2005, Southern Company submitted
responsive information. In February 2006, the FERC suspended the proceeding to allow the
parties to conduct settlement discussions. Any new market-based rate transactions in Southern
Company’s retail service territory entered into after February 27, 2005 are subject to refund to
the level of the default cost-based rates, pending the outcome of the proceeding. The impact of
such sales through December 31, 2005 is not material to the Company’s net income. The refund
period covers 15 months. In the event that the FERC’s default mitigation measures for entities
that are found to have market power are ultimately applied, the Company may be required to
charge cost-based rates for certain wholesale sales in the Southern Company retail service
territory, which may be lower than negotiated market-based rates. The final outcome of this
matter will depend on the form in which the final methodology for assessing generation market
power and mitigation rules may be ultimately adopted and cannot be determined at this time.

In addition, in May 2005, the FERC started an investigation to determine whether Southern
Company satisfies the other three parts of the FERC’s market-based rate analysis: transmission
market power, barriers to entry, and affiliate abuse or reciprocal dealing. The FERC established a
new refund period related to this expanded investigation. Any and all new market-based rate
transactions both inside and outside Southern Company’s retail service territory involving any
Southern Company subsidiary, including the Company, will be subject to refund to the extent the
FERC orders lower rates as a result of this new investigation, with the 15-month refund period
beginning July 19, 2005. The impact of such sales through December 31, 2005 is not material to the
Company’s net income. The FERC also directed that this expanded proceeding be held in abeyance
pending the outcome of the proceeding on the IIC discussed below.

The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for this proceeding and is vigorously
defending itself in this matter. However, the final outcome of this matter, including any remedies
to be applied in the event of an adverse ruling in this proceeding, cannot now be determined.

Intercompany Interchange Contract

The Company’s generation fleet in its retail service territory is operated under the IIC, as
approved by the FERC. In May 2005, the FERC initiated a new proceeding to examine (1) the
provisions of the IIC among Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, the
Company, Southern Power, and SCS, as agent, under the terms of which the power pool of Southern
Company is operated, and, in particular, the propriety of the continued inclusion of Southern Power
as a party to the IIC, (2) whether any parties to the IIC have violated the FERC’s standards of
conduct applicable to utility companies that are transmission providers, and (3) whether Southern
Company’s code of conduct defining Southern Power as a “system company” rather than a “marketing
affiliate” is just and reasonable. In connection with the formation of Southern Power, the FERC
authorized Southern Power’s inclusion in the IIC in 2000. The FERC also previously approved
Southern Company’s code of conduct. The FERC order directs that the administrative law judge who
presided over a proceeding involving approval of PPAs between Southern Power and Georgia Power and
the Company be assigned to preside over the hearing in this proceeding and that the testimony and
exhibits presented in that proceeding be preserved to the extent appropriate. Hearings are
scheduled for September 2006. Effective July 19, 2005, revenues from transactions under the IIC
involving any Southern Company subsidiaries, including the Company, are subject to refund to the
extent the FERC orders any changes to the IIC.

The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for this proceeding and is to
vigorously defending itself in this matter. However, the final outcome of this matter, including
any remedies to be applied in the event of an adverse ruling in this proceeding, cannot now be
determined.

II-296


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Generation Interconnection Agreements

In July 2003, the FERC issued its final rule on the standardization of generation interconnection
agreements and procedures (Order 2003). Order 2003 shifts much of the financial burden of new
transmission investment from the generator to the transmission provider. The FERC has indicated
that Order 2003, which was effective January 20, 2004, is to be applied prospectively to
interconnection agreements. The impact of Order 2003 and its subsequent rehearings on the Company
and the final results of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Transmission

In December 1999, the FERC issued its final rule on Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs).
Since that time, there have been a number of additional proceedings at the FERC designed to
encourage further voluntary formation of RTOs or to mandate their formation. However, at the
current time, there are no active proceedings that would require the Company to participate in an
RTO. Current FERC efforts that may potentially change the regulatory and/or operational structure
of transmission include rules related to the standardization of generation interconnection, as well
as an inquiry into, among other things, market power by vertically integrated utilities. See
“Market-Based Rate Authority” and “Generation Interconnection Agreements” above for additional
information. The final outcome of these proceedings cannot now be determined. However, the
Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by
future changes in the federal regulatory or operational structure of transmission.

PSC Matters

Merger

In connection with the Merger, Georgia Power and the Company plan to establish a new coastal
regional organization for Georgia Power that will operate following completion of the Merger.
Management expects that current employees of the Company will fill most of the positions in the new
regional organization. In connection with the Merger, the Company plans to offer voluntary
severance to a number of employees and expects to incur approximately $16 million in expenses
related to severance benefits and termination costs associated with the Company’s Supplemental
Executive Retirement Plan. These anticipated severance benefits will result in cash payments that
are expected to be expensed during the first half of 2006. The actual amount and timing of these
charges may differ materially from the Company’s estimates described above and will depend upon the
final composition and seniority of the affected employees and the actual timing of completion of
the Merger and the development of the coastal regional organization of Georgia Power.

While the Georgia PSC does not have specific approval authority over the merger of electric
utilities, in January 2006, Georgia Power and the Company filed an application with the Georgia PSC
for certain approvals necessary to complete the Merger. In particular, Georgia Power and the
Company are seeking the approval of the Georgia PSC with respect to the following matters:

•

the transfer of the Company’s generating facilities and certification
of the generating facilities as Georgia Power assets;

•

amendments to Georgia Power’s Integrated Resource Plan to add the
current customers and generating facilities of the Company;

•

the transfer of the Company’s assigned service territory to Georgia
Power;

•

adoption of Georgia Power’s service rules and regulations to the
current Savannah Electric customers;

•

new fuel rate and base rate schedules that would apply to Georgia
Power’s sale of electricity to the current company customers; and

•

the issuance of additional shares of Georgia Power common stock to
Southern Company in exchange for Southern Company’s shares of the
Company’s common stock.

Georgia Power has also requested that the Georgia PSC better align the rates for the Company’s
customers with those of Georgia Power. Currently, customers of the Company pay slightly lower base
rates and significantly higher fuel rates than Georgia Power customers. The overall effect is that
customers of the Company pay substantially higher overall costs for electricity. See “Rate Filing”
and “Fuel Cost Recovery” herein and Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory
Matters” for additional information.

II-297


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Rate Filing

In November 2004, the Company filed a rate case with the Georgia PSC requesting a $23.2 million, or
6.7 percent, increase in total retail revenues, effective January 1, 2005 to cover the cost of new
generation and PPAs, higher operating and maintenance expenses, and continued investment in new
transmission and distribution facilities to support growth and ensure reliability. The requested
increase was based on a future test year ending December 31, 2005 and a proposed retail return on
common equity of 12.5 percent.

On May 17, 2005, the Georgia PSC approved the 2005 Retail Rate Plan. Under the terms of the
2005 Retail Rate Plan, earnings will be evaluated against a retail return on common equity range of
9.75 percent to 11.75 percent. Two-thirds of any earnings above 11.75 percent will be applied to
rate refunds with the remaining one-third retained by the Company. Retail base revenues increased
in June 2005 by approximately $9.6 million, or 5.1 percent, on an annual basis. If the Merger is
not completed, the Company would be required to file a general rate case on November 30, 2007, in
response to which the Georgia PSC would be expected to determine whether the rate plan should be
continued, modified, or discontinued. In connection with the Merger, Georgia Power has requested
Georgia PSC approval of a “merger transition charge” that would be used to adjust the Company’s
total base revenues to more closely match the existing base rates for Georgia Power. The merger
transition charge would remain in effect until completion of Georgia Power’s next base rate case in
2007 that would be effective on January 1, 2008. See Note 3 to the financial statements under
“Retail Regulatory Matters — Merger” for additional information.

Plant McIntosh Construction Project

In December 2002 after a competitive bidding process, the Georgia PSC certified PPAs between
Southern Power and Georgia Power and the Company for capacity from Plant McIntosh Combined Cycle
Units 10 and 11, which were then under construction. In April 2003, Southern Power applied for
FERC approval of these PPAs. In July 2003, the FERC accepted the PPAs to become effective June
1, 2005, subject to refund, and ordered that hearings be held. Intervenors opposed the FERC’s
acceptance of the PPAs, alleging that they did not meet applicable standards for market-based
rates between affiliates. To ensure the timely completion of construction and the availability
of the units in the summer of 2005 for their retail customers, the Company and Georgia Power in
May 2004, requested the Georgia PSC to direct them to acquire the Plant McIntosh construction
project. The Georgia PSC issued such an order and the transfer occurred on May 24, 2004 at a
total cost of approximately $415 million, including $14 million of transmission interconnection
facilities.

Subsequently, Southern Power filed a request to withdraw the PPAs and to terminate the
ongoing FERC proceedings. In August 2004, the FERC issued a notice accepting the request to
withdraw the PPAs and permitting such request to become effective by operation of law. However,
the FERC made no determination on what additional steps may need to be taken with respect to
testimony provided in the proceedings. See “FERC Matters — Intercompany Interchange Contract”
above for additional information.

In December 2004, the Georgia PSC approved the transfer of the Plant McIntosh construction
project, at a total fair market value of approximately $385 million. This value reflected an
approximate $16 million disallowance of which approximately $3 million is attributable to the
Company and reduced the Company’s 2004 net income by approximately $1.5 million. The Georgia
PSC also certified a total completion cost not to exceed $547 million for the project. In June
2005, Plant McIntosh Combined Cycle Units 10 and 11 were placed in service at a total cost that
did not exceed the certified amount. In connection with the Company’s 2005 Retail Rate Plan,
the Plant McIntosh revenue requirements impact is being reflected in the Company’s rates.

Fuel Cost Recovery

On November 10, 2005, the Georgia PSC voted to approve the Company’s request to increase customer
fuel rates to recover estimated under-recovered fuel costs of approximately $71.8 million as of
November 30, 2005 over an estimated four-year period beginning December 1, 2005, as well as future
projected fuel costs. Fuel revenues as recorded on the financial statements are adjusted for
differences in actual recoverable costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates.
Accordingly, this increase in the customer fuel rates will have no significant effect on the
Company’s net income, but is

II-298


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2005 Annual Report

expected to increase annual cash flow by approximately $52.4 million.

As a result of recent increases in fuel costs, the Georgia PSC ordered the Company to file a
new fuel case on or before January 17, 2006. In connection with the Merger, the Company requested
and the Georgia PSC agreed to postpone the January 2006 filing. Instead, the Company and Georgia
Power plan to jointly file a fuel case in March 2006 that would seek approval of a fuel cost
recovery rate based upon future fuel cost projections for the combined generating fleet. The new
fuel cost recovery rate would be paid by all Georgia Power customers following the Merger,
including the existing customers of the Company. Under recovered amounts as of the date of the
Merger will be paid by the appropriate customer groups. See “Merger” herein for additional
information.

In a separate proceeding on August 2, 2005, the Georgia PSC initiated an investigation of the
Company’s fuel practices. In February 2006, an investigation of Georgia Power’s fuel practices was
initiated. The Company and Georgia Power are responding to data requests and cooperating in the
investigations. The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Other Matters

In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 87, Employers’
Accounting for Pensions, the Company recorded non-cash pension costs of approximately $6.2 million,
$5.3 million, and $4.3 million 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Postretirement benefit costs
for the Company were approximately $3.0 million in 2005, $2.8 million in 2004, and $2.7 million in
2003. Both pension and postretirement costs are expected to continue to trend upward. Future
costs are dependent on several factors including trust earnings and changes to the plans. A
portion of pension and postretirement benefit costs is capitalized based on construction-related
labor charges. Pension and postretirement benefit costs are a component of regulated rates and
generally do not have a long-term effect on net income. For more information regarding pension and
postretirement benefits, see Note 2 to the financial statements.

Effective September 30, 2004, the Company retired Units 4 and 5 at Plant Riverside. The
remaining units at the plant were retired on May 31, 2005. These retirements had no material
impact on the Company’s financial statements.

The Company is involved in various other matters being litigated and regulatory matters that
could affect future earnings. See Note 3 to the financial statements for information regarding
material issues.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may
have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations and related disclosures. Different
assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those
recorded in the financial statements. Management has reviewed and discussed critical accounting
policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of Southern Company’s Board of Directors.

Electric Utility Regulation

The Company is subject to retail regulation by the Georgia PSC and wholesale regulation by the
FERC. These regulatory agencies set the rates the Company is permitted to charge customers based
on allowable costs. As a result, the Company applies FASB Statement No. 71, Accounting for the
Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (Statement No. 71), which requires the financial statements
to reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the ratemaking process, the regulators may
require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when they would be recognized
by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of expenses and the
recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery through rates or the
deferral of gains or creation of liabilities and the recording of related regulatory liabilities.
The application of Statement No. 71 has a further effect on the Company’s financial statements as a
result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the ratemaking process. These estimates may
differ from

II-299


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2005 Annual Report

those actually incurred by the Company; therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in specific
costs such as depreciation and pension and postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on
the Company’s results of operations than they would on a non-regulated company.

As reflected in Note 1 to the financial statements, significant regulatory assets and
liabilities have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of these regulatory
assets and liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines and accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. However, adverse legislative, judicial, or regulatory
actions could materially impact the amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could
adversely impact the Company’s financial statements.

Contingent Obligations

The Company is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other
factors and conditions that potentially subject it to environmental, litigation, income tax, and
other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Note 3 to the financial statements for more
information regarding certain of these contingencies. The Company periodically evaluates its
exposure to such risks and records reserves for those matters where a loss is considered probable
and reasonably estimable in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The adequacy
of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or conditions that can be
unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially affect the Company’s
financial statements. These events or conditions include the following:

•

Changes in existing state or federal regulation by governmental
authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality,
control of toxic substances, hazardous and solid wastes, and other
environmental matters.

•

Changes in existing income tax regulations or changes in Internal
Revenue Service interpretations of existing regulations.

•

Identification of additional sites that require environmental
remediation or the filing of other complaints in which the Company may
be asserted to be a potentially responsible party.

•

Identification and evaluation of other potential lawsuits or
complaints in which the Company may be named as a defendant.

•

Resolution or progression of existing matters through the legislative
process, the court systems, or the EPA.

Unbilled Revenues

Revenues related to the sale of electricity are recorded when electricity is delivered to
customers. However, the determination of KWH sales to individual customers is based on the reading
of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each
month, amounts of electricity delivered to customers, but not yet metered and billed, are
estimated. Components of the unbilled revenue estimates include total KWH territorial supply,
total KWH billed, estimated total electricity lost in delivery, and customer usage. These
components can fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including weather, generation patterns,
and power delivery volume, and other operational constraints. These factors can be unpredictable
and can vary from historical trends. As a result, the overall estimate of unbilled revenues could
be significantly affected, which could have a material impact on the Company’s results of
operations.

New Accounting Standards

Income Taxes

In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 109-1, Application of FASB Statement No.
109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities
Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (FSP 109-1), which requires that the
generation deduction be accounted for as a special tax deduction rather than as a tax rate
reduction. The Company adopted FSP 109-1 in the first quarter of 2005 with no material impact
on its financial statements.

Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations

Effective December 31, 2005, the Company adopted the provision of FASB Interpretation No. 47
(FIN 47), Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires that an asset retirement
obligation be recorded even though the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on
future events. Prior to December 2005, the Company did not recognize asset retirement
obligations for asbestos removal because the timing of their retirements was dependent on future
events. At

II-300


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2005 Annual Report

December 31, 2005, the Company recorded additional asset retirement obligations (and assets) of
approximately $3.3 million. The adoption of FIN 47 did not have any effect on the Company’s
income statement. For additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements under
“Asset Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of Removal.”

Stock Options

On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, on a
modified prospective basis. This statement requires that compensation cost relating to
share-based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements. That cost will be
measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued.
Although the compensation expense required under the revised statement differs slightly, the
impacts on the Company’s financial statements are similar to the pro forma disclosures included
in Note 1 to the financial statements under “Stock Options.”

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

The Company’s financial condition continued to be stable at December 31, 2005. As of December 31,
2005, the Company’s capital structure consisted of 47.7 percent common stockholder’s equity, 8.8
percent preferred stock, and 43.5 percent long-term debt, excluding amounts due within one year.

The principal change in the Company’s financial condition in 2005 was the addition of $52.3
million to utility plant, the majority of which was related to completion of Plant McIntosh Units
10 and 11. The funds needed for gross property additions are currently provided from operating
activities, the issuance of securities, capital contributions from Southern Company, and short-term
debt. See statements of cash flows for additional information. The Company has received
investment grade ratings from the major rating agencies.

Sources of Capital

The Company plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from sources
similar to those used in the past, including funds from operations and capital contributions from
Southern Company. The Company is required to meet certain earnings coverage requirements specified
in its mortgage indenture and corporate charter to issue new first mortgage bonds and preferred
stock. The Company’s coverage ratios are sufficiently high to permit, at present interest rate
levels, any foreseeable security sales. There are no restrictions on the amount of unsecured
indebtedness allowed. The amount, type, and timing of any future financings — if needed — will
depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings, regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions,
and other factors.

The issuance of long-term securities by the Company is subject to the approval of the Georgia
PSC. In addition, the issuance of short-term securities by the Company is generally subject to
regulatory approval by the FERC following the repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935, as amended (PUHCA), on February 8, 2006. Additionally, with respect to the public offering
of securities, the Company files registration statements with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) under the Securities Act of 1933 (the 1933 Act). The amounts of securities
authorized by the appropriate regulatory authorities, as well as the amounts registered under the
1933 Act, are continuously monitored and appropriate filings are made to ensure flexibility in the
capital markets.

At the beginning of 2006, the Company had $80 million of unused short-term and revolving
credit arrangements with banks to meet its short-term cash needs. Of this amount, $60 million
will expire at various times in 2006 and $20 million will expire in 2008. The arrangements
contain covenants that limit debt levels and typically contain cross default provisions that are
restricted to the indebtedness of the Company. The Company is currently in compliance with all
such covenants. The Company expects to renew, as needed, its credit arrangements prior to
expiration. The Company also has adequate cash flow from operating activities and access to the
capital markets to meet liquidity needs. See Note 6 to the financial statements under “Bank
Credit Arrangements” for additional information.

The Company may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company subsidiary
organized to issue and sell commercial paper and extendible commercial notes at the request and for
the benefit of the Company and the other retail operating companies.

II-301


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Proceeds from such issuances for the benefit of the Company are loaned directly to the Company and
are not commingled with proceeds from such issuances for the benefit of any other operating
company. The obligations of each company under these arrangements are several; there is no cross
affiliate credit support. At December 31, 2005, the Company had outstanding $49.9 million in
commercial paper and $8.9 million in extendible commercial notes.

The Company’s committed credit arrangements provide liquidity support to some of the Company’s
variable rate obligations and to its commercial paper program. At December 31, 2005, the amount of
variable rate obligations outstanding requiring liquidity support was $6.7 million.

The Company obtains financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. The
Southern Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of
the Company are not commingled with funds of any other company.

Financing Activities

Maturities and redemptions of long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable preferred securities were
$1.1 million in 2005, $71.0 million in 2004, and $39.8 million in 2003. The Company issued no new
securities in 2005.

Credit Rating Risk

The Company does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment
schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. The Company is party to
certain derivative agreements that could require collateral and/or accelerated payment in the event
of a credit rating change to below investment grade. These agreements are primarily for natural
gas price risk management activities. At December 31, 2005, the Company’s exposure related to
these agreements was not material.

Market Price Risk

Due to cost-based rate regulation, the Company has limited exposure to market volatility in
interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity. To manage the volatility
attributable to these exposures, the Company nets the exposures to take advantage of natural
offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to the
Company’s policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and risk management practices. Company
policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and mandates strict
adherence to all applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are monitored using
techniques including but not limited to market valuation, value at risk, stress testing, and
sensitivity analysis.

To mitigate future exposure to change in interest rates, the Company has entered into forward
starting interest rate swaps that have been designated as cash flow hedges. The weighted average
rate on $6.7 million of variable rate long-term debt outstanding that has not been hedged at
January 1, 2006 was 4.04 percent. If the Company sustained a 100 basis point change in interest
rates for all unhedged variable rate long-term debt, at January 1, 2006, the change would not
materially affect annualized interest expense. See Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements under
“Financial Instruments” for additional information.

To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the Company enters
into fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale
electricity market. In addition, the Company has implemented a natural gas/oil hedging program
ordered by the Georgia PSC. The program limits the recovery of losses on financial hedging
positions through the fuel clause to 10 percent of the Company’s annual natural gas/oil budget.
These hedging position limits were $1.1 million for 2003, $2.7 million for 2004, and $5.1 million
for 2005 and will be $7.4 million for 2006. The program has operated within the defined hedging
position limits set for each year. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory
Matters — Fuel Hedging Program” for additional information.

Unrealized gains and losses from mark to market adjustments on derivative contracts related to
the Company’s fuel hedging program are recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities. Realized
gains and losses from this program are included in fuel expense and recovered through the Company’s
FCR clause. Of the net gains, the Company is allowed to retain 25 percent in earnings. Gains and
losses on derivative contracts that are not designated as hedges are recognized in the statements
of income as incurred. These amounts were not material in any year presented. At December 31,

The Company is exposed to market price risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties
to the derivative energy contracts. The Company’s policy is to enter into agreements with
counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s or with
counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. Therefore, the
Company does not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the counterparties. See
Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements under “Financial Instruments” for additional information.

Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations

The Company’s construction program is currently estimated to be $44.7 million in 2006, $33.5
million in 2007, and $55.8 million in 2008. Environmental expenditures included in these amounts
are $0.6 million in 2006 and $4.4 million for 2008. Actual construction costs may vary from this
estimate because of changes in such factors as: business conditions; environmental regulations;
FERC rules and regulations; load projections; the cost and efficiency of construction labor,
equipment, and materials; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that
costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered. Construction of new transmission
and distribution facilities and capital improvements for generation, transmission, and distribution
facilities, including those needed to meet the environmental standards previously discussed, will
be ongoing.

As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company provides postretirement
benefits to substantially all employees and funds trusts to the extent required by the Georgia PSC.

Other funding requirements related to obligations associated with scheduled maturities of
long-term debt, as well as the related interest, derivative obligations, preferred stock dividends,
leases, and other purchase commitments are as follows: See Notes 1, 6, and 7 to the financial
statements for additional information.

The Company forecasts postretirement trust contributions over a three-year period. No
contributions related to the Company’s pension trust are currently expected during this
period. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information related to the
pension and postretirement plans, including estimated benefit payments. Certain benefit
payments will be made through the related trusts. Other benefit payments will be made from
the Company’s corporate assets.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2005 Annual Report

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

General

Savannah Electric and Power Company (the Company) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company,
which is the parent company of five retail operating companies, Southern Power Company (Southern
Power), Southern Company Services (SCS), Southern Communications Services (SouthernLINC Wireless),
Southern Company Holdings (Southern Holdings), Southern Nuclear Operating Company (Southern
Nuclear), Southern Telecom, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The retail operating
companies, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, and the Company, provide
electric service in four Southeastern states. The Company operates as a vertically integrated
utility providing electricity to retail customers within its traditional service area of
southeastern Georgia. Southern Power constructs, owns, and manages Southern Company’s competitive
generation assets and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Contracts
among the retail operating companies and Southern Power, related to jointly owned generating
facilities, interconnecting transmission lines, or the exchange of electric power, are regulated by
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). SCS, the system service company, provides, at
cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. SouthernLINC Wireless
provides digital wireless communications services to the retail operating companies and also
markets these services to the public within the Southeast. Southern Telecom provides fiber cable
services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding subsidiary for
Southern Company’s investments in synthetic fuels and leveraged leases and various other
energy-related businesses. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to Southern Company’s
nuclear power plants. On January 4, 2006, Southern Company completed the sale of substantially all
the assets of Southern Company Gas, its competitive retail natural gas marketing subsidiary.

Certain prior years’ data presented in the financial statements has been reclassified to
conform with the current year presentation.

Southern Company was registered as a holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended (PUHCA), until its repeal
on February 8, 2006, and Southern Company and its subsidiaries, including the Company, were subject to
the regulatory provisions of the PUHCA. The Company also is subject to regulation by the FERC and
the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC). The Company follows accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States and complies with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by
its regulatory commissions. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires the use of estimates, and the actual
results may differ from those estimates.

Affiliate Transactions

The Company has an agreement with SCS under which the following services are rendered to the
Company at direct or allocated cost: general and design engineering, purchasing, accounting and
statistical analysis, finance and treasury, tax, information resources, marketing, auditing,
insurance and employee benefits, human resources, systems and procedures, and other services with
respect to business and operations and power pool transactions. Costs for these services amounted
to $17.9 million, $17.4 million, and $16.3 million during 2005, 2004, and 2003,
respectively. Cost allocation methodologies used by SCS were approved by the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) prior to the repeal of PUHCA and management believes they are reasonable.

The Company has a purchased power agreement (PPA) with Southern Power for 200 megawatts of
capacity from Plant Wansley Units 6 and 7 which began operation in June 2002. Purchased power
capacity and energy costs in 2005 amounted to $50.7 million. At December 31, 2005, approximately
$0.9 million in prepaid capacity expense related to this PPA was recorded in other deferred charges
and other assets in the balance sheets.

The Company operates an eight-unit combustion turbine site at its Plant McIntosh. Two of the
units are owned by the Company, and six of the units are owned by Georgia Power. Georgia Power
reimburses the Company for its proportionate share of the related expenses, which were $1.9 million
in 2005, $3.3 million in 2004, and $3.6 million in 2003.

In addition, the Company and Georgia Power jointly

II-312


NOTES (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2005 Annual Report

acquired, in 2004, the Plant McIntosh Combined Cycle Units 10 and 11 construction project from
Southern Power. The Company also operates these units which were placed in service in June 2005.
Georgia Power reimburses the Company for its proportionate share of the related expenses, which
were $3.6 million for 2005. See Note 3 under “Retail Regulatory Matters — Plant McIntosh
Construction Project” and Notes 4 and 5 for additional information.

The Company provides incidental services to other subsidiaries which are generally minor in
duration and amount. However, with the hurricane damage experienced by Alabama Power, Gulf Power,
and Mississippi Power in the last two years, assistance provided to aid in storm restoration has
caused an increase in these activities. The total amount of storm restoration provided in 2004 and
2005 was $0.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively. These activities were billed at cost.

The retail operating companies, including the Company, and Southern Power may jointly enter
into various types of wholesale energy, natural gas, and certain other contracts, either directly
or through SCS as agent. Each participating company may be jointly and severally liable for the
obligations incurred under these agreements. See Note 7 under “Fuel Commitments” and “Purchased
Power Commitments” for additional information.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

The Company is subject to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement
No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. Regulatory assets represent
probable future revenues associated with certain costs that are expected to be recovered from
customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future
reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be credited to customers
through the ratemaking process.

Regulatory assets and (liabilities) reflected in the balance sheets at December 31 and the
amortization periods are discussed below as follows:

Note: The recovery and amortization periods for these regulatory assets and (liabilities) are
as follows:

In the event that a portion of the Company’s operations is no longer subject to the
provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, the Company would be required to write off related regulatory
assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable through regulated rates. In addition,
the Company would be required to determine if any impairment to other assets exists, including
plant, and write down the assets, if impaired, to their fair value. All regulatory assets and
liabilities are currently reflected in rates.

II-313


NOTES (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Revenues

Energy revenues and other revenues are recognized as services are rendered. Unbilled revenues are
accrued at the end of each fiscal period. Electric rates for the Company include provisions to
adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, fuel hedging, the energy component of purchased
power costs, and certain other costs. Revenues are adjusted for differences between these actual
costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Under or over recovered regulatory clause
revenues are recorded in the balance sheets and are recovered or returned to customers through
adjustments to the billing factors.

The Company has a diversified base of customers. No single customer or industry comprises 10
percent or more of revenues. For all periods presented, uncollectible accounts averaged less than
1 percent of revenues.

Fuel Costs

Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is used. Fuel expense includes the cost of purchased emission
allowances as they are used. See Note 3 under “Retail Regulatory Matters — Fuel Cost Recovery”
for additional information.

Income Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provides deferred
income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences. Federal investment tax credits
utilized are deferred and amortized to income over the average life of the related property.

Manufacturer’s Tax Credits

The State of Georgia provides a tax credit for qualified investment property to manufacturing
companies that construct new facilities. The credit ranges from one percent to five percent of
qualified construction expenditures depending upon the county in which the new facility is located.
The Company’s policy is to recognize these credits when management believes that they are more
likely than not to be allowed by the Georgia Department of Revenue. The amounts recorded for
manufacturer’s tax credits were not material for any period presented.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost less regulatory disallowances and
impairments. Original cost includes: materials; labor; minor items of property; appropriate
administrative and general costs; payroll-related costs such as taxes, pensions, and other
benefits, and Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC).

The Company’s property, plant, and equipment consisted of the following at December 31:

The cost of replacements of property, exclusive of minor items of property, is capitalized.
The cost of maintenance, repairs, and replacement of minor items of property is charged to
maintenance expense. In accordance with Georgia PSC order, the Company is deferring the costs of
certain significant inspection costs for the combustion turbines at Plant McIntosh and amortizing
such costs over 10 years, which approximates the expected maintenance cycle.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation of the original cost of utility plant in service is provided primarily by using
composite straight-line rates, which approximated 2.5 percent in 2005, 2.8 percent in 2004, and 2.9
percent in 2003. Depreciation studies are conducted periodically to update the composite rates and
are filed with the Georgia PSC. As ordered by the Georgia PSC, the Company lowered its
depreciation rates in June 2005. See Note 3 under “Retail Regulatory Matters — Rate Plans” for
additional information. When property subject to depreciation is retired or otherwise disposed of
in the normal course of business, its cost — together with the cost of removal, less salvage—is
charged to accumulated depreciation. Minor items of property included in the original cost of the
plant are retired when the related property unit is retired. Depreciation expense includes an
amount for the expected cost of removal of certain facilities.

II-314


NOTES (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2005 Annual Report

In the Company’s 2002 rate order, the Georgia PSC ordered the Company to amortize the balance
of accelerated cost recovery as a credit to depreciation expense over a three year period beginning
June 2002. Accordingly, in 2005, 2004, and 2003, the Company amortized $1.3 million, $3.0 million,
and $3.0 million, respectively. See Note 3 under “Retail Regulatory Matters — Rate Plans” for
additional information.

Asset Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of Removal

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations. Statement No. 143 established new accounting and reporting standards for
legal obligations associated with the ultimate costs of retiring long-lived assets. The present
value of the ultimate costs for an asset’s future retirement is recorded in the period in which the
liability is incurred. The costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and
depreciated over the asset’s useful life. In addition, effective December 31, 2005, the Company
adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 47, Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations,
which requires that an asset retirement obligation be recorded even though the timing and/or method
of settlement are conditional on future events. Prior to December 2005, the Company did not
recognize asset retirement obligations for asbestos removal. The Company has received accounting
guidance from the Georgia PSC allowing the continued accrual of other future retirement costs for
long-lived assets that the Company does not have a legal obligation to retire. Accordingly, the
accumulated removal costs for these obligations will continue to be reflected on the balance sheets
as a regulatory liability. Therefore, the Company had no cumulative effect to net income resulting
from the adoption of Statement No. 143 or Interpretation No. 47.

The Company has retirement obligations related to various landfill sites, a rail line, and
underground storage tanks. As a result of the implementation of Interpretation No. 47, the Company
recognized additional asset retirement obligations (and assets) of $3.3 million, primarily related
to asbestos removal. The Company has also identified retirement obligations related to certain
transmission and distribution facilities. However, liabilities for the removal of these
transmission and distribution assets have not been recorded because the range of time over which
the Company may settle these obligations is unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated. The Company will continue to recognize
in statements of income allowed removal costs in accordance with its regulatory treatment. Any
difference between costs recognized under Statement No. 143 and Interpretation No. 47 and those
reflected in rates are recognized as either a regulatory asset or liability, as ordered by the
Georgia PSC, and are reflected in the balance sheets.

Details of the asset retirement obligations included in the balance sheets are as follows:

If Interpretation No. 47 had been adopted as of December 31, 2004, the pro forma asset
retirement obligations would have been $7.1 million.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction

In accordance with regulatory treatment, the Company records AFUDC. AFUDC represents the estimated
debt and equity costs of capital funds that are necessary to finance the construction of new
regulated facilities. While cash is not realized currently from such allowance, it increases the
revenue requirement over the service life of the plant through a higher rate base and higher
depreciation expense. The average rates used by the Company to calculate AFUDC were 8.29 percent
in 2005, 6.11 percent in 2004, and 4.22 percent in 2003. AFUDC as a percent of net income was 10.0
percent in 2005, 13.5 percent in 2004, and 1.4 percent in 2003.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles

The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of
whether an impairment has occurred is based on either a specific regulatory disallowance or an
estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared with the
carrying value of the assets. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the

II-315


NOTES (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2005 Annual Report

impairment recognized is determined by either the amount of regulatory disallowance or by
estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a provision for loss if the carrying value is
greater than the fair value. For assets identified as held for sale, the carrying value is
compared to the estimated fair value less the cost to sell in order to determine if an impairment
provision is required. Until the assets are disposed of, their estimated fair value is
re-evaluated when circumstances or events change. See Note 3 under “Retail Regulatory Matters —
Plant McIntosh Construction Project” for information on a regulatory disallowance by the Georgia
PSC in December 2004.

Storm Damage Reserve

The Company maintains a storm damage reserve for property damage to cover the cost of uninsured
damages from major storms to transmission and distribution facilities and other property. As part
of the 2005 retail rate plan approved by the Georgia PSC (2005 Retail Rate Plan), the Company’s
annual storm damage accrual was set at $0.3 million.

Environmental Cost Recovery

The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling
and disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and
regulations, the Company may also incur substantial costs to clean up properties. The Company
currently recovers environmental costs through its base rates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are considered cash
equivalents. Temporary cash investments are securities with original maturities of 90 days or
less.

Materials and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include the average cost of transmission, distribution, and
generating plant materials. Materials are charged to inventory when purchased and then expensed or
capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when installed.

Fuel Inventory

Fuel inventory includes the average costs of oil, coal,
natural gas, and emission allowances. Fuel is charged to inventory when purchased and then
expensed as used. Emission allowances granted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are
included in inventory at zero cost.

Stock Options

Southern Company provides non-qualified stock options to a large segment of the Company’s employees
ranging from line management to executives. The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation
plans in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25. Accordingly, no compensation
expense has been recognized because the exercise price of all options granted equaled the
fair-market value of Southern Company’s common stock on the date of grant. When options are
exercised, the Company receives a capital contribution from Southern Company equivalent to the
related income tax benefit.

For pro forma purposes, the Company generally recognizes stock option expense on a
straight-line basis over the vesting period. Stock options granted to employees who are
eligible for retirement are expensed at the grant date. The pro forma impact on net income of
fair-value accounting for options granted is as follows:

Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposures to fluctuations in interest
rates, the prices of certain fuel purchases, and electricity purchases and sales. All derivative
financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair
value. Substantially all of the Company’s bulk energy purchases and sales contracts that meet the
definition of a derivative are exempt from fair value accounting requirements and are accounted for
under the accrual method. Other derivative contracts qualify as cash flow hedges of anticipated
transactions or are recoverable through the Georgia PSC approved fuel hedging program as discussed
below. This results in the deferral of related gains and losses in other comprehensive income or
regulatory assets and liabilities, respectively, as appropriate until the hedged transactions
occur. Any ineffectiveness arising from cash flow hedges is recognized currently in net income.
Other derivative contracts are marked to market through current period income and are recorded on a
net basis in the statements of income.

The Company is exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of
counterparties’ nonperformance. The Company has established controls to determine and monitor the
creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate the Company’s exposure to counterparty
credit risk.

The Company has implemented a natural gas/oil hedging program as ordered by the Georgia PSC.
The program limits the recovery of losses on financial hedging positions through the fuel clause to
10 percent of the Company’s annual natural gas/oil budget. These hedging position limits were $1.1
million for 2003, $2.7 million for 2004, and $5.1 million for 2005 and will be $7.4 million for
2006. The program has operated within the defined hedging position limits set for each year.

The Company’s other financial instruments for which the carrying amount does not equal fair
value at December 31 were as follows:

Carrying

Fair

Amount

(in millions)

Long-term debt:

$


The fair values for long-term debt were based on either closing market prices or closing
prices of comparable instruments.

Comprehensive Income

The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of all changes in common stock equity
of an enterprise that result from transactions and other economic events of the period other than
transactions with owners. Comprehensive income consists of net income, changes in the fair value
of qualifying cash flow hedges and marketable securities, and changes in additional minimum pension
liability, less income taxes and reclassifications for amounts included in net income.

2. RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company has a defined benefit, trusteed pension plan covering substantially all employees. The
plan is funded in accordance with requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended (ERISA). In 2005, the plan was amended to provide an additional monthly
supplement to certain retirees. No contributions to the plan are expected for the year ending
December 31, 2006. The Company also provides certain non-qualified benefit plans for a selected
group of management and highly compensated employees and directors. Benefits under these
non-qualified plans are funded on a cash basis. In addition, the Company has a supplemental
retirement plan for certain executive employees. The plan is unfunded and payable from the general
funds of the Company. The Company has purchased life insurance on participating executives and
plans to use these policies to satisfy this obligation. Due to the merger of the Company with and
into Georgia Power, a liability of $0.9 million was accrued for special termination benefits
provided by the Company’s supplemental executive retirement plan. See Note 3 under “Retail
Regulatory Matters — Merger” for

additional information. Also, the Company provides certain medical care and life insurance
benefits for retired employees. The Company funds trusts to the extent required by the Georgia PSC
and the FERC. For the year ended December 31, 2006, postretirement trust contributions are
expected to total approximately $1.3 million.

The measurement date for plan assets and obligations is September 30 for each year presented.

Pension Plans

The total accumulated benefit obligation for the pension plans was $109.6 million in 2005 and $95.5
million in 2004. Changes during the year in the projected benefit obligations, accumulated benefit
obligations, and fair value of plan assets were as follows:

In
2005, the projected benefit obligations for the qualified and non-qualified pension plans were
$104.3 million and $13.1 million, respectively. All plan assets are related to the qualified plan.

Pension plan assets are managed and invested in accordance with all applicable requirements,
including ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Internal Revenue Code). The
Company’s investment policy covers a diversified mix of assets, including equity and fixed income
securities, real estate, and private equity, as described in the table below. Derivative
instruments are used primarily as hedging tools but may also be used to gain efficient exposure to
the various asset classes. The Company primarily minimizes the risk of large losses through
diversification but also monitors and manages other aspects of risk.

In the third quarter 2004, the Company prospectively adopted FASB Staff Position (FSP) 106-2,
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and
Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act). The Medicare Act provides a 28 percent prescription drug
subsidy for Medicare eligible retirees. FSP 106-2 requires recognition of the impacts of the
Medicare Act in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) and future cost of service
for postretirement medical plans. The effect of the subsidy reduced the Company’s expenses for the
six months ended December 31, 2004 and for the year ended December 31, 2005 by approximately $0.2
million and $0.5 million, respectively, and is expected to have a similar impact on future
expenses.

Future benefit payments, including prescription drug benefits, reflect expected future service
and are estimated based on assumptions used to measure the accumulated benefit obligation for the
postretirement plans. Estimated benefit payments are reduced by drug subsidy receipts expected as
a result of the Medicare Act as follows:

Actuarial Assumptions

The weighted average rates assumed in the actuarial calculations used to determine both the benefit
obligations and the net periodic costs for the pension and postretirement benefit plans were as
follows:

The Company determined the long-term rate of return based on historical asset class returns
and current market conditions, taking into account the diversification benefits of investing in
multiple asset classes.

An additional assumption used in measuring the APBO was a weighted average medical care cost
trend rate of 10.25 percent for 2005, decreasing gradually to 4.75 percent through the year 2014,
and remaining at that level thereafter.

An annual increase or decrease in the assumed medical care cost trend rate of 1 percent would
affect the accumulated benefit obligation and the service and interest cost components at December
31, 2005 as follows:

Employee Savings Plan

The Company also sponsors a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering substantially all employees.
The Company provides a 75 percent matching contribution up to 6 percent of an employee’s base
salary. Total matching contributions made to the plan for 2005, 2004, and 2003 were $1.2 million,
$1.1 million, and $1.1 million, respectively.

3. CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY MATTERS

General Litigation Matters

The Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course
of business. In addition, the Company’s business activities are subject to extensive
governmental regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation over

II-320


NOTES (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2005 Annual Report

environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal
injury, and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements such as opacity and other air
quality standards, has increased generally throughout the United States. In particular,
personal injury claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become
more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against the Company
cannot be predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically reported
herein, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such current
proceedings would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements.

Environmental Matters

New Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the EPA brought a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Georgia against certain Southern Company subsidiaries, including Alabama
Power and Georgia Power, alleging that these subsidiaries had violated the New Source Review
(NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act and related state laws at certain coal-fired generating
facilities. Through subsequent amendments and other legal procedures, the EPA added the Company
as a defendant to the original action and filed a separate action against Alabama Power in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama after it was dismissed from the
original action. In these lawsuits, the EPA alleges that NSR violations occurred at eight
coal-fired generating facilities including the Company’s Plant Kraft. The civil actions request
penalties and injunctive relief, including an order requiring the installation of the best
available control technology at the affected units. On June 3, 2005, the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of Alabama issued a decision in favor of Alabama Power on two primary
legal issues in the case; however, the decision does not resolve the case, nor does it address
other legal issues associated with the EPA’s allegations. In accordance with a separate court
order, Alabama Power and the EPA are currently participating in mediation with respect to the
EPA’s claims. The action against Georgia Power and the Company has been administratively closed
since the spring of 2001, and none of the parties has sought to reopen the case.

The Company believes it complied with applicable laws and the EPA’s regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act
authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $32,500 per day, per violation at each generating
unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in this matter could
require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly
require payment of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of operations, cash
flows, and financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

FERC Matters

Market-Based Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates at market-based
prices. The Company also has FERC authority to make short-term opportunity sales at market
rates. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a market-based contract with an
affiliate. In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s
generation dominance within its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based
rates in other markets is not an issue in that proceeding. In February 2005, Southern Company
submitted responsive information. In February 2006, the FERC suspended the proceeding to allow
the parties to conduct settlement discussions. Any new market-based rate transactions in
Southern Company’s retail service territory entered into after February 27, 2005 are subject to
refund to the level of the default cost-based rates, pending the outcome of the proceeding. The
impact of such sales through December 31, 2005 is not material to the Company’s net income. The
refund period covers 15 months. In the event that the FERC’s default mitigation measures for
entities that are found to have market power are ultimately applied, the Company may be required
to charge cost-based rates for certain wholesale sales in the Southern Company retail service
territory, which may be lower than negotiated market-based rates. The final outcome of this
matter will depend on the form in which the final methodology for assessing generation market
power and mitigation rules may be ultimately adopted and cannot be determined at this time.

In addition, in May 2005, the FERC started an investigation to determine whether Southern
Company satisfies the other three parts of the FERC’s market-based

II-321


NOTES (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2005 Annual Report

rate analysis: transmission market power, barriers to entry, and affiliate abuse or reciprocal
dealing. The FERC established a new refund period related to this expanded investigation. Any and
all new market-based rate transactions both inside and outside Southern Company’s retail service
area involving any Southern Company subsidiary, including the Company, will be subject to refund to
the extent the FERC orders lower rates as a result of this new investigation, with the 15-month
refund period beginning July 19, 2005. The impact of such sales through December 31, 2005 is not
material to the Company’s net income. The FERC also directed that this expanded proceeding be held
in abeyance pending the outcome of the proceeding on the Intercompany Interchange Contract (IIC)
discussed below.

The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for this proceeding and is vigorously
defending itself in this matter. However, the final outcome of this matter, including any remedies
to be applied in the event of an adverse ruling in this proceeding,
cannot now be determined.

Intercompany Interchange Contract

The Company’s generation fleet in its retail service territory is operated under the IIC, as
approved by the FERC. In May 2005, the FERC initiated a new proceeding to examine (1) the
provisions of the IIC among Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, the
Company, Southern Power, and SCS, as agent, under the terms of which the power pool of Southern
Company is operated, and, in particular, the propriety of the continued inclusion of Southern Power
as a party to the IIC, (2) whether any parties to the IIC have violated the FERC’s standards of
conduct applicable to utility companies that are transmission providers, and (3) whether Southern
Company’s code of conduct defining Southern Power as a “system company” rather than a “marketing
affiliate” is just and reasonable. In connection with the formation of Southern Power, the FERC
authorized Southern Power’s inclusion in the IIC in 2000. The FERC also previously approved
Southern Company’s code of conduct. The FERC order directs that the administrative law judge who
presided over a proceeding involving approval of PPAs between Southern Power and Georgia Power and
the Company be assigned to preside over the hearing in this proceeding and that the testimony and
exhibits presented in that proceeding be preserved to the extent appropriate. Hearings are
scheduled for September 2006. Effective July 19, 2005, revenues from transactions under the IIC
involving any Southern Company subsidiary, including the Company, will be subject to refund to the
extent the FERC orders any changes to the IIC.

The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for this proceeding and is vigorously
defending itself in this matter. However, the final outcome of this matter, including any remedies
to be applied in the event of an adverse ruling in this proceeding,
cannot now be determined.

Generation Interconnection Agreements

In July 2003, the FERC issued its final rule on the standardization of generation interconnection
agreements and procedures (Order 2003). Order 2003 shifts much of the financial burden of new
transmission investment from the generator to the transmission provider. The FERC has indicated
that Order 2003, which was effective January 20, 2004, is to be applied prospectively to
interconnection agreements. The impact of Order 2003 and its subsequent rehearings on the Company
and the final results of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Right of Way Litigation

In late 2001, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company, including Alabama Power, Georgia Power,
Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, the Company, and Southern Telecom, were named as defendants in a
lawsuit brought by a telecommunications company that uses certain of the defendants’ rights of
way. This lawsuit alleges, among other things, that the defendants are contractually obligated
to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the telecommunications company from any liability that
may be assessed against it in pending and future right of way litigation. The Company believes
that the plaintiff’s claims are without merit. In the fall of 2004, the trial court stayed the
case until resolution of an underlying landowner litigation involving Southern Company and
certain of its subsidiaries. In January 2005, the Georgia Court of Appeals dismissed the
telecommunications company’s appeal of the trial court’s order for lack of jurisdiction. An
adverse outcome in this case could result in a substantial judgment; however, the final outcome
of this matter cannot now be determined.

II-322

Retail Regulatory Matters

Merger

On December 13, 2005, Georgia Power and the Company entered into a merger agreement, under which
the Company will merge with and into Georgia Power, with Georgia Power continuing as the surviving
corporation (the Merger). Pursuant to the Merger agreement, at the effective time of the Merger
each share of Georgia Power common stock will remain issued and outstanding; each share of Georgia
Power preferred stock currently issued and outstanding will have been redeemed prior to the Merger;
the issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, all of which are held by Southern
Company, will be converted into the right to receive 1,500,000 shares of Georgia Power common
stock; and each share of the Company’s preferred stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Merger will be converted into the right to receive one share of a new series of Georgia Power
Class A Preferred Stock. The Merger must be approved by the preferred shareholders of the Company,
and is subject to the receipt of certain regulatory approvals from the FERC, the Georgia PSC, and
the Federal Communications Commission. Pending regulatory approvals, the Merger is expected to
occur by July 2006.

While the Georgia PSC does not have specific approval authority over the merger of electric
utilities, in January 2006, Georgia Power and the Company filed an application with the Georgia PSC
for certain approvals necessary to complete the Merger. In particular, Georgia Power and the
Company are seeking the approval of the Georgia PSC with respect to the following matters:

Rate
Plans

In November 2004, the Company filed a rate case with the Georgia PSC requesting a $23.2 million, or
6.7 percent, increase in total retail revenues, effective January 1, 2005 to cover the cost of new
generation and PPAs, higher operating and maintenance expenses, and continued investment in new
transmission and distribution facilities to support growth and ensure reliability. The requested
increase was based on a future test year ending December 31, 2005 and a proposed retail return on
common equity of 12.5 percent.

On May 17, 2005, the Georgia PSC approved a new three-year retail rate plan for the Company
ending May 31, 2008, (2005 Retail Rate Plan). Under the terms of the 2005 Retail Rate Plan,
earnings will be evaluated against a retail return on common equity range of 9.75 percent to 11.75
percent. Two-thirds of any earnings above 11.75 percent will be applied to rate refunds with the
remaining one-third retained by the Company. Retail base revenues increased in June 2005 by
approximately $9.6 million, or 5.1 percent, on an annual basis. If the Merger is not completed,
the Company would be required to file a general rate case on November 30, 2007, in response to
which the Georgia PSC would be expected to determine whether the rate plan should be continued,
modified, or discontinued. In connection with the Merger, Georgia Power has requested Georgia PSC
approval of a “merger transition charge” that would be used to adjust the Company’s existing base
rates to more closely match the existing base rates for Georgia Power. The merger transition
charge would remain in effect until the completion of Georgia Power’s next base rate case in 2007
that would be effective on January 1, 2008.

In May 2002, the Georgia PSC approved a $7.8 million base rate increase and an authorized
return on equity of 12 percent as a result of the Company’s request to recover significant new
expenses related to the Plant Wansley PPA which began in June 2002, as well as other operation and
maintenance expense changes. The Georgia PSC also ordered the Company to amortize approximately $9
million of accelerated depreciation and amortization, previously recorded, equally over three years
as a credit to expense beginning June 1, 2002.

II-323


NOTES (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2005 Annual Report

In December 2002, at the Company’s request, the Georgia PSC issued an accounting order
authorizing the Company to defer until May 2005 approximately $3.8 million annually in Plant
Wansley purchased power costs that the Georgia PSC had ruled to be outside the test period for the
base rate order. Under the terms of the order, two-thirds of any earnings of the Company in a
calendar year above a 12 percent return on common equity were used to amortize the deferred amounts
to purchase power expense, with the remainder retained by the Company. The Company also had
discretionary authority to amortize up to an additional $1.5 million annually. Through May 31,
2005, the Company had amortized all of the deferred purchased power costs.

Fuel
Hedging Program

The Georgia PSC approved a natural gas and oil procurement and hedging program that allows the
Company to use financial instruments to hedge price and commodity risk. The order limits the
program in terms of time, volume, dollars, and physical amounts hedged. The costs of the program,
including net losses subject to certain limits, are recovered through the fuel cost recovery
clause. Annual net financial gains from the hedging program are shared, with the retail customers
receiving 75 percent and the Company retaining 25 percent of the total net gains. Such net gains
totaled $10.5 million in 2005, of which the Company has retained $2.6 million.

Fuel
Cost Recovery

On August 19, 2005, the Company filed a request with the Georgia PSC for a fuel cost recovery rate
increase. On November 10, 2005, the Georgia PSC voted to approve the Company’s request to increase
customer fuel rates to recover estimated under-recovered fuel costs of approximately $71.8 million
as of November 30, 2005 over an estimated four-year period beginning December 1, 2005, as well as
future projected fuel costs. Fuel revenues as recorded on the financial statements are adjusted
for differences in actual recoverable costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates.
Accordingly, this increase in the customer fuel rates will have no significant effect on the
Company’s net income, but is expected to increase annual cash flow by approximately $52.4 million.

As a result of recent increases in fuel costs, the Georgia PSC ordered the Company to file a
new fuel case on or before January 17, 2006. In connection with the Merger, the Company requested,
and the Georgia PSC agreed to postpone the January 2006 filing. Instead, the Company and Georgia
Power plan to jointly file a fuel case in March 2006 that would seek approval of a fuel cost
recovery rate based upon future fuel cost projections for the combined generating fleet. The new
fuel cost recovery rate would be paid by all Georgia Power customers, including the existing
customers of the Company, following the Merger. Under recovered amounts as of the date of the
Merger will be paid by the appropriate customer groups.

In a separate proceeding on August 2, 2005, the Georgia PSC approved its staff recommendation
to initiate an investigation of the Company’s fuel practices. In February 2006, an investigation
of Georgia Power’s fuel practices was initiated. The Company and Georgia Power are responding to
data requests and cooperating in the investigations. The final outcome of this matter cannot now
be determined.

Plant McIntosh Construction Project

In December 2002, after a competitive bidding process, the Georgia PSC certified PPAs between
Southern Power and Georgia Power and the Company for capacity from Plant McIntosh Combined Cycle
Units 10 and 11, which was then under construction. In April 2003, Southern Power applied for
FERC approval of these PPAs. In July 2003, the FERC accepted the PPAs to become effective June
1, 2005, subject to refund, and ordered that hearings be held. Intervenors opposed the FERC’s
acceptance of the PPAs, alleging that they did not meet applicable standards for market-based
rates between affiliates. To ensure the timely completion of construction and the availability
of the units in the summer of 2005 for their retail customers, the Company and Georgia Power in
May 2004 requested the Georgia PSC to direct them to acquire the Plant McIntosh construction
project. The Georgia PSC issued such an order and the transfer occurred on May 24, 2004 at a
total cost of approximately $415 million, including $14 million of transmission interconnection
facilities.

Subsequently, Southern Power filed a request to withdraw the PPAs and to terminate the
ongoing FERC proceedings. In August 2004, the FERC issued a notice accepting the request to
withdraw the PPAs

II-324


NOTES (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2005 Annual Report

and permitting such request to become effective by operation of law. However, the FERC
made no determination on what additional steps may need to be taken with respect to testimony
provided in the proceedings. See “FERC Matters — Intercompany Interchange Contract” herein
for additional information.

In December 2004 the Georgia PSC approved the transfer of the Plant McIntosh construction
project, at a total fair market value of approximately $385 million. This value reflects an
approximate $16 million disallowance, of which approximately $3 million is attributable to the
Company and reduced the Company’s 2004 net income by approximately $1.5 million. The Georgia PSC
also certified a total completion cost not to exceed $547 million for the project. In June 2005,
Plant McIntosh Combined Cycle Units 10 and 11 were placed in service at a total cost that did not
exceed the certified amount. In connection with the Company’s 2005 Retail Rate Plan, the Plant
McIntosh revenue requirements impact is being reflected in the Company’s rates.

4. JOINT OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS

The Company operates and jointly owns its Plant McIntosh combustion turbines with Georgia Power.
Two of the eight units, totaling 160 megawatts of capacity, are owned by the Company, and six
units, totaling 480 megawatts of capacity, are owned by Georgia Power. In addition, the Company
and Georgia Power jointly acquired the Plant McIntosh Combined Cycle Units 10 and 11 construction
project in 2004. The units, which have a total capacity of 1,319 megawatts, began operation in
June 2005. The Company’s amount of investment in the jointly owned Plant McIntosh facilities and
related accumulated depreciation at December 31, 2005 were $135 million and $15 million,
respectively. The Company’s proportionate share of its combustion turbine and combined cycle plant
operating expenses is included in the operating expenses in the statements of income.

5. INCOME TAXES

Southern Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return and a combined
State of Georgia income tax return. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement,
each subsidiary’s current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis and no
subsidiary is allocated more expense than would be paid if they filed a separate income tax return.
In accordance with Internal Revenue Service regulations, each company is jointly and severally
liable for the tax liability.

The transfer of the Plant McIntosh construction project from Southern Power to the Company
resulted in a deferred gain to Southern Power for federal income tax purposes. The Company is
reimbursing Southern Power for the remaining balance of the deferred tax of $1.0 million as it is
reflected in Southern Power’s future taxable income. At December 31, 2005, the payable to Southern
Power is included in the Company’s balance sheet under Affiliated Accounts Payable and Other
Deferred Credits and totaled $0.3 million and $0.7 million, respectively.

At December 31, 2005, tax-related regulatory assets and liabilities were $11.5 million and
$8.0 million, respectively. These assets are attributable to tax benefits flowed through to
customers in prior years and to taxes applicable to capitalized interest. These liabilities are
attributable to deferred taxes previously recognized at rates higher than the current enacted tax
law and to unamortized investment tax credits.

In accordance with regulatory requirements, deferred investment tax credits are amortized
over the lives of the related property with such amortization normally applied as a credit to
reduce depreciation in the statements of income. Credits amortized in this manner amounted to $0.7
million per year in 2005, 2004, and 2003. At December 31, 2005, all investment tax credits
available to reduce federal income taxes payable had been utilized.

6. FINANCING

Long-Term Debt and Capital Leases

The Company’s indenture related to its first mortgage bonds is unlimited as to the authorized
amount of bonds which may be issued, provided that required property additions, earnings, and other
provisions of such indenture are met.

Assets acquired under capital leases are recorded as utility plant in service, and the related
obligation is classified as other long-term debt. Leases are capitalized at the net present value
of the future lease payments. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had capitalized lease
obligations for its Plant Kraft coal unloading dock and its vehicles of $5.1 million and $5.8
million, respectively. However, for ratemaking purposes, these obligations are treated as
operating leases and, as such, lease payments are charged to expense as incurred. The annual
expense incurred for 2005, 2004, and 2003 for the Plant Kraft coal unloading dock was $0.5 million.
The annual expense for the vehicles was $0.6 million in 2005, $0.5 million in 2004, and $0.4
million in 2003.

Securities Due Within One Year

At December 31, 2004, the Company was subject to a first mortgage bond improvement (sinking) fund
requirement of $200,000, or 1 percent of the outstanding bonds authenticated under the first
mortgage bond indenture, other than those issued to collateralize pollution control and other
obligations. This requirement was satisfied by pledging additional property equal to 1 2/3 times
the requirement.

The outstanding first mortgage bonds mature in May 2006; therefore, at December 31, 2005,
there is no remaining sinking fund requirement. Maturities through 2010 applicable to long-term
debt are as follows: $21.0 million in 2006; $1.0 million in 2007; $46.0 million in 2008; $0.8
million in 2009; and $0.5 million in 2010.

Assets Subject to Lien

As amended and supplemented, the Company’s first mortgage bond indenture, which secures the first
mortgage bonds issued by the Company, constitutes a direct first lien on substantially all of the
Company’s fixed property and franchises.

Bank Credit Arrangements

At the beginning of 2006, credit arrangements with banks totaled $80 million, of which $60 million
expires at various times in 2006 and the remaining $20 million expires in 2008. The facilities
expiring in 2006 contain two-year term out provisions and the facility that expires in 2008
contains a one-year term out provision.

In connection with these credit arrangements, the

II-326


NOTES (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2005 Annual Report

Company agrees to pay commitment fees based
on the unused portions of the commitments. Commitment fees are one-eighth of 1 percent or less for
the Company.

The credit arrangements contain covenants that limit the level of indebtedness to
capitalization to 65 percent, as defined in the arrangements. Exceeding these debt levels would
result in a default under the credit arrangements. In addition, the credit arrangements contain
cross default provisions that would be triggered if the Company defaulted on indebtedness over a
specified threshold. The cross default provisions are restricted only to indebtedness of the
Company. The Company is currently in compliance with all such covenants.

The Company may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company subsidiary
organized to issue and sell commercial paper and extendible commercial notes at the request and for
the benefit of the Company and the other Southern Company retail operating companies. Proceeds
from such issuances for the benefit of the Company are loaned directly to the Company and are not
commingled with proceeds from such issuances for the benefit of any other retail operating company.
The obligations of each company under these arrangements are several; there is no cross affiliate
credit support. At December 31, 2005, the Company had $49.9 million in commercial paper and $8.9
million in extendible commercial notes outstanding. During 2005, the peak amount of short-term
debt outstanding was $63.7 million and the average amount outstanding was $41.9 million. The
average annual interest rate on short-term debt was 3.4 percent.

The Company’s committed credit arrangements provide liquidity support to the Company’s
variable rate obligations and to its commercial paper program. At December 31, 2005, the amount of
variable rate obligations outstanding requiring liquidity support was $6.7 million.

Financial Instruments

The Company enters into energy related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, gas, and
other fuel price changes. However, due to cost-based rate regulations, the Company has limited
exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity. The Company has
implemented fuel-hedging programs at the direction of the Georgia PSC. The Company also enters
into hedges of forward electricity sales. There was no material ineffectiveness recorded in
earnings in any period presented.

At December 31, 2005, the fair value of derivative energy contracts was reflected in the
financial statements as follows:

The fair value gains or losses for cash flow hedges that are recoverable through the
regulatory fuel clauses are recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities and are recognized in
earnings at the same time the hedged items affect earnings. The Company has energy-related hedges
in place up to and including 2008.

The Company enters into derivatives to hedge exposure to interest rate changes. Derivatives
related to variable rate securities or forecasted transactions are accounted for as cash flow
hedges. The derivatives are generally structured to mirror the critical terms of the hedged debt
instruments; therefore, no material ineffectiveness has been recorded in earnings.

At December 31, 2005, the Company had $44 million notional amount of interest rate swaps
accounted for as cash flow hedges outstanding with net fair value gains of $0.9 million as follows:

all periods presented, the amounts reclassified from other comprehensive income to
interest expense were not material. For 2006, pre-tax

II-327


NOTES

Electric and Power Company 2005 Annual Report

gains of approximately $0.1 million are
expected to be reclassified from other comprehensive income to interest expense.

Common Stock Dividend Restrictions

The Company’s first mortgage bond indenture contains certain limitations on the payment of cash
dividends on common stock. At December 31, 2005, approximately $68 million of retained earnings
was restricted against the payment of cash dividends on common stock under the terms of the
indenture.

7. COMMITMENTS

Construction Program

The Company is engaged in a continuous construction program, currently estimated to total $44.7
million in 2006, $33.5 million in 2007, and $55.8 million in 2008. The construction program is
subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from the above
estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions;
acquisition of additional generating assets; revised load growth estimates; changes in
environmental regulations; changes in FERC rules and transmission regulations; increasing costs of
labor, equipment, and materials; and cost of capital. Construction related to new transmission and
distribution facilities and capital improvements to existing generation, transmission, and
distribution facilities, including those necessary to meet environmental standards, will continue.
At December 31, 2005, significant purchase commitments were outstanding in connection with the
construction program.

Long-Term Service Agreement

The Company and Georgia Power have entered into a Long-Term Service Agreement (LTSA) with General
Electric (GE) for the purpose of securing maintenance support for the combustion turbines at the
Plant McIntosh combined cycle facility. In summary, the LTSA stipulates that GE will perform all
planned inspections on the covered equipment, which includes the cost of all labor and materials.
GE is also obligated to cover the costs of unplanned maintenance on the covered equipment subject
to a limit specified in the contract.

In general this LTSA is in effect through two major inspection cycles per unit. Scheduled
payments to GE are made at various intervals based on actual operating hours of the respective
units. Total payments by the Company to GE under this agreement are currently estimated at $36
million over the remaining life of the agreement, which may range up to 30 years. However, the
LTSA contains various cancellation provisions at the option of the Company and Georgia Power.

Fuel Commitments

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of its generating plants, the Company has entered into
long-term commitments for the procurement of fuel. In most cases, these contracts contain
provisions for price escalations, minimum purchase levels, and other financial commitments.
Natural gas purchase commitments contain given volumes with prices based on various indices at the
time of delivery. Amounts included in the chart below for natural gas represent estimates based on
New York Mercantile Exchange future prices at December 31, 2005.

Total estimated minimum long-term obligations at December 31, 2005 were as follows:

Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas may be jointly and severally liable. The creditworthiness
of Southern Power and Southern Company Gas is currently inferior to the creditworthiness
of the retail operating companies. Accordingly, Southern Company has entered into keep-well
agreements with the

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Southern Power Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Southern Power Company and
subsidiaries (the “Company”) (a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company) as of December 31,
2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, common
stockholder’s equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2005. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control
over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An
audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements (pages II-348 to II-361) present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Southern Power Company and subsidiaries
at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

OVERVIEW

Business Activities

Southern Power Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the Company) construct, own, and
manage the Southern Company’s competitive generation assets and sell electricity at market-based
rates in the Super-Southeast wholesale market. The Company focused on executing its regional
strategy in 2005 by signing purchased power agreements (PPAs) with investor owned utilities,
electric cooperatives, and municipal suppliers for generation assets in the Southeast.

In June 2005, the Company acquired all of the outstanding general and limited partnership
interests of Oleander Power Project, LP (Oleander) from subsidiaries of Constellation Energy
Group, Inc. Oleander owns a 628 megawatt (MW) dual-fueled simple cycle combustion turbine plant
in Cocoa, Florida, and has PPAs with Florida Power & Light (FPL) and Seminole Electric
Cooperative, Inc. (Seminole) covering the entire output of the plant.

In December 2005, the Company and the Orlando Utilities Commission (OUC) entered into
definitive project agreements to develop an integrated coal gasification combined cycle (IGCC)
project on OUC’s Stanton Energy Center site in Orlando, Florida. In addition, in February 2006,
the Company signed a cooperative agreement with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) that
provides up to $235 million in funding to be applied by the joint owners for the construction
and demonstration of the gasification portion of this project.

As of December 31, 2005, the Company had 5,403 MWs in commercial operation. The weighted
average duration of the Company’s wholesale contracts generally exceeds 10 years, which reduces
remarketing risk. However, the Company continues to face challenges at the federal regulatory
level relative to market power and affiliate transactions.

Key Performance Indicators

To evaluate operating results and to ensure the Company’s ability to meet its contractual
commitments to customers, the Company focuses on several key performance indicators. These
indicators consist of plant availability, peak season equivalent forced outage rate (EFOR), and net income. Plant availability shows the percentage of time during the
year that the Company’s generating units are available to be called upon to generate (the higher
the better), where as the EFOR more narrowly defines the hours during peak demand times when the
Company’s generating units are not available due to forced outages (the lower the better). Net
income is the primary component of the Company’s contribution to Southern Company’s earnings per
share goal. The Company’s actual performance in 2005 surpassed targets in these key performance
areas. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for additional information on the Company’s financial
performance.

Earnings

The Company’s 2005 earnings were $115 million, a $3 million increase over 2004. The 2005 increase
is primarily attributed to the acquisition of Oleander in June 2005 and additional revenues
associated with energy margins from fully contracted units, which were partially offset by the
expiration of PPAs at Plant Dahlberg. In addition, interest expense increased in connection with
the Oleander acquisition as well as the reduction in interest capitalized related to the conclusion
of the Company’s initial construction program.

The Company’s earnings decreased $44 million in 2004 and increased $101 million in 2003.
These changes were primarily the result of a one time $50 million gain in May 2003 from the
termination of PPAs with Dynegy Inc. (Dynegy). In addition, Plant Stanton A, Plant Franklin Unit
2, and Plant Harris Unit 1 and 2 were all placed into service in 2003 and related revenues from
PPAs or opportunity sales began. See Note 2 to the financial statements under “Plant Franklin Unit
3 Construction Project” for additional information on the Dynegy transaction.

Revenues

Operating revenues in 2005 were $781.0 million, a $79.7 million (11.4 percent) increase from
2004. This increase was primarily due to PPAs acquired in the Oleander acquisition, a new PPA
with Flint Energies (Flint EMC), and a full year of revenue from PPAs with Georgia Power at
Plant Franklin Unit 2 and Plant Harris Unit 2. The Georgia Power PPA for Plant Franklin Unit 2
had a scheduled sales increase in June 2004, while the PPA for Plant Harris Unit 2 became
effective June 2004. These increases were partially offset by the expiration of PPAs at Plant
Dahlberg. See FUTURE EARNING POTENTIAL – “Power Sales Agreements” and Note 2 to the financial
statements under “Oleander Acquisition” for additional information.

Operating revenues in 2004 were $701.3 million, a $19.5 million (2.9 percent) increase from
2003. The increase was primarily related to a full year of revenues under PPAs from new units.
Plant Harris Units 1 and 2 and Plant Franklin Unit 2 were placed in service in June 2003. Plant
Stanton A was placed in service in October 2003.

Operating revenues in 2003 were $681.8 million, a $383.0 million (128.2 percent) increase from
2002. In 2003, operating revenues increased due to a one time gain from a termination settlement
with Dynegy and new PPAs or opportunity sales from four new units placed into service. Also
contributing to this increase was a $9.9 million dollar increase in service and fee revenues from
various electric membership cooperative (EMC) contracts.

Capacity revenues are an integral component of the Company’s PPAs with both affiliate and
non-affiliate customers and represent the greatest contribution to net income. Energy under PPAs
is generally sold at variable cost or is indexed to published gas indices. Energy revenues also
include fees for support services, fuel storage, and unit start charges. Details of these PPA
capacity and energy revenues are as follows:

Revenues from sales to affiliated and non-affiliated companies that are not covered by PPAs
are made in accordance with the Intercompany Interchange Contract (IIC), as approved by the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and will vary depending on demand and the availability and
cost of generating resources at each company that participates in the centralized operation and
dispatch of the Southern Company fleet of generating plants (Southern Pool). These transactions do
not have a significant impact on earnings since the energy is generally sold at variable cost.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

Expenses

Fuel and Purchased Power

In 2005, fuel expense increased by $81.9 million or 64.4 percent. The increase was driven by a
54.2 percent increase in the average cost of natural gas per decatherm. In 2004, fuel expense
increased by $11.8 million or 10.3 percent primarily due to increased gas transportation expenses
associated with Plant Harris Unit 2 prior to its commitment with Georgia Power. The average cost
of natural gas per decatherm also increased 8.3 percent from 2003 to 2004. In 2003, fuel expense
increased $17.3 million or 17.7 percent primarily due to the operation of Plant Wansley Units 6 and
7 for a full year, as well as the commencement of commercial operations of Plant Franklin Unit 2
and Plant Harris Units 1 and 2 in June 2003. Opportunity sales made from Plant Franklin Unit 2 and
Plant Harris Unit 2 prior to their commitment under affiliate PPAs also contributed to the increase
in fuel expense. The average cost of natural gas per decatherm increased 24 percent from 2002 to
2003.

A significant upward trend in the cost of natural gas has emerged since 2003, and volatility
in this market is expected to continue. Higher natural gas prices in the United States are the
result of increased demand and slightly lower gas supplies despite increased drilling activity.
Natural gas supply interruptions, such as those caused by the 2005 and 2004 hurricanes result in an
immediate market response; however, the long-term impact of this price volatility may be reduced by
imports of natural gas and liquefied natural gas. Fuel expenses incurred under the Company’s PPAs
are generally the responsibility of the counterparties and do not significantly affect net income.
Under the PPAs, either the Company incurs the fuel expense and concurrently recovers the cost
through energy revenues or the counterparty purchases the fuel directly.

Purchased power decreased $28.4 million in 2005, primarily due to increased PPA commitments
for the Company’s generating resources beginning in June 2004. Previously, capacity from some of
these units was sold into the short-term market and related energy sales were sometimes served with
short-term power purchases from both affiliates and non-affiliates when market costs were lower
than the cost of self-generation.

Purchased power increased $3.2 million in 2004 over 2003, consisting of a $15.4 million
increase for non-affiliates and a $12.3 million decrease for affiliates as a result of the
availability of lower cost energy from contracts with Georgia EMCs and North Carolina
municipalities, in addition to other market sources. Purchased power increased by $131.6 million
in 2003 as a result of the availability of lower cost generating capacity primarily due to the mild
summer weather in Southern Company’s retail service territory.

The amount of purchased power expenses between affiliates and non-affiliates will vary
depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources available throughout the
Southern Company electric system. Load requirements are submitted to the Southern Pool on an
hourly basis and are fulfilled with the lowest cost alternative, whether that is generation owned
by the Company, affiliate-owned generation, or external purchases.

Operations and Maintenance

Other operations and maintenance, depreciation and amortization expenses, and taxes other than
income taxes all increased during the period from 2002 through 2005. These year-to-year increases
are primarily the result of new generating units. In 2002, Plant Wansley Units 6 and 7 and Plant
Franklin Unit 1 were placed into service. Four more units were placed in service in 2003 including
Plant Franklin Unit 2, Plant Harris Units 1 and 2, and Plant Stanton A. Plant Oleander was
acquired in June 2005.

Interest Expense

Interest expense has increased by $13.2 million, $34.4 million, and $22.8 million in 2005, 2004,
and 2003, respectively. These increases were primarily the result of additional debt incurred for
the Oleander acquisition, and a lower percentage of interest costs being capitalized as projects
reached completion, were sold, or were suspended. Plant McIntosh Units 10 and 11 were transferred
to Georgia Power and Savannah Electric and construction was suspended on Plant Franklin Unit 3
during 2004, effectively ceasing all capitalized interest. For additional information, see FUTURE
EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “Construction Projects – Plant Franklin Unit 3” and Note 2 to the financial
statements under “Plant Franklin Unit 3 Construction Project.”

Other Income and Expense

The increases in other income net, in 2004 and 2003 were primarily the result of realized gains and
losses on derivative energy contracts. See FINANCIAL

II-337


MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – “Market Price Risk”
herein and Notes 1 and 5 to the financial statements under “Financial Instruments.”

Effects of Inflation

The Company is party to long-term contracts that are generally based on the recovery of historical
costs. In addition, the income tax laws are based on historical costs. Therefore, inflation
creates an economic loss because the Company is recovering its costs of investments in dollars that
have less purchasing power. While the inflation rate has been relatively low in recent years, it
continues to have an adverse effect on the Company because of the large investment in generating
facilities with long economic lives. Conventional accounting for historical cost does not
recognize this economic loss nor the partially offsetting gain that arises through financing
facilities with fixed-money obligations such as long-term debt.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL

General

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of future
earnings potential. Several factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the
Company’s competitive wholesale energy business. These factors include the ability to achieve
sales growth while containing costs. Another major factor is federal regulatory policy, which may
impact the Company’s level of participation in this market. The level of future earnings depends
on numerous factors including regulatory matters such as those related to affiliate contracts,
sales, creditworthiness of customers, total generating capacity available in the Southeast, and the
successful remarketing of capacity as current contracts expire.

Power Sales Agreements

The Company’s sales are primarily through long-term PPAs. The Company is working to maintain
and expand its share of the wholesale market in the Southeastern power markets. Although there
is currently an oversupply of generating capacity in the Super Southeast, opportunities remain
in certain areas.

In February 2006, the Company entered into a PPA with Florida Municipal Power Agency (FMPA)
to commence in 2007 and extend through 2022. The Company will provide FMPA with the output from
a dedicated unit to be constructed at the Plant Oleander site.

In June 2005 as part of the Oleander acquisition, the Company acquired PPAs with FPL and
Seminole. The FPL PPA is for one unit and extends through the end of May 2007. The Seminole
PPA is for the three remaining units at Plant Oleander and extends through the end of 2009. In
February 2006, the Company signed an extension of the FPL PPA for approximately 160 MWs of
capacity through May 2012. Also in February 2006, the Company signed a new PPA with Seminole
for approximately 320 MWs of capacity through December 2015. See Note 2 to the financial
statements under “Oleander Acquisition” for additional information.

In August 2004, the Company entered into two PPAs with FPL. Under the PPAs, the Company will
provide FPL with a total of 790 MWs of capacity annually from Plant Harris Unit 1 and Plant
Franklin Unit 1 for the period from June 2010 through December 2015. A similar PPA with Progress
Energy Florida (Progress) was signed in November 2004 for 350 MWs from Franklin Unit 1 for the
period June 2010 through December 2015. The Florida Public Service Commission has approved these
contracts.

Also in 2004, the Company executed multiple agreements expanding its relationship with
existing customers. For the years 2005 through 2009, the Company will sell approximately 130 MWs
of additional wholesale capacity from existing resources to Flint EMC. The Company also agreed to
a 10-year extension of the OUC PPA for Stanton Unit A.

In June 2003, the Company placed Plant Franklin Unit 2 and Plant Harris Units 1 and 2 into
commercial operation. In October 2003, the Company placed Plant Stanton A into commercial
operation. In June 2004, sales under PPAs with Georgia Power for the remaining 200 MWs of
uncontracted capacity at Plant Franklin Unit 2 and for Plant Harris Unit 2 began. Sales under PPAs
for the other units became effective upon commercial operation.

Option in 2009 to convert from full requirements to fixed capacity sale.

Although some of the Company’s PPAs are with Southern Company’s five retail operating
companies, the Company’s generating facilities are not in the retail operating companies’ regulated
rate bases, and the Company is not able to seek recovery from their ratepayers for construction,
repair, environmental, or maintenance costs. The Company expects that the capacity payments in the
PPAs will produce sufficient cash flow to meet these costs, pay debt service, and provide an equity
return. However, the Company’s overall profit will depend on numerous factors, including efficient
operation of its generating facilities.

As a general matter, existing PPAs provide that the purchasers are responsible for
substantially all of the cost of fuel relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. To the
extent a particular generating facility does not meet the operational requirements contemplated in
the PPAs, the Company may be responsible for excess fuel costs. With respect to fuel
transportation risk, most of the Company’s PPAs provide that the counterparties are responsible for
procuring and transporting the fuel to the particular generating facility.

Fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs will be recovered through capacity charges
based on dollars-per-kilowatt year or dollars-per-megawatt hour. The Company has long-term service
contracts with General Electric (GE) to reduce its exposure to certain operation and maintenance
costs relating to GE equipment. See Note 6 to the financial statements under “Long-Term Service
Agreements” for additional information.

The Company’s PPAs with non-affiliated counterparties have provisions that require the posting
of collateral or an acceptable substitute guarantee in the event that Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s
downgrades the credit ratings of such counterparty to below investment grade or the counterparty is
not rated or fails to maintain a minimum coverage ratio. The PPAs are expected to provide the
Company with a stable source of revenue during their respective terms.

FERC Matters

Market-Based Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates at market-based prices
and to make short-term opportunity sales at market rates. Specific FERC approval must be obtained
with respect to a market-based contract with an affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation
dominance within its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other
markets is not an issue in that proceeding. In February 2005, Southern Company submitted
responsive information. In February 2006, the FERC suspended the proceeding to allow the
parties to conduct settlement discussions. Any new market-based rate transactions in Southern
Company’s retail service territory entered into after February 27, 2005 are subject to refund to
the level of the default cost-based rates, pending the outcome of the proceeding. The impact of
such sales through December 31, 2005 is expected to be immaterial to the Company. The refund
period covers 15-months. In the event that the FERC’s default mitigation measures for entities
that are found

II-339


MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

to have market power are ultimately applied, the Company may be required to charge cost-based
rates for certain wholesale sales in the Southern Company retail service territory, which may be
lower than negotiated market-based rates. The final outcome of this matter will depend on the
form in which the final methodology for assessing generation market power and mitigation rules
may be ultimately adopted and cannot be determined at this time.

In addition, in May 2005, the FERC started an investigation to determine whether Southern
Company satisfies the other three parts of the FERC’s market-based rate analysis: transmission
market power, barriers to entry, and affiliate abuse or reciprocal dealing. The FERC established a
new refund period related to this expanded investigation. Any and all new market-based rate
transactions both inside and outside Southern Company’s retail service territory involving any
Southern Company subsidiary, including the Company, are subject to refund to the extent the FERC
orders lower rates as a result of this new investigation, with the 15-month refund period beginning
July 19, 2005. The impact of such sales through December 31, 2005 is expected to be immaterial to
the Company. The FERC also directed that
this expanded proceeding be held in abeyance pending the outcome of the proceeding on the IIC
discussed below.

The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for this proceeding and is vigorously
defending itself in this matter. However, the final outcome of this matter, including any remedies
to be applied in the event of an adverse ruling in this proceeding, cannot now be determined.

Intercompany Interchange Contract

The Company’s generation fleet is operated under the IIC, as approved by the FERC. In May 2005,
the FERC initiated a new proceeding to examine (1) the provisions of the IIC among Alabama Power,
Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, Savannah Electric, the
Company, and Southern Company Services, Inc. (SCS), as agent,
under the terms of which the power pool of Southern Company is operated, and, in particular, the
propriety of the continued inclusion of the Company as a party to the IIC, (2) whether any parties
to the IIC have violated the FERC’s standards of conduct applicable to utility companies that are
transmission providers, and (3) whether Southern Company’s code of conduct defining the Company as
a “system company” rather than a “marketing affiliate” is just and reasonable. In connection with
the formation of the Company, the FERC authorized the Company’s inclusion in the IIC in 2000. The
FERC also previously approved Southern Company’s code of conduct. The FERC order directs that the
administrative law judge who presided over a proceeding involving the approval of PPAs between the
Company and Georgia Power and Savannah Electric be assigned to preside over the hearing in this
proceeding and that the testimony and exhibits presented in that proceeding be preserved to the
extent appropriate. Hearings are scheduled for September 2006. Effective July 19, 2005, revenues
from transactions under the IIC involving any Southern Company subsidiaries, including the Company,
are subject to refund to the extent the FERC orders any changes to the IIC.

The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for this proceeding and is vigorously
defending itself in this matter. However, the final outcome of this matter, including any remedies
to be applied in the event of an adverse ruling in this proceeding, cannot now be determined.

Environmental Matters

The Company’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by state and federal environmental
agencies under a variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental media, including air,
water, and land resources. Such statutes and regulations include the Clean Air Act; the Clean
Water Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Emergency Planning & Community
Right-to-Know Act; the Endangered Species Act; and related federal and state regulations.
Compliance with possible additional federal or state legislation or regulations related to global
climate change, air quality, or other environmental and health concerns could also affect the
Company.

New environmental legislation or regulations, or changes to existing statutes or regulations
could affect many areas of the Company’s operations. While the Company’s PPAs generally contain
provisions that permit charging the counterparty with some of the new costs incurred as a result of
changes in environmental laws and regulations, the full impact of any such regulatory or
legislative changes cannot be determined at this time.

MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

Because each of the Company’s units are newer gas-fired generating facilities, costs
associated with environmental compliance for these facilities have been less significant than for
similarly situated coal-fired generating facilities or older gas-fired generating facilities.
Environmental, natural resource, and land use concerns, including the applicability of air quality
limitations, the availability of water withdrawal rights, uncertainties regarding aesthetic impacts
such as increased light or noise, and concerns about potential adverse health impacts, can,
however, increase the cost of siting and operating any type of future electric generating facility.
The impact of such statutes and regulations on the Company as a result of generating facilities
that may be acquired or constructed in the future cannot be predicted at this time.

Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage,
personal injury and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements such as opacity and other air
quality standards, has increased generally throughout the United States. In particular, personal
injury claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become more
frequent. The ultimate outcome of such potential litigation against the Company cannot be
predicted at this time.

Construction Projects

Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC

)

In December 2005, the Company and OUC executed definitive agreements for development of the
IGCC, a project of approximately 285 MW in Orlando, Florida, adjacent to Plant Stanton Unit A,
which is co-owned by the Company, OUC and others. The definitive agreements provide that the
Company will own at least 65 percent of the gasifier portion of the project. OUC will own the
remainder of the gasifier portion and 100 percent of the combined cycle portion of the project.
OUC will make capacity payments for all of the Company’s gasifier capacity once the plant is in
commercial operation. The Company will construct the project and bill OUC a fixed price for its
share in the project. The Company will also manage operations after construction is completed
using a joint staff of OUC and SCS employees.

A cooperative agreement with DOE was signed in February 2006, which provides for up to $235
million in funding from the DOE to be applied by the joint owners for the construction and
demonstration of the gasification portion of the project. The DOE will provide the funding in
four phases throughout the development and demonstration of the gasifier. The Company’s share
of the total cost related to the gasifier portion of the project is currently estimated at
approximately $121 million. The IGCC project, subject to National Environmental Policy Act
review and state environmental reviews and certain regulatory approvals, is expected to begin
commercial operation in 2010.

Plant Franklin Unit 3

In August 2004, the Company completed limited construction activities on Plant Franklin Unit 3 to
preserve the long-term viability of the project and suspended further construction. Final
completion is not anticipated until the 2008-2011 period. See Note 2 to the financial statements
under “Plant Franklin Unit 3 Construction Project” for more information. The final outcome of this
matter cannot now be determined.

Other Matters

The Company is currently conducting a depreciation study to update the composite depreciation rates
for its property, plant, and equipment. The impact of this possible change cannot be determined at
this time.

From time to time, the Company is involved in various other matters being litigated and
regulatory matters that could affect future earnings. See Note 2 to the financial statements for
information regarding material issues.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may
have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations and related disclosures.
Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different
from those recorded in the financial statements. Management has reviewed and discussed the
critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of Southern Company’s Board
of Directors.

II-341


MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

Revenue Recognition

The Company’s revenue recognition depends on appropriate classification and documentation of
transactions in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended and interpreted. In
general, the Company’s power sale transactions can be classified in one of four categories:
non-derivatives, normal sales, cash flow hedges, and mark to market. For more information on
derivative transactions, see FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – “Market Price Risk” herein and
Notes 1 and 5 to the financial statements under “Financial Instruments.” The Company’s revenues
are dependent upon significant judgments used to determine the appropriate transaction
classification, which must be documented upon the inception of each contract. Factors that must be
considered in making these determinations include:

Normal Sale and Non-Derivative Transactions

The Company considers derivative contracts, including capacity contracts, which provide for the
sale of electricity to be physically delivered in quantities within the Company’s available
generating capacity to be normal sales. In accordance with FASB Statement No. 133, such
transactions are accounted for as executory contracts and are not subject to mark to market
accounting. Therefore, the related revenue is recognized, in accordance with Emerging Issues Task
Force (EITF) No. 91-6, Revenue Recognition of Long-Term Power Sales Contracts, on an accrual basis
in amounts equal to the lesser of the levelized amount or the amount billable under the contract,
over the respective contract periods. Revenues from transactions that do not meet the definition
of a derivative are also recorded in this manner. Contracts recorded on the accrual basis
represented the majority of the Company’s operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Cash Flow Hedge Transactions

The Company designates other derivative contracts for the sale of electricity as cash flow hedges
of anticipated sale transactions. These contracts are marked to market through Other Comprehensive
Income over the life of the contract. Realized gains and losses are then recognized in revenues as
incurred.

Mark to Market Transactions

Contracts for sales of electricity that are not normal sales and are not designated as cash flow
hedges are marked to market and recorded directly through net income. Net unrealized gains on such
contracts were not material for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Asset Impairments

The Company’s investments in long-lived assets are primarily generation assets, whether in service
or under construction. The Company evaluates the carrying value of these assets under FASB
Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets, whenever
indicators of potential impairment exist. Examples of impairment indicators could include
significant changes in construction schedules, current period losses combined with a history of
losses, or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in market prices. If an
indicator exists, the asset is tested for recoverability by comparing the asset carrying value to
the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows directly attributable to the asset. A high
degree of judgment is required in developing estimates related to these evaluations, which are
based on projections of various factors, including the following:

•

Future demand for electricity based on projections of economic growth
and estimates of available generating capacity

•

Future power and natural gas prices, which have been quite volatile in
recent years

•

Future operating costs.

To date, the Company’s evaluations of its assets have not required any impairment to be
recorded. See Note 2 to

II-342


MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

the financial statements under “Plant Franklin Unit 3 Construction Project” for additional
information.

New Accounting Standards

Income Taxes

In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 109-1, Application of FASB Statement No.
109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities
Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (FSP 109-1), which requires that the
generation deduction be accounted for as a special tax deduction rather than as a tax rate
reduction. The Company adopted FSP 109-1 in the first quarter of 2005 with no material impact
on its financial statements.

Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations

Effective December 31, 2005, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 47
(FIN 47), Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires that an asset retirement
obligation be recorded even though the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on
future events. For additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements under “Asset
Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of Removal.” The adoption of FIN 47 had no impact on the
Company’s financial statements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

The major change in the Company’s financial condition during 2005 was the June acquisition of
Oleander, which contributed $218 million of utility plant and working capital. See Note 2 to the
financial statements under “Oleander Acquisition” for additional information. The Company has
received investment grade ratings from the major rating agencies.

Sources of Capital

The Company may use operating cash flows, external funds, or equity capital from Southern
Company to finance any new projects, acquisitions and ongoing capital requirements. The Company
expects to generate external funds from the issuance of unsecured senior debt and commercial
paper or utilization of credit arrangements from banks.

The Company’s current liabilities frequently exceed current assets due to the use of
short-term debt as a funding source. At December 31, 2005, the Company had approximately $27.6
million of cash and cash equivalents to meet short-term cash needs and contingencies. To meet
liquidity and capital resource requirements, the Company had at December 31, 2005, $399 million of
unused committed credit arrangements with banks. Subject to certain financial covenants, these
credit arrangements may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes as well as
liquidity support for the Company’s commercial paper program. See Note 5 to the financial
statements under “Bank Credit Arrangements” for additional information.

The Company’s commercial paper program is used to finance acquisition and construction costs
related to electric generating facilities and for general corporate purposes. At December 31,
2005, there was $110.7 million of commercial paper outstanding. See Note 5 to the financial
statements under “Commercial Paper” for additional information.

The issuance of all securities by the Company is generally subject to regulatory approval by
the FERC. The amounts of securities authorized by the FERC are continuously monitored and
appropriate filings are made to ensure flexibility in the capital markets. Additionally, with
respect to the public offering of securities, the Company will be required to file registration
statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended.

Credit Rating Risk

The Company does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment
schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating change to BBB- or Baa3, or below.
These contracts are primarily for physical electricity purchases and sales. At December 31,
2005 the maximum potential collateral requirements at BBB- or Baa3 were approximately $190
million. The maximum potential collateral requirements at a rating below BBB- or Baa3 were
approximately $357 million. Generally, collateral may be provided with a Southern Company
guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. The Company is also party to certain derivative agreements
that could require collateral and/or accelerated payment in the event of a credit rating change
to below investment grade. These agreements are primarily for natural gas price risk management
activities. At December 31, 2005, the

II-343


MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

Company had no material exposure related to these agreements.

Subsequent to December 31, 2005, the Company has entered into additional physical
electricity purchases and sales contracts adding $9 million to the maximum potential collateral
requirements at a credit rating of BBB and Baa2 and $17 million at BBB- or Baa3 and below.

Market Price Risk

The Company is exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates, certain energy-related
commodity prices, and, occasionally, currency exchange rates. To manage the volatility
attributable to these exposures, the Company nets the exposures to take advantage of natural
offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to the
Company’s policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and hedging practices. Company policy is
that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes. Derivative positions are monitored
using techniques that include market valuation and sensitivity analysis.

Because energy from the Company’s facilities is primarily sold under long-term PPAs with
tolling agreements and provisions shifting substantially all of the responsibility for fuel cost to
the counterparties, the Company’s exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices
of electricity is limited. To mitigate residual risks in those areas, the Company enters into
fixed-price contracts for the sale of electricity.

The fair value of changes in derivative energy contracts and year-end valuations were as
follows at December 31:

Unrealized pre-tax gains and losses on electric contracts used to hedge anticipated sales,
and gas contracts used to hedge anticipated purchases and sales, are deferred in Other
Comprehensive Income. Gains and losses on contracts that do not represent hedges are recognized
in the income statement as incurred.

At December 31, 2005, the fair value of derivative energy contracts was as follows:

Approximately, $0.1 million, $0.3 million, and $(1.9) million of unrealized pre-tax gains
(losses) were recognized in income in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The Company is
exposed to market-price risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the derivative
energy contracts. The Company’s policy is to enter into agreements with counterparties that
have investment grade credit ratings by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s or with counterparties who
have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. Therefore, the Company does not
anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the counterparties. For additional
information, see Notes 1 and 5 to the financial statements under “Financial Instruments.”

At December 31, 2005, the Company had no variable long-term debt outstanding. Therefore,
there would be no effect on annualized interest expense related to long-term debt if the Company
sustained a 100 basis point change in interest rates. The Company is not aware of any facts or
circumstances that would significantly affect such exposures in the near term.

II-344


MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations

The capital program of the Company is currently estimated to be $162.3 million for 2006, $265.2
million for 2007, and $221.0 million for 2008. These amounts include estimates for potential
plant acquisitions and/or new construction. Currently, there are no plants under construction.
Actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because of changes in factors such as:
business conditions; environmental regulations; FERC rules and transmission regulations; load
projections; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; and the
cost of capital.

Other funding requirements related to obligations associated with scheduled maturities of long-term
debt, as well as the related interest, leases, and other purchase commitments are as follows. See Notes
1, 5, and 6 to the financial statements for additional information.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General

Southern Power Company (the Company) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company, which is
also the parent company of five retail operating companies, Southern Company Services (SCS),
Southern Communications Services (SouthernLINC Wireless), Southern Company Holdings (Southern
Holdings), Southern Nuclear Operating Company (Southern Nuclear), Southern Telecom and other direct
and indirect subsidiaries. The retail operating companies — Alabama Power Company, Georgia Power
Company, Gulf Power Company, Mississippi Power Company, and Savannah Electric and Power Company —
provide electric service in four Southeastern states. The Company constructs, owns and manages
Southern Company’s competitive generation assets and sells electricity at market-based rates in the
wholesale market. Contracts among the retail operating companies and the Company — related to
jointly owned generating facilities, interconnecting transmission lines or the exchange of electric
power — are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). SCS, the system service
company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies.
SouthernLINC Wireless provides digital wireless communications services to the retail operating
companies and also markets these services to the public within the Southeast. Southern Telecom
provides fiber cable services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding
subsidiary for Southern Company’s investments in synthetic fuels and leveraged leases and energy
related businesses. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to Southern Company’s nuclear
power plants. On January 4, 2006, Southern Company completed the sale of substantially all the
assets of Southern Company Gas, its competitive retail natural gas marketing subsidiary.

Southern Company was registered as a holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, as amended (PUHCA), until its repeal on February 8, 2006, and Southern Company and its
subsidiaries, including the Company, were subject to the regulatory provisions of the PUHCA. The
Company is subject to regulation by the FERC. The Company follows accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the use of estimates, and
the actual results may differ from those estimates.

The financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries, Southern Company — Florida LLC (SCF), Oleander Power Project LP (Oleander) and
Southern Power Company — Orlando Gasification LLC (SPC-OG), which were established to own, operate,
and maintain the Company’s ownership interests in Plant Stanton Unit A, Oleander, and the
integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plant, respectively. See Note 2 under “Oleander
Acquisition” and Note 3 for further information. All intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.

Affiliate Transactions

The Company has an agreement with SCS under which the following services are rendered to the
Company at direct or allocated cost: general and design engineering, purchasing, accounting and
statistical analysis, finance and treasury, tax, information resources, marketing, auditing,
insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures and other services
with respect to business and operations and power pool transactions. SCS also enters into fuel
purchase and transportation arrangements and contracts, financial instruments for purposes of
hedging and wholesale energy purchase and sale transactions for the benefit of the Company.
Because the Company has no employees, all employee related charges are rendered at cost under
agreements with SCS or the retail operating companies. Costs for these services from SCS amounted
to approximately $51.9 million in 2005, $46.7 million in 2004, and $47.5 million in 2003.
Approximately $47.8 million in 2005, $40.3 million in 2004, and $32.8 million in 2003, were
general, administrative, operation and maintenance expenses; the remainder was capitalized to
construction work in progress. Cost allocation methodologies used by SCS were approved by the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) prior to the repeal of PUHCA and management believes they
are reasonable.

The Company has agreements with Georgia Power and Alabama Power to provide operations and
maintenance services for Plants Dahlberg, Wansley, Franklin, and Harris. These services are billed
at cost on a monthly basis and are recorded as operations and maintenance expense in the
accompanying statements of

II-353


NOTES

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

income. For the periods ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, these services totaled
approximately $7.1 million, $6.6 million, and $6.1 million, respectively.

Total billings for all purchased power agreements (PPAs) in effect with affiliates totaled
$531 million, $383.0 million, and $282.2 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003 respectively. Included in
these billings were $37.5 million, $39.1 million, and $28.4 million of affiliated deferred capacity
revenues recorded on the balance sheets at December 31, 2005, December 31, 2004, and December 31,
2003, respectively.

The Company and the retail operating companies may jointly enter into various types of
wholesale energy, natural gas, and certain other contracts, either directly or through SCS as
agent. Each participating company may be jointly and severally liable for the obligations incurred
under these agreements.

The Company and the retail operating company affiliates generally settle amounts related to
the above transactions on a monthly basis in the month following the performance of such services
or the purchase or sale of electricity.

Revenues

Capacity is sold at rates specified under contractual terms and is recognized at the lesser of the
levelized amount or the amount billable under the contract over the respective contract periods.
Energy is generally sold at market-based rates and the associated revenue is recognized as the
energy is delivered. See “Financial Instruments” herein for additional information.

Significant portions of the Company’s revenues have been derived from certain customers. For
the year ended December 31, 2005, Georgia Power accounted for 53.6 percent of revenues, while
Alabama Power and Savannah Electric were 8.2 percent and 6.5 percent of revenues, respectively.
For the year ended December 31, 2004, Georgia Power accounted for 40.3 percent of revenues, with
Alabama Power and Savannah Electric accounting for 8.4 percent and 4.5 percent of revenues,
respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2003, Georgia Power accounted for approximately 33.7
percent of revenues, excluding $80 million related to termination of contracts with Dynegy, Inc.
(Dynegy), with Alabama Power and Savannah Electric accounting for 5.5 percent and 5.0 percent,
respectively.

Fuel Costs

Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is consumed.

Income Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provides deferred
income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

The Company’s property, plant, and equipment consist entirely of generation assets.

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost. Original cost includes materials,
direct labor incurred by affiliated companies, minor items of property, and interest capitalized.
Interest is capitalized on qualifying projects during the development and construction period. The
cost to replace significant items of property defined as retirement units is capitalized. The cost
of maintenance, repairs, and replacement of minor items of property is charged to maintenance
expense as incurred.

Manufacturer’s Tax Credits

The State of Georgia provides a tax credit for qualified investment property to manufacturing
companies that construct new facilities. The credit ranges from 1 percent to 5 percent of
construction expenditures depending upon the county in which the new facility is located. The
Company’s policy is to recognize these credits when management believes they are more likely than
not to be allowed by the Georgia Department of Revenue. Manufacturer’s tax credits of $11.8
million were recorded in 2003. There were no credits recorded in 2004 or 2005.

Depreciation

Depreciation of the original cost of assets is computed under the straight-line method based on the
assets’ estimated useful lives determined by the Company. The primary assets in property, plant
and equipment are power plants, all of which have an estimated useful life of 35 years, except
Plant Dahlberg and Plant Oleander which have an estimated useful life of 40 years. These lives
reflect a composite of the significant components (called retirement units) that make up the
plants. Depreciation studies are conducted periodically to update the composite

II-354


NOTES

(continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

rates. When property subject to composite depreciation is retired or otherwise disposed of in the
normal course of business, its cost is charged to accumulated depreciation. For other property
dispositions, the applicable cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the accounts and a
gain or loss is recognized.

Asset Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of Removal

The present value of the ultimate costs for an asset’s future retirement is recorded in the
period in which the liability is incurred. The costs are capitalized as part of the related
long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset’s useful life.

At December 31, 2005, the Company had no liability for asset retirement obligations. In
connection with the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 143,
Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, in January 2003, the Company recorded a reduction
to the accumulated reserve for depreciation and a cumulative effect of change in accounting
principle of $0.6 million ($0.4 million after-tax), representing removal costs for long-lived
assets that the Company did not have a legal obligation to retire.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles

The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of
whether impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows
attributable to the assets, as compared with the carrying value of the assets. If an impairment
has occurred, the amount of the impairment loss recognized is determined by estimating the fair
value of the assets and recording a loss for the amount of the carrying value that is greater than
the fair value. For assets identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the
estimated fair value less the cost to sell in order to determine if an impairment loss is required.
Until the assets are disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or
events change.

Deferred Project Development Costs

The Company capitalizes project development costs once it is determined that it is probable that a
specific site will be acquired and a power plant constructed. These costs include professional
services, permits and other costs directly related to the construction of a new project. These
costs are generally transferred to construction work in progress upon commencement of construction.
The total deferred project development costs were $3.8 million at December 31, 2005 and $3.2
million at December 31, 2004.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are considered cash
equivalents. Temporary cash investments are securities with original maturities of 90 days or
less.

Materials and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include generating plant materials. Materials are charged to
inventory when purchased and then expensed or capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when installed.
Materials and supplies are recorded at average cost.

Fuel Inventory

Fuel inventory includes the average cost of oil and emission allowances. The Company maintains
minimal oil levels for use at Plant Dahlberg and Plant Oleander. Inventory is maintained using the
weighted average cost method. Fuel and emissions are charged to inventory when purchased and then
expensed as used.

Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to fluctuations in interest
rates, the prices of certain fuel purchases and electricity purchases and sales. All derivative
financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair
value. Substantially all of the Company’s bulk energy purchases and sales contracts that meet the
definition of a derivative are exempt from fair value accounting requirements and are accounted for
under the accrual method. Other derivative contracts qualify as cash flow hedges of anticipated
transactions. This results in the deferral of related gains and losses in Other Comprehensive
Income

II-355


NOTES

(continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

until the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness is recognized currently in net income.
Other derivative contracts are marked to market through current period income and are recorded on a
net basis in the statements of income.

The Company is exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of
counterparties’ nonperformance. The Company has established controls to determine and monitor
the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate the Company’s exposure to
counterparty credit risk.

The Company’s financial instruments for which the carrying amounts did not equal fair value at
December 31 were as follows:

Carrying

Fair

Amount

Value

(in millions)

Long-term debt:


$

1,100

$

1,117


$

1,099

$

1,114

The fair values for securities were based on either closing market prices or closing prices of
comparable instruments.

Comprehensive Income

The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of all changes in common stock equity
of an enterprise that result from transactions and other economic events of the period other than
transactions with owners. Comprehensive income consists of net income and changes in the fair
value of qualifying cash flow hedges, less income taxes and reclassifications of amounts included
in net income.

2. CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY
MATTERS

General Litigation Matters

From time to time, the Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the
ordinary course of business. In addition, the Company’s business activities are subject to
extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation over
environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury and
citizen enforcement of environmental requirements such as opacity or other air quality standards,
has increased generally throughout the United States. In particular, personal injury claims for
damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become more frequent. The ultimate
outcome of such potential litigation against the Company cannot be predicted at this time; however,
management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising would have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s financial statements.

FERC Matters

Market-Based Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates at market-based
prices and to make short-term opportunity sales at market rates. Specific FERC approval must be
obtained with respect to a market-based contract with an affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation
dominance within its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in
other markets is not an issue. In February 2005, Southern Company submitted responsive
information. In February 2006, the FERC suspended the proceeding to allow the parties to
conduct settlement discussions. Any new market-based rate transactions in the Southern Company
retail service territory entered into after February 27, 2005 are subject to refund to the level
of the default cost-based rates, pending the outcome of the proceeding. The impact of such
sales through December 31, 2005 is expected to be immaterial to the Company. The refund period
covers 15 months. In the event that the FERC’s default mitigation measures for entities that
are found to have market power are ultimately applied, the Company may be required to charge
cost-based rates for certain wholesale sales in the Southern Company retail service territory,
which may be lower than negotiated market-based rates. The final outcome of this matter will
depend on the form in which the final methodology for assessing generation market power and
mitigation rules may be ultimately adopted and cannot be determined at this time.

In addition, in May 2005, the FERC started an investigation to determine whether Southern
Company satisfies the other three parts of the FERC’s market-based rate analysis: transmission
market power, barriers to entry, and affiliate abuse or reciprocal dealing. The FERC established a
new refund period related to this expanded

II-356


NOTES

(continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

investigation. Any and all new market-based rate transactions both inside and outside Southern
Company’s retail service territory involving any Southern Company subsidiary, including the
Company, are subject to refund to the extent the FERC orders lower rates as a result of this new
investigation, with the 15-month refund period beginning July 19, 2005. The impact of such sales
through December 31, 2005 is expected to be immaterial to the Company. The FERC also directed that
this expanded proceeding be held in abeyance pending the outcome of the proceeding on the
Intercompany Interchange Contract (IIC) discussed below.

The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for this proceeding and is vigorously
defending itself in this matter. However, the final outcome of this matter, including any remedies
to be applied in the event of an adverse ruling in this proceeding, cannot now be determined.

Intercompany Interchange Contract

The Company’s generation fleet is operated under the IIC, as approved by the FERC. In May 2005,
the FERC initiated a new proceeding to examine (1) the propriety of the continued inclusion of the
Company as a party to the IIC, (2) whether any parties to the IIC have violated the FERC’s
standards of conduct applicable to utility companies that are transmission providers, and (3)
whether Southern Company’s code of conduct defining the Company as a “system company” rather than a
“marketing affiliate” is just and reasonable. In connection with the formation of the Company, the
FERC authorized the Company’s inclusion in the IIC in 2000. The FERC also previously approved
Southern Company’s code of conduct. The FERC order directs that the administrative law judge who
presided over a proceeding involving approval of PPAs between the Company, Georgia Power, and
Savannah Electric be assigned to preside over the hearing in this proceeding and that the testimony
and exhibits presented in that proceeding be preserved to the extent appropriate. Hearings are
scheduled for September 2006. Effective July 19, 2005, revenues from transactions under the IIC
involving any Southern Company subsidiaries, including the Company, will be subject to refund to
the extent the FERC orders any changes to the IIC.

The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for this proceeding and is vigorously
defending itself in this matter. However, the final outcome of this matter, including any remedies
to be applied in the event of an adverse ruling in this proceeding, cannot now be determined.

Oleander Acquisition

On June 7, 2005, the Company acquired all of the outstanding general and limited partnership
interests of Oleander from subsidiaries of Constellation Energy Group, Inc. The results of
Oleander’s operations have been included in the financial statements since that date. The
Company’s acquisition of the general and limited partnership interests in Oleander was pursuant to
a Purchase and Sale Agreement dated April 8, 2005, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately
$206 million, plus approximately $12 million of working capital and other adjustments. Plant
Oleander is a dual-fueled generating plant in Brevard County, Florida with a nameplate capacity of
628 megawatts (MW). The entire output of Plant Oleander is sold under separate PPAs with Florida
Power & Light Company (FPL) and Seminole Electric Cooperative, Inc. (Seminole). The PPA with FPL
is for one unit and extends through the end of May 2007. The Seminole PPA is for the remaining
three units at Oleander and extends through the end of 2009. In February 2006, FPL extended its
PPA for approximately 160 MW through 2012 and Seminole signed a new PPA for approximately 320 MW of
capacity through 2015.

Plant Franklin Unit 3 Construction Project

In May 2003, the Company entered into an agreement with Dynegy to resolve all outstanding matters
related to capacity sales contracts with subsidiaries of Dynegy. Under the terms of the agreement,
Dynegy made a cash termination payment of $80 million to the Company. The termination payments
from Dynegy resulted in a one-time gain to the Company of approximately $50 million. As a result
of the contract termination, the Company has completed limited construction activities on Plant
Franklin Unit 3 to preserve the long-term viability of the project but has deferred final
completion until the 2008-2011 period. The length of the deferral period will depend on forecasted
capacity needs and other wholesale market opportunities. As of December 31, 2005, the Company’s
investment in Unit 3 of Plant Franklin was $171.5 million. The final outcome of this matter cannot
now be determined.

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

3. JOINT OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS

The Company is a 65 percent owner of Plant Stanton A, a combined-cycle project with 630 MWs. The
unit is co-owned by the Orlando Utilities Commission (OUC) (28 percent), Florida Municipal Power
Agency (3.5 percent), and Kissimmee Utility Authority (3.5 percent). The Company has a service
agreement with SCS whereby SCS is responsible for the operations and maintenance of Plant Stanton
A. As of December 31, 2005, $155.7 million was recorded in plant in service with associated
accumulated depreciation of $10 million. The Company’s proportionate share of Plant Stanton A’s
operating expense is included in the corresponding operating expenses in the statements of income.

The Company will be a 65 percent owner of the gasifier island portion of the new IGCC project
at OUC’s Stanton Energy Center site. OUC will own the remaining 35 percent of the gasifier and 100
percent of the combined cycle portion of the IGCC project. The Company will construct the project
for OUC at a fixed price. OUC will purchase the Company’s 65 percent capacity in the gasification
island for 20 years after the date of commercial operation. In addition, the Company will manage
the operations of the project after construction is completed using a joint staff of OUC and SCS
employees.

A cooperative agreement with DOE was signed in February 2006, which provides for up to $235
million in funding from the DOE to be applied by the joint owners for the construction and
demonstration of the gasification portion of the project. The DOE will provide the funding in
four phases throughout the development and demonstration of the gasifier. The Company’s share
of the total cost related to the gasifier portion of the project is currently estimated at
approximately $121 million. The IGCC project, subject to National Environmental Policy Act
review and state environmental reviews and certain regulatory approvals, is expected to begin
commercial operation in 2010.

4. INCOME TAXES

Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and combined tax returns for the
State of Georgia, the State of Alabama and the State of Mississippi. Under a joint consolidated
income tax allocation agreement, each subsidiary’s current and deferred tax expense is computed on
a stand-alone basis, and no subsidiary is allocated more expense than would be paid if they filed a
separate income tax return. In accordance with Internal Revenue Service regulations, each company
is jointly and severally liable for the tax liability.

construction project to Georgia Power and Savannah Electric in 2004 resulted in a deferred gain for
federal income tax purposes. Georgia Power and Savannah Electric are reimbursing the Company for
the related tax liability balance of $6.3 million. Of this total, $1.9 million is included in the
balance sheet in Affiliated Accounts Receivable and the remainder is included in Other Affiliated
Deferred Debits.

Deferred tax assets consist primarily of timing differences related to the recognition of
capacity revenues, and the tax impact related to the deferred loss on interest rate swaps reflected
in Other Comprehensive Income. The transfer of Plants Dahlberg, Wansley, and Franklin to the
Company from Georgia Power in 2001 also resulted in a deferred gain for federal income tax
purposes. The Company will reimburse Georgia Power for the related tax asset of $12.2 million. Of
this total, $1.4 million is included in the balance sheet in Affiliated Accounts Payable and the
remainder is included in Other Affiliated Deferred Credits.

5. FINANCING

Bank Credit Arrangements

The Company has a $400 million unsecured syndicated revolving credit facility (Facility) expiring
in April 2010. The purpose of the Facility is to provide liquidity support to the Company’s
commercial paper program and other general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2005, the Company
had $399 million available under the Facility.

The Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the unused balance of the Facility. This
fee is less than 1/8 of 1 percent. For the period ended December 31, 2005, the Company incurred
approximately $0.8 million in expense from commitment fees under the Facility. Under a previous
credit facility, for the periods ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company incurred expenses of
$2.1 million and $2.1 million from commitment fees, respectively.

The Facility contains a covenant that requires a maximum 65 percent debt to capitalization
ratio, as defined in the Facility. The Facility also contains a cross default provision that would
be triggered if the Company defaulted on other indebtedness above a specified threshold. As of
December 31, 2005, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants.

Dividend Restriction

The Facility also contains certain limitations on the payment of common stock dividends. No
dividends may be paid unless, as of the end of any calendar quarter, the Company’s projected cash
flows from fixed priced capacity PPAs (as defined in the agreement) are at least 80 percent of
total projected cash flows for the next twelve months or the Company’s debt to capitalization ratio
is no greater than 60 percent. At December 31, 2005, the Company was in compliance with these
ratios and had no restrictions on its ability to pay dividends.

Commercial Paper

The Company has the ability to borrow under a commercial paper program. For the periods ended
December 31, 2005 and 2004, the peak commercial paper balance outstanding was $184.7 million and
$114.5 million, respectively. The average amount outstanding was $63 million and $49.6 million in
2005 and 2004, respectively. The average annual interest rate was 3.7 percent in 2005 and 1.14
percent in 2004. As of December 31, 2005, the commercial paper program had an outstanding balance
of $110.7 million. There was no commercial paper outstanding on December 31, 2004.

Financial Instruments

The Company enters into energy related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, gas, and
other fuel price changes. The Company’s exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices
and prices of electricity is limited because its long-term sales contracts shift substantially
all fuel cost responsibility to the purchaser. The Company may enter into interest rate swaps
to limit exposure to interest rate changes. Swaps related to variable rate securities or
forecasted transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges.

II-359


NOTES

(continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2005 Annual Report

These swaps are generally structured to match the critical terms of the hedged debt instruments;
therefore, no material ineffectiveness has been recorded in earnings.

At December 31, 2005, the Company had no interest derivatives outstanding. The Company has
deferred losses totaling $82.4 million in other comprehensive income that will be amortized to
interest expense through 2013 over the life of the related senior notes. For the years 2005,
2004, and 2003, approximately $11.2 million, $10.4 million, and $5.5 million, respectively, of
pre-tax losses were reclassified from other comprehensive income to interest expense. During
2006, approximately $11.9 million of pre-tax losses are expected to be reclassified from other
comprehensive income to interest expense.

Fair value gains or losses for cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income and
reclassified to fuel expense. There were no material amounts reclassified during any year
presented. For the year 2006, the reclassifications from other comprehensive income to fuel
expense are expected to be immaterial. There was no significant ineffectiveness recorded in
earnings for any period presented. The Company has energy-related hedges in place through 2007.
Additionally, there are deferred realized net hedging gains relating to capitalized costs and
revenues during the construction of specific plants that will be reclassified from other
comprehensive income to depreciation and amortization over the remaining life of the respective
plants, which is approximately 32 years. For the years 2005, 2004, and 2003, approximately $0.3
million per year of pre-tax gains were reclassified from other comprehensive income to depreciation
and amortization. For 2006, approximately $0.3 million of pre-tax gains are expected to be
reclassified from other comprehensive income to depreciation and amortization.

6. COMMITMENTS

Construction Program

The Company currently estimates property additions to be $162.3 million, $265.2 million, and $221.0
million in 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively. There are currently no plants actively under
construction. See Note 2 under “Plant Franklin Unit 3 Construction Project” for additional
information.

Long-Term Service Agreements

The Company has entered into several Long-Term Service Agreements (LTSAs) with General Electric
(GE) for the purpose of securing maintenance support for its combined cycle and combustion turbine
generating facilities. In summary, the LTSAs provide that GE will perform all planned inspections
on the covered equipment, which includes the cost of all labor and materials. GE is also obligated
to cover the costs of unplanned maintenance on the covered equipment subject to a limit specified
in each contract.

In general, except for Plants Dahlberg and Oleander, these LTSAs are in effect through two
major inspection cycles per unit. The Dahlberg and Oleander agreements are in effect through the
first hot gas path inspections and last combustion inspections, respectively, of each unit.
Scheduled payments to GE are made at various intervals based on actual operating hours of the
respective units. Total payments to GE under these agreements are $1.1 billion over the remaining
term of the agreements, which may range up to 30 years per unit. However, the LTSAs contain
various cancellation provisions at the Company’s option.

Payments made to GE prior to the performance of any planned inspections are recorded as a
long-term prepayment in Deferred Charges and Other Assets on the balance sheets. Inspection costs
are capitalized or charged to expense based on the nature of the work performed.

Fuel Commitments

SCS, as agent for the retail operating companies and the Company, has entered into various fuel
transportation and procurement agreements to supply a portion of the fuel (primarily natural gas)
requirements for the operating facilities. In most cases, these contracts contain provisions for
firm transportation costs, storage costs, minimum purchase levels and other financial commitments.

Additional commitments for fuel will be required to supply the Company’s future needs.

Acting as an agent for all of Southern Company’s retail operating companies, the Company
and Southern Company Gas, SCS may enter into various types of wholesale energy and natural gas
contracts. Under these agreements, each of the retail operating companies, the Company and
Southern Company Gas may be jointly and severally liable. The creditworthiness of the Company
and Southern Company Gas is currently inferior to the creditworthiness of the retail operating
companies; therefore, Southern Company has entered into keep-well agreements with each of the
retail operating companies to insure they will not subsidize nor be responsible for any costs,
losses, liabilities or damages resulting from the inclusion of the Company and Southern Company
Gas as a contracting party under these agreements.

The amounts shown in the table were calculated according to the final average pay formula and
are based on a single life annuity without reduction for joint and survivor annuities or
computation of Social Security offset that would apply in most cases.

In 1998, Savannah Electric merged its pension plan into the Southern Company Pension Plan.
Savannah Electric also has in effect a supplemental executive retirement plan for certain of its
executive employees. The plan is designed to provide participants with a supplemental retirement
benefit, which, in conjunction with Social Security and benefits under Southern Company’s qualified
pension plan, will equal 70 percent of the highest three of the final 10 years’ average annual
earnings (excluding incentive compensation).

The following table sets forth the estimated combined annual pension benefits under Southern
Company’s pension and Savannah Electric’s supplemental executive retirement plans in effect during
2005 which are payable to Messrs. Greer and Willis, upon retirement at the normal retirement age
after designated periods of accredited service and at a specified compensation level.

pro-rata payments at not less than target-level performance if a change in control occurs and
the plan is not continued or replaced with a comparable plan or plans.

On May 31, 2002, Southern Company, SCS and Mr. Christopher Womack entered into a Deferred
Compensation Agreement which, upon Mr. Womack’s termination, will pay him a monthly amount equal
