PART I

Item 1. BUSINESS

Southern Company was incorporated under the laws of Delaware on November 9, 1945.
Southern Company is domesticated under the laws of Georgia and is qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation under the laws of Alabama. Southern Company owns all the outstanding common
stock of Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power and Savannah Electric, each of
which is an operating public utility company. The retail operating companies supply electric
service in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi and Georgia, respectively. More
particular information relating to each of the retail operating companies is as follows:

Alabama Power

is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Alabama on November 10,
1927, by the consolidation of a predecessor Alabama Power Company, Gulf Electric Company and
Houston Power Company. The predecessor Alabama Power Company had had a continuous existence
since its incorporation in 1906.

business in Mississippi on December 23, 1924, and in Alabama on December 7, 1962.

Savannah Electric

is a corporation existing under the laws of the State of Georgia; its charter
was granted by the Secretary of State on August 5, 1921.

In addition, Southern Company owns all of the common stock of Southern Power, which is also an
operating public utility company. Southern Power constructs, owns and manages Southern Company’s
competitive generation assets and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market.
Southern Power is a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware on January 8, 2001, and
admitted to do business in Alabama, Florida and Georgia on January 10, 2001 and in Mississippi on
January 30, 2001.

Southern Company also owns all the outstanding common stock of SouthernLINC Wireless, Southern
Company GAS, Southern Nuclear, SCS, Southern Telecom, Southern Holdings and other direct and
indirect subsidiaries. SouthernLINC Wireless provides digital wireless communications services to
the retail operating companies and also markets these services to the public within the Southeast.
Southern Company GAS, which began operation in August 2002, is a competitive retail natural gas
marketer serving communities in Georgia. Southern Nuclear provides services to Alabama Power’s and
Georgia Power’s nuclear plants. SCS is the system service company providing, at cost, specialized
services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern Telecom provides wholesale
fiber optic solutions to telecommunication providers in the Southeastern United States. Southern
Holdings is an intermediate holding subsidiary for Southern Company’s investments in synthetic
fuels and leveraged leases and various other energy-related businesses.

Alabama Power and Georgia Power each own 50% of the outstanding common stock of SEGCO. SEGCO
is an operating public utility company that owns electric generating units with an aggregate
capacity of 1,019,680 kilowatts at Plant Gaston on the Coosa River near Wilsonville, Alabama.

The SOUTHERN System

Retail Operating Companies

The transmission facilities of each of the retail operating companies are connected to the
respective company’s own generating plants and other sources of power and are interconnected with
the transmission facilities of the other retail operating companies and SEGCO by means of
heavy-duty high voltage lines. For information on Georgia Power’s integrated transmission system,
see BUSINESS — “Territory Served by the Utilities” in Item 1 herein for additional information.

Operating contracts covering arrangements in effect with principal neighboring utility systems
provide for capacity exchanges, capacity purchases and sales, transfers of economy energy and other
similar transactions. Additionally, the retail operating companies have entered into voluntary
reliability agreements with the subsidiaries of Entergy Corporation, Florida Electric Power
Coordinating Group and TVA and with Carolina Power & Light Company, Duke Energy Corporation, South
Carolina Electric & Gas Company and Virginia Electric and Power Company, each of which provides for
the establishment and periodic review of principles and procedures for planning and operation of
generation and transmission facilities, maintenance schedules, load retention programs, emergency
operations and other matters affecting the reliability of bulk power supply. The retail operating
companies have joined with other utilities in the Southeast (including those referred to above) to
form the SERC to augment further the reliability and adequacy of bulk power supply. Through the
SERC, the retail operating companies are represented on the National Electric Reliability Council.

An intra-system interchange agreement provides for coordinating operations of the power
producing facilities of the retail operating companies and Southern Power and the capacities
available to such companies from non-affiliated sources and for the pooling of surplus energy
available for interchange. Coordinated operation of the entire interconnected system is conducted
through a central power supply coordination office maintained by SCS. The available sources of
energy are allocated to the retail operating companies and Southern Power to provide the most
economical sources of power consistent with reliable operation. The resulting benefits and savings
are apportioned among each of the companies.

SCS has contracted with Southern Company, each retail operating company, Southern Power,
Southern Nuclear, SEGCO and other subsidiaries to furnish, at direct or allocated cost and upon
request, the following services: general and design engineering, purchasing, accounting and
statistical analysis, finance and treasury, tax, information resources, marketing, auditing,
insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures and other services
with respect to business and operations and power pool transactions. Southern Power, Southern
Company GAS, SouthernLINC Wireless and Southern Telecom have also secured from the retail operating
companies certain services which are furnished at cost.

Southern Nuclear has contracts with Alabama Power to operate Plant Farley and with Georgia
Power to operate Plants Hatch and Vogtle. See BUSINESS — “Regulation — Atomic Energy Act of 1954”
in Item 1 herein for additional information.

Southern Power

Southern Power is an electric wholesale generation subsidiary with market-based rates.
Southern Power constructs, owns and manages generating facilities and sells the output under
long-term, fixed-price capacity contracts both to unaffiliated wholesale purchasers as well as to
the retail operating companies (under PPAs approved by the respective PSCs). Southern Power’s
business activities are not subject to traditional state regulation of utilities but are subject to
regulation by the

I-2


FERC. Southern Power has attempted to insulate itself from significant fuel supply, fuel
transportation and electric transmission risks by making such risks the responsibility of the
counterparties to the PPAs. However, Southern Power’s overall profit will depend on the parameters
of the wholesale market and its efficient operation of its wholesale generating assets. At
December 31, 2004, Southern Power had approximately 4,775 megawatts of generating capacity in
commercial operation.

Other Business

In June 2002, Southern Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Southern Company GAS.
Southern Company GAS operates as a retail gas marketer in the State of Georgia. Southern Company
GAS completed its acquisition out of bankruptcy from The New Power Company (New Power) and began
operations in July 2002. Southern Company GAS also purchased proprietary risk management software
and hardware systems, natural gas inventory and accounts receivable from New Power. The total
purchase price was approximately $60 million. Southern Company GAS has a 12.2% market share as of
December 31, 2004.

Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding subsidiary for Southern Company’s investments in
leveraged leases and synthetic fuel products, in addition to Southern Company Energy Solutions LLC,
which provides energy services.

In 1996, SouthernLINC Wireless began serving Southern Company’s retail operating companies and
marketing its services to non-affiliates within the Southeast. Its system covers approximately
127,000 square miles and combines the functions of two-way radio dispatch, cellular phone, short
text and numeric messaging and wireless internet access and data transfer.

These continuing efforts to invest in and develop new business opportunities offer potential
returns exceeding those of rate-regulated operations. However, these activities also involve a
higher degree of risk.

Risk Factors

In addition to the other information in this Form
10-K and other documents filed by Southern Company and/or its subsidiaries with the SEC from time
to time, the following factors should be carefully considered in evaluating Southern Company and
its subsidiaries. Such factors could affect actual results and cause results to differ materially
from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, Southern Company
and/or its subsidiaries. Some or all of these factors may apply to Southern Company and/or its
subsidiaries.

Risks Related to the Energy Industry

Southern Company is subject to substantial governmental regulation. Compliance with current and
future regulatory requirements and procurement of necessary approvals, permits and certificates may
result in substantial costs to Southern Company.

Southern Company is subject to substantial regulation from federal, state and local regulatory
agencies. Southern Company and its subsidiaries are required to comply with numerous laws and
regulations and to obtain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from the governmental
agencies that regulate various aspects of their businesses, including customer rates, service
regulations, retail service territories, sales of securities, asset acquisitions and sales,
accounting policies and practices and the operation of fossil-fuel, hydroelectric and nuclear
generating facilities. For example, the rates charged to wholesale customers by the retail
operating companies and by Southern Power must be approved by the FERC. In addition, the
respective state PSCs must approve the retail operating companies’ rates for retail customers.
Southern Company believes the necessary permits, approvals and certificates have been obtained for
its existing operations and that its business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws;
however, Southern Company is unable to predict the impact on its operating results from future
regulatory activities of these agencies.

Southern Company is also subject to regulation by the SEC under the Holding Company Act. The
rules and regulations promulgated under the Holding Company Act impose a number of restrictions on
the

I-3


operations of registered utility holding companies and their subsidiaries. These restrictions
include a requirement that, subject to a number of exceptions, the SEC approve in advance
securities issuances, acquisitions and dispositions of utility assets or of securities of utility
companies and acquisitions of other businesses. The Holding Company Act also generally limits the
operations of a registered holding company to a single integrated public utility system, plus
additional energy-related businesses. The Holding Company Act requires that transactions between
affiliated companies in a registered holding company system be performed at cost, with limited
exceptions.

The impact of any future revision or changes in interpretations of existing regulations or the
adoption of new laws and regulations applicable to Southern Company or any of its subsidiaries
cannot now be predicted. Changes in regulation or the imposition of additional regulations could
influence Southern Company’s operating environment and may result in substantial costs to Southern
Company.

General Risks Related to Operation of Southern Company’s Utility Subsidiaries

The regional power market in which Southern Company and its subsidiaries compete has changing
transmission regulatory structures, which could affect the ownership of these assets and related
revenues and expenses.

The retail operating companies currently own and operate transmission facilities as part of a
vertically integrated utility. Transmission revenues are not separated from generation and
distribution revenues in their approved retail rates. Federal governmental authorities are
advocating the formation of RTOs and are proposing the adoption of new regulations that would
impact electric markets, including the transmission regulatory structure. Under this new
transmission regulatory structure, the retail operating companies would transfer functional control
(but not ownership) of their transmission facilities to an independent third party. Because it
remains unclear how RTOs will develop or what new market rules will be established, Southern
Company is unable to assess fully the impact that these developments may have on its business.
Southern Company’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities could be adversely affected by
changes in the transmission regulatory structure in its regional power market.

Certain events in the energy markets that are beyond Southern Company’s control have increased the
level of public and regulatory scrutiny in the energy industry and in the capital markets. The
reaction to these events may result in new laws or regulations related to Southern Company’s
business operations or the accounting treatment of its existing operations which could have a
negative impact on Southern Company’s net income or access to capital.

As a result of the energy crisis in California during the summer of 2001, the filing of
bankruptcy by Enron Corporation, investigations by governmental authorities into energy trading
activities and the August 2003 power outage in the Northeast, companies in regulated and
unregulated electric utility businesses have been under an increased amount of public and
regulatory scrutiny with respect to, among other things, accounting practices, financial
disclosures and relationships with independent auditors. The capital markets and ratings agencies
also have increased their level of scrutiny. This increased scrutiny could lead to substantial
changes in laws and regulations affecting Southern Company, including new accounting standards that
could change the way Southern Company is required to record revenues, expenses, assets and
liabilities. These types of disruptions in the industry and any resulting regulations may have a
negative impact on Southern Company’s net income or access to capital.

Deregulation or restructuring in the electric industry may result in increased competition and
unrecovered costs which could negatively impact Southern Company’s earnings and the value of its
assets.

Increased competition, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant
adverse financial impact on Southern Company and its retail operating companies. Increased
competition could result in increased pressure to lower the cost of electricity. Any adoption in
the territories served by the retail operating companies of retail competition and the unbundling
of regulated energy service could have a significant adverse financial impact on Southern Company
and the retail operating companies due to an impairment of assets, a loss of retail customers,
lower profit margins, an inability to recover reasonable costs or increased costs of capital.
Southern Company cannot

I-4


predict if or when it will be subject to changes in legislation or regulation, nor can Southern
Company predict the impact of these changes.

Additionally, the electric utility industry has experienced a substantial increase in
competition at the wholesale level, caused by changes in federal law and regulatory policy. As a
result of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 and the Energy Act, competition in
the wholesale electricity market has greatly increased due to a greater participation by
traditional electricity suppliers, non-utility generators, independent power producers,
wholesale power marketers and brokers, and due to the trading of energy futures contracts on
various commodities exchanges. In 1996, the FERC issued new rules on transmission service to
facilitate competition in the wholesale market on a nationwide basis. The rules give greater
flexibility and more choices to wholesale power customers.

Potential changes to the criteria used by the FERC for approval of market-based contracts may
negatively impact the retail operating companies’ and Southern Power’s ability to charge
market-based rates.

Each of the retail operating companies and Southern Power have authorization from the FERC to
sell power to nonaffiliates at market-based prices. The retail operating companies and Southern
Power also have FERC authority to make short-term opportunity sales at market rates. Specific
FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a market-based contract with an affiliate. In
November 2001, the FERC modified the test it uses to consider utilities’ applications to charge
market-based rates and adopted a new test called the Supply Margin Assessment (SMA). The FERC
applied the SMA to several utilities, including Southern Company, the retail operating companies
and Southern Power, and found Southern Company and others to be “pivotal suppliers” in their
retail service territories and ordered the implementation of several mitigation measures.
Southern Company and others sought rehearing of the FERC order, and the FERC delayed the
implementation of certain mitigation measures. In April 2004, the FERC issued an order that
abandoned the SMA test and adopted a new interim analysis for measuring generation market power.
This new interim approach requires utilities to submit a pivotal supplier screen and a
wholesale market share screen. If the applicant does not pass both screens, there will be a
rebuttable presumption regarding generation market power. The FERC’s order also sets forth
procedures for rebutting these presumptions and addresses mitigation measures for those entities
that are found to have market power. In the absence of specific mitigation measures, the order
includes several cost-based mitigation measures that would apply by default. The FERC also
initiated a new rulemaking proceeding that, among other things, will adopt a final methodology
for assessing generation market power.

In July 2004, the FERC denied Southern Company’s request for rehearing, along with a number
of others, and reaffirmed the interim tests that it adopted in April 2004. In August 2004,
Southern Company submitted a filing to the FERC that included results showing that Southern
Company passed the pivotal supplier screen for all markets and the wholesale market share screen
for all markets except the Southern Company retail service territory. Southern Company also
submitted other analyses to demonstrate that it lacks generation market power. On December 17,
2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation dominance within
its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other markets is not
at issue. As directed by this order, on February 15, 2005, Southern Company submitted
additional information related to generation dominance in its retail service territory. Any new
market-based rate transactions in the Southern Company retail service territory entered into
after February 27, 2005 will be subject to refund to the level of the default cost-based rates,
pending the outcome of the proceeding. Southern Company, along with other utilities, has also
filed an appeal of the FERC’s April and July 2004 orders with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit. The FERC has asked the court to dismiss the appeal on the grounds
that it is premature.

In the event that the FERC’s default mitigation measures are ultimately applied, Southern
Power and the retail operating companies may be required to charge cost-based rates for certain
wholesale sales in the Southern Company retail service territory, which may be lower than
negotiated market-based rates. The final outcome of this matter will depend on

I-5


the form in which the final methodology for assessing generation market power and mitigation
rules may be ultimately adopted and cannot be determined at this time.

Risks Related to Environmental Regulation

Southern Company’s costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant. The costs of
compliance with future environmental laws and the incurrence of environmental liabilities could
harm Southern Company’s cash flow and profitability.

Southern Company and its subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal, state and local
environmental requirements which, among other things, regulate air emissions, water discharges and
the management of hazardous and solid waste in order to adequately protect the environment.
Compliance with these legal requirements requires Southern Company to commit significant
expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment, environmental monitoring, emissions
fees and permits at all of its facilities. These expenditures are significant and Southern Company
expects that they will increase in the future. For example, construction expenditures for
achieving compliance with Title IV of the Clean Air Act totaled approximately $400 million.
Construction expenditures for compliance with the nitrogen oxide emission reduction requirements
totaled approximately
$1.1 billion through 2004 with an additional $500 million committed through 2007 for the states of Alabama and Georgia.

Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage,
personal injury, and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements, has increased generally
throughout the United States. In particular, personal injury claims for damages caused by alleged
exposure to hazardous materials have become more frequent. Although the ultimate outcome of such
litigation cannot be predicted, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any,
arising from such current proceedings would have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition of Southern Company and its subsidiaries.

If Southern Company fails to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by
factors beyond its control, that failure may result in the assessment of civil or criminal
penalties and fines against Southern Company. The EPA has filed civil actions against Alabama
Power, Georgia Power and Savannah Electric alleging violations of the new source review provisions
of the Clean Air Act. The EPA has also issued notices of violation to Gulf Power and Mississippi
Power. In addition, Georgia Power is a party to a civil suit regarding alleged violations of the
Clean Air Act at four units of Plant Wansley. Attorneys general from eight states, each outside of
Southern Company’s service territory, and the corporation counsel for New York City filed a
complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Southern Company
and four other electric power companies. A nearly identical complaint was filed by three
environmental groups in the same court. The complaints allege that the companies’ emissions of
carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, contribute to global warming, which the plaintiffs assert is a
public nuisance. An adverse outcome in any one of these cases could require substantial capital
expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and/or could require payment of substantial
penalties.

Existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised or new laws and regulations seeking
to protect the environment may be adopted or become applicable to Southern Company. Revised or
additional laws and regulations could result in significant additional expense and operating
restrictions on Southern Company’s facilities or increased compliance costs which may not be fully
recoverable from Southern Company’s customers and would therefore reduce Southern Company’s net
income. The cost impact of such legislation would depend upon the specific requirements enacted
and cannot be determined at this time.

Risks Related to Southern Company and its Business

Southern Company may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay
dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay upstream dividends or repay
funds to Southern Company.

Southern Company is a holding company and, as such, Southern Company has no operations of its
own. Southern Company’s ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its
common stock at the current rate is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of its
subsidiaries and their ability to pay upstream dividends or to repay funds to Southern

I-6


Company. Prior to funding Southern Company, Southern Company’s subsidiaries have financial
obligations that must be satisfied, including among others, debt service and preferred stock
dividends. In addition, the Holding Company Act rules limit the dividends that Southern Company’s
subsidiaries may pay from unearned surplus.

Southern Company’s financial performance may be adversely affected if its subsidiaries are unable
to successfully operate their facilities.

Southern Company’s financial performance depends on the successful operation of its
subsidiaries’ electric generating, transmission and distribution facilities. Operating these
facilities involves many risks, including:

A decrease or elimination of revenues from power produced by the electric generating
facilities or an increase in the cost of operating the facilities would reduce Southern Company’s
net income and could decrease or eliminate funds available to Southern Company.

In addition, Southern Company’s non-utility businesses depend on the successful operation of
their respective facilities. For example, SouthernLINC Wireless’ business could be adversely
impacted in the event of a break-down of its telecommunications facilities.

Through its subsidiaries, Southern Company’s revenues depend in part on sales under PPAs. The
failure of a counterparty to one of these PPAs to perform its obligations, or the failure to renew
the PPAs, could have a negative impact on Southern Company’s earnings.

Most of Southern Power’s generating capacity has been sold to purchasers under PPAs having
initial terms of five to 15 years. In addition, the retail operating companies also enter into
PPAs with non-affiliated parties. Southern Company’s revenues are dependent on the continued
performance by the purchasers of their obligations under the PPAs. Even though Southern Power and
the retail operating companies have a rigorous credit evaluation, the failure of one of the
purchasers to perform its obligations could have a negative impact on Southern Company’s earnings.
Although these credit evaluations take into account the possibility of default by a purchaser,
Southern Company’s actual exposure to a default by a purchaser may be greater than the credit
evaluation predicts. Neither Southern Power nor the retail operating companies can predict whether
the PPAs will be renewed at the end of their respective terms or on what terms any renewals may be
made. If a PPA is not renewed, a replacement PPA cannot be assured.

Southern Company and its subsidiaries may incur additional costs or delays in power plant
construction and may not be able to recover their investment. Southern Company’s facilities
require ongoing capital expenditures.

Certain of the retail operating companies and Southern Power are in the process of
constructing new generating facilities. Southern Company intends to continue its strategy of
developing and constructing other new facilities and expanding existing facilities. The completion
of these facilities without delays or cost overruns is subject to substantial risks, including:

If a retail operating company or Southern Power is unable to complete the development or
construction of a

I-7


facility, or if a retail operating company or Southern Power decides to delay or cancel
construction of a facility, it may not be able to recover its investment in that facility. In
addition, construction delays and contractor performance shortfalls can result in the loss of
revenues and may, in turn, adversely affect the results of operations and financial position of a
retail operating company or Southern Power. Furthermore, if construction projects are not
completed according to specification, a retail operating company or Southern Power may incur
liabilities and suffer reduced plant efficiency, higher operating costs and reduced earnings.

Once facilities come into commercial operation, ongoing capital expenditures are required to
maintain reliable levels of operation. Significant portions of the retail operating companies’
existing facilities were constructed many years ago. Older generation equipment, even if
maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant capital
expenditures to maintain efficiency, to comply with changing environmental requirements or to
provide reliable operations.

Changes in technology may make Southern Company’s electric generating facilities less competitive.

A key element of Southern Company’s business model is that generating power at central power
plants achieves economies of scale and produces power at relatively low cost. There are other
technologies that produce power, most notably fuel cells, microturbines, windmills and solar cells.
It is possible that advances in technology will reduce the cost of alternative methods of producing
power to a level that is competitive with that of most central power station electric production.
If this were to happen and if these technologies achieved economies of scale, Southern Company’s
market share could be eroded, and the value of its electric generating facilities could be reduced.
Changes in technology could also alter the channels through which retail electric customers buy
power, which could reduce Southern Company’s revenues or increase expenses.

Operation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, health,
regulatory, terrorism and financial risks that could result in fines or the closure of Southern
Company’s nuclear units, and which may present potential exposures in excess of Southern Company’s
insurance coverage.

Southern Company owns six nuclear units through Alabama Power (two units) and through Georgia
Power, which holds undivided interests in, and contracts for operation of, four units. These six
nuclear units are operated by Southern Nuclear and represent approximately 3,680 megawatts, or 9.5%
of Southern Company’s generation capacity as of December 31, 2004. Southern Company’s nuclear
facilities are subject to environmental, health and financial risks such as on-site storage of
spent nuclear fuel, the ability to dispose of such spent nuclear fuel, the ability to maintain
adequate reserves for decommissioning, potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these
facilities and the threat of a possible terrorist attack. Southern Company maintains
decommissioning trusts and external insurance coverage to minimize the financial exposure to these
risks; however, it is possible that damages could exceed the amount of Southern Company’s insurance
coverage.

The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related
requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. In the event of non-compliance,
the NRC has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its
assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Recent NRC orders
related to increased security measures and any future safety requirements promulgated by the NRC
could require Southern Company to make substantial operating and capital expenditures at its
nuclear plants. In addition, although Southern Company has no reason to anticipate a serious
nuclear incident at its plants, if an incident did occur, it could result in substantial costs to
Southern Company. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC
to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit.

Southern Company’s nuclear units require licenses that, in some cases, need to be renewed or
extended in order to continue operating beyond their initial forty-year terms. As a result of
potential terrorist threats and increased public scrutiny of utilities, the licensing process could
result in increased licensing or compliance costs that are difficult or impossible to predict.

I-8


Southern Company’s generation and energy marketing operations are subject to risks, many of
which are beyond its control, that may reduce Southern Company’s revenues and increase its costs.

Southern Company’s generation and energy marketing operations are subject to changes in power
prices or fuel costs, which could increase the cost of producing power or decrease the amount
Southern Company receives from the sale of power. The market prices for these commodities may
fluctuate over relatively short periods of time. Southern Company attempts to mitigate risks
associated with fluctuating fuel costs by passing these costs on to customers through retail fuel
cost recovery or in its PPAs. Among the factors that could influence power prices and fuel costs
are:

Certain of these factors could increase Southern Company’s expenses. For the retail operating
companies, such increases may not be fully recoverable through rates. Other of these factors could
reduce Southern Company’s revenues.

The use of derivative contracts by Southern Company and its subsidiaries in the normal course of
business could result in financial losses that negatively impact the results of operations of
Southern Company and its subsidiaries.

Southern Company and its subsidiaries use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options,
futures and forwards, to manage their commodity and financial market risks and, to a lesser extent,
engage in limited trading activities. Southern Company and its subsidiaries could recognize
financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts, or if a
counterparty fails to perform. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing
information from external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involve
management’s judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or
use of alternative valuation methods could affect the value of the reported fair value of these
contracts.

Southern Company may not be able to obtain adequate fuel supplies, which could limit its ability to
operate its facilities.

Southern Company purchases fuel from a number of suppliers. Disruption in the delivery of
fuel, including disruptions as a result of, among other things, weather, labor relations or
environmental regulations affecting Southern Company’s fuel suppliers, could limit Southern
Company’s ability to operate its facilities, and thus, reduce its net income.

Southern Company may not be able to obtain adequate supply of coal, which could limit its ability
to operate its facilities.

The retail operating companies are dependent on coal for much of their electric generating
capacity. Each retail operating company has coal supply contracts in place; however, there can be
no assurance that the counterparties to these agreements will fulfill their obligations to supply
coal to the retail operating companies. The suppliers under these agreements may experience
financial or technical problems which inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to the
retail operating companies. In addition, the suppliers under these agreements may not be required
to supply coal to the retail operating companies under certain circumstances, such as in the event
of a natural disaster.

I-9


If the retail operating companies are unable to obtain their coal requirements under these
contracts, the retail operating companies may be required to purchase their coal requirements at
higher prices, which may not be fully recoverable through rates.

Demand for power could exceed Southern Company’s supply capacity, resulting in increased costs to
Southern Company for purchasing capacity in the open market or building additional generation
capabilities.

Southern Company is currently obligated to supply power to regulated retail and wholesale
customers under long-term PPAs. At peak times, the demand for power required to meet this
obligation could exceed Southern Company’s available generation capacity. Market or competitive
forces may require that Southern Company purchase capacity on the open market or build additional
generation capabilities. Because regulators may not permit the retail operating companies to pass
all of these purchase or construction costs on to their customers, the retail operating companies
may not be able to recover any of these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated
with the time between the incurrence of costs of purchased or constructed capacity and the retail
operating companies’ recovery in customers’ rates. Under Southern Power’s long-term fixed price
PPAs, Southern Power would not have the ability to recover any of these costs.

Southern Company’s operating results are affected by weather conditions and may fluctuate on a
seasonal and quarterly basis.

Electric power generation is generally a seasonal business. In many parts of the country,
demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time.
In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter. As a result, Southern Company’s overall
operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. In addition,
Southern Company has historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income, when
weather conditions are milder. Unusually mild weather in the future could reduce Southern Company’s
revenues, net income, available cash and borrowing ability.

Risks Related to Market and Economic Volatility

Southern Company’s business is dependent on its ability to successfully access capital markets.
Southern Company’s inability to access capital may limit its ability to execute its business plan
or pursue improvements and make acquisitions that Southern Company may otherwise rely on for future
growth.

Southern Company relies on access to both short-term money markets and longer-term capital
markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash
flow from its operations. If Southern Company is not able to access capital at competitive rates,
its ability to implement its business plan or pursue improvements and make acquisitions that
Southern Company may otherwise rely on for future growth will be limited. Southern Company
believes that it will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets based upon current
credit ratings. However, certain market disruptions or a downgrade of Southern Company’s credit
rating may increase its cost of borrowing or adversely affect its ability to raise capital through
the issuance of securities or other borrowing arrangements. Such disruptions could include:

Southern Company is subject to risks associated with a changing economic environment, including
Southern Company’s ability to obtain insurance, the financial stability of its customers and
Southern Company’s ability to raise capital.

The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the continuing threat of terrorism and the related
military action by the United States have affected the nation’s economy and financial markets. The
insurance industry has also been disrupted by these events. The availability of insurance covering
risks Southern Company and its competitors typically insure against may decrease, and the insurance
that Southern Company is able to obtain

I-10


may have higher deductibles, higher premiums and more restrictive policy terms. Any economic
downturn or disruption of financial markets could constrain the capital available to Southern
Company’s industry and could reduce Southern Company’s access to funding for its operations, as
well as the financial stability of its customers and counterparties. These factors could adversely
affect Southern Company’s subsidiaries’ ability to achieve energy sales growth, thereby decreasing
Southern Company’s level of future earnings.

Construction Programs

The subsidiary companies of Southern Company are engaged in continuous construction programs to
accommodate existing and estimated future loads on their respective systems. Construction
expenditures during 2005 through 2007 by the retail operating companies, Southern Power and other
subsidiaries are estimated as follows:

Business” in Item 1 herein for additional information.

The construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction
costs may vary from the above estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include:
changes in business conditions; acquisition of additional generating assets; revised load growth
estimates; environmental regulations; changes in existing nuclear plants to meet new regulatory
requirements; changes in FERC rules and transmission regulations; increasing cost of construction
labor, equipment and materials; and cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that
costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered.

Under Georgia law, Georgia Power and Savannah Electric each are required to file an Integrated
Resource Plan for approval by the Georgia PSC. Under the plan rules, the Georgia PSC must
pre-certify the construction of new power plants and new PPAs. See
BUSINESS — “Rate Matters — Integrated Resource Planning” in Item 1 herein and Note 3 to the financial statements under “Plant
McIntosh Construction Project” of Southern Company, Georgia Power and Savannah Electric and Note 2

The retail operating companies have long-term agreements in place from which they expect
to receive approximately 85.7% of their coal burn requirements in 2005. These agreements cover
remaining terms up to 8 years. In 2004, the weighted average sulfur content of all coal burned by
the retail operating companies was 0.74% sulfur. This sulfur level, along with banked and
purchased sulfur dioxide allowances, allowed the retail operating companies to remain within limits
set by the Phase II acid rain requirements of the Clean Air Act. In 2004, Southern Company
purchased approximately $45 million in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission allowances. As
additional environmental regulations are proposed that impact the utilization of coal, the retail
operating companies’ fuel mix will be monitored to ensure that the retail operating companies
remain in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, Southern Company and the
retail operating companies will continue to evaluate the need to purchase additional emission
allowances, and the timing of capital expenditures for emission control equipment. See
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS — FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “Environmental Statutes and
Regulations” of Southern Company and each of the retail operating companies in Item 7 herein for
information on the Clean Air Act.

The retail operating companies, Southern Power and Southern Company GAS also have long-term
agreements

I-13


in place for their natural gas burn requirements. For 2005, the retail operating companies,
Southern Power and Southern Company GAS have contracted for 103 billion cubic feet of natural gas
supply. These agreements cover remaining terms up to 14 years. In addition to gas supply, the
retail operating companies, Southern Power and Southern Company GAS have contracts in place for
both firm gas transportation and storage. Management believes that these contracts provide
sufficient natural gas supplies, transportation and storage to ensure normal operations of the
Southern Company system’s natural gas generating units.

Changes in fuel prices to the retail operating companies are generally reflected in fuel
adjustment clauses contained in rate schedules. See BUSINESS — “Rate Matters — Rate Structure” in
Item 1 herein for additional information.

Alabama Power and Georgia Power have numerous contracts covering a portion of their nuclear
fuel needs for uranium, conversion services, enrichment services and fuel fabrication. These
contracts have varying expiration dates and most are short to medium term (less than 10 years).
Management believes that sufficient capacity for nuclear fuel supplies and processing exists to
preclude the impairment of normal operations of the Southern Company system’s nuclear generating
units.

Alabama Power and Georgia Power have contracts with the DOE that provide for the permanent
disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin disposing of spent fuel in January 1998,
as required by the contracts, and Alabama Power and Georgia Power are pursuing legal remedies
against the government for breach of contract. Sufficient pool storage capacity is available at
Plant Farley to maintain full-core discharge capability until the refueling outages scheduled for
2006 and 2008 for units 1 and 2, respectively. Construction of an on-site dry storage facility at
Plant Farley is in progress and scheduled for operation in 2005. The onsite storage facility is
expected to provide adequate spent fuel storage through 2015 for both units. Also, the facility
will be able to be expanded to provide
storage through 2025. Sufficient pool storage capacity for spent fuel is available at Plant Vogtle
to maintain full-core discharge capability for both units into 2015. Construction of an on-site
dry storage facility at Plant Vogtle is expected to begin in sufficient time to maintain pool
full-core discharge capability. At Plant Hatch, an on-site dry storage facility became operational
in 2000 and can be expanded to accommodate spent fuel through the life of the Plant.

The Energy Act established a Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund,
which is funded in part by a special assessment on utilities with nuclear plants, including Alabama
Power and Georgia Power. This assessment is being paid over a 15-year period ending in 2008. This
fund will be used by the DOE for the decontamination and decommissioning of its nuclear fuel
enrichment facilities. The law provides that utilities will recover these payments in the same
manner as any other fuel expense. See Note 1 to the financial statements of Southern Company,
Alabama Power and Georgia Power under the heading “Fuel Costs” in Item 8 herein for additional
information.

Territory Served by the Utilities

The territory in which the retail operating companies provide electric service comprises most
of the states of Alabama and Georgia together with the northwestern portion of Florida and
southeastern Mississippi. In this territory there are non-affiliated electric distribution systems
which obtain some or all of their power requirements either directly or indirectly from the retail
operating companies. The territory has an area of approximately 120,000 square miles and an
estimated population of approximately 11 million.

Alabama Power is engaged, within the State of Alabama, in the generation and purchase of
electricity and the distribution and sale of such electricity at retail in over 1,000 communities
(including Anniston, Birmingham, Gadsden, Mobile, Montgomery and Tuscaloosa) and at wholesale to 15
municipally-owned electric distribution systems, 11 of which are served indirectly through sales to
AMEA, and two rural distributing cooperative associations. Alabama Power also supplies steam
service in downtown Birmingham. Alabama Power owns coal reserves near its Gorgas Steam Electric
Generating Plant and uses the output of coal from the reserves in its generating plants. Alabama
Power also sells, and cooperates with dealers in promoting the sale of, electric appliances.

Georgia Power is engaged in the generation and purchase of electricity and the transmission,
distribution and sale of such electricity within the State of Georgia at retail in over 600
communities, as well as in rural areas,

I-14


and at wholesale currently to OPC, MEAG, Dalton and the City of Hampton.

Gulf Power is engaged, within the northwestern portion of Florida, in the generation and
purchase of electricity and the distribution and sale of such electricity at retail in 71
communities (including Pensacola, Panama City and Fort Walton Beach), as well as in rural areas,
and at wholesale to a non-affiliated utility and a municipality.

Mississippi Power is engaged in the generation and purchase of electricity and the
distribution and sale of such energy within the 23 counties of southeastern Mississippi, at retail
in 123 communities (including Biloxi, Gulfport, Hattiesburg, Laurel, Meridian and Pascagoula), as
well as in rural areas, and at wholesale to one municipality, six rural electric distribution
cooperative associations and one generating and transmitting cooperative.

Savannah Electric is engaged, within a five-county area in eastern Georgia, in the generation
and purchase of electricity and the distribution and sale of such electricity at retail.

Through the Southern Company system power pool, the retail operating companies are also
engaged in the transmission and sale of wholesale energy.

For information relating to kilowatt-hour sales by classification for the retail operating
companies, see MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS — RESULTS OF OPERATIONS of each of the retail
operating companies in Item 7 herein. Also, for information relating to the sources of revenues
for the Southern Company system, each of the retail operating companies and Southern Power,
reference is made to Item 6 herein.

A portion of the area served by the retail operating companies adjoins the area served by TVA
and its municipal and cooperative distributors. An Act of Congress limits the distribution of TVA
power, unless otherwise authorized by Congress, to specified areas or customers which generally
were those served on July 1, 1957.

The RUS has authority to make loans to cooperative associations or corporations to enable them
to provide electric service to customers in rural sections of the country. There are 71 electric
cooperative organizations operating in the territory in which the retail operating companies
provide electric service at retail or wholesale.

One of these, AEC, is a generating and transmitting cooperative selling power to several
distributing cooperatives, municipal systems and other customers in south Alabama and northwest
Florida. AEC owns generating units with approximately 1,776 megawatts of nameplate capacity,
including an undivided 8.16% ownership interest in Alabama Power’s Plant Miller Units 1 and 2.
AEC’s facilities were financed with RUS loans secured by long-term contracts requiring distributing
cooperatives to take their requirements from AEC to the extent such energy is available. Two of
the 14 distributing cooperatives operating in Alabama Power’s service territory obtain a portion of
their power requirements directly from Alabama Power.

Four electric cooperative associations, financed by the RUS, operate within Gulf Power’s
service area. These cooperatives purchase their full requirements from AEC and SEPA (a federal
power marketing agency). A non-affiliated utility also operates within Gulf Power’s service area
and purchases its full requirements from Gulf Power.

Alabama Power and Gulf Power have entered into separate agreements with AEC involving
interconnection between their respective systems. The delivery of capacity and energy from AEC to
certain distributing cooperatives in the service areas of Alabama Power and Gulf Power is governed
by the Southern Company/AEC Network Transmission Service Agreement. The rates for this service to
AEC are based on the negotiated agreement on file with the FERC. See PROPERTIES — “Jointly-Owned
Facilities” in Item 2 herein for details of Alabama Power’s joint-ownership with AEC of a portion
of Plant Miller.

Mississippi Power has an interchange agreement with SMEPA, a generating and transmitting
cooperative, pursuant to which various services are provided, including the furnishing of
protective capacity by Mississippi Power to SMEPA.

There are 43 electric cooperative organizations operating in, or in areas adjoining, territory
in the State of Georgia in which Georgia Power provides electric service at retail or wholesale.
In January 2005, three of these organizations began obtaining their power from

I-15


TVA, one from Southern Power under a 15-year agreement and one from other sources. OPC has a
wholesale power contract with the remaining 38 of these cooperative organizations. OPC and these
cooperative organizations utilize self-owned generation, some of which is acquired and
jointly-owned with Georgia Power, megawatt capacity purchases from Georgia Power under power supply
agreements and other arrangements to meet their power supply obligations. Georgia Power, OPC, and
Georgia Systems Operations Corporation have entered into a new control area compact agreement that
will replace current coordination service agreements among the parties in 2005 pending acceptance
by the FERC.

Pursuant to an agreement entered into in April 1999, OPC will purchase 250 megawatts of
capacity from Georgia Power through March 2006. In April 2006, AEC will start purchasing such
capacity for a 10-year term. In January 2005, 30 electric cooperative organizations served by OPC
began purchasing a total of 700 megawatts of capacity from Georgia Power under individual contracts
for 10-year terms. Also, on January 1, 2005, one of the electric cooperatives began purchasing 25
megawatts of peaking capacity from Georgia Power under a 10-year contract. Another of the electric
cooperatives will purchase 50 megawatts and 75 megawatts of peaking capacity from Georgia Power
beginning April 1, 2006 and June 1, 2010, respectively. See PROPERTIES — “Jointly-Owned
Facilities” in Item 2 herein for additional information.

There are 65 municipally-owned electric distribution systems operating in the territory in
which the retail operating companies provide electric service at retail or wholesale.

AMEA was organized under an act of the Alabama legislature and is comprised of 11
municipalities. In October 1991, Alabama Power entered into a power sales contract with AMEA
entitling AMEA to scheduled amounts of additional capacity (up to a maximum 80 megawatts) for a
period of 15 years. Under the terms of the contract, Alabama Power received payments from AMEA
representing the net present value of the revenues associated with the respective capacity
entitlements. See Note 6 to the financial statements of Alabama Power under “First Mortgage Bonds”
in Item 8 herein for further information on this contract.

Forty-eight municipally-owned electric distribution systems and one county-owned system
receive their requirements through MEAG, which was established by a Georgia state statute in 1975.
MEAG serves these requirements from self-owned generation facilities, some of which are acquired
and jointly-owned with Georgia Power, power purchased from Georgia Power and purchases from other
resources. In 1997, a pseudo scheduling and services agreement was implemented between Georgia
Power and MEAG. Since 1977, Dalton has filled its requirements from self-owned generation
facilities, some of which are acquired and jointly-owned with Georgia Power, and through purchases
from Georgia Power pursuant to their partial requirements tariff. Beginning January 1, 2003,
Dalton entered into a power supply agreement pursuant to which it will purchase 134 megawatts from
Georgia Power for a 15-year term. In addition, another municipally-owned electric distribution
system’s full requirements are served under a market-based contract by Georgia Power. See
PROPERTIES — “Jointly-Owned Facilities” in Item 2 herein for additional information.

Georgia Power has entered into substantially similar agreements with Georgia Transmission
Corporation (formerly OPC’s transmission division), MEAG and Dalton providing for the establishment
of an integrated transmission system to carry the power and energy of each. The agreements require
an investment by each party in the integrated transmission system in proportion to its respective
share of the aggregate system load. See PROPERTIES — “Jointly-Owned Facilities” in Item 2 herein
for additional information.

See MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS — FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL —  “Other Matters” of
Gulf Power and MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS — FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “Power Sales
Agreements” of Southern Power in Item 8 herein for information concerning certain PPAs entered into
during 2004.

SCS, acting on behalf of the retail operating companies, also has a contract with SEPA
providing for the use of those companies’ facilities at government expense to deliver to certain
cooperatives and municipalities, entitled by federal statute to preference in the purchase of power
from SEPA, quantities of power equivalent to the amounts of power allocated to them by SEPA from
certain United States government hydroelectric projects.

I-16


The retail service rights of all electric suppliers in the State of Georgia are regulated by
the 1973 State Territorial Electric Service Act. Pursuant to the provisions of this Act, all areas
within existing municipal limits were assigned to the primary electric supplier therein (451
municipalities, including Atlanta, Columbus, Macon, Augusta, Athens, Rome and Valdosta, to Georgia
Power; 115 to electric cooperatives; and 50 to publicly-owned systems). Areas outside of such
municipal limits were either to be assigned or to be declared open for customer choice of supplier
by action of the Georgia PSC pursuant to standards set forth in the Act. Consistent with such
standards, the Georgia PSC has assigned substantially all of the land area in the state to a
supplier. Notwithstanding such assignments, the Act provides that any new customer locating
outside of 1973 municipal limits and having a connected load of at least 900 kilowatts may receive
electric service from the supplier of its choice. See BUSINESS — “Competition” in Item 1 herein
for additional information.

Under and subject to the provisions of its franchises and concessions and the 1973 State
Territorial Electric Service Act, Savannah Electric has the full but nonexclusive right to serve
the City of Savannah, the Towns of Bloomingdale, Pooler, Garden City, Guyton, Newington, Oliver,
Port Wentworth, Rincon, Tybee Island, Springfield, Thunderbolt and Vernonburg, and in conjunction
with a secondary supplier, the Town of Richmond Hill. In addition, Savannah Electric has been
assigned certain unincorporated areas in Chatham, Effingham, Bryan, Bulloch and Screven Counties by
the Georgia PSC. See BUSINESS — “Competition” in Item 1 herein for additional information.

Pursuant to the 1956 Utility Act, the Mississippi PSC issued “Grandfather Certificates” of
public convenience and necessity to Mississippi Power and to six distribution rural cooperatives
operating in southeastern Mississippi, then served in whole or in part by Mississippi Power,
authorizing them to distribute electricity in certain specified geographically described areas of
the state. The six cooperatives serve approximately 375,000 retail customers in a certificated
area of approximately 10,300 square miles. In areas included in a “Grandfather Certificate,” the
utility holding such certificate may, without further certification, extend its lines up to five
miles; other extensions within that area by such utility, or by other utilities, may not be made
except upon a showing of, and a grant of a certificate of, public convenience and necessity. Areas
included in such a certificate which are subsequently annexed to municipalities may continue to be
served by the holder of the certificate, irrespective of whether it has a franchise in the annexing
municipality. On the other hand, the holder of the municipal franchise may not extend service into
such newly annexed area without authorization by the Mississippi PSC.

Competition

The electric utility industry in the United States is continuing to evolve as a result of
regulatory and competitive factors. Among the early primary agents of change was the Energy Act.
The Energy Act allowed IPPs to access a utility’s transmission network in order to sell electricity
to other utilities.

Alabama Power currently has cogeneration contracts in effect with 11 industrial customers.
Under the terms of these contracts, Alabama Power purchases excess generation of such companies.
During 2004, Alabama Power purchased approximately 178 million kilowatt-hours from such companies
at a cost of $5.2 million.

Georgia Power currently has contracts in effect with nine small power producers whereby
Georgia Power purchases their excess generation. During 2004, Georgia Power purchased 10 million
kilowatt-hours from such companies at a cost of $0.6 million. Georgia Power has PPAs for
electricity with two cogeneration facilities. Payments are subject to reductions for failure to
meet minimum capacity output. During 2004, Georgia Power purchased 79 million kilowatt-hours at a
cost of $53 million from these facilities. See Note 7 to the financial statements for Georgia
Power herein under “Purchased Power Commitments” in Item 8 for additional information regarding
purchased power commitments.

Gulf Power currently has agreements in effect with various industrial, commercial and
qualifying facilities pursuant to which Gulf Power purchases “as available” energy from
customer-owned generation. During 2004, Gulf Power purchased 31 million kilowatt-hours from such
companies for $591,000.

Mississippi Power currently has a cogeneration agreement in effect with one of its industrial
customers. Under the terms of this contract, Mississippi Power purchases any excess generation.
During 2004,

I-17


Mississippi Power purchased approximately 12 million kilowatt-hours of excess generation at a cost
of $300,000.

During 2004, Savannah Electric purchased energy from six customer-owned generating facilities.
Five of the six provide only excess energy to Savannah Electric and are paid Savannah Electric’s
avoided energy cost. These five customers make no capacity commitment and are not dispatched by
Savannah Electric. Savannah Electric does have a contract for five megawatts of dispatchable
capacity and energy with one customer. During 2004, Savannah Electric purchased a total of 34
million kilowatt-hours from the six suppliers at a cost of approximately $1.3 million.

The competition for retail energy sales among competing suppliers of energy is influenced by
various factors, including price, availability, technological advancements and reliability. These
factors are, in turn, affected by, among other influences, regulatory, political and environmental
considerations, taxation and supply.

The retail operating companies have experienced, and expect to continue to experience,
competition in their respective retail service territories in varying degrees as the result of
self-generation (as described above) and fuel switching by customers and other factors. See also
BUSINESS  — “Territory Served by the Utilities” in Item 1 herein for additional information
concerning suppliers of electricity operating within or near the areas served at retail by the
retail operating companies.

Regulation

State Commissions

The retail operating companies are subject to the jurisdiction of their respective state PSCs,
which have broad powers of supervision and regulation over public utilities operating in the
respective states, including their rates, service regulations, sales of securities (except for the
Mississippi PSC) and, in the cases of the Georgia PSC and Mississippi PSC, in part, retail service
territories. See BUSINESS — “Territory Served by the Utilities” and “Rate Matters” in Item 1
herein for additional information.

Holding Company Act

Southern Company is registered as a holding company under the Holding Company Act, and it and its
subsidiary companies are subject to the regulatory provisions of said Act, including provisions
relating to the issuance of securities, sales and acquisitions of securities and utility assets,
services performed by SCS and Southern Nuclear and the activities of certain of Southern Company’s
other subsidiaries.

While various proposals have been introduced in Congress regarding the Holding Company Act,
the prospects for legislative reform or repeal are uncertain at this time.

Federal Power Act

The Federal Power Act subjects the retail operating companies, Southern Power and SEGCO to
regulation by the FERC as companies engaged in the transmission or sale at wholesale of electric
energy in interstate commerce, including regulation of accounting policies and practices.

Alabama Power and Georgia Power are also subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act or
the earlier Federal Water Power Act applicable to licensees with respect to their hydroelectric
developments. Among the hydroelectric projects subject to licensing by the FERC are 14 existing
Alabama Power generating stations having an aggregate installed capacity of 1,662,400 kilowatts and
18 existing Georgia Power generating stations having an aggregate installed capacity of 1,074,696
kilowatts.

In December 2002, Georgia Power filed a relicensing application for the Middle Chattahoochee
Project with the FERC. On December 27, 2004, the FERC issued a new 30-year license for the Middle
Chattahoochee Project. This project consists of the Goat Rock, Oliver and North Highlands
facilities. In 2003, Georgia Power started the relicensing process for the Morgan Falls project
and is currently working on developing study plans for the facility with license participants.
Alabama Power initiated the relicensing process in 2002 for its seven projects on the Coosa
River (Weiss, Henry, Logan Martin, Lay, Mitchell, Jordan and Bouldin) and the Smith and Bankhead
projects on the Warrior River. The FERC licenses for all of these eight projects expire in 2007.

I-18


Georgia Power and OPC also have a license, expiring in 2027, for the Rocky Mountain Plant, a
pure pumped storage facility of 847,800 kilowatt capacity which began commercial operation in 1995.
See PROPERTIES — “Jointly-Owned Facilities” in Item 2 herein for additional information.

Licenses for all projects, excluding those discussed above, expire in the period 2007-2033 in
the case of Alabama Power’s projects and in the period 2005-2039 in the case of Georgia Power’s
projects.

Upon or after the expiration of each license, the United States Government, by act of
Congress, may take over the project or the FERC may relicense the project either to the original
licensee or to a new licensee. In the event of takeover or relicensing to another, the original
licensee is to be compensated in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Power Act, such
compensation to reflect the net investment of the licensee in the project, not in excess of the
fair value of the property taken, plus reasonable damages to other property of the licensee
resulting from the severance therefrom of the property taken.

Atomic Energy Act of 1954

Alabama Power, Georgia Power and Southern Nuclear are subject to the provisions of the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended, which vests jurisdiction in the NRC over the construction and
operation of nuclear reactors, particularly with regard to certain public health and safety and
antitrust matters. The National Environmental Policy Act has been construed to expand the
jurisdiction of the NRC to consider the environmental impact of a facility licensed under the
Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.

NRC operating licenses currently expire in June 2017 and March 2021 for Plant Farley units 1
and 2, respectively, and in January 2027 and February 2029 for Plant Vogtle units 1 and 2,
respectively. In January 2002, the NRC granted Georgia Power a 20-year extension of the licenses
for both units at Plant Hatch which permits the operation of units 1 and 2 until 2034 and 2038,
respectively. Alabama Power filed an application with the NRC in September 2003 to extend the
operating license for Plant Farley for an additional 20 years.

See Notes 1 and 9 to the financial statements of Southern Company, Alabama Power and Georgia
Power in Item 8 herein for information on nuclear decommissioning costs and nuclear insurance.

FERC Matters

See Southern Company’s, Alabama Power’s, Georgia Power’s, Gulf Power’s, Mississippi Power’s,
Savannah Electric’s and Southern Power’s, MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS — FUTURE EARNINGS
POTENTIAL — “FERC and State PSC Matters,” “FERC and Alabama PSC Matters,” “FERC and Georgia PSC
Matters,” “FERC and Florida PSC Matters,” “FERC and Mississippi PSC Matters,” “FERC and Georgia
PSC Matters” and “FERC Matters” in Item 7 herein for information on matters regarding the FERC.

Environmental Statutes and Regulations

Southern Company’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by state and federal
environmental agencies under a variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental
media, including air, water and land resources. Compliance with these environmental
requirements involves significant costs, a major portion of which is expected to be recovered
through existing ratemaking provisions. There is no assurance, however, that all such costs
will, in fact, be recovered.

Compliance with the federal Clean Air Act and resulting regulations has been, and will
continue to be, a significant focus for Southern Company. See MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS  — FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “Environmental Matters” of Southern Company and each of
the retail operating companies in Item 7 herein for additional information about the Clean Air
Act and other environmental issues, including the litigation brought under the New Source Review
provisions of the Clean Air Act.

Additionally, each retail operating company and SEGCO has incurred costs for environmental
remediation of various sites. See MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS — FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL
- - “Environmental Remediation Reserves” of Southern Company and each of the retail operating
companies in Item 7 herein for

I-19


information regarding environmental remediation efforts. Also, see Note 3 to the financial
statements of Southern Company, Georgia Power, Gulf Power and Mississippi Power in Item 8 herein
under “Environmental Matters — Environmental Remediation,” for information regarding the
identification of sites that may require environmental remediation.

The retail operating companies, Southern Power and SEGCO are unable to predict at this time
what additional steps they may be required to take as a result of the implementation of existing or
future quality control requirements for air, water and hazardous or toxic materials, but such steps
could adversely affect system operations and result in substantial additional costs.

The outcome of the matters mentioned above under “Regulation” cannot now be determined, except
that these developments may result in delays in obtaining appropriate licenses for generating
facilities, increased construction and operating costs or reduced generation, the nature and extent
of which, while not determinable at this time, could be substantial.

Rate Matters

Rate Structure

The rates and service regulations of the retail operating companies are uniform for each class of
service throughout their respective service areas. Rates for residential electric service are
generally of the block type based upon kilowatt-hours used and include minimum charges.

Residential and other rates contain separate customer charges. Rates for commercial service
are presently of the block type and, for large customers, the billing demand is generally used to
determine capacity and minimum bill charges. These large customers’ rates are generally based upon
usage by the customer and include rates with special features to encourage off-peak usage.
Additionally, the retail operating companies are allowed by their respective PSCs to negotiate the
terms and compensation of service to large customers. Such terms and compensation of service,
however, are subject to final PSC approval. Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power and
Savannah Electric are allowed by state law to recover fuel and net purchased energy costs through
fuel cost recovery provisions which are adjusted to reflect increases or decreases in such costs as
needed. Gulf Power also recovers from retail customers costs of fuel, net purchased power, energy
conservation and environmental compliance through provisions approved by the Florida PSC which are
adjusted annually to reflect increases or decreases in such costs. Revenues are adjusted for
differences between recoverable costs and amounts actually recovered in current rates.

See
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS — FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL in Item 7 and to
Note 3 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power,
Mississippi Power and Savannah Electric for a discussion of rate matters.

Integrated Resource Planning

Georgia Power and Savannah Electric must file IRPs with the Georgia PSC that specify how each
intends to meet the future electrical needs of its customers through a combination of demand-side
and supply-side resources. The Georgia PSC must certify these new resources. Once certified, all
prudently incurred constructions costs and purchase power costs will be recoverable through rates.

In July 2001, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power’s certification request for approximately
1,800 megawatts of purchased power and 12 megawatts of upgraded hydro generation. This
certification request included a seven-year PPA with Southern Power for two gas-fired, combined
cycle units at Plant Franklin. The purchase of the full 570 megawatts from the first unit began in
2003 with the purchase of approximately 250 megawatts beginning earlier in June 2002. The purchase
of the full 610 megawatts from the second unit began in 2004 with the purchase of approximately 300
megawatts beginning earlier in June 2003. Also, an upgrade of 12 megawatts was approved for the
existing Goat Rock hydro units 1 and 2. Additionally, this certification included approval of a
15-year PPA with Southern Power for 615 megawatts of gas-fired combined cycle generation at Plant
Harris in Alabama.

In December 2002, the Georgia PSC certified the Duke Energy (Murray) generating facility. The
Duke Energy (Murray) PPA provides for the purchase by Georgia Power of the full 620 megawatts of
output for seven years beginning in June 2005.

I-20


On January 30, 2004, Georgia Power and Savannah Electric filed the 2004 IRP with the Georgia
PSC and received Georgia PSC approval of the 2004 IRP on
July 9, 2004. Through the approval of the 2004 IRP, Georgia Power de-certified the Atkinson
combustion turbine units 5A and 5B totaling approximately 80 megawatts of capacity. Georgia Power
and Savannah Electric will issue an RFP in July 2005 for approximately 1,200 megawatts to meet
their future supply-side capacity needs for 2009 and beyond. Additionally, Georgia Power and
Savannah Electric will each continue a residential load management program which was certified by
the Georgia PSC for up to 40 megawatts of equivalent supply-side capacity. Georgia Power will
continue to utilize approximately 8 megawatts of capacity from existing qualifying facilities under
firm contracts and continue to add additional resources as ordered by the Georgia PSC.

In May 2004, the Georgia PSC ordered Georgia Power and Savannah Electric to purchase the
McIntosh combined cycle generating facility from Southern Power and place it into their respective
rate bases. The McIntosh resource was previously certified as a PPA by the Georgia PSC in the 2002
supply-side certification. The McIntosh units will produce a combined 1,240 megawatts of which
Georgia Power’s portion is 1,040 megawatts and Savannah Electric’s portion is 200 megawatts. This
new generation is expected to be available by June 2005. See Note 3 to the financial statements
of Southern Company, Georgia Power and Savannah Electric under “Plant McIntosh Construction
Project” in Item 8 herein for additional information.

Environmental Cost Recovery Plans

On October 5, 2004, the Alabama PSC approved a specific rate mechanism for the recovery of
Alabama Power’s retail costs associated with environmental laws, regulations or other such
mandates. The rate mechanism began operation in January 2005 and provides for the recovery of
these costs pursuant to a factor that will be calculated annually. Environmental costs to be
recovered include operation and maintenance expense, depreciation and a return on invested
capital. See MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS — FUTURE EARNING POTENTIAL — “FERC and State
PSC Matters” and “FERC and Alabama PSC Matters,” respectively, in Item 7 herein and Note 3 to
the financial statements of Southern Company and Alabama Power in Item 8 herein for a discussion
on Alabama PSC rate matters.

The Florida Legislature has adopted legislation for an Environmental Cost Recovery Clause,
which allows Gulf Power to petition the Florida PSC for recovery of prudent environmental
compliance costs that are not being recovered through base rates or any other recovery mechanism.
Such environmental costs include operation and maintenance expense, emission allowance expense,
depreciation and a return on invested capital.

This legislation was amended in 2002 to allow recovery of costs incurred as a result of an
agreement between Gulf Power and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection for the purpose
of ensuring compliance with ozone ambient air quality standards adopted by the EPA. See Note 3 to
the financial statements of Gulf Power in Item 8 herein under “Environmental Remediation” for
additional information.

In 1992, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power’s Environmental Compliance Overview
Plan (ECO Plan). The ECO Plan establishes procedures to facilitate the Mississippi PSC’s overview
of Mississippi Power’s environmental strategy and provides for recovery of costs (including costs
of capital associated with environmental projects approved by the Mississippi PSC). Under the ECO
Plan, any increase in the annual revenue requirement is limited to two percent of retail revenues.
However, the ECO Plan also provides for carryover of any amount over the two percent limit into the
next year’s revenue requirement. Mississippi Power conducts studies, when possible, to determine
the extent of any required environmental remediation. Should such remediation be determined to be
probable, reasonable estimates of costs to clean up such sites are developed and recognized in the
financial statements. Mississippi Power recovers such costs under the ECO Plan as they are
incurred, as provided for in Mississippi Power’s 1994 ECO Plan order. Mississippi Power filed its
2005 ECO Plan in January 2005, which, if approved as filed, will result in an increase in customer
prices. See Note 3 to the financial statements of Mississippi Power under “Environmental
Compliance Overview Plan” for additional information.

units of the retail operating companies, Southern Power and SEGCO are owned in fee by the
respective companies. It is the opinion of management of each such company that its operating
properties are adequately maintained and are substantially in good operating condition.

Mississippi Power owns a 79-mile length of 500-kilovolt transmission line which is leased
to Entergy Gulf States. The line, completed in 1984, extends from Plant Daniel to the Louisiana
state line. Entergy Gulf States is paying a use fee over a 40-year period covering all expenses
and the amortization of the original $57 million cost of the line. At December 31, 2004, the
unamortized portion of this cost was approximately $26.2 million.

The all-time maximum demand on the retail operating companies, Southern Power and SEGCO was
34,414,100 kilowatts and occurred on July 14, 2004. This amount excludes demand served by
capacity retained by MEAG and Dalton and excludes demand associated with power purchased from
OPC and SEPA by its preference customers. The reserve margin for the retail operating
companies, Southern Power and SEGCO at that time was 20.2%. See SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA in
Item 6 herein for additional information on peak demands.

Jointly-Owned Facilities

Alabama Power, Georgia Power and Southern Power have undivided interests in certain
generating plants and other related facilities to or from non-affiliated parties. The

Alabama Power and Georgia Power have contracted to operate and maintain the respective
units in which each has an interest (other than Rocky Mountain and Intercession City) as agent
for the joint owners. SCS provides operation and maintenance services for Plant Stanton A.

In addition, Georgia Power has commitments regarding a portion of a 5 percent interest in
Plant Vogtle owned by MEAG that are in effect until the later of retirement of the plant or the
latest stated maturity date of MEAG’s bonds issued to finance
such ownership interest. The payments for capacity are required whether any capacity is
available. The energy cost is a function of each unit’s variable operating costs.
Except for the portion of the capacity payments related to the Georgia PSC’s disallowances of
Plant Vogtle costs, the cost of such capacity and energy is included in purchased power from
non-affiliates in Georgia Power’s Statements of Income in Item 8 herein.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls And Procedures.

Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power and Southern Power

As of the end of the period covered by this annual report, Southern Company, Alabama Power,
Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power and Southern Power conducted separate evaluations
under the supervision and with the participation of each company’s management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of
the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Sections 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon these evaluations, the Chief Executive Officer and
the Chief Financial Officer, in each case, concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures
are effective in alerting them in a timely manner to material information relating to their company
(including its consolidated subsidiaries, if any) required to be included in periodic filings with
the SEC.

Savannah Electric

As of the end of the period covered by this annual report, Savannah Electric conducted an
evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of
the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Sections 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in
alerting them in a timely manner to material information relating to Savannah Electric required to
be included in periodic filings with the SEC, because of an internal control weakness described
below.

In connection with the review and preparation of the financial statements of Savannah Electric
for the year ended December 31, 2004, errors in Savannah Electric’s estimates
of unbilled revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, and periods prior to 2002 were
identified. The errors also affect Savannah Electric’s previously issued financial statements for
the quarters ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2004 and 2003. Savannah Electric’s
financial statements have been restated to reflect adjustments to
Savannah Electric’s financial
information previously reported. See Note 9 to the financial statements of Savannah Electric in
Item 8 herein.

Unbilled
revenues represent an estimate of the kilowatt-hour sales of electricity delivered to
customers, but not yet billed. Components of the unbilled revenue estimates include total kilowatt-hour
territorial supply, total kilowatt-hours billed, total electricity lost in delivery (line losses) and
customer usage. These components are affected by a number of factors including
weather, generation patterns, power delivery volume and other operational constraints.

The
errors in Savannah Electric’s estimates were identified through
comparisons of Savannah Electric’s
unbilled revenue account balance at December 31, 2004 to the billed kilowatt-hour sales recorded in
January 2005 made in connection with Savannah Electric’s
2004 audit. Savannah Electric analyzed the unbilled
revenue calculations for the years 1999 through 2004 to determine the timing and source of the
errors, which primarily relate to the estimates of line losses. For the years through 2002, line
losses were understated and total unbilled revenues were overstated.
However, in 2003, Savannah Electric
revised its methodology of estimating line losses, which had the effect of overstating the line
losses, and, thus, understating total unbilled revenues during 2003 and
2004. Since Savannah Electric’s
calculation of unbilled revenues utilized a net change methodology, the cumulative effect of each
of these errors was carried forward from period to period.

Management believes Savannah Electric’s failure to identify these errors would constitute
a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting under standards adopted by the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Deloitte &
Touche LLP and the management of
Savannah Electric discussed these adjustments and the internal control deficiency with Southern
Company’s Audit Committee. Management has revised its process and controls related to estimating unbilled revenues to
utilize a gross change methodology that reverses each period’s estimate in total in the following
period.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2004 Annual Report

Southern Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate
system of internal control over financial reporting as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
and as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). A control system can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.

Under management’s supervision, an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of Southern
Company’s internal control over financial reporting was conducted based on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that Southern Company’s
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2004.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as auditors of
Southern
Company’s financial statements, has issued an attestation report
on management’s assessment of the
effectiveness of Southern Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2004. Deloitte & Touche LLP’s report, which expresses unqualified opinions on management’s
assessment and on the effectiveness of Southern Company’s internal control over financial
reporting, is included herein.

Internal Control over Financial Reporting

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Southern Company

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management Report (page
II-8), that Southern Company (the “Company”) maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The
Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including
the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements
due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based
on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2004, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2004 of the Company and our report dated February 28, 2005 expressed an unqualified
opinion on those financial statements.

Consolidated Financial Statements

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Southern Company

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of
capitalization of Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2004
and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, common
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2004. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements (pages II-35 to II-70) present fairly,
in all
material respects, the financial position of Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies at December
31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America.

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, in 2003 the Southern Company changed its
method of accounting for asset retirement obligations.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
and our report dated February 28, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment
of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2004 Annual Report

OVERVIEW

Business Activities

Southern Company’s primary business is electricity sales in the Southeast by the retail
operating companies — Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, and Savannah
Electric — and Southern Power. Southern Power is an electric wholesale generation subsidiary
with market-based rate authority.

Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of Southern Company’s
electricity business. These factors include the retail operating companies’ ability to maintain
a stable regulatory environment, to achieve energy sales growth while containing costs, and to
recover costs related to growing demand and increasingly more stringent environmental standards.
In 2004, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power each completed retail rate
proceedings that should help provide future earnings stability. These regulatory actions will
also enable the recovery of substantial capital investments to facilitate the continued
reliability of the transmission and distribution network and to continue environmental
improvements at the generating plants. Appropriately balancing environmental expenditures with
customer prices will continue to challenge the Company for the foreseeable future.

Another major factor is the profitability of the competitive market-based wholesale
generating business and federal regulatory policy, which may impact Southern Company’s level of
participation in this market. Southern Power continued executing its regional strategy in 2004
by signing several wholesale contracts with major utilities, as well as with cooperatives and
municipal suppliers in the Southeast. Southern Company’s average wholesale contract now extends
more than 13 years, with the average Southern Power market-based contract extending more than 11
years. These contracts reduce remarketing risk until the middle of the next decade. However,
the Company continues to face regulatory challenges related to transmission and market power
issues at the national level.

Southern Company’s other business activities include investments in synthetic fuels and
leveraged lease projects, telecommunications, energy-related services, and natural gas
marketing. Management continues to evaluate the contribution by each of these activities to
total shareholder return and may pursue acquisitions and dispositions accordingly.

Key Performance Indicators

In striving to maximize shareholder value while providing low-cost energy to more than 4 million
customers, Southern Company focuses on several key indicators. These indicators include customer
satisfaction, peak season equivalent forced outage rate (Peak Season EFOR), return on equity
(ROE), and earnings per share (EPS). Southern Company’s financial success is directly tied to
the satisfaction of its customers. Key elements of ensuring customer satisfaction include
outstanding service, high reliability, and competitive prices. Management uses nationally
recognized customer satisfaction surveys and reliability indicators to evaluate the Company’s
results. Peak Season EFOR is an indicator of plant availability and efficient generation fleet
operations during the months when generation needs are greatest. The rate is calculated by
dividing the number of hours of forced outages by total generation hours. ROE is a performance
standard used by both the investment community and many regulatory agencies. EPS is a major
component of the Company’s efforts to increase returns to shareholders through dividend growth.
Southern Company’s 2004 results compared with its targets for each of these indicators are
reflected in the following chart.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2004 Annual Report

Earnings

Southern Company’s financial performance in 2004 was the Company’s best ever and again a leader
in the electric utility industry. Net income of $1.53 billion in 2004 increased 3.9 percent over
the prior year. Net income was $1.47 billion in 2003 and $1.32 billion in 2002, reflecting
increases over the prior year of 11.8 percent and 17.6 percent, respectively. Basic EPS was
$2.07 in 2004, $2.03 in 2003, and $1.86 in 2002. Dilution — which factors in additional shares
related to stock options — decreased EPS by 1 cent each year.

Dividends

Southern Company has paid dividends on its common stock since 1948. Dividends paid per share on
common stock were $1.415 in 2004, $1.385 in 2003, and $1.355 in 2002. In January 2005, Southern
Company declared a quarterly dividend of 35.75 cents per share. This is the 229th consecutive
quarter that Southern Company has paid a dividend equal to or higher than the previous quarter.
The Company’s goal for the dividend payout ratio is to achieve and maintain a payout of 70
percent of net income. The actual payout ratio was 68.2 percent for 2004.

Retail revenues increased $857 million in 2004, $147 million in 2003, and $288 million in
2002. The significant factors driving these changes are shown in the preceding table. Electric
rates for the retail operating companies include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations
in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased energy costs. Under these
provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses — including the fuel component of
purchased energy — and do not affect net income. Certain of the retail operating companies
also have clauses to recover other costs, such as environmental and new plant additions.

Sales for resale revenues within the service area increased $60 million in 2004 due to
continued customer growth in the Southeast and new contracts with utilities within the service
area. Sales for resale were flat in 2003 and increased $104 million in 2002, primarily as a
result of hotter than normal weather.

Revenues from energy sales for resale outside the service area decreased $77 million in 2004
and increased $189 million in 2003. In general, sales for resale outside the service area can be
significantly influenced by weather, which affects both customer demand and generating availability
for these types of sales. Neighboring utilities that depend heavily on gas-

fired generation
purchase larger amounts of power as
natural gas prices increase. These factors contribute to the large fluctuations in sales from year
to year. In 2004, however, coal prices also increased, resulting in a lower marginal price
differential that reduced demand. In addition, mild summer weather throughout the Southeast also
reduced demand. In 2003, Southern Company entered into several new contracts with neighboring
utilities. In addition, milder weather in Southern Company’s service territory, compared with the
rest of the Southeast and combined with higher gas prices, resulted in increases in both customer
demand and available generation. In 2002, revenues from energy sales for resale outside the
service area were down $111 million from 2001, resulting from the expiration of certain short-term
energy sales contracts.

Southern Company’s average wholesale contract now extends more than 13 years. As a result,
the Company has significantly reduced its remarketing risk until the middle of the next decade.
Under unit power sales contracts, principally sales to Florida utilities, capacity revenues reflect
the recovery of fixed costs and a return on investment, and energy is generally sold at variable
cost. The capacity and energy components of the unit power contracts and other long-term contracts
were as follows:

In May 2003, Mississippi Power and Southern Power entered into agreements with Dynegy,
Inc. (Dynegy) that terminated all capacity sales contracts with subsidiaries of Dynegy. The
termination payments from Dynegy resulted in an increase in other electric revenues of $135
million in 2003.

Energy Sales

Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the volume of energy sold each year.

Energy sales in 2004 were strong across all retail customer classes as a result of an
improved economy in the Southeast and customer growth of 1.5 percent. Residential energy sales
in 2003 reflected a decrease in customer demand as a result of very mild weather partially
offset by customer growth of 1.6 percent. In 2003, commercial sales continued to show steady
growth while industrial sales increased somewhat over the depressed results of recent years. In
2002, the rate of growth in total retail energy sales was very strong. Residential energy sales
reflected an increase as a result of hotter-than-normal summer weather and a 1.6 percent
increase in customers. Energy sales to retail customers are projected to increase at an average
annual rate of 1.88 percent during the period 2005 through 2010.

Sales to customers outside the service area under contracts and opportunity sales decreased
by 6.0 billion kilowatt-hours in 2004, increased by 8.1 billion kilowatt-hours in 2003, and were
flat in 2002. The decrease in 2004 as compared with 2003 is due to the increased availability
of coal-fired generation in 2003 resulting from weather-related lower retail demand coupled with
higher natural gas prices, which increased the wholesale market demand for opportunity sales.
Unit power energy sales increased 1.9 percent in 2004 and 4.0 percent in 2003 and decreased 3.3
percent in 2002. Fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices, which are the primary fuel sources
for unit power sales customers, influence changes in these sales. However, these fluctuations
in energy sales under long-term contracts have a minimal effect on earnings because the energy
is generally sold at variable cost.

Electric Operating Expenses

Electric operating expenses in 2004 were $8.6 billion, an increase of $693 million over 2003
expenses. Production costs, including fuel and purchased power expenses, exceeded the prior year by
$624 million as a result of increased sales, a 12.7 percent increase in the

average unit cost of fuel, and maintenance costs that were deferred from 2003. Non-production
operation and maintenance costs increased by $93 million due to additional administrative and
general expenses of $106 million, primarily related to employee benefits, nuclear security, and
property insurance, as well as increased transmission and distribution expenses of $49 million
primarily related to expenditures that were deferred from 2003. These increases were partially
offset by a $60 million regulatory liability related to Plant Daniel that was expensed in 2003.
Depreciation and amortization expenses declined by $64 million in 2004, primarily as a result of
amortization of the Plant Daniel regulatory liability and a Georgia Power regulatory liability
related to the levelization of certain purchased power costs that reduced amortization expense by
$17 million and $90 million, respectively, from the prior year. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL -
“FERC and State PSC Matters — Mississippi Power Retail Rate Filing” herein and Note 3 to the
financial statements under “Georgia Power Retail Rate Activity” for more information on these
regulatory adjustments. These reductions were partially offset by a higher depreciable plant base.
Taxes other than income taxes increased $40 million as a result of additional plant in service
and a higher property tax base.

In 2003, electric operating expenses were $7.9 billion, an increase of $355 million over 2002
expenses. Production costs exceeded the prior year by $209 million as a result of increased sales
and a 5.1 percent increase in the average unit cost of fuel. Non-production operation and
maintenance costs increased by $133 million over the prior year. This increase in expenses was
primarily driven by additional administrative and general expenses of $46 million, primarily due to
higher property insurance and employee benefits, customer service expenses of $14 million, and the
$60 million Plant Daniel regulatory liability discussed previously. Taxes other than income taxes
increased $29 million in 2003 as a result of additional generating facilities and a higher property
tax base. The $16 million decrease in depreciation and amortization in 2003 was primarily due to a
$49 million reduction in amortization of the previously discussed Georgia Power purchased power
regulatory liability and was partially offset by a higher depreciable plant base.

In 2002, electric operating expenses were $7.5 billion, an increase of $60 million over
2001 expenses. Production costs exceeded 2001 costs by $87 million as a result of increased
sales. Non-production operation and maintenance costs also increased in 2002 by $106 million
due to additional administrative and general expenses of $56 million and transmission and
distribution expenses of $37 million. Taxes other than income taxes increased $22 million in
2002 due to higher property taxes related to commercial operation of new generating plants.
Depreciation and amortization declined by $155 million in 2002 primarily as a result of Georgia
Power’s 2001 rate order to reverse and amortize over three years $333 million that had been
previously expensed related to accelerated depreciation under a previous rate order. This
amortization reduced depreciation expense in 2002 by $111 million.

Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses

Fuel costs constitute the single largest expense for the electric utilities. The mix of fuel
sources for generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel
consumed, and the availability of generating units. The amount and sources of generation, the
average cost of fuel per net kilowatt-hour generated, and the average cost of purchased power
were as follows:

Fuel and purchased power expenses were $4.0 billion in 2004, an increase of $567 million or
16.3 percent above 2003 costs. This increase was attributed to higher average unit fuel cost.

Fuel and purchased power expenses were $3.5 billion in 2003, an increase of $236 million or
7.3 percent above the prior year costs. This increase was primarily attributed to higher
average unit fuel cost and increased customer demand. The additional demand was met by
generating 6 billion and purchasing 1.6 billion more kilowatt-hours than in 2002.

In 2002, fuel and purchased power expenses were $3.2 billion, a decrease of $60 million or
1.8 percent below the prior year costs. An additional 8.9

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2004 Annual Report

billion kilowatt-hours were generated in 2002, at a slightly higher average cost; however, this
lowered requirements to purchase more expensive electricity from other utilities.

A significant upward trend in the cost of coal and natural gas has emerged since 2003, and
volatility in these markets is expected to continue. Increased coal prices have been influenced
by a worldwide increase in demand as a result of rapid economic growth in China as well as by
increases in mining costs. Higher natural gas prices in the United States are the result of
slightly lower gas supplies despite increased drilling activity. Natural gas supply
interruptions, such as those caused by the 2004 hurricanes, result in an immediate market
response, however, the impact of this price volatility may be reduced by imports of natural gas
and liquefied natural gas. Fuel expenses generally do not affect net income, since they are
offset by fuel revenues under the retail operating companies’ fuel cost recovery provisions.
Likewise, Southern Power’s purchase power agreements (PPAs) generally provide that the
purchasers are responsible for substantially all of the cost of fuel.

Electric Other Income and (Expense)

Total interest charges and other financing costs increased by $19 million in 2004 as a result of
a lower percentage of interest costs capitalized as Southern Power projects reached completion
in 2003. This increase was partially offset by the refinancing of higher cost debt at the
retail operating companies in 2003. Total interest charges and other financing costs declined
by $24 million in 2002 as a result of lower interest rates on short-term debt and continued
refinancing of higher-cost long-term securities.

Other Business Activities

Southern Company’s other business activities include the parent company — which does not
allocate operating expenses to business units — investments in synthetic fuels and leveraged
lease projects, telecommunications, energy-related services, and natural gas marketing. These
businesses are classified in general categories and may comprise one or more of the following
subsidiaries. Southern Company Holdings invests in various energy-related projects, including
synthetic fuels and leveraged lease projects that receive tax benefits, which contribute
significantly to the economic results of these investments; SouthernLINC Wireless provides
digital wireless communications services to the retail operating companies and also markets
these services to the public within the Southeast; Southern Telecom provides fiber optics
services in the Southeast; and Southern Company GAS is a retail gas marketer serving customers
in the State of Georgia.

Southern Company’s non-electric revenues were flat in 2004 and increased $131 million in
2003 and $68 million in 2002. The increases are primarily the result of Southern Company GAS
beginning operations in August 2002 and increasing its revenues $5 million in 2004 and $101
million in 2003. SouthernLINC Wireless revenues also increased $6 million, $8 million, and $32
million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively, as a result of increased wireless subscribers. A
decrease in operating revenues in the energy-related services business offset the 2004
increases. Revenues from a subsidiary that primarily provides fuel transportation services
related to synthetic fuel products were $115 million in 2004, increasing by $21 million, $37
million, and $26 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, as a result of increased
production at the synthetic fuel facilities. Most of these service revenues are ultimately
included in the cost of the synthetic fuel purchased by Alabama Power and

Georgia Power and,
therefore, have no significant effect on consolidated revenues. See Note 1 to the
financial statements under “Related Party Transactions” for additional information.

Operation and maintenance expenses for these other businesses increased by $8 million in 2004
when compared with the prior year as a result of a $12.6 million bad debt reserve related to
additional federal income taxes and interest Southern Company paid on behalf of Mirant. See FUTURE
EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “Other Matters — Mirant Related Matters” herein and Note 3 to the financial
statements under “Mirant Related Matters — Mirant Bankruptcy” for additional information. The more
significant increases in 2004 and 2003 were primarily driven by Southern Company GAS increases in
purchased gas expenses of $3 million and $78 million, respectively, following the inception of its
operations in August 2002. In 2002, expenses also increased $19 million as a result of additional
SouthernLINC Wireless subscribers and $30 million as a result of increased production at the
synthetic fuel facilities.

The increase in depreciation expense in 2002 reflects a $16 million charge related to the
impairment of assets under certain customer contracts for energy-related services as well as the
impact of property additions at SouthernLINC Wireless.

The increases in equity in losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2002 reflect the
results of additional investments in synthetic fuel partnerships that produce operating losses.
These partnerships also claim federal income tax credits that offset these operating losses and
make the projects profitable. These credits totaled $146 million in 2004, $120 million in 2003,
and $108 million in 2002. Additionally in 2004, a $37 million reserve related to these tax
credits was reversed following the settlement of an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit. See
FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “Income Tax Matters — Synthetic Fuel Tax Credits” herein and Note 3
to the financial statements under “Income Tax Matters — Synthetic Fuel Tax Credits” for
additional information.

The decrease in other income in 2004 as compared with 2003 reflects a $15 million gain for
a Southern Telecom contract settlement during 2003. The gain in 2003 was partially offset by an
increase of $7 million in charitable contributions above the amount in 2002 made by the parent
company.

Interest expenses for 2004 decreased $21 million as a result of the parent company’s
redemption of preferred securities in 2003. This decrease was partially offset by an increase
in outstanding long-term debt in 2004. Interest expense in 2002 reflects lower interest rates
and reduced amounts of debt outstanding for the parent company.

Effects of Inflation

The retail operating companies and Southern Power are subject to rate regulation and are party
to long-term contracts, respectively, that are based on the recovery of historical costs. In
addition, the income tax laws are based on historical costs. Therefore, inflation creates an
economic loss because the Company is recovering its costs of investments in dollars that have
less purchasing power. While the inflation rate has been relatively low in recent years, it
continues to have an adverse effect on Southern Company because of the large investment in
utility plant with long economic lives. Conventional accounting for historical cost does not
recognize this economic loss nor the partially offsetting gain that arises through financing
facilities with fixed-money obligations such as long-term debt and preferred securities. Any
recognition of inflation by regulatory authorities is reflected in the rate of return allowed in
the retail operating companies’ approved electric rates.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL

General

The retail operating companies operate as vertically integrated companies providing electricity
to customers within their service areas in the southeastern United States. Prices for
electricity provided to retail customers are set by state public service commissions (PSC) under
cost-based regulatory principles. Retail rates and earnings are reviewed and adjusted
periodically within certain limitations based on ROE. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES — “Application of
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates — Electric Utility Regulation” herein and Note 3 to
the financial statements for additional information about these and other regulatory matters.

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of future
earnings potential. The level of Southern Company’s future earnings depends on numerous factors
that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of Southern

II-16


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2004 Annual Report

Company’s primary business of
selling electricity. These factors include the retail operating companies’ ability to maintain
a stable regulatory environment,
to achieve energy sales growth while containing costs, and to recover costs related to growing
demand and increasingly more stringent environmental standards. Another major factor is the
profitability of the competitive market-based wholesale generating business and federal
regulatory policy, which may impact Southern Company’s level of participation in this market.
Future earnings for the electricity business in the near term will depend, in part, upon growth
in energy sales, which is subject to a number of factors. These factors include weather,
competition, new energy contracts with neighboring utilities, energy conservation practiced by
customers, the price of electricity, the price elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic
growth in the service area.

Since 2001, merchant energy companies and traditional electric utilities with significant
energy marketing and trading activities have come under severe financial pressures. Many of
these companies have completely exited or drastically reduced all energy marketing and trading
activities and sold foreign and domestic electric infrastructure assets. Southern Company has
not experienced any material adverse financial impact regarding its limited energy trading
operations and recent generating capacity additions. In general, Southern Company has
constructed new generating capacity only after entering into long-term capacity contracts for
the new facilities or to meet requirements of Southern Company’s regulated retail markets, both
of which are optimized by limited energy trading activities.

To adapt to a less regulated, more competitive environment, Southern Company continues to
evaluate and consider a wide array of potential business strategies. These strategies may
include business combinations, acquisitions involving other utility or non-utility businesses or
properties, internal restructuring, disposition of certain assets, or some combination thereof.
Furthermore, Southern Company may engage in new business ventures that arise from competitive
and regulatory changes in the utility industry. Pursuit of any of the above strategies, or any
combination thereof, may significantly affect the business operations and financial condition of
Southern Company.

Environmental Matters

New Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil action in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against certain Southern Company
subsidiaries, including Alabama Power and Georgia Power, alleging that these subsidiaries had
violated the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act and related state laws at
five coal-fired generating facilities. Through subsequent amendments and other legal
procedures, the EPA added Savannah Electric as a defendant to the original action and added
allegations regarding two additional generating facilities owned by Alabama Power. The EPA
filed a separate action against Alabama Power after it was dismissed from the original action.
As of the date of this report, the EPA alleges that NSR violations occurred at eight coal-fired
generating facilities operated by Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Savannah Electric. The
civil actions request penalties and injunctive relief, including an order requiring the
installation of the best available control technology at the affected units. The actions
against Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Savannah Electric were effectively stayed in the
spring of 2001 pending the appeal of a similar NSR action against the Tennessee Valley Authority
before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. In June 2004, following the final
resolution of that appeal, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama lifted
the stay in the action against Alabama Power, placing the case back onto the court’s active
docket. At this time, no party to the case against Georgia Power and Savannah Electric has
sought to reopen that case, which remains administratively closed in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Georgia. See Note 3 to the financial statements
under “Environmental Matters —  New Source Review
Actions” for additional information.

Southern Company believes that the retail operating companies complied with applicable laws
and the EPA regulations and interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place.
The Clean Air Act authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $32,500 per day, per violation
at each generating unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in any
one of these cases could require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this
time and could possibly require payment of substantial penalties. This could affect future results
of operations, cash flows, and possibly

II-17


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

In December 2002 and October 2003, the EPA issued final revisions to its NSR regulations under
the Clean Air Act. The December 2002 revisions included changes to the regulatory exclusions and
the methods of calculating emissions increases. The October 2003 regulations clarified the scope
of the existing Routine Maintenance, Repair, and Replacement (RMRR) exclusion. A coalition of
states and environmental organizations has filed petitions for review of these revisions with the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The October 2003 RMRR rules have been
stayed by the Court of Appeals pending its review of the rules. In any event, the final
regulations must also be adopted by the individual states to apply to facilities in the Southern
Company system. The effect of these final regulations, related legal challenges, and potential
state rulemakings cannot be determined at this time.

Carbon Dioxide Litigation

On July 21, 2004, attorneys general from eight states, each outside of Southern Company’s service
territory, and the corporation counsel for New York City filed a complaint in the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York against Southern Company and four other electric power
companies. A nearly identical complaint was filed by three environmental groups in the same court.
The complaints allege that the companies’ emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas,
contribute to global warming, which the plaintiffs assert is a public nuisance. Under common law
public and private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs seek a judicial order (1) holding each
defendant jointly and severally liable for creating, contributing to, and/or maintaining global
warming and (2) requiring each of the defendants to cap its emissions of carbon dioxide and then
reduce those emissions by a specified percentage each year for at least a decade. Plaintiffs have
not, however, requested that damages be awarded in connection with their claims. Southern Company
believes these claims are without merit and notes that the complaint cites no statutory or
regulatory basis for the claims. Southern Company and the other defendants have filed motions to
dismiss both lawsuits. Southern Company intends to vigorously defend against these claims. While
the outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time, an adverse judgment in either of
these actions could result in substantial capital expenditures.

Plant Wansley Environmental Litigation

On December 30, 2002, the Sierra Club, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Georgia Forestwatch,
and one individual filed a civil suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
Georgia against Georgia Power for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act at four of the units at
Plant Wansley. The civil action requests injunctive and declaratory relief, civil penalties, a
supplemental environmental project, and attorneys’ fees. The Clean Air Act authorizes civil
penalties of up to $27,500 per day, per violation at each generating unit. The liability phase of
the case has concluded with the court ruling in favor of Georgia Power in part and the plaintiffs
in part. Georgia Power has filed a petition for review of the decision with the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The district court case has been administratively closed pending
that appeal. If necessary, the district court will hold a separate trial which will address civil
penalties and possible injunctive relief requested by the plaintiffs. See Note 3 to the financial
statements under “Environmental Matters — Plant Wansley Environmental Litigation” for additional information. The
ultimate outcome of this matter cannot currently be determined; however, an adverse outcome could
require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly
require the payment of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of operations, cash
flows, and possibly financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

Environmental Statutes and Regulations

Southern Company’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by state and federal
environmental agencies under a variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental
media, including air, water, and land resources. Compliance with these environmental
requirements involves significant capital and operating costs, a major portion of which is
expected to be recovered through existing ratemaking provisions. Environmental costs that are
known and estimable at this time are included in capital expenditures discussed under FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY — “Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations” herein. There is
no assurance, however, that all such costs will, in fact, be recovered.

Compliance with the Clean Air Act and resulting regulations has been and will continue to
be a significant focus for the Company. The Title IV acid rain provisions of the Clean Air Act,
for example, required significant reductions in sulfur dioxide and

II-18


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2004 Annual Report

nitrogen oxide emissions and resulted in total construction expenditures of approximately $400
million through 2000. Some of these previous expenditures also assisted the Company in
complying with nitrogen oxide emission reduction requirements under Title I of the Clean Air
Act, which were designed to address one-hour ozone nonattainment problems in Atlanta, Georgia,
and Birmingham, Alabama. The states of Alabama and Georgia adopted regulations that required
additional nitrogen oxide emission reductions from May through September of each year at plants
in and/or near those nonattainment areas. Seven generating plants in the Atlanta area and two
plants in the Birmingham area are currently subject to those requirements, the most recent of
which went into effect in 2003. Construction expenditures for compliance with the nitrogen
oxide emission reduction requirements totaled approximately $1.1 billion through 2004 with an
additional $500 million committed through 2007 for these two states. These expenditures include
costs associated with the regional nitrogen oxide reduction rules discussed below. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Alabama Power Retail Regulatory Matters” for information regarding Alabama Power’s recovery of costs associated with
environmental laws and regulations.

In addition, in 2002, Gulf Power entered into an agreement with the State of Florida to
install additional controls on certain units and to retire three older units at a plant near
Pensacola to help ensure attainment of the ozone standard in the area. The conditions of the
agreement will be fully implemented in 2006 at a cost of approximately $138 million, of which
$44 million remains to be spent. Gulf Power’s costs have been approved under its environmental
cost recovery clause. See Note 1 to the financial statements under “Environmental Cost Recovery”
for additional information.

To help attain the one-hour ozone standard, the EPA issued regional nitrogen oxide
reduction rules in 1998. Those rules required 21 states, including Alabama and Georgia, to
reduce and cap nitrogen oxide emissions from power plants and other large industrial sources.
Affected sources, including five of the Company’s coal-fired plants in Alabama, were required to
comply with the reduction requirements by May 31, 2004. However, as a result of litigation
challenging the rule, the courts required the EPA to complete a separate rulemaking before the
requirements could be applied in Georgia. In April 2004, the EPA published final regional
nitrogen oxide reduction rules applicable to Georgia, specifying a May 1, 2007 compliance date.
However, in October 2004, the EPA announced that it would stay implementation of the rule as it
relates to Georgia, while it initiates rulemakings to address issues raised in a petition for
reconsideration filed by a coalition of Georgia industries. The impact of the nitrogen oxide
reduction rules will depend on the outcome of the petition for reconsideration and/or any
subsequent development and approval of Georgia’s state implementation plan and cannot be
determined at this time.

In March 2004, the EPA redesignated the Birmingham, Alabama, area from nonattainment to
attainment under the one-hour ozone standard. In addition, in September 2003 the EPA
reclassified the Atlanta area from a “serious” to a “severe” nonattainment area for the one-hour
standard effective January 1, 2004. However, based on the last three years of data, the State
of Georgia believes that the Atlanta area has attained the one-hour standard and is in the
process of applying for redesignation from the EPA.

In July 1997, the EPA revised the national ambient air quality standards for ozone and
particulate matter. These revisions made the standards significantly more stringent and
included development of an eight-hour ozone standard, as opposed to the previous one-hour ozone
standard. In the subsequent litigation of these standards, the U.S. Supreme Court found the
EPA’s implementation program for the new eight-hour ozone standard unlawful and remanded it to
the EPA for further rulemaking. During 2003, the EPA proposed implementation rules designed to
address the court’s concerns. On April 30, 2004, the EPA published its eight-hour ozone
nonattainment designations and a portion of the rules implementing the new eight-hour ozone
standard. Areas within the Southern Company’s service area that have been designated as
nonattainment under the eight-hour ozone standard include Birmingham, Macon (Georgia), and a
20-county area within metropolitan Atlanta. Under the implementation provisions of the new
rule, the EPA announced that the one-hour ozone standard will be revoked on June 15, 2005 and
that areas classified as “severe” nonattainment areas under the one-hour standard, such as
Atlanta, will not be required to impose emissions fees if those areas fail to come into
attainment with the one-hour standard. With respect to the eight-hour nonattainment areas,
state implementation plans, including new emission control regulations necessary to bring those
areas

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2004 Annual Report

into attainment, could be required as early as 2007. These state implementation plans could
require reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions from power plants. The impact of the eight-hour
designations and the new standard will depend on the development and implementation of
applicable state implementation plans and therefore cannot be determined at this time.

On December 17, 2004, the EPA issued its final “nonattainment” designations for the fine
particulate national ambient air quality standard. Several areas within Southern Company’s
service area in Alabama and Georgia were included in the EPA’s final particulate matter
designations. The EPA plans to propose a fine particulate matter implementation rule in 2005
and finalize the implementation rule in 2006. State implementation plans addressing the
nonattainment designations may be required by 2008 and could require reductions in sulfur
dioxide emissions and further reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions from power plants. The
impact of the fine particulate designations will depend on the development and implementation of
applicable state implementation plans and therefore cannot be determined at this time.

In January 2004, the EPA issued a proposed Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) to address
interstate transport of ozone and fine particles. This proposed rule would require additional
year-round sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission reductions from power plants in the
eastern United States in two phases — in 2010 and 2015. The EPA currently plans to finalize
this rule in 2005. If finalized, the rule could modify or supplant other state requirements for
attainment of the fine particulate matter standard and the eight-hour ozone standard, as well as
other air quality regulations. The impact of this rule on the Company will depend upon the
specific requirements of the final rule and cannot be determined at this time.

The Company has developed and maintains an environmental compliance strategy for the
installation of additional control technologies and the purchase of emission allowances to
assure continued compliance with current sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission regulations.
Additional expenses associated with these regulations are anticipated to be incurred each year
to maintain current and future compliance. Because the Company’s compliance strategy is
impacted by factors such as changes to existing environmental laws and regulations, increases in
the cost of emissions allowances, and any changes in the Company’s fuel mix, future
environmental compliance costs cannot be determined at this time.

Further reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides could also be required under the
EPA’s Regional Haze rules. The Regional Haze rules require states to establish Best Available
Retrofit Technology (BART) standards for certain sources that contribute to regional haze and to
implement emission reduction requirements that make progress toward remedying current visibility
impairment in certain natural areas. The Company has a number of plants that could be subject
to these rules. The EPA’s Regional Haze program calls for states to submit implementation plans
in 2008 that contain emission reduction strategies for implementing BART and for achieving
sufficient progress toward the Clean Air Act’s visibility improvement goal. In response to
litigation, the EPA proposed revised rules in May 2004, which it plans to finalize in April
2005. The impact of these regulations will depend on the promulgation of final rules and
implementation of those rules by the states, and, therefore, it is not possible to determine the
effect of these rules on the Company at this time.

In January 2004, the EPA issued proposed rules regulating mercury emissions from electric
utility boilers. The proposal solicits comments on two possible approaches for the new
regulations — a Maximum Achievable Control Technology approach and a cap-and-trade approach.
Either approach would require significant reductions in mercury emissions from Company
facilities. The regulations are scheduled to be finalized by March 2005, and compliance could
be required as early as 2008. Because the regulations have not been finalized, the impact on
the Company cannot be determined at this time.

Major bills to amend the Clean Air Act to impose more stringent emissions limitations on
power plants, including the Bush Administration’s Clear Skies Act, have been re-proposed in
2005. The Clear Skies Act is expected to further limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide,
nitrogen oxides, and mercury and to supplement the proposed CAIR and mercury regulatory
programs. Other proposals to limit emissions of carbon dioxide have also been introduced. The
cost impacts of such legislation would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot
be determined at this time.

II-20


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2004 Annual Report

Under the Clean Water Act, the EPA has been developing new rules aimed at reducing
impingement and entrainment of fish and fish larvae at power plants’ cooling water intake
structures. In July 2004, the EPA published final rules that will require biological studies
and, perhaps, retrofits to some intake structures at existing power plants. The impact of these
new rules will depend on the results of studies and analyses performed as part of the rules’
implementation and the actual limits established by the regulatory agencies.

Georgia Power is installing cooling towers at additional facilities under the Clean Water
Act to cool water prior to discharge. Near Atlanta, a cooling tower for one plant was completed
in 2004 with two others scheduled for completion in 2008. The total estimated cost of these
projects is $248 million, with $170 million remaining to be spent. Also, Georgia Power is
conducting a study of the aquatic environment at another facility to determine if further
thermal controls are necessary at that plant.

Several major pieces of environmental legislation are periodically considered for
reauthorization or amendment by Congress. These include: the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water
Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Emergency Planning &
Community Right-to-Know Act, and the Endangered Species Act. Compliance with possible
additional federal or state legislation or regulations related to global climate change or other
environmental and health concerns could also significantly affect Southern Company. The impact
of any new legislation, changes to existing legislation, or environmental regulations could
affect many areas of Southern Company’s operations. The full impact of any such changes cannot,
however, be determined at this time.

Global Climate Issues

Domestic efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions have been spurred by international
discussions surrounding the Framework Convention on Climate Change — and specifically the Kyoto
Protocol — which proposes constraints on the emissions of greenhouse gases for a group of
industrialized countries. The Bush Administration has not supported U.S. ratification of the
Kyoto Protocol or other mandatory carbon dioxide reduction legislation and, in 2002, announced a
goal to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of the U.S. — the ratio of greenhouse gas emissions
to the value of U.S. economic output — by 18 percent by 2012. A year later, the Department of
Energy (DOE) announced the Climate VISION program to support this goal. Energy-intensive
industries, including electricity generation, are the initial focus of this program. Southern
Company is leading the development of a voluntary electric utility sector climate change
initiative in partnership with the government. The utility sector has pledged to reduce its
greenhouse gas emissions rate by 3 to 5 percent over the next decade and, on December 13, 2004,
signed a memorandum of understanding with the DOE initiating this program under Climate VISION.
Because efforts under this voluntary program are just beginning, the impact of this program on
the Company cannot be determined at this time.

Environmental Remediation Reserves

Southern Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that cover the
handling and disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws
and regulations, the retail operating companies could incur substantial costs to clean up
properties. The retail operating companies conduct studies to determine the extent of any
required cleanup and have recognized in their respective financial statements the costs to clean
up known sites. Amounts for cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs were not material for any year
presented. The retail operating companies may be liable for some or all required cleanup costs
for additional sites that may require environmental remediation. See Note 3 to the financial
statements under “Environmental Matters — Environmental Remediation” for additional information.

In September 2004, Gulf Power increased its estimated liability for the estimated costs of
environmental remediation projects by approximately $47 million. This increase relates to new
regulations and more stringent site closure criteria by the Florida Department of Environmental
Protection (FDEP) for impacts to soil and groundwater from herbicide applications at Gulf Power
substations. The schedule for completion of the remediation projects will be subject to FDEP
approval. The projects have been approved by the Florida PSC for recovery, as expended, through
Gulf Power’s environmental cost recovery clause; therefore, there was no impact on Gulf Power’s
net income as a result of these revised estimates.

II-21


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2004 Annual Report

Under Georgia PSC ratemaking provisions, $22 million has been deferred in a regulatory
liability account for use in meeting future environmental remediation costs of Georgia Power.
Under the December 2004 three-year retail rate plan ending December 31, 2007 (2004 Retail Rate
Plan), this regulatory liability will be amortized over a three-year period beginning January 1,
2005. However, the order also approved an annual environmental accrual of $5.4 million.
Environmental remediation expenditures will be charged against the reserve as they are incurred.
The annual accrual amount will be reviewed and adjusted in future regulatory proceedings.

FERC and State PSC Matters

Transmission

In December 1999, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued its final rule on
Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs). Since that time, there have been a number of
additional proceedings at the FERC designed to encourage further voluntary formation of RTOs or
to mandate their formation. However, at the current time, there are no active proceedings that
would require Southern Company to participate in an RTO. Current FERC efforts that may
potentially change the regulatory and/or operational structure of transmission include rules
related to the standardization of generation interconnection, as well as an inquiry into, among
other things, market power by vertically integrated utilities. See “Generation Interconnection
Agreements” and “Market-Based Rate Authority” below for additional information. The final
outcome of these proceedings cannot now be determined. However, Southern Company’s financial
condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected by future changes
in the federal regulatory or operational structure of transmission.

Generation Interconnection Agreements

In July 2003, the FERC issued its final rule on the standardization of generation
interconnection agreements and procedures (Order 2003). Order 2003 shifts much of the financial
burden of new transmission investment from the generator to the transmission provider. The FERC
has indicated that Order 2003, which was effective January 20, 2004, is to be applied
prospectively to interconnection agreements. Subsidiaries of Tenaska, Inc., as counterparties
to three previously executed interconnection agreements with subsidiaries of Southern Company,
have filed complaints at the FERC requesting that the FERC modify the agreements and that
Southern Company refund a total of $19 million previously paid for interconnection facilities,
with interest. Southern Company has also received similar requests from other entities totaling
$9 million. Southern Company has opposed such relief, and the proceedings are still pending.
The impact of Order 2003 and its subsequent rehearings on Southern Company and the final results
of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Market-Based Rate Authority

Each of the retail operating companies and Southern Power has authorization from the FERC to
sell power to nonaffiliates at market-based prices. The retail operating companies and Southern
Power also have FERC authority to make short-term opportunity sales at market rates. Specific
FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a market-based contract with an affiliate. In
November 2001, the FERC modified the test it uses to consider utilities’ applications to charge
market-based rates and adopted a new test called the Supply Margin Assessment (SMA). The FERC
applied the SMA to several utilities, including Southern Company, the retail operating
companies, and Southern Power, and found Southern Company and others to be “pivotal suppliers”
in their retail service territories and ordered the implementation of several mitigation
measures. Southern Company and others sought rehearing of the FERC order, and the FERC delayed
the implementation of certain mitigation measures. In April 2004, the FERC issued an order that
abandoned the SMA test and adopted a new interim analysis for measuring generation market power.
This new interim approach requires utilities to submit a pivotal supplier screen and a
wholesale market share screen. If the applicant does not pass both screens, there will be a
rebuttable presumption regarding generation market power. The FERC’s order also sets forth
procedures for rebutting these presumptions and addresses mitigation measures for those entities
that are found to have market power. In the absence of specific mitigation measures, the order
includes several cost-based mitigation measures that would apply by default. The FERC also
initiated a new rulemaking proceeding that, among other things, will adopt a final methodology
for assessing generation market power.

II-22


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2004 Annual Report

In July 2004, the FERC denied Southern Company’s request for rehearing, along with a number
of others, and reaffirmed the interim tests that it adopted in April 2004. In August 2004, Southern
Company submitted a filing to the FERC that included results showing that Southern Company
passed the pivotal supplier screen for all markets and the wholesale market share screen for all
markets except the Southern Company retail service territory. Southern Company also submitted
other analyses to demonstrate that it lacks generation market power. On December 17, 2004, the
FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation dominance within its retail
service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other markets is not at issue. As
directed by this order, on February 15, 2005, Southern Company submitted additional information
related to generation dominance in its retail service territory. Any new market-based rate
transactions in its retail service territory entered into after February 27, 2005 will be
subject to refund to the level of the default cost-based rates, pending the outcome of the
proceeding. Southern Company, along with other utilities, has also filed an appeal of the FERC’s
April and July 2004 orders with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
The FERC has asked the court to dismiss the appeal on the grounds that it is premature.

In the event that the FERC’s default mitigation measures are ultimately applied, Southern
Power and the retail operating companies may be required to charge cost-based rates for certain
wholesale sales in the retail service territory, which may be lower than negotiated market-based
rates. The final outcome of this matter will depend on the form in which the final methodology
for assessing generation market power and mitigation rules may be ultimately adopted and cannot
be determined at this time.

Georgia Power Retail Rate Case

On December 21, 2004, the Georgia PSC approved the 2004 Retail Rate Plan for Georgia Power. Under the terms of the 2004 Retail Rate Plan,
earnings will be evaluated against a retail ROE range of 10.25 percent to 12.25 percent.
Two-thirds of any earnings above 12.25 percent will be applied to rate refunds, with the
remaining one-third retained by Georgia Power. Retail rates and customer fees were increased by
approximately $203 million effective January 1, 2005 to cover the higher costs of purchased
power, operating and maintenance expenses, environmental compliance, and continued investment in
new generation, transmission, and distribution facilities to support growth and ensure
reliability.

Georgia Power will not file for a general base rate increase unless its projected retail
return on common equity falls below 10.25 percent. Georgia Power is required to file a general
rate case by July 1, 2007, in response to which the Georgia PSC would be expected to determine
whether the 2004 Retail Rate Plan should be continued, modified, or discontinued. See Note 3 to
the financial statements under “Georgia Power Retail Rate Activity” for additional information.

Alabama Power Environmental Rate Filing

On October 5, 2004, the Alabama PSC approved a specific rate mechanism for the recovery of
Alabama Power’s retail costs associated with environmental laws, regulations, or other such
mandates. The rate mechanism began operation in January 2005 and provides for the recovery of
these costs pursuant to a factor that will be calculated annually. Environmental costs to be
recovered include operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation, and a return on invested
capital. Retail rates have increased 1 percent in 2005, which should yield an annual recovery
of approximately $33 million, and are expected to increase an additional 1 percent in 2006. In
conjunction with the Alabama PSC’s approval, Alabama Power agreed to a moratorium until March
2007 on any retail rate increase under the previously approved Rate Stabilization and
Equalization plan (RSE). Any increase in March 2007 would be based upon the retail ROE at
December 31, 2006. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Alabama Power Retail Regulatory
Matters” for further information on RSE.

Mississippi Power Retail Rate Filing

In May 2004, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power’s request to reclassify to
jurisdictional cost of service the 266 megawatts of Plant Daniel unit 3 and 4 capacity,
effective January 1, 2004. The Mississippi PSC authorized Mississippi Power to include the
related costs and revenue credits in jurisdictional rate base, cost of service, and revenue
requirement calculations for purposes of retail rate recovery. Mississippi Power is amortizing
the regulatory liability established pursuant to the Mississippi PSC’s interim December 2003
order, as approved in May 2004, to earnings as follows: $16.5 million in 2004, $25.1 million in

II-23


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2004 Annual Report

2005, $13.0 million in 2006, and $5.7 million in 2007, resulting in expense reductions in each
of those years.

Plant McIntosh Construction Project

In December 2002 after a competitive bidding process, the Georgia PSC certified PPAs between
Southern Power and Georgia Power and Savannah Electric for capacity from Plant McIntosh units 10
and 11, construction of which is scheduled to be completed in June 2005. In April 2003, Southern
Power applied for FERC approval of these PPAs. In July 2003, the FERC accepted the PPAs to
become effective June 1, 2005, subject to refund, and ordered that hearings be held. Intervenors
opposed the FERC’s acceptance of the PPAs, alleging that they did not meet the applicable
standards for market-based rates between affiliates. To ensure the timely completion of the
Plant McIntosh construction project and the availability of the units in the summer of 2005 for
their retail customers, Savannah Electric and Georgia Power in May 2004 requested the Georgia
PSC to direct them to acquire the Plant McIntosh construction project. The Georgia PSC issued
such an order and the transfer occurred on May 24, 2004 at a total cost of approximately $415
million, including $14 million of transmission interconnection facilities. Subsequently,
Southern Power filed a request to withdraw the PPAs and to terminate the ongoing FERC
proceedings. In August 2004, the FERC issued a notice accepting the request to withdraw the PPAs
and permitting such request to become effective by operation of law. However, the FERC made no
determination on what additional steps may need to be taken with respect to testimony provided
in the proceedings. The ultimate outcome of any additional FERC action cannot now be determined.

As directed by the Georgia PSC order, Georgia Power and Savannah Electric in June 2004
filed an application to amend the resource certificate granted by the Georgia PSC in 2002 to
change the character of the resource from a purchase to a self-owned, rate based asset and to
describe the approximate construction schedule and the proposed rate base treatment.
In connection with the 2004 Retail Rate Plan, the Georgia PSC approved the transfer of the
Plant McIntosh construction project at a total fair market value of approximately $385 million.
This value reflects an approximate $16 million disallowance and reduced Southern Company’s 2004
net income by approximately $9.5 million. The Georgia PSC also certified a total completion
cost of $547 million for the project. The amount of the disallowance will be adjusted
accordingly based on the actual completion cost of the project. Under the 2004 Retail Rate
Plan, the Plant McIntosh impact will be reflected in Georgia Power’s rates evenly over the three
years ending 2007. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Georgia Power Retail Rate
Activity” and “Plant McIntosh Construction Project” for additional information on the 2004
Retail Rate Plan and the Plant McIntosh construction project.

Retail Fuel Cost Recovery

The retail operating companies each have established fuel cost recovery rates approved by their
respective state PSCs. In recent months, the retail operating companies have experienced higher
than expected fuel costs for coal and gas. These higher fuel costs have increased the under
recovered fuel costs included in the balance sheets. The retail operating companies will
continue to monitor the under recovered fuel cost balance in light of these higher fuel costs.

Alabama Power fuel costs are recovered under Rate ECR (Energy Cost Recovery), which provides
for the addition of a fuel and energy cost factor to base rates. In April 2005, this factor is
scheduled to increase from its current level.

On February 18, 2005, Georgia Power filed a request with the Georgia PSC for a fuel cost
recovery rate increase effective April 1, 2005, subject to refund. The requested increase,
representing an average annual increase in revenues of approximately 11.7 percent, will allow
for the recovery of fuel costs based on an estimate of future fuel costs, as well as the
collection of the existing under recovery of fuel costs. Georgia Power’s under recovered fuel
costs as of January 31, 2005 totaled $390 million. The Georgia PSC will examine Georgia Power’s
fuel expenditures and determine whether the proposed fuel cost recovery rate is just and
reasonable before issuing its decision in May 2005. The final outcome of the filing cannot be
determined at this time. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Georgia Power Retail
Rate Activity” for additional information.

II-24


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2004 Annual Report

Storm Damage Cost Recovery

Each retail operating company maintains a reserve for property damage to cover the cost of
damages from major storms to its transmission and distribution lines and the cost of uninsured
damages to its generation facilities and other property. In September 2004, Hurricane Ivan hit
the Gulf Coast of Florida and Alabama and continued north through Southern Company’s service
territory causing substantial damage.

At Gulf Power, the related costs charged to its property damage reserve as of December 31,
2004 were $93.5 million. Prior to Hurricane Ivan, Gulf Power’s reserve balance was approximately
$28 million. Gulf Power’s current annual accrual to the property damage reserve, as approved by
the Florida PSC, is $3.5 million. The Florida PSC has also approved additional accrual amounts
at Gulf Power’s discretion, and Gulf Power accrued an additional $15 million in 2004. In
February 2005, Gulf Power, the Office of Public Counsel for the State of Florida, and the
Florida Industrial Power Users Group filed a Stipulation and Settlement with the Florida PSC
that, if approved, would allow Gulf Power to recover the retail portion of $51.7 million of
these costs, plus interest and revenue taxes, from customers over a 24-month period. In
connection with the stipulation, Gulf Power has agreed that it will not seek any additional
increase in its base rates and charges to become effective on or before March 1, 2007.

At Alabama Power, operation and maintenance expenses associated with repairing the damage to
its facilities and restoring service to customers as a result of Hurricane Ivan were $57.8 million
for 2004. The balance in Alabama Power’s natural disaster reserve prior to the storm was $14.6
million. In October 2004, Alabama Power received approval from the Alabama PSC to defer the
negative balance for recovery in future periods. Alabama Power is allowed to accrue $250,000 per
month until a maximum accumulated provision of $32 million is attained. Higher accruals to restore
the reserve to its authorized level are allowed whenever the balance in the reserve declines below
$22.4 million. During 2004, Alabama Power accrued $9.9 million, including an additional amount of
$6.9 million, to the reserve and at December 31, 2004, the negative balance totaled $37.7 million
and is reflected in the balance sheet as a regulatory asset.

In February 2005, Alabama Power requested and received Alabama PSC approval of an accounting
order that allows Alabama Power to immediately return certain regulatory liabilities to the retail
customers. The order also allows Alabama Power to simultaneously recover from customers an accrual
of approximately $45 million to offset the costs of Hurricane Ivan and restore a positive balance
in the natural disaster reserve. The combined effects of this order will have no impact on Alabama
Power’s net income in 2005. See Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements under “Storm Damage
Reserves” and “Gulf Power and Alabama Power Storm Damage Recovery,” respectively, for additional
information on these reserves.

Income Tax Matters

Synthetic Fuel Tax Credits

As discussed in Note 3 to the
financial statements under “Income Tax Matters — Synthetic Fuel Tax Credits,” Southern
Company has investments in two entities that produce synthetic fuel and receive tax credits
under Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Internal Revenue Code).
These investments include a 30 percent interest in Alabama Fuel Products (AFP) and a 24.975
percent interest in Carbontronics Synfuels Investors, L.P. (Carbontronics). In January 2004,
the IRS completed an audit of AFP for 1999 and 2000. In December 2004, the IRS notified
Carbontronics that its audit for 2000 and 2001 had been completed. In addition, in December
2004, the IRS also concluded its audits of Southern Company’s consolidated income tax returns
for 2000 and 2001. The IRS raised no issues related to synthetic fuel tax credits upon
conclusion of any of these audits. As a result, in December 2004, Southern Company reversed its
related reserve of $37 million.

In accordance with Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code, these tax credits are subject
to limitation as the annual average price of oil (as determined by the DOE) increases over a
specified, inflation-adjusted dollar amount published in the spring of the subsequent year.
Southern Company, along with its partners in these investments, will continue to monitor oil
prices. Any indicated potential limitation on these credits could affect either the timing or
the amount of the credit recognition and could also require an impairment analysis of these
investments by Southern Company.

Leveraged Lease Transactions

Southern Company participates in four international leveraged lease transactions and receives
federal income tax deductions for rent, depreciation, and

II-25


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2004 Annual Report

amortization, as well as interest on related debt. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial
statements under “Income Tax Matters — Leveraged Lease Transactions,” the IRS proposed to
disallow the tax losses for one of the lease transactions in connection with its audit of 1996
through 1999. To stop the interest accretion, Southern Company deposited approximately $30
million of additional taxes and interest with the IRS and filed a refund claim. In connection
with its audit of 2000 and 2001, the IRS proposed a similar assessment of approximately $18
million, including approximately $3 million of interest. In October 2004, Southern Company
submitted the issue to the IRS appeals division and, in February 2005, reached a negotiated
settlement with the IRS. The settlement had no material impact on Southern Company’s financial
statements.

In connection with its audit of 2000 and 2001, the IRS has also challenged Southern
Company’s deductions related to three other international lease transactions. Southern Company
believes these transactions are valid leases for U.S. tax purposes and is pursuing resolution
with the IRS. If the IRS is ultimately successful in disallowing the tax deductions related to
these three transactions, beginning with the 2000 tax year, Southern Company could be subject to
additional interest charges of up to $20 million. Additionally, although the payment of the tax
liability, exclusive of this interest, would not affect Southern Company’s results of operations
under current accounting standards, it could have a material impact on cash flow. Furthermore,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is currently considering changes to the
accounting for income tax settlements related to leveraged leases, which may result in a net
income impact from such settlements. See Note 1 to the financial statements under “Leveraged
Leases” for additional details of the deferred taxes related to these transactions. The final
outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.

American Jobs Creation Act of 2004

On October 22, 2004, President Bush signed the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Jobs Act)
into law. The Jobs Act includes a provision that allows a generation tax deduction for
utilities. Southern Company is currently assessing the impact of the Jobs Act, including this
deduction, as well as the related regulatory treatment, on its taxable income. However,
Southern Company currently does not expect the Jobs Act to have a material impact on its
financial statements.

Other Matters

Other Construction Projects

In October 2004, a partnership between Southern Company and the Orlando Utilities Commission
(OUC) was selected by the DOE to build and operate a 285 megawatt coal-gasification facility.
The facility will be located at OUC’s Stanton Energy Center near Orlando, Florida, site of Plant
Stanton A, an existing gas-fired 630 megawatt unit co-owned by Southern Power, OUC, and others.
Southern Power will own and operate the Southern Company portion of the project. The project
will demonstrate a coal gasification technology that has been under development, in partnership
with the DOE, by Southern Company. The project is expected to begin commercial operation in
2011, with a projected total cost of $557 million. The DOE is expected to contribute
approximately $235 million of the cost.

In August 2004, Southern Power completed limited construction activities on Plant Franklin
Unit 3 to preserve the long-term viability of the project. Final completion is not anticipated
until the 2008-2011 period. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Plant Franklin
Construction Project” for additional information. The final outcome of this matter cannot now be
determined.

Mirant Related Matters

On July 14, 2003, Mirant Corporation (Mirant) filed for voluntary reorganization under Chapter
11 of the Bankruptcy Code with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. Southern Company has certain
contingent liabilities associated with guarantees of contractual commitments made by Mirant’s
subsidiaries discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements under “Guarantees” and with various
lawsuits discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements under “Mirant Related Matters.”

In December 2004, as a result of concluding an IRS audit for the tax years 2000 and 2001,
Southern Company paid $39 million in additional tax and interest for issues related to Mirant
tax items. Under the terms of the separation agreements entered in connection with the
spin-off, Mirant agreed to indemnify Southern Company for costs associated with these
guarantees, lawsuits, and additional IRS assessments. However, as a result of Mirant’s
bankruptcy, Southern Company must seek reimbursement as a creditor in the Chapter 11 proceeding.
Based on management’s assessment of

II-26


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2004 Annual Report

the collectibility of this receivable, Southern Company reserved approximately $12.5 million.
If Southern Company is ultimately required to make any additional payments related to these
obligations, Mirant’s indemnification obligation to Southern Company for these additional
payments may also represent an unsecured claim, subject to compromise pursuant to Mirant’s final
reorganization plan.

Other

In accordance with FASB Statement No. 87, Employers’ Accounting for Pensions, Southern Company
recorded non-cash pension income, before tax, of approximately $44 million, $99 million, and
$117 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Future pension income is dependent on
several factors including trust earnings and changes to the pension plan. The decline in
pension income is expected to continue and become an expense as early as 2006. Postretirement
benefit costs for Southern Company were $106 million, $101 million, and $99 million in 2004,
2003, and 2002, respectively, and are expected to continue to trend upward. A portion of
pension income and postretirement benefit costs is capitalized based on construction-related
labor charges. For the retail operating companies, pension and postretirement benefit costs are
a component of the regulated rates and generally do not have a long-term effect on net income.
For more information regarding pension and postretirement benefits, see Note 2 to the financial
statements.

Southern Company is involved in various other matters being litigated, regulatory matters,
and certain tax related issues that could affect future earnings. See Note 3 to the financial
statements for information regarding material issues.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Southern Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. Significant accounting policies are
described in Note 1 to the financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain
estimates are made that may have a material impact on Southern Company’s results of operations
and related disclosures. Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that
are significantly different from those recorded in the financial statements. Senior management
has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates
described below with the Audit Committee of Southern Company’s Board of Directors.

Electric Utility Regulation

Southern Company’s retail operating companies, which comprise approximately 85 percent of
Southern Company’s total earnings, are subject to retail regulation by their respective state
PSCs and wholesale regulation by the FERC. These regulatory agencies set the rates the retail
operating companies are permitted to charge customers based on allowable costs. As a result,
the retail operating companies apply FASB Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of
Certain Types of Regulation, which requires the financial statements to reflect the effects of
rate regulation. Through the ratemaking process, the regulators may require the inclusion of
costs or revenues in periods different than when they would be recognized by a non-regulated
company. This treatment may result in the deferral of expenses and the recording of related
regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery through rates or the deferral of gains or
creation of liabilities and the recording of related regulatory liabilities. The application of
Statement No. 71 has a further effect on the Company’s financial statements as a result of the
estimates of allowable costs used in the ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from
those actually incurred by the retail operating companies; therefore, the accounting estimates
inherent in specific costs such as depreciation, nuclear decommissioning, and pension and
postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on the Company’s results of operations than
they would on a non-regulated company.

As reflected in Note 1 to the financial statements, significant regulatory assets and
liabilities have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of these
regulatory assets and liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines. However, adverse
legislative, judicial, or regulatory actions could materially impact the amounts of such
regulatory assets and liabilities and could adversely impact the Company’s financial statements.

Contingent Obligations

Southern Company and its subsidiaries are subject to a number of federal and state laws and
regulations, as well as other factors and conditions that

II-27


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2004 Annual Report

potentially subject them to environmental, litigation, income tax, and other risks. See FUTURE
EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Note 3 to the financial statements for more information regarding
certain of these contingencies. Southern Company periodically evaluates its exposure to such
risks and records reserves for those matters where a loss is considered probable and reasonably
estimable in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The adequacy of reserves
can be significantly affected by external events or conditions that can be unpredictable; thus,
the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially affect Southern Company’s financial
statements. These events or conditions include the following:

Unbilled Revenues

Revenues related to the sale of electricity are recorded when electricity is delivered to
customers. However, the determination of kilowatt-hour sales to individual customers is based
on the reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month.
At the end of each month, amounts of electricity delivered to customers, but not yet metered and
billed, are estimated. Components of the unbilled revenue estimates include total kilowatt-hour
territorial supply, total kilowatt-hour billed, estimated total electricity lost in delivery,
and customer usage. These components can fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including
weather, generation patterns, and power delivery volume and other operational constraints.
These factors can be unpredictable and can vary from historical trends. As a result, the
overall estimate of unbilled revenues could be significantly affected, which could have a
material impact on the Company’s results of operations.

New Accounting Standards

On March 31, 2004, Southern Company prospectively adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46R,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” which requires the primary beneficiary of a
variable interest entity to consolidate the related assets and liabilities. The adoption of
FASB Interpretation No. 46R had no impact on Southern Company’s net income. However, as a
result of the adoption, Southern Company and the retail operating companies deconsolidated
certain wholly-owned trusts established to issue preferred securities since Southern Company and
the retail operating companies do not meet the definition of primary beneficiary established by
FASB Interpretation No. 46R. In addition, Southern Company consolidated its 85 percent limited
partnership investment in an energy/technology venture capital fund that was previously
accounted for under the equity method. See Note 1 to the financial statements under “Variable
Interest Entities” for additional information.

In the third quarter 2004, Southern Company prospectively adopted FASB Staff Position (FSP)
106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act). The Medicare Act provides a 28
percent prescription drug subsidy for Medicare eligible retirees. FSP 106-2 requires recognition
of the impacts of the Medicare Act in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO)
and future cost of service for postretirement medical plans. The effect of the subsidy reduced
Southern Company’s expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2004 by approximately $10.6
million and is expected to have a similar impact on future expenses. The subsidy’s impact on the
postretirement medical plan APBO was a reduction of approximately $182 million. However, the
ultimate impact on future periods is subject to final interpretation of the federal regulations
which were published on January 21, 2005. See Note 2 to the financial statements under
“Postretirement Benefits” for additional information.

FASB Statement No. 123R, Share-Based Payment was issued in December 2004. This statement
requires that compensation cost relating to

II-28


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2004 Annual Report

share-based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements. That cost will be
measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. For
Southern Company, this statement is effective beginning on July 1, 2005. Although the
compensation expense required under the revised statement differs slightly, the impacts on the
Company’s financial statements are expected to be similar to the pro forma disclosures included
in Note 1 to the financial statements under “Stock Options.”

See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “Income Tax Matters — American Jobs Creation Act of 2004”
herein for information regarding the adoption of new tax legislation. In December 2004, the FASB
issued FSP 109-1, Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax
Deduction on Qualified Production Activities provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004,
which requires that the generation deduction be accounted for as a special tax deduction rather
than as a tax rate reduction. Southern Company is currently assessing the Jobs Act and this
pronouncement, as well as the related regulatory treatment, but currently does not expect a
material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

Southern Company’s financial condition continued to be strong at December 31, 2004. Net cash
flow from operating activities totaled $2.7 billion, $3.1 billion, and $2.9 billion for 2004,
2003, and 2002, respectively. The $379 million decrease for 2004 resulted primarily from higher
fuel costs at the retail operating companies. Those costs are recoverable in future periods and
are reflected on the balance sheets as under recovered regulatory
clause revenues. The $218
million increase from 2002 to 2003 resulted primarily from the deferral of income tax
liabilities arising from accelerated depreciation deductions, partially offset by the settlement
of interest rate hedges. Gross property additions to utility plant were $2.1 billion in 2004.
The majority of funds needed for gross property additions since 2000 has been provided from
operating activities.

Significant balance sheet changes include a $0.5 billion increase in long-term debt and
preferred stock for 2004 due to the replacement of short-term financing with long-term debt,
consistent with the Company’s finance policy, and an increase of $0.8 billion in property, plant,
and equipment.

At the close of 2004, the closing price of Southern Company’s common stock was $33.52 per
share, compared with book value of $13.86 per share. The market-to-book value ratio was 242
percent at the end of 2004, compared with 230 percent at year-end 2003.

Each of the retail operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Services, Inc.
(SCS), the system service company, have received investment grade ratings from the major rating
agencies.

Sources of Capital

Southern Company intends to meet its future capital needs through internal cash flow and
externally through the issuance of debt, preferred securities, preferred stock, and equity.
Equity capital can be provided from any combination of the Company’s stock plans, private
placements, or public offerings. The amount and timing of additional equity capital to be raised
in 2005 — as well as in subsequent years — will be contingent on Southern Company’s investment
opportunities. The Company does not currently anticipate any equity offerings in 2005 and is
currently developing a program to repurchase shares to offset issuances under the Company’s
stock compensation plans.

The retail operating companies plan to obtain the funds required for construction and other
purposes from sources similar to those used in the past, which were primarily from operating
cash flows. In recent years, financings primarily have utilized unsecured debt and preferred
securities. However, the type and timing of any financings — if needed — will depend on market
conditions and regulatory approval. The issuance of securities by Southern Company and its
subsidiaries is generally subject to regulatory approval by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended (PUHCA), and,
generally, for the retail operating companies, the appropriate state PSC. Additionally, with
respect to the public offering of securities, Southern Company and its subsidiaries must file
registration statements with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (1933 Act).
The amounts of securities authorized by the appropriate regulatory authorities, as well as the
amounts registered under the 1933 Act, are continuously monitored and appropriate filings are
made to ensure flexibility in the capital markets.

II-29


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2004 Annual Report

Southern Power plans to use operating cash flows, external funds, and equity capital from
Southern Company to finance its capital expenditures. External funds are expected to be
obtained from the issuance of unsecured senior debt and commercial paper or through credit
arrangements from banks.

Southern Company and each retail operating company obtains financing separately without
credit support from any affiliate. Currently, Southern Company provides limited credit support
to Southern Power. See Note 6 to the financial statements under “Bank Credit Arrangements” for
additional information. The Southern Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or
money pool. Therefore, funds of each company are not commingled with funds of any other
company. In accordance with the PUHCA, most loans between affiliated companies must be approved
in advance by the SEC.

Southern Company’s current liabilities frequently exceed current assets because of the
continued use of short-term debt as a funding source to meet cash needs as well as scheduled
maturities of long-term debt. To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, Southern Company
has various internal and external sources of liquidity. At December 31, 2004, Southern Company
and its subsidiaries had approximately $373 million of cash and cash equivalents and $3.2
billion of unused credit arrangements with banks, as described below. In addition, Southern
Company has substantial cash flow from operating activities and access to the capital markets,
including commercial paper programs, to meet liquidity needs.

At December 31, 2004, the Southern Company system had approximately $3.2 billion of unused
credit arrangements with banks, of which $1.8 billion expire in 2005 and $1.4 billion expire in
2006 and beyond. Approximately $1.2 billion of the credit facilities expiring in 2005 allow for
the execution of term loans for an additional two-year period, and $275 million allow for the
execution of one-year term loans. See Note 6 to the financial statements under “Bank Credit
Arrangements” for additional information.

Financing Activities

During 2004, Southern Company and its subsidiaries issued $2.1 billion of long-term debt,
including long-term debt payable to affiliated trusts, and $175 million of preferred stock. In
addition, Southern Company issued 7 million new shares of common stock through the Company’s
stock plans and realized proceeds of $124 million. The security issuances were primarily used to
redeem $1.5 billion of long-term debt. The remainder was used to reduce short-term debt,
provide capital contributions to subsidiaries, and fund Southern Company’s ongoing construction
program.

Subsequent to December 31, 2004, Georgia Power refinanced $250 million of maturing long-term
debt.

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements

In May 2001, Mississippi Power began the initial 10-year term of a lease agreement for a combined
cycle generating facility built at Plant Daniel. The facility cost approximately $370 million. In
2003, the generating facility was acquired by Juniper Capital L.P. (Juniper), a limited partnership
whose investors are unaffiliated with Mississippi Power. Simultaneously, Juniper entered into a
restructured lease agreement with Mississippi Power. Juniper has also entered into leases with
other parties unrelated to Mississippi Power. The assets leased by Mississippi Power comprise less
than 50 percent of Juniper’s assets. Mississippi Power is not required to consolidate the leased
assets and related liabilities, and the lease with Juniper is considered an operating lease. The
lease also provides for a residual value guarantee — approximately 73 percent of the acquisition
cost — by Mississippi Power that is due upon termination of the lease in the event that
Mississippi Power does not renew the lease or purchase the assets and that the fair market value is
less than the unamortized cost of the assets. See Note 7 to the financial statements under
“Operating Leases” for additional information.

Credit Rating Risk

The Company does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment
schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. There are certain contracts
that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating
change to BBB- or Baa3 or below. These contracts are primarily for physical electricity
purchases and sales. At December 31, 2004, the maximum potential collateral requirements at a
BBB- or Baa3 rating were approximately $40 million. The maximum potential collateral
requirements at a rating below BBB- or Baa3 were approximately $324 million. Generally,
collateral may be provided for by a

II-30


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2004 Annual Report

Southern Company guaranty,
letter of credit, or cash. The Company is also party to certain
derivative agreements that could require collateral and/or accelerated payment in the event of a
credit rating change to below investment grade. These agreements are primarily for natural gas
price and interest rate risk management activities. At December 31, 2004, Southern Company and
its subsidiaries’ maximum potential exposure to these contracts was $10 million.

Market Price Risk

Southern Company is exposed to market risks, primarily commodity price risk and interest rate
risk. To manage the volatility attributable to these exposures, the Company nets the exposures
to take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the
remaining exposures pursuant to the Company’s policies in areas such as counterparty exposure
and risk management practices. Company policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for
hedging purposes and mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies.
Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including, but not limited to, market
valuation, value at risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis.

To mitigate exposure to interest rates, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps
that have been designated as hedges. The weighted average interest rate on $1.8 billion of
long-term variable interest rate exposure that has not been hedged at January 1, 2005 was 2.6
percent. If Southern Company sustained a 100 basis point change in interest rates for all
unhedged variable rate long-term debt, the change would affect annualized interest expense by
approximately $20.1 million at January 1, 2005. For further information, see Notes 1 and 6 to
the financial statements under “Financial Instruments.”

Due to cost-based rate regulations, the retail operating companies have limited exposure to
market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity. In
addition, Southern Power’s exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of
electricity is limited because its long-term sales contracts shift substantially all fuel cost
responsibility to the purchaser. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in
electricity prices, the retail operating companies and Southern Power enter into fixed-price
contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity market and,
to a lesser extent, into similar contracts for gas purchases. The retail operating companies
have implemented fuel-hedging programs at the instruction of their respective state PSCs.
Southern Company GAS also has in place a risk management program to substantially mitigate its
exposure to price volatility for its natural gas purchases.

The changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts and year-end valuations were

Unrealized gains and losses from mark-to-market adjustments on derivative contracts related to
the retail operating companies’ fuel hedging programs are recorded as regulatory assets and

recovered through the retail operating companies’ fuel cost recovery clauses. In addition,
unrealized gains and losses on energy-related derivatives used by Southern Power and Southern
Company GAS to hedge anticipated purchases and sales are deferred in other comprehensive income.
Gains and losses on derivative contracts that are not designated as hedges are recognized in the
income statement as incurred. At December 31, 2004, the fair value of derivative energy contracts
was reflected in the financial statements as follows:

Unrealized pre-tax gains and losses recognized in income were not material for any year
presented. Southern Company is exposed to market price risk in the event of nonperformance by
counterparties to the derivative energy contracts. Southern Company’s policy is to enter into
agreements with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody’s and Standard &
Poor’s or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure.
Therefore, Southern Company does not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the
counterparties. For additional information, see Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements under
“Financial Instruments.”

Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations

The construction program of Southern Company is currently estimated to be $2.2 billion for 2005,
$2.5 billion for 2006, and $3.2 billion for 2007. Environmental expenditures included in these
amounts are $452 million, $615 million, and $896 million for 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively.
Actual construction costs may vary from this estimate because of changes in such factors as:
business conditions; environmental regulations; nuclear plant regulations; FERC rules and
transmission regulations; load projections; the cost and efficiency of construction labor,
equipment, and materials, and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that
costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered.

Southern Company has approximately 1,200 megawatts of new generating capacity scheduled to
be placed in service by Georgia Power and Savannah Electric in June 2005. In addition, capital
improvements, including those needed to meet the environmental standards previously discussed
for the
retail operating companies’ generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, are ongoing.

As a result of requirements by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Alabama Power and Georgia
Power have established external trust funds for nuclear decommissioning costs. For additional
information, see Note 1 to the financial statements under “Nuclear Decommissioning.” Also, as
discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements under “Fuel Costs,” in 1993 the DOE implemented a
special assessment over a 15-year period on utilities with nuclear plants, to be used for the
decontamination and decommissioning of its nuclear fuel enrichment facilities.

In addition, as discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, Southern Company provides
postretirement benefits to substantially all employees and funds trusts to the extent required by
the retail operating companies’ respective regulatory commissions.

Other funding requirements related to obligations associated with scheduled maturities of
long-term debt and preferred securities, as well as the related interest, preferred stock
dividends, leases, and other purchase commitments are as follows. See Notes 1, 6, and 7 to the
financial statements for additional information.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

Southern Company’s 2004 Annual Report contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking
statements include, among other things, statements concerning the strategic goals for Southern
Company’s wholesale business, retail sales growth, storm damage cost recovery, environmental
regulations and expenditures, the Company’s projections for postretirement benefit trust
contributions, completion of construction projects, and estimated construction and other
expenditures. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as
“may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,”
“projects,” “predicts,” “potential,” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other similar
terminology. There are various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from
those suggested by the forward-looking statements; accordingly, there can be no assurance that such
indicated results will be realized. These factors include:

Southern Company expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2004 Annual Report

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General

Southern Company is the parent company of five retail operating companies, Southern Power
Company (Southern Power), Southern Company Services (SCS), Southern Communications Services
(SouthernLINC Wireless), Southern Company Gas (Southern Company GAS), Southern Company Holdings
(Southern Holdings), Southern Nuclear Operating Company (Southern Nuclear), Southern Telecom,
and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The retail operating companies — Alabama Power,
Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, and Savannah Electric — provide electric service
in four Southeastern states. Southern Power constructs, owns, and manages Southern Company’s
competitive generation assets and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale
market. Contracts among the retail operating companies and Southern Power — related to jointly
owned generating facilities, interconnecting transmission lines, or the exchange of electric
power — are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and/or the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC). SCS — the system service company — provides, at cost,
specialized services to Southern Company and the subsidiary companies. SouthernLINC Wireless
provides digital wireless communications services to the retail operating companies and also
markets these services to the public within the Southeast. Southern Telecom provides fiber
cable services within the Southeast. Southern Company GAS is a competitive retail natural gas
marketer serving customers in the State of Georgia. Southern Holdings is an intermediate
holding subsidiary for Southern Company’s investments in synthetic fuels and leveraged leases
and various other energy-related businesses. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to
Southern Company’s nuclear power plants.

The financial statements reflect Southern Company’s investments in the subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis. The equity method is used for subsidiaries in which the Company has
significant influence but does not control and for variable interest entities where the Company
is not the primary beneficiary. All material intercompany items have been eliminated in
consolidation. Certain prior years’ data presented in the financial statements have been
reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.

Southern Company is registered as a holding company under the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935, as amended (PUHCA). Both the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to
the regulatory provisions of the PUHCA. In addition, the retail operating companies and
Southern Power are subject to regulation by the FERC, and the retail operating companies are
also subject to regulation by their respective state public service commissions (PSC). The
companies follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and comply with
the accounting policies and practices prescribed by their respective commissions. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those
estimates.

Related Party Transactions

Alabama Power and Georgia Power purchase synthetic fuel from Alabama Fuel Products, LLC (AFP), an
entity in which Southern Holdings holds a 30 percent ownership interest. Total fuel purchases for
2004, 2003, and 2002 were $409 million, $312 million, and $217 million, respectively. Synfuel
Services, Inc. (SSI), another subsidiary of Southern Holdings, provides fuel transportation
services to AFP that are ultimately reflected in the cost of the synthetic fuel billed to Alabama
Power and Georgia Power. In connection with these services, the related revenues of approximately
$82 million, $65 million, and $35 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively, have been
eliminated against fuel expense in the financial statements. SSI also provides additional services
to AFP, as well as to a related party of AFP. Revenues from these transactions totaled
approximately $24 million, $20 million, and $15 million, in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

Revenues

Capacity revenues are generally recognized on a levelized basis over the appropriate contract
periods. Energy and other revenues are recognized as services are provided. Unbilled revenues
are accrued at the end of each fiscal period. Electric rates for the retail operating companies
include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, fuel hedging, the energy
component of purchased power costs, and certain other costs. Revenues are adjusted for
differences between the actual recoverable costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates.

II-42


NOTES(continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2004 Annual Report

Southern Company has a diversified base of customers. No single customer or industry comprises 10 percent or more of revenues. For all
periods presented, uncollectible accounts averaged less than 1 percent of revenues despite an
increase in customer bankruptcies.

Fuel Costs

Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is used. Fuel expense generally includes the cost of
purchased emission allowances as they are used. Fuel expense also includes the amortization of
the cost of nuclear fuel and a charge, based on nuclear generation, for the permanent disposal
of spent nuclear fuel. Total charges for nuclear fuel included in fuel expense amounted to $134
million in 2004, $138 million in 2003, and $134 million in 2002. Alabama Power and Georgia
Power have contracts with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) that provide for the permanent
disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin disposing of spent nuclear fuel in 1998
as required by the contracts, and Alabama Power and Georgia Power are pursuing legal remedies
against the government for breach of contract. Sufficient pool storage capacity for spent fuel
is available at Plant Farley to maintain full-core discharge capability until the refueling
outages scheduled for 2006 and 2008 for units 1 and 2, respectively. Construction of an on-site
dry storage facility at Plant Farley is in progress and scheduled for operation in 2005. The
onsite storage facility is expected to provide adequate spent fuel storage through 2015 for both
units. Also, the facility will be able to be expanded to provide storage through 2025.
Sufficient pool storage capacity for spent fuel is available at Plant Vogtle to maintain
full-core discharge capability for both units into 2015. Construction of an on-site dry storage
facility at Plant Vogtle is scheduled to begin in sufficient time to maintain pool full-core
discharge capability. At Plant Hatch, an on-site dry storage facility became operational in
2000 and can be expanded to accommodate spent fuel through the life of the plant.

Also, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 established a Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and
Decommissioning Fund, which is funded in part by a special assessment on utilities with nuclear
plants. This assessment is being paid over a 15-year period, which began in 1993. This fund
will be used by the DOE for the decontamination and decommissioning
of its nuclear fuel
enrichment facilities. The law provides that utilities will recover these payments in the same
manner as any other fuel expense. Alabama Power and Georgia Power — based on its ownership
interest — estimate their respective remaining liability at December 31, 2004 under this law to
be approximately $9 million and $7 million.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

The retail operating companies are subject to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation.
Regulatory assets represent probable future revenues associated with certain costs that are
expected to be recovered from customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities
represent probable future reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be
credited to customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory assets and (liabilities)
reflected in the balance sheets at December 31 relate to:

II-43


NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2004 Annual Report

In the event that a portion of a retail operating company’s operations is no longer
subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, such company would be required to write off
related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable through regulated
rates. In addition, the retail operating company would be required to determine if any impairment
to other assets, including plant, exists and write down the assets, if impaired, to their fair
value. All regulatory assets and liabilities are currently reflected in rates.

Income Taxes

Southern Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provides
deferred income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences. Investment tax
credits utilized are deferred and amortized to income over the average life of the related
property.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation of the original cost of plant in service is provided primarily by using composite
straight-line rates, which approximated 3.0 percent in 2004, 3.1 percent in 2003, and 3.2
percent in 2002. When property subject to composite depreciation is retired or otherwise
disposed of in the normal course of business, its original cost — together with the cost of
removal, less salvage — is charged to accumulated depreciation. For other property
dispositions, the applicable cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the balance sheet
accounts and a gain or loss is recognized. Minor items of property included in the original
cost of the plant are retired when the related property unit is retired.

Under its 2001 rate order, the Georgia PSC ordered Georgia Power to amortize $333 million —
the cumulative balance of accelerated depreciation and amortization previously expensed — equally
over three years as a credit to depreciation and amortization expense beginning January 2002.
Georgia Power was also ordered to recognize new certified purchased power costs in rates evenly
over the three-year period by the 2001 rate order. As a result of this regulatory adjustment,
Georgia Power recorded depreciation and amortization expense of $(77) million, $14 million, and $63
million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. See Note 3 under “Georgia Power Retail Rate
Activity” for additional information.

In May 2004, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power’s request to reclassify 266
megawatts of Plant Daniel units 3 and 4 capacity to jurisdictional cost of service effective
January 1, 2004 and authorized Mississippi Power to include the related costs and revenue
credits in jurisdictional rate base, cost of service, and revenue requirement calculations for
purposes of retail rate recovery. Mississippi Power is amortizing the regulatory liability
established pursuant to the Mississippi PSC’s interim December 2003 order, as approved in May
2004, to earnings as follows: $16.5 million in 2004, $25.1 million in 2005, $13.0 million in
2006, and $5.7 million in 2007, resulting in increases to earnings in each of those years.

Asset Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of Removal

Effective January 1, 2003, Southern Company adopted FASB Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations. Statement No. 143 established new accounting and reporting standards
for legal obligations associated with the ultimate costs of retiring long-lived assets. The
present value of the ultimate costs for an asset’s future retirement is recorded in the period
in which the liability is incurred. The costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived
asset and depreciated over the asset’s useful life. Although Statement No. 143 does not permit
the continued accrual of future retirement costs for long-lived assets that the Company does not
have a legal obligation to retire, the retail operating companies have received accounting
guidance from their respective state PSCs allowing such treatment. Accordingly, the accumulated
removal costs for other obligations previously accrued will continue to be reflected on the
balance sheets as a regulatory liability. Therefore, the retail operating companies had no
cumulative effect to net income resulting from the adoption of Statement No. 143.

The liability recognized to retire long-lived assets primarily relates to Southern
Company’s nuclear facilities, which include Alabama Power’s Plant Farley and Georgia Power’s
ownership interests in Plants Hatch and Vogtle. The fair value of assets legally restricted for
settling retirement obligations related to nuclear facilities as of December 31, 2004 was $905
million. In addition, the retail operating companies have retirement obligations related to

various landfill sites, ash ponds, and underground storage tanks. The retail operating
companies have also identified retirement obligations related to certain transmission and
distribution facilities. However, liabilities for the removal of these transmission and
distribution assets

II-44


NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2004 Annual Report

have not been recorded because no reasonable estimate can be made regarding the timing of the
obligations. The retail operating companies will continue to recognize in the statements of
income allowed removal costs in accordance with each company’s respective regulatory treatment.
Any difference between costs recognized under Statement No. 143 and those reflected in rates are
recognized as either a regulatory asset or liability and are reflected in the balance sheets.
See “Nuclear Decommissioning” herein for further information on amounts included in rates.

Nuclear Decommissioning

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requires licensees of commercial nuclear power reactors to
establish a plan for providing reasonable assurance of funds for future decommissioning. Alabama
Power and Georgia Power have external trust funds to comply with the NRC’s regulations. The funds
set aside for decommissioning are managed and invested in accordance with applicable requirements
of various regulatory bodies, including the NRC, the FERC, and state PSCs, as well as the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS). Funds are invested in a tax-efficient manner in a diversified mix of equity
and fixed income securities. Equity securities typically range from 50 to 75 percent of the funds
and fixed income securities from 25 to 50 percent. Amounts previously recorded in internal
reserves are being transferred into the external trust funds over periods approved by the
respective state PSCs. The NRC’s minimum external funding requirements are based on a generic
estimate of the cost to decommission only the radioactive portions of a nuclear unit based on the
size and type of reactor. Alabama Power and Georgia Power have filed plans with the NRC to ensure
that — over time — the deposits and earnings of the external trust funds will provide the minimum
funding amounts prescribed by the NRC.

Site study cost is the estimate to decommission a specific facility as of the site study
year. The estimated costs of decommissioning based on the most current studies as of December
31, 2004 for Alabama Power’s Plant Farley and Georgia Power’s ownership interests in plants
Hatch and Vogtle were as follows:

The decommissioning cost estimates are based on prompt dismantlement and removal of the
plant from service. The actual decommissioning costs may vary from the above estimates because
of changes in the assumed date of decommissioning, changes in NRC requirements, or changes in
the assumptions used in making these estimates.

Annual provisions for nuclear decommissioning are based on an annuity method as approved by
the respective state PSCs. The amount expensed in 2004 and fund balances were as follows:

Alabama Power’s decommissioning costs for ratemaking are based on the site study.
Effective January 1, 2005, the Georgia PSC has ordered the annual decommissioning costs for
ratemaking be decreased from $9 million to $7 million. This amount is based on the NRC generic
estimate to decommission the radioactive portion of the facilities as of 2003 — $421 million
and $326 million for plants Hatch and Vogtle, respectively. Significant assumptions used to
determine these costs for ratemaking were an inflation rate of 4.5 percent and 3.1 percent for
Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, and a trust earnings rate of 7.0 percent and 5.1
percent for Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively. Another significant assumption used
was the change in the operating license for

II-45

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2004 Annual Report

Plant Hatch. In January 2002, the NRC granted Georgia Power a 20-year extension of the licenses
for both units at Plant Hatch which permits the operation of units 1 and 2 until 2034 and 2038,
respectively. Alabama Power filed an application with the NRC in September 2003 to extend the
operating license for Plant Farley for an additional 20 years. The NRC is expected to rule on
the application by July 2005. Alabama Power and Georgia Power expect their respective state
PSCs to periodically review and adjust, if necessary, the amounts collected in rates for the
anticipated cost of decommissioning.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) and Interest Capitalized

In accordance with regulatory treatment, the retail operating companies record AFUDC. AFUDC
represents the estimated debt and equity costs of capital funds that are necessary to finance
the construction of new regulated facilities. While cash is not realized currently from such
allowance, it increases the revenue requirement over the service life of the plant through a
higher rate base and higher depreciation expense. Interest related to the construction of new
facilities not included in the retail operating companies’ regulated rates is capitalized in
accordance with standard interest capitalization requirements.

Cash payments for interest totaled $551 million, $603 million, and $560 million in 2004,
2003, and 2002, respectively, net of amounts capitalized of $36 million, $49 million, and $59
million, respectively.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost less regulatory disallowances and
impairments. Original cost includes: materials; labor; minor items of property; appropriate
administrative and general costs; payroll-related costs such as taxes, pensions, and other
benefits, and the interest capitalized and/or cost of funds used during construction.

The cost of replacements of property — exclusive of minor items of property — is
capitalized. The cost of maintenance, repairs, and replacement of minor items of property is
charged to maintenance expense as incurred or performed with the exception of nuclear refueling
costs, which are recorded in accordance with specific state PSC orders. Alabama Power accrues
estimated refueling costs in advance of the unit’s next refueling outage. Georgia Power defers
and amortizes refueling costs over the unit’s operating cycle before the next refueling. The
refueling cycles for Alabama Power and Georgia Power range from 18 to 24 months for each unit.
In accordance with retail accounting orders, both Georgia Power and Savannah Electric will defer
the costs of certain significant inspection costs for the combustion turbines at Plant McIntosh
and amortize such costs over 10 years, which approximates the expected maintenance cycle.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles

Southern Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The
determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on either a specific regulatory
disallowance or an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as
compared with the carrying value of the assets. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of
the impairment recognized is determined by either the amount of regulatory disallowance or by
estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater
than the fair value. For assets identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to
the estimated fair value less the cost to sell in order to determine if an impairment provision
is required. Until the assets are disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when
circumstances or events change. See Note 3 under “Plant McIntosh Construction Project” for
information on a regulatory disallowance by the Georgia PSC in December 2004.

Storm Damage Reserves

Each retail operating company maintains a reserve for property damage to cover the cost of
uninsured damages from major storms to transmission and distribution lines and to generation
facilities and other property. In accordance with their respective state PSC orders, the retail
operating companies accrue a total of $16 million annually. Alabama Power, Gulf Power, and
Mississippi Power also have discretionary authority from their state PSCs to accrue additional
amounts as circumstances warrant. In 2004, Alabama Power, Gulf Power, and Mississippi Power
accrued additional amounts of $6.9 million, $15 million, and $3.1 million, respectively. See
Note 3 under “Gulf Power and Alabama Power Storm Damage Recovery” for additional information
regarding the impact of Hurricane Ivan on these reserves.

Environmental Cost Recovery

Southern Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that cover the
handling and disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws
and regulations, the subsidiaries may also incur substantial costs to clean up properties.
Alabama Power, Gulf Power, and Mississippi Power have each received authority from their
respective state PSCs to recover approved environmental compliance costs through specific retail
rate clauses. Within limits approved by the state PSCs, these rates are adjusted annually.
Georgia Power and Savannah Electric continue to recover environmental costs through their base
rates.

Leveraged Leases

Southern Company has several leveraged lease agreements — ranging up to 45 years — that relate
to international and domestic energy generation, distribution, and transportation assets.
Southern Company receives federal income tax deductions for rent or depreciation and
amortization, as well as interest on long-term debt related to these investments.

Southern Company’s net investment in leveraged leases consists of the following at December

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are considered cash
equivalents. Temporary cash investments are securities with original maturities of 90 days or
less.

Materials and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include the average costs of transmission, distribution, and
generating plant materials. Materials are charged to inventory when purchased and then expensed
or capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when installed.

Stock Options

Southern Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plans in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized
because the exercise price of all options granted equaled the fair-market value on the date of
grant.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2004 Annual Report

Financial Instruments

Southern Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to fluctuations in
interest rates, the prices of certain fuel purchases, and electricity purchases and sales. All
derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured
at fair value. Substantially all of Southern Company’s bulk energy purchases and sales
contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are exempt from fair value accounting
requirements and are accounted for under the accrual method. Other derivative contracts qualify
as cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions. This results in the deferral of related gains
and losses in other comprehensive income or regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate
until the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness is recognized currently in net income.
Other derivative contracts are marked to market through current period income and are recorded
on a net basis in the statements of income.

Southern Company is exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of
counterparties’ nonperformance. The Company has established controls to determine and monitor
the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate the Company’s exposure to
counterparty credit risk.

The other Southern Company financial instruments for which the carrying amount does not
equal fair value at December 31 were as follows:

The fair values were based on either closing market price or closing price of comparable
instruments. See “Variable Interest Entities” herein and Note 6 under “Mandatorily Redeemable
Preferred Securities/Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts” for further information.

Comprehensive Income

The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of all changes in common stock
equity of an enterprise that result from transactions and other economic events of the period
other than transactions with owners. Comprehensive income consists of net income, changes in
the fair value of qualifying cash flow hedges and marketable securities, and changes in
additional minimum pension liability, less income taxes and reclassifications for amounts
included in net income.

Variable Interest Entities

On March 31, 2004, Southern Company prospectively adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46R,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” which requires the primary beneficiary of a
variable interest entity to consolidate the related assets and liabilities. The adoption of
Interpretation No. 46R had no impact on the net income of Southern Company. However, as a result
of the adoption, Southern Company deconsolidated certain wholly-owned trusts established to
issue preferred securities since Southern Company and the retail operating companies are not the
primary beneficiaries of the trusts. Therefore, the investments in these trusts are reflected as
Other Investments, and the related loans from the trusts are reflected as Long-term Debt Payable
to Affiliated Trusts on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2004. This treatment resulted in a
$60 million increase in both total assets and total liabilities as of March 31, 2004.

In addition, Southern Company consolidated its 85 percent limited partnership investment in
an energy/technology venture capital fund that was previously accounted for under the equity
method. During the third quarter of 2004, Southern Company terminated new investments in this
fund; however, additional contributions to existing investments will still occur. Southern
Company has committed to a maximum investment of $50 million. At December 31, 2004, Southern
Company’s investment totaled $22.0 million.

2. RETIREMENT BENEFITS

Southern Company has a defined benefit, trusteed, pension plan covering substantially all
employees. The plan is funded in accordance with Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended (ERISA), requirements. No contributions to the plan are expected for the year
ending December 31, 2005. Southern Company also provides certain non-qualified benefit plans
for a selected group of management and highly

II-48


NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2004 Annual Report

compensated employees. Benefits under these non-qualified plans are funded on a cash basis. In
addition, Southern Company provides certain medical care and life insurance benefits for retired
employees. The retail operating companies fund related trusts to the extent required by their
respective regulatory commissions. For the year ended December 31, 2005, postretirement trust
contributions are expected to total approximately $34.5 million.

The measurement date for plan assets and obligations is September 30 for each year.

Pension Plans

The accumulated benefit obligation for the pension plans was $4.6 billion in 2004 and $4.2
billion in 2003. Changes during the year in the projected benefit obligations, accumulated
benefit obligations, and fair value of plan assets were as follows:

Pension plan assets are managed and invested in accordance with all applicable requirements,
including ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Internal Revenue Code). The
Company’s investment policy covers a diversified mix of assets, including equity and fixed income
securities, real estate, and private equity, as described in the table below. Derivative
instruments are used primarily as hedging tools but may also be used to gain efficient exposure to
the various asset classes. The Company primarily minimizes the risk of large losses through
diversification but also monitors and manages other aspects of risk.

In the third quarter 2004, Southern Company prospectively adopted FASB Staff Position (FSP)
106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act). The Medicare Act provides a 28
percent prescription drug subsidy for Medicare eligible retirees. FSP 106-2 requires recognition
of the impacts of the Medicare Act in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO)
and future cost of service for postretirement medical plan. The effect of the subsidy reduced
Southern Company’s expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2004 by approximately $10.6
million and is expected to have a similar impact on future expenses. The subsidy’s impact on the
postretirement medical plan APBO was a reduction of approximately $182 million.

Future benefit payments, including prescription drug benefits, reflect expected future
service and are estimated based on assumptions used to measure the accumulated benefit
obligation for the postretirement plans. Estimated benefit payments are reduced by drug subsidy
receipts expected as a result of the Medicare Act as follows:

The Company determined the long-term rate of return based on historical asset class returns

An additional assumption used in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation was a weighted average medical care cost trend rate of 11 percent for 2004,
decreasing gradually to 5 percent through the year 2012, and remaining at that level thereafter.
An annual increase or decrease in the assumed medical care cost trend rate of 1 percent would

Employee Savings Plan

Southern Company also sponsors a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering substantially all
employees. The Company provides a 75 percent matching contribution up to 6 percent of an
employee’s base salary. Total matching contributions made to the plan for 2004, 2003, and 2002
were $56 million, $55 million, and $53 million, respectively.

3. CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY MATTERS

General Litigation Matters

Southern Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course
of business. In addition, Southern Company’s business activities are subject to extensive
governmental regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation over
environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury,
and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements, has increased generally throughout the
United States. In particular, personal injury claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to
hazardous materials have become more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such litigation against
Southern Company and its subsidiaries cannot be predicted at this time; however, management does
not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings would have a
material adverse effect on Southern Company’s financial statements.

Mirant Related Matters

Mirant Bankruptcy

In July 2003, Mirant Corporation (Mirant) filed for voluntary reorganization under Chapter 11 of
the Bankruptcy Code with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court (Bankruptcy Court). In January 2005, Mirant
filed its plan of reorganization (POR), which must be approved by the Bankruptcy Court. Southern
Company has certain contingent liabilities associated with guarantees of contractual commitments
made by Mirant’s subsidiaries discussed in Note 7 under “Guarantees” and with various lawsuits
related to Mirant discussed below. Southern Company has paid approximately $1.4 million in
connection with the guarantees. Also, Southern Company has joint and several liability with
Mirant regarding the joint consolidated federal income tax returns through 2001, as discussed in
Note 5. In December 2004, as a result of concluding an IRS audit for the tax years 2000 and
2001, Southern Company paid $39 million in additional tax and interest for issues related to
Mirant tax items. Based on management’s assessment of the collectibility of this receivable,
Southern Company reserved approximately $12.5 million.

Under the terms of the separation agreements, Mirant agreed to indemnify Southern Company
for

II-51


NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2004 Annual Report

costs associated with these guarantees, lawsuits, and additional IRS assessments. However, as a
result of Mirant’s bankruptcy, Southern Company must seek reimbursement as a creditor in
Mirant’s Chapter 11 proceeding. Southern Company has filed several claims against Mirant in
connection with Mirant’s indemnity obligations.

The POR provides for the settlement of court-approved claims by unsecured creditors with
common stock of a new corporation to which Mirant would transfer substantially all of its assets
and its restructured debt and interests in a trust to which Mirant would transfer certain
assets, including any claims that Mirant may have against Southern Company. Mirant’s disclosure
statement filed with the POR states that it is unlikely that there is sufficient value to
provide a full recovery to all creditors. A valuation hearing is scheduled before the
Bankruptcy Court for April 11, 2005. If Southern Company is ultimately required to make any
additional payments related to these obligations, Mirant’s indemnification obligation to
Southern Company for those additional payments may also represent an unsecured claim, subject to
compromise pursuant to the POR.

In April 2004, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge presiding over Mirant’s proceedings ordered
that an examiner be appointed and defined the duties of the examiner, including the
investigation of any potential causes of action against insiders, past or present, of Mirant or
any basis for objecting to or subordinating any claim that may be available to Mirant against
any past or present insider or any member of a committee appointed in Mirant’s bankruptcy
proceeding. As a former shareholder of Mirant, Southern Company could be considered a past
insider. In June 2004, Mirant’s bankruptcy counsel notified Southern Company that it is
investigating, on behalf of a committee of independent Mirant directors, potential claims
against Southern Company. Southern Company has produced documents in response to related
informal requests by Mirant’s bankruptcy counsel and is cooperating in the investigation. The
final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.

Mirant Securities Litigation

In November 2002, Southern Company, certain former and current senior officers of Southern
Company, and 12 underwriters of Mirant’s initial public offering were added as defendants in a
class action lawsuit that several Mirant shareholders originally filed against Mirant and
certain Mirant officers in May 2002. Several other similar lawsuits filed subsequently were
consolidated into this litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
Georgia. The amended complaint is based on allegations related to alleged improper energy
trading and marketing activities involving the California energy market, alleged false
statements and omissions in Mirant’s prospectus for its initial public offering and in
subsequent public statements by Mirant, and accounting-related issues previously disclosed by
Mirant. The lawsuit purports to include persons who acquired Mirant securities between
September 26, 2000 and September 5, 2002.

In July 2003, the court dismissed all claims based on Mirant’s alleged improper energy
trading and marketing activities involving the California energy market. The remaining claims
do not allege any improper trading and marketing activity, accounting errors, or material
misstatements or omissions on the part of Southern Company but seek to impose liability on
Southern Company based on allegations that Southern Company was a “control person” as to Mirant
prior to the spin off date. Southern Company filed an answer to the consolidated amended class
action complaint in September 2003. Plaintiffs have also filed a motion for class
certification.

As a result of Mirant’s Chapter 11 proceeding, the Bankruptcy Code automatically stayed all
litigation as to Mirant. In November 2003, the Bankruptcy Court granted a request to extend
this automatic stay to all other non-debtor defendants, including Southern Company and its
current and/or former officers named as defendants in the Mirant securities litigation.
However, the Bankruptcy Court authorized Mirant to agree with parties in pending actions to
allow discovery or other matters to proceed without violating the stay. Mirant and plaintiffs’
counsel in the Mirant securities litigation agreed that document discovery could proceed. In
October 2003, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order authorizing Southern Company’s insurance
companies to pay related defense costs.

Under certain circumstances, Southern Company will be obligated under its Bylaws to
indemnify the four current and/or former Southern Company officers who served as directors of
Mirant at the time of its initial public offering through the date of the spin off and who are
also named as defendants in this lawsuit. The final outcome of these matters cannot now be
determined.

NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2004 Annual Report

Southern Company Employee Savings Plan Litigation

On June 30, 2004, an employee of a subsidiary of Southern Company filed a complaint in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia alleging violations of ERISA, on behalf of a
purported class of individuals who were participants in or beneficiaries of The Southern Company
Employee Savings Plan (Plan) at any time since April 2, 2001 and whose Plan accounts included
investments in Mirant common stock. The complaint, which was amended on December 6, 2004, named
as defendants Southern Company, SCS, the Employee Savings Plan Committee, the Pension Fund
Investment Review Committee, individual members of such committees, and the SCS Board of
Directors during the class period.

In the amended complaint, the plaintiff alleges that the various defendants had certain
fiduciary duties under ERISA regarding the Mirant shares distributed to Southern Company
shareholders in the spin off and held in the Mirant stock fund in the Plan. The plaintiff
alleges that the various defendants breached their respective fiduciary duties by, among other
things, failing to adequately determine whether Mirant stock was an appropriate investment
option to hold in the Plan and by failing to adequately inform Plan participants that Mirant
stock was not an appropriate investment for their retirement assets based on Mirant’s alleged
improper energy trading and accounting practices, mismanagement, and dire business conditions.
The amended complaint also alleges that certain defendants failed to monitor Plan fiduciaries
and that certain defendants had conflicting interests regarding Mirant, which prevented them
from acting solely in the interests of Plan participants and beneficiaries. The plaintiff seeks
class-wide equitable relief and an unspecified amount of money damages.

On February 7, 2005, the Southern Company defendants filed a motion to dismiss all of the
claims asserted in the amended complaint. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot now be
determined.

Environmental Matters

New Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil action in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against Alabama Power and Georgia Power,
alleging violations of the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act and related
state laws at five coal-fired generating facilities. The EPA concurrently issued to each of the
retail operating companies notices of violation relating to 10 generating facilities, including
the five facilities mentioned previously. In early 2000, the EPA filed a motion to amend its
complaint to add the violations alleged in its notices of violation and to add Gulf Power,
Mississippi Power, and Savannah Electric as defendants.

The
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia subsequently granted Alabama Power’s motion to dismiss
and denied the EPA’s motion to add Gulf Power and Mississippi Power for lack of jurisdiction in
Georgia. In March 2001, the court granted the EPA’s motion to add Savannah Electric as a
defendant and to add allegations regarding two additional generating facilities owned by Alabama
Power. As directed by the court, the EPA refiled its amended complaint limiting claims to those
brought against Georgia Power and Savannah Electric. In addition, the EPA refiled its claims
against Alabama Power in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. These
civil complaints allege violations with respect to eight coal-fired generating facilities in
Alabama and Georgia, and they request penalties and injunctive relief, including an order
requiring the installation of the best available control technology at the affected units. The
EPA has not refiled against Gulf Power or Mississippi Power.

The actions against Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Savannah Electric were effectively
stayed in the spring of 2001 during the appeal of a similar NSR enforcement action against the
Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. In
June 2003, the Court of Appeals issued its ruling in the TVA case, dismissing the appeal for
reasons unrelated to the issues in the cases pending against Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and
Savannah Electric. In May 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the EPA’s petition for review of
the case. In June 2004, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama lifted the
stay in the action against Alabama Power, placing the case back onto the court’s active docket.
At this time, no party to the case against Georgia Power and Savannah Electric has sought to
reopen that case, which remains administratively closed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Georgia.

Since the inception of the NSR proceedings against Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and

II-53

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2004 Annual Report

Savannah Electric, the EPA has also been proceeding with similar NSR enforcement actions against
other utilities, involving many of the same legal issues. In each case, the EPA alleged that
the utilities failed to comply with the NSR permitting requirements when performing maintenance
and construction activities at coal-burning plants, which activities the utilities considered to
be routine or otherwise not subject to NSR. District courts addressing these cases have, to
date, issued opinions that reached conflicting conclusions.

Southern Company believes that the retail operating companies complied with applicable laws
and the EPA regulations and interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place.
The Clean Air Act authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $32,500 per day, per violation
at each generating unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in any
one of these cases could require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this
time and could possibly require payment of substantial penalties. This could affect future results
of operations, cash flows, and possibly financial condition if such costs are not recovered through
regulated rates.

In December 2002 and October 2003, the EPA issued final revisions to its NSR regulations under
the Clean Air Act. The December 2002 revisions included changes to the regulatory exclusions and
the methods of calculating emissions increases. The October 2003 regulations clarified the scope
of the existing Routine Maintenance, Repair, and Replacement (RMRR) exclusion. A coalition of
states and environmental organizations has filed petitions for review of these revisions with the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The October 2003 RMRR rules have been
stayed by the Court of Appeals pending its review of the rules. In any event, the final
regulations must be adopted by the individual states to apply to facilities in the Southern Company
system. The effect of these final regulations, related legal challenges, and potential state
rulemakings cannot be determined at this time.

Plant Wansley Environmental Litigation

On December 30, 2002, the Sierra Club, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Georgia
Forestwatch, and one individual filed a civil suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Georgia against Georgia Power for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act at four of
the generating units at Plant Wansley. The complaint alleges Clean Air Act violations at both
the existing coal-fired units and the new combined cycle units. Specifically, the plaintiffs
allege (1) opacity violations at the coal-fired units, (2) violations of a permit provision that
requires the combined cycle units to operate above certain levels, (3) violation of nitrogen
oxide emission offset requirements, and (4) violation of hazardous air pollutant requirements.
The civil action requests injunctive and declaratory relief, civil penalties, a supplemental
environmental project, and attorneys’ fees. The Clean Air Act authorizes civil penalties of up
to $27,500 per day, per violation at each generating unit.

The court has concluded the liability phase of the action. The court ruled in favor of
Georgia Power on the allegations regarding the hazardous air pollutants, the allegations regarding
emission offsets, and a majority of the allegations regarding the permit provision that requires
the combined cycle units to operate above certain levels. The court ruled in favor of the
plaintiffs on a majority of the opacity incidents. Georgia Power has filed a petition for review of
the decision with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The district court case has
been administratively closed pending that appeal. If necessary, the district court will hold a
separate remedy trial which will address civil penalties and possible injunctive relief requested
by the plaintiffs. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot currently be determined; however, an
adverse outcome could require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this
time and could possibly require the payment of substantial penalties. This could affect future
results of operations, cash flows, and possibly financial condition if such costs are not recovered
through regulated rates.

Environmental Remediation

Georgia Power has been designated as a potentially responsible party at sites governed by the
Georgia Hazardous Site Response Act and/or by the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act. In 1995, the EPA designated Georgia Power and four other
unrelated entities as potentially responsible parties at a site in Brunswick, Georgia, that is
listed on the federal National Priorities List. As of December 31, 2004, Georgia Power had
recorded approximately $6 million in cumulative expenses associated with its agreed-upon share
of the removal and remedial investigation and feasibility study costs for the Brunswick site.
Additional claims for recovery of

II-54


NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2004 Annual Report

natural resource damages at the site are anticipated. Georgia Power has also recognized $35
million in cumulative expenses through December 31, 2004 for the assessment and anticipated
cleanup of other sites on the Georgia Hazardous Sites Inventory.

Under Georgia PSC ratemaking provisions, $22 million has been deferred in a regulatory
liability account for use in meeting future environmental remediation costs at Georgia Power.
Under the December 2004 three-year retail rate plan ending December 31, 2007 (2004 Retail Rate
Plan), this regulatory liability will be amortized over a three-year period beginning January 1,
2005. However, the order also approved an annual environmental accrual of $5.4 million.
Environmental remediation expenditures will be charged against the reserve as they are incurred.
The annual accrual amount will be reviewed and adjusted in future regulatory proceedings.

In September 2004, Gulf Power increased its liability and related regulatory asset for the
estimated costs of environmental remediation projects by approximately $47 million to $59.8
million. This increase relates to new regulations and more stringent site closure criteria by
the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) for impacts to soil and groundwater
from herbicide applications at Gulf Power substations. The schedule for completion of these
remediation projects will be subject to FDEP approval.

The final outcome of the Georgia Power and Gulf Power matters cannot now be determined.
However, based on the currently known conditions at these sites and the nature and extent of
activities relating to these sites, management does not believe that additional liabilities, if
any, at these sites would be material to the financial statements.

Generation Interconnection Agreements

In July 2003, the FERC issued its final rule on the standardization of generation
interconnection agreements and procedures (Order 2003). Order 2003 shifts much of the financial
burden of new transmission investment from the generator to the transmission provider. The FERC
has indicated that Order 2003, which was effective January 20, 2004, is to be applied
prospectively to interconnection agreements. Subsidiaries of Tenaska, Inc., as counterparties
to three previously executed interconnection agreements with subsidiaries of Southern Company,
have filed complaints at the FERC requesting that the FERC modify the agreements and that
Southern Company refund a total of $19 million previously paid for interconnection facilities,
with interest. Southern Company has also received similar requests from other entities totaling
$9 million. Southern Company has opposed such relief, and the proceedings are still pending.
The impact of Order 2003 and its subsequent rehearings on Southern Company and the final results
of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Market-Based Rate Authority

Each of the retail operating companies and Southern Power has authorization from the FERC to
sell power to nonaffiliates at market-based prices. The retail operating companies and Southern
Power also have FERC authority to make short-term opportunity sales at market rates. Specific
FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a market-based contract with an affiliate. In
November 2001, the FERC modified the test it uses to consider utilities’ applications to charge
market-based rates and adopted a new test called the Supply Margin Assessment (SMA). The FERC
applied the SMA to several utilities, including Southern Company, the retail operating
companies, and Southern Power, and found Southern Company and others to be “pivotal suppliers”
in their retail service territories and ordered the implementation of several mitigation
measures. Southern Company and others sought rehearing of the FERC order, and the FERC delayed
the implementation of certain mitigation measures.

In April 2004, the FERC issued an order that abandoned the SMA test and adopted a new
interim analysis for measuring generation market power. This new interim approach requires
utilities to submit a pivotal supplier screen and a wholesale market share screen. If the
applicant does not pass both screens, there will be a rebuttable presumption regarding
generation market power. The FERC’s order also sets forth procedures for rebutting these
presumptions and addresses mitigation measures for those entities that are found to have market
power. In the absence of specific mitigation measures, the order includes several cost-based
mitigation measures that would apply by default. The FERC also initiated a new rulemaking
proceeding that, among other things, will adopt a final methodology for assessing generation
market power.

In July 2004, the FERC denied Southern Company’s request for rehearing, along with a

II-55


NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2004 Annual Report

number of others, and
reaffirmed the interim tests that it adopted in April 2004. In August 2004,
Southern Company submitted a filing to the FERC that included results showing that Southern
Company passed the pivotal supplier screen for all markets and the wholesale market share screen
for all markets except the Southern Company retail service territory. Southern Company also
submitted other analyses to demonstrate that it lacks generation market power. On December 17,
2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation dominance within
its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other markets is not
at issue. As directed by this order, Southern Company submitted additional information on
February 15, 2005 related to generation dominance in its retail service territory. Any new
market-based rate transactions in its retail service territory entered into after February 27,
2005 will be subject to refund to the level of the default cost-based rates, pending the outcome
of the proceeding. Southern Company, along with other utilities, has also filed an appeal of the
FERC’s April and July 2004 orders with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit. The FERC has asked the court to dismiss the appeal on the grounds that it is
premature.

In the event that the FERC’s default mitigation measures are ultimately applied, Southern
Power and the retail operating companies may be required to charge cost-based rates for certain
wholesale sales in the retail service territory, which may be lower than negotiated market-based
rates. The final outcome of this matter will depend on the form in which the final methodology
for assessing generation market power and mitigation rules may be ultimately adopted and cannot
be determined at this time.

Race Discrimination Litigation

In July 2000, a lawsuit alleging race discrimination was filed by three Georgia Power employees
against Georgia Power, Southern Company, and SCS in the Superior Court of Fulton County,
Georgia. Shortly thereafter, the lawsuit was removed to the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Georgia. The lawsuit also raised claims on behalf of a purported class.
The plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages in an unspecified amount, as well as
injunctive relief. In August 2000, the lawsuit was amended to add four more plaintiffs. Also,
an additional indirect subsidiary of Southern Company, Southern Company Energy Solutions, was
named a defendant.

In October 2001, the district court denied the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit subsequently denied plaintiffs’ petition
seeking permission to file an appeal of the October 2001 decision. In March 2003, the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia granted summary judgment in favor of the
defendants on all claims raised by all seven plaintiffs. In April 2003, plaintiffs filed an
appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit challenging these adverse summary
judgment rulings, as well as the District Court’s October 2001 ruling denying class
certification. On November 10, 2004, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Eleventh Circuit issued an order affirming in all respects the district court’s rulings. On
December 1, 2004, the plaintiffs filed a petition for rehearing seeking a review of the November
2004 order by the entire Eleventh Circuit panel of judges. If this petition is denied, the
plaintiffs will have 90 days from the date of the court’s order denying the petition to file a
petition for writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court. The final outcome of this matter
cannot now be determined.

Right of Way Litigation

Southern Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including Georgia Power, Gulf Power,
Mississippi Power, and Southern Telecom, have been named as defendants in numerous lawsuits
brought by landowners since 2001. The plaintiffs’ lawsuits claim that defendants may not use,
or sublease to third parties, some or all of the fiber optic communications lines on the rights
of way that cross the plaintiffs’ properties and that such actions exceed the easements or other
property rights held by defendants. The plaintiffs assert claims for, among other things,
trespass and unjust enrichment and seek compensatory and punitive
damages and injunctive relief. Management of Southern Company and its
subsidiaries believe that they have complied with applicable laws and that the plaintiffs’
claims are without merit. An adverse outcome in these matters could result in substantial
judgments; however, the final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.

In November 2003, the Second Circuit Court in Gadsden County, Florida, ruled in favor of
the plaintiffs on their motion for partial summary judgment concerning liability in one such
lawsuit brought by landowners regarding the installation and use of fiber optic cable over Gulf
Power rights of way located on the landowners’ property. Subsequently, the plaintiffs sought to
amend their complaint and asked the court to enter a final declaratory judgment and to enter an
order enjoining Gulf Power from allowing expanded general telecommunications use of the fiber
optic cables that

II-56


NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2004 Annual Report

are the subject of this litigation. On January 6, 2005, the trial judge entered an
order granting in part the plaintiffs’ motion to amend their complaint and denying the requested
declaratory and injunctive relief at this time. On January 14, 2005, the Superior Court of
Decatur County, Georgia, granted partial summary judgment in another such lawsuit brought by
landowners against Georgia Power on the plaintiffs’ declaratory judgment claim that the
easements do not permit general telecommunications use. Georgia Power is appealing this ruling
to the Georgia Court of Appeals. The court also dismissed Southern Telecom from this case. The
question of damages and other liability or remedies issues with respect to these actions, if
any, will be decided at future trials. In the event of an adverse verdict in either case, Gulf
Power or Georgia Power, as applicable, could appeal the issues of both liability and damages or
other relief granted. With respect to approximately one-third of the plaintiffs in the actions
pending against Mississippi Power, Mississippi Power has entered into an agreement with
plaintiffs’ counsel clarifying Mississippi Power’s easement rights. This agreement has been
approved by the Circuit Court of Harrison County, Mississippi (First Judicial District) and
dismissals of the related cases are in progress.

In addition, in late 2001, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company, including Alabama
Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, Savannah Electric, and Southern Telecom,
were named as defendants in a lawsuit brought by a telecommunications company that uses certain
of the defendants’ rights of way. This lawsuit alleges, among other things, that the defendants
are contractually obligated to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the telecommunications
company from any liability that may be assessed against it in pending and future right of way
litigation. The Company believes that the plaintiff’s claims are without merit. In the fall of
2004, the trial court stayed the case until resolution of the underlying landowner litigation
discussed above. On January 12, 2005, the Georgia Court of Appeals dismissed the
telecommunications company’s appeal of the trial court’s order for lack of jurisdiction. An
adverse outcome in this matter, combined with an adverse outcome against the telecommunications
company in one or more of the right of way lawsuits, could result in substantial judgments;
however, the final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.

Income Tax Matters

Synthetic Fuel Tax Credits

Southern Company has investments in two entities that produce synthetic fuel and receive tax
credits under Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code — a 30 percent ownership interest in
Alabama Fuel Products (AFP) and a 24.975 percent limited partnership interest in Carbontronics
Synfuels Investors, L.P. (Carbontronics). At December 31, 2004, Southern Company’s total
investment in these entities was approximately $29 million.

In June 2003, the IRS completed a review of the scientific validity of test procedures and
results that have been presented as evidence that a significant chemical change occurred in such
synthetic fuel and announced that it has determined that the test procedures and results used by
taxpayers are scientifically valid if the procedures are applied in a consistent and unbiased
manner. The IRS stated that the processes they approved do not produce the level of chemical
change required by Section 29, but they will, nevertheless, resume issuing private letter
rulings. The IRS required taxpayers applying for future rulings, as well as those already
holding rulings, to implement and maintain certain sampling and quality control procedures, as
well as additional documentation and record retention procedures. Both AFP and Carbontronics
have private letter rulings from the IRS that concluded significant chemical change occurred
based on the procedures and results submitted. In addition, both entities regularly use
independent laboratories and experts to test for chemical change. These tests replicated
significant chemical changes consistent with the procedures submitted with the private letter
rulings.

In October 2003, the Senate Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations
announced that it has begun a separate investigation of the synthetic fuel industry and its
producers for potential abuses of these tax credits. There has been no significant activity
related to this investigation to date.

In January 2004, the IRS completed an audit of AFP for tax years 1999 and 2000. In
December 2004, the IRS notified Carbontronics that its audit for 2000 and 2001 had been
completed. In addition,

II-57


NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2004 Annual Report

in December 2004, the IRS also concluded its audit of Southern Company’s consolidated income
tax returns for 2000 and 2001. The IRS raised no issues related to synthetic fuel tax credits
upon conclusion of any of these audits. As a result, in December 2004, Southern Company reversed
its related reserve of $37 million.

Leveraged Lease Transactions

Southern Company undergoes audits by the IRS for each of its tax years. The IRS has completed
its audits of Southern Company’s consolidated federal income tax returns for all years through
2001. As part of the audit for the 1996-1999 tax years, the IRS proposed to disallow the tax
losses associated with Southern Company’s lease-in-lease-out (LILO) transaction, resulting in an
additional tax payment of approximately $30 million, including approximately $6.5 million of
interest. To stop interest accretion, Southern Company deposited this payment with the IRS in
May 2003 and filed a refund claim. In January 2004, the IRS proposed to disallow the refund
claim. In connection with its audit of 2000 and 2001, the IRS proposed a similar assessment of
approximately $18 million, including approximately $3 million of interest. In October 2004,
Southern Company submitted the issue to the IRS appeals division and in February 2005 reached a
negotiated settlement with the IRS. The settlement had no material impact on Southern Company’s
financial statements.

In connection with its audit of 2000 and 2001, the IRS has also challenged Southern
Company’s deductions related to three other international lease transactions (so-called SILO or
sale-in-lease-out transactions). Southern Company believes that these transactions are valid
leases for U.S. tax purposes and is pursuing resolution with the IRS. If the IRS is ultimately
successful in disallowing the tax deductions related to these three transactions, beginning with
the 2000 tax year, Southern Company could be subject to additional interest charges of up to $20
million. Additionally, although the payment of the tax liability, exclusive of this interest,
would not affect Southern Company’s results of operations under current accounting standards, it
could have a material impact on cash flow. See Note 1 under “Leveraged Leases” for additional
information on deferred taxes arising from these transactions. Furthermore, the FASB is
currently considering changes to the accounting for income tax settlements related to leveraged
leases, which may result in a net income impact from such settlements. The final outcome of
these matters cannot now be determined.

Alabama Power Retail Regulatory Matters

Alabama Power operates under a Rate Stabilization and Equalization plan (Rate RSE) originally
adopted by the Alabama PSC in November 1982. Rate RSE provides for periodic annual adjustments
based upon Alabama Power’s earned return on end-of-period retail common equity. Such annual
adjustments are limited to 3 percent. Within a range of return on common equity of 13 percent to
14.5 percent, rates remain unchanged. The Alabama PSC has also approved a rate mechanism that
provides for adjustments to recognize the placing of new generating facilities in retail service
and for the recovery of retail costs associated with certificated purchased power agreements
(Rate CNP). Both increases and decreases have been placed into effect since the adoption of
these rates.

In accordance with Rate RSE, a 2 percent increase in retail rates was effective in April
2002, amounting to an annual increase of $55 million. Also, to recover certificated purchased
power costs under Rate CNP, an increase of 2.6 percent in retail rates, or $79 million annually,
was effective July 2003. An additional increase of $25 million annually was effective in June
2004 under Rate CNP for new certificated purchased power costs. In April 2005, an annual
true-up adjustment to Rate CNP is expected to decrease retail rates by approximately 0.5 percent
or $18.5 million annually.

In October 2004, the Alabama PSC approved a request by Alabama Power to amend Rate CNP to
also provide for the recovery of retail costs associated with environmental laws and
regulations, effective in January 2005. In conjunction with the Alabama PSC’s approval, Alabama
Power agreed to a moratorium until March 2007 on any retail rate increase under the Rate RSE.
Any increase in March 2007 would be based upon the earned return on retail common equity at
December 31, 2006. The ratemaking procedures will remain in effect until the Alabama PSC votes
to modify or discontinue them.

Alabama Power fuel costs are recovered under Rate ECR (Energy Cost Recovery), which
provides for the addition of a fuel and energy cost factor to base rates. In April 2005, this
factor is scheduled to increase from its current level.

II-58


NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2004 Annual Report

Georgia Power Retail Rate Activity

On December 21, 2004, the Georgia PSC voted to approve the 2004 Retail Rate Plan for Georgia
Power. Under the terms of the 2004 Retail Rate Plan, earnings will be evaluated against a
retail return on common equity range of 10.25 percent to 12.25 percent. Two-thirds of any
earnings above 12.25 percent will be applied to rate refunds, with the remaining one-third
retained by Georgia Power. Retail rates and customer fees will be increased by approximately
$203 million effective January 1, 2005 to cover the higher costs of purchased power, operating
and maintenance expenses, environmental compliance, and continued investment in new generation,
transmission, and distribution facilities to support growth and ensure reliability.

Georgia Power will not file for a general base rate increase unless its projected retail
return on common equity falls below 10.25 percent. Georgia Power is required to file a general
rate case by July 1, 2007, in response to which the Georgia PSC would be expected to determine
whether the rate order should be continued, modified, or discontinued.

In December 2001, the Georgia PSC approved a three-year retail rate plan (2001 Retail Rate
Plan) for Georgia Power ending December 31, 2004. Under the terms of the 2001 Retail Rate Plan,
earnings were evaluated against a retail return on common equity range of 10 percent to 12.95
percent. Georgia Power’s earnings in all three years were within the common equity range.
Under the 2001 Retail Rate Plan, Georgia Power amortized a regulatory liability of $333 million,
related to previously recorded accelerated amortization expenses, equally over three years
beginning in 2002. Also, the 2001 Retail Rate Plan required Georgia Power to recognize capacity
and operating and maintenance costs related to certified purchase power contracts evenly into
rates over a three-year period ending December 31, 2004.

On February 18, 2005, Georgia Power filed a request with the Georgia PSC for a fuel cost
recovery rate increase. The requested increase, representing an average annual increase in
revenues of approximately 11.7 percent, will allow for the recovery of fuel costs based on an
estimate of future fuel costs, as well as the collection of the existing under recovery of fuel
costs. Georgia Power’s under recovered fuel costs as of January 31, 2005 totaled $390 million.
The Georgia PSC will examine Georgia Power’s fuel expenditures and determine whether the
proposed fuel cost recovery rate is just and reasonable before issuing its decision in May 2005.
The final outcome of the filing cannot be determined at this time.

Gulf Power and Alabama Power Storm Damage Recovery

In September 2004, Hurricane Ivan hit the Gulf Coast of Florida and Alabama and continued north
through Southern Company’s service territory causing substantial damage. At Gulf Power, the
related costs charged to its property damage reserve were $141.5 million, resulting in a
negative reserve balance of $96.5 million at December 31, 2004. At Alabama Power, the related
costs charged to its natural disaster reserve were $57.8 million, resulting in a negative
reserve balance of $37.7 million at December 31, 2004, which is reflected in the balance sheet
as a regulatory asset pursuant to Alabama PSC order. See Note 1 under “Storm Damage Reserves”
for additional information on these reserves.

In
February 2005, the Citizens of the State of Florida through the Office of Public Counsel for the State of Florida,
the Florida Industrial Power Users Group, and Gulf Power filed a Stipulation and Settlement with the Florida PSC
that, if approved, would allow Gulf Power to recover the retail portion of $51.7 million of
these costs, plus interest and revenue taxes, from customers over a 24-month period. In
connection with the stipulation, Gulf Power has agreed that it will not seek any additional
increase in its base rates and charges to become effective on or before March 1, 2007.

Also in February 2005, Alabama Power requested and received Alabama PSC approval of an
accounting order that allows Alabama Power to immediately return certain regulatory liabilities to
its retail customers. The order also allows Alabama Power to simultaneously recover from its
customers an accrual of approximately $45 million to offset the costs of Hurricane Ivan and restore
the natural disaster reserve. The combined effects of this order will have no impact on Alabama
Power’s net income in 2005.

Plant McIntosh Construction Project

In December 2002, after a competitive bidding process, the Georgia PSC certified purchased power
agreements (PPAs) between Southern Power and Georgia Power and Savannah Electric for capacity
from Plant McIntosh units 10 and 11, construction of which is scheduled to be completed in June
2005. In

II-59


NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2004 Annual Report

April 2003, Southern Power applied for FERC approval of these PPAs. In July 2003, the FERC
accepted the PPAs to become effective June 1, 2005, subject to refund, and ordered that hearings
be held. Intervenors opposed the FERC’s acceptance of the PPAs, alleging that they did not meet
the applicable standards for market-based rates between affiliates. To ensure the timely
completion of the Plant McIntosh construction project and the availability of the units in the
summer of 2005 for their retail customers, Savannah Electric and Georgia Power in May 2004
requested the Georgia PSC to direct them to acquire the Plant McIntosh construction project.
The Georgia PSC issued such an order, and the transfer occurred on May 24, 2004 at a total cost
of approximately $415 million, including $14 million of transmission interconnection facilities.
Subsequently, Southern Power filed a request to withdraw the PPAs and to terminate the ongoing
FERC proceedings. In August 2004, the FERC issued a notice accepting the request to withdraw the
PPAs and permitting such request to become effective by operation of law. However, the FERC made
no determination on what additional steps may need to be taken with respect to testimony
provided in the proceedings. The ultimate outcome of any additional FERC action cannot now be
determined.

As directed by the Georgia PSC order, Georgia Power and Savannah Electric in June 2004
filed an application to amend the resource certificate granted by the Georgia PSC in 2002. In
connection with the 2004 Retail Rate Plan, the Georgia PSC approved the transfer of the Plant
McIntosh construction project at a total fair market value of approximately $385 million. This
value reflects an approximate $16 million disallowance and reduced Southern Company’s net income
by approximately $9.5 million. The Georgia PSC also certified a total completion cost of $547
million for the project. The amount of the disallowance will be adjusted accordingly based on
the actual completion cost of the project. Under the 2004 Retail Rate Plan, the Plant McIntosh
impact will be reflected in Georgia Power’s rates evenly over the three years ending 2007. See
“Georgia Power Retail Rate Activity” above for additional information on the 2004 Retail Rate
Plan.

Plant Franklin Construction Project

Southern Power completed limited construction activities on Plant Franklin Unit 3 to preserve the
long-term viability of the project but has deferred final completion until the 2008-2011 period.
The length of the deferral period will depend on forecasted capacity needs and other wholesale
market opportunities. As of December 31, 2004, Southern Power’s investment in Unit 3 of Plant
Franklin was $172 million. The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

4. JOINT OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS

Alabama Power owns an undivided interest in units 1 and 2 of Plant Miller and related facilities
jointly with Alabama Electric Cooperative, Inc.

Georgia Power owns undivided interests in Plants Vogtle, Hatch, Scherer, and Wansley in
varying amounts jointly with Oglethorpe Power Corporation (OPC), the Municipal Electric
Authority of Georgia, the city of Dalton, Georgia, Florida Power & Light Company, and
Jacksonville Electric Authority. In addition, Georgia Power has joint ownership agreements with
OPC for the Rocky Mountain facilities and with Florida Power Corporation for a combustion
turbine unit at Intercession City, Florida.

Southern Power owns an undivided interest in Stanton Unit A and related facilities jointly
with the Orlando Utilities Commission, Kissimmee Utility Authority, and Florida Municipal Power
Agency.

At December 31, 2004, Alabama Power’s, Georgia Power’s, and Southern Power’s ownership and
investment (exclusive of nuclear fuel) in jointly owned facilities with the above entities were

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2004 Annual Report

Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Southern Power have contracted to operate and maintain
the jointly owned facilities — except for Rocky Mountain and Intercession City — as agents for
their respective co-owners. The companies’ proportionate share of their plant operating
expenses is included in the corresponding operating expenses in the statements of income.

5. INCOME TAXES

Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and a combined State of Georgia
income tax return. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement, as required by
the PUHCA, each subsidiary’s current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone
basis. In accordance with IRS regulations, each company is jointly and severally liable for the
tax liability.

Mirant was included in the consolidated federal tax return through April 2, 2001. In
December 2004, the IRS concluded its audit for the tax years 2000 and 2001, and Southern
Company paid $39 million in additional tax and interest for issues related to Mirant tax items.
Under the terms of the separation agreements, Mirant agreed to indemnify Southern Company for
subsequent assessment of any additional taxes related to its transactions prior to the spin off.
However, as a result of Mirant’s bankruptcy, Southern Company must seek reimbursement as an
unsecured creditor. For additional information, see Note 3 under “Mirant Related Matters —
Mirant Bankruptcy.”

At December 31, 2004, the tax-related regulatory assets and liabilities were $865 million
and $374 million, respectively. These assets are attributable to tax benefits flowed through to
customers in prior years and to taxes applicable to capitalized interest. These liabilities are
attributable to deferred taxes previously recognized at rates higher than the current enacted
tax law and to unamortized investment tax credits.

At December 31, 2004, Southern Company also had available State of Georgia net operating
loss carryforward deductions totaling $1.0 billion, which could result in net state income tax
benefits of $59 million, if utilized. These deductions will expire between 2010 and 2021.
During 2004, Southern Company realized $10 million in such state income tax benefits. Beginning
in 2002, the State of Georgia allowed the filing of a combined return, which should
substantially reduce any additional net operating loss carryforwards.

In accordance with regulatory requirements, deferred investment tax credits are amortized
over the lives of the related property with such amortization normally applied as a credit to
reduce depreciation in the statements of income. Credits amortized in this manner amounted to
$27 million in 2004, $29 million in 2003, and $27 million in 2002. At December 31, 2004, all
investment tax credits

6. FINANCING

Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities/Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts

Southern Company and the retail operating companies have each formed certain wholly owned trust
subsidiaries for the purpose of issuing preferred securities. The proceeds of the related
equity investments and preferred security sales were loaned back to Southern Company and the
retail operating companies through the issuance of junior subordinated notes totaling $2.0
billion, which constitute substantially all assets of these trusts and are reflected on the
balance sheets as Long-term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts. Southern Company and the retail
operating companies each consider that the mechanisms and obligations relating to the preferred
securities issued for its benefit, taken together, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee
by it of the respective trusts’ payment obligations with respect to these securities. At
December 31, 2004, preferred securities of $1.9 billion were outstanding. Southern Company
guarantees the notes related to $574 million of these securities issued on its behalf. See Note
1 under “Variable Interest Entities” for additional information on the accounting treatment for
these trusts and the related securities.

in 2008, and $624 million in 2009.

Assets Subject to Lien

Each of Southern Company’s subsidiaries is organized as a legal entity, separate and apart from
Southern Company and its other subsidiaries. The retail operating companies’ mortgages, which
secure the first mortgage bonds issued by the retail operating companies, constitute a direct
first lien on substantially all of the retail operating companies’ respective fixed property and
franchises. Georgia Power discharged its mortgage in 2002, and the lien was removed. There are
no agreements or other arrangements among the subsidiary companies under which the assets of one
company have been pledged or otherwise made available to satisfy obligations of Southern Company
or any of its other subsidiaries.

Bank Credit Arrangements

At the beginning of 2005, unused credit arrangements with banks totaled $3.2 billion, of which
$1.8 billion expires during 2005 and $1.4 billion expires
during 2006 and beyond. The following table outlines the credit arrangements by company:

NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2004 Annual Report

Approximately $1.2 billion of the credit facilities expiring in 2005 allow the execution of
term loans for an additional two-year period, and $275 million allow execution of one-year term
loans. Most of these agreements include stated borrowing rates but also allow for competitive
bid loans.

All of the credit arrangements require payment of commitment fees based on the unused
portion of the commitments or the maintenance of compensating balances with the banks.
Commitment fees are less than one-eighth of 1 percent for Southern Company and the retail
operating companies and less than three-eighths of 1 percent for Southern Power. Compensating
balances are not legally restricted from withdrawal. Included in the total $3.2 billion of
unused credit arrangements is $2.5 billion of syndicated credit arrangements that require the
payment of agent fees.

Most of the credit arrangements with banks have covenants that limit debt levels to 65
percent of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these
definitions, debt excludes the long-term debt payable to affiliated trusts. At December 31,
2004, Southern Company, Southern Power, and the retail operating companies were each in
compliance with their respective debt limit covenants.

In addition, the credit arrangements typically contain cross default provisions that would
be triggered if the borrower defaulted on other indebtedness above a specified threshold.
Except for Southern Power, the cross default provisions are restricted only to the indebtedness,
including any guarantee obligations, of the company that has the credit arrangement with the
bank. Southern Power’s bank credit arrangements have a cross default to Southern Company’s
indebtedness, which, if triggered, would require prepayment of debt related to projects financed
under the credit arrangement that are not complete. Southern Company has committed to fund at
least 35 percent on Southern Power’s construction project financing and to pay for construction
overruns to the extent that Southern Power’s cash flow is insufficient. Southern Company and
its subsidiaries are currently in compliance with all such covenants.

Borrowings under certain retail operating companies’ unused credit arrangements totaling
$40 million would be prohibited if the borrower experiences a material adverse change, as
defined in such arrangements. Initial borrowings for new projects under Southern Power’s credit
facility would be prohibited if Southern Power or Southern Company experiences a material
adverse change, as defined in that credit facility.

A portion of the $3.2 billion unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity
support to the retail operating companies’ variable rate pollution control bonds. The amount of
variable rate pollution control bonds requiring liquidity support as of December 31, 2004 was
$662 million.

Southern Company, the retail operating companies, and Southern Power borrow through
commercial paper programs that have the liquidity support of committed bank credit arrangements.
Southern Company and the retail operating companies may also borrow through extendible
commercial note programs. The amount of commercial paper and extendible commercial notes
outstanding and included in notes payable on the balance sheets at December 31, 2004 and
December 31, 2003 was $377 million and $568 million, respectively. During 2004, the peak amount
outstanding for commercial paper was $848 million, and the average amount outstanding was $511
million. The average annual interest rate on commercial paper was 1.3 percent in both 2004 and
2003.

Financial Instruments

The retail operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company GAS enter into
energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, gas, and other fuel price changes.
However, due to cost-based rate regulations, the retail operating companies have limited
exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity. In addition,
Southern Power’s exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of
electricity is limited because its long-term sales contracts shift substantially all fuel cost
responsibility to the purchaser. Each of the retail operating companies has implemented
fuel-hedging programs at the instruction of their respective state PSCs. Together with Southern
Power, the retail operating companies may enter into hedges of forward electricity sales.
Southern Company GAS has gas-hedging programs to substantially mitigate its exposure to price
volatility for its gas purchases.

At December 31, 2004, the fair value of derivative energy contracts was reflected in the
financial statements as follows:

The fair value gains or losses for cash flow hedges that are recoverable through the
regulatory fuel clauses are recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities and are recognized in
earnings at the same time the hedged items affect earnings. For Southern Power and Southern
Company GAS, the fair value gains or losses for cash flow hedges are recorded in other
comprehensive income and are reclassified into earnings at the same time the hedged items affect
earnings. For 2004, 2003, and 2002, approximately $(3) million, $22 million, and $3 million,
respectively, of pre-tax gains (losses) were reclassified from other comprehensive income to
fuel expense. For the year 2005, approximately $3 million of pre-tax gains are expected to be
reclassified from other comprehensive income to fuel expense. There was no significant
ineffectiveness recorded in earnings for any period presented. Southern Company has
energy-related hedges in place up to and including 2007.

Southern Company and certain subsidiaries also enter into derivatives to hedge exposure to
changes in interest rates. Derivatives related to fixed-rate securities are accounted for as
fair value hedges. Derivatives related to variable rate securities or forecasted transactions
are accounted for as cash flow hedges. As the derivatives employed as hedging instruments are
generally structured to match the critical terms of the hedged debt instruments, no material
ineffectiveness has been recorded in earnings.

At December 31, 2004, Southern Company had $2.6 billion notional amount of interest rate
swaps and options outstanding with net fair value gains of $12 million as follows:

For fair value hedges where the hedged item is an asset, liability, or firm
commitment, the changes in the fair value of the hedging derivatives are recorded in earnings
and are offset by the changes in the fair value of the hedged item.

The fair value gain or loss for cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income and
is reclassified into earnings at the same time the hedged items affect earnings. In 2004, 2003,
and 2002, the Company settled losses of $7 million, $116 million, and $14 million, respectively,
upon termination of certain interest derivatives at the same time it issued debt. These losses
have been deferred in other comprehensive income and will be amortized to interest expense over the
life of the original interest derivative. For 2004, 2003, and 2002, approximately $23 million, $26

million, and $6 million, respectively, of pre-tax losses were reclassified from other comprehensive
income to interest expense. For 2005, pre-tax losses of approximately $11 million are expected to
be reclassified from other comprehensive income to interest expense. The Company has
interest-related hedges in place through 2035.

7. COMMITMENTS

Construction Program

Southern Company is engaged in continuous construction programs, currently estimated to total
$2.2 billion in 2005, $2.5 billion in 2006, and $3.2 billion in 2007. These amounts include $64
million, $45 million, and $39 million in 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively, for construction
expenditures related to contractual purchase commitments for uranium and nuclear fuel
conversion, enrichment, and fabrication services included herein under “Fuel and Purchased Power
Commitments.” The construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual
construction costs may vary from the above estimates because of numerous factors. These factors
include: changes in business conditions; acquisition of additional generating assets; revised
load growth estimates; changes in environmental regulations; changes in existing nuclear plants
to meet new regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules and transmission regulations;
increasing costs of labor, equipment, and materials; and cost of capital. At December 31, 2004,
significant purchase commitments were outstanding in connection with the construction program.
Southern Company has approximately 1,200 megawatts of additional generating capacity scheduled
to be placed in service during 2005. In addition, capital improvements to generation,
transmission, and distribution facilities — including those to meet environmental standards —
will continue.

Long-Term Service Agreements

The retail operating companies and Southern Power have entered into several Long-Term Service
Agreements (LTSAs) with General Electric (GE) for the purpose of securing maintenance support
for the combined cycle and combustion turbine generating facilities owned by the subsidiaries.
The LTSAs stipulate that GE will perform all planned inspections on the covered equipment, which
includes the cost of all labor and materials. GE is also obligated to cover the costs of
unplanned maintenance on the covered equipment subject to a limit specified in each contract.

In general, except for Southern Power’s Plant Dahlberg, these LTSAs are in effect through
two major inspection cycles per unit. The Dahlberg agreement is in effect through the first
major inspection of each unit. Scheduled payments to GE are made at various intervals based on
actual operating hours of the respective units. Total payments to GE under these agreements for
facilities owned are currently estimated at $1.4 billion over the remaining life of the
agreements, which may range up to 30 years. However, the LTSAs contain various cancellation
provisions at the option of the purchasers.

In December 2004, Georgia Power entered into a LTSA with GE for blanket coverage of neutron
monitoring system parts and electronics at Plant Hatch. GE will be responsible for parts and
service for 10 years. Total payments under the agreement are estimated at $14 million. The
contract contains cancellation provisions at the option of Georgia Power.

Payments made to GE prior to the performance of any planned inspections are recorded as a
prepayment in the balance sheets. Inspection costs are capitalized or charged to expense based
on the nature of the work performed.

Fuel and Purchased Power Commitments

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of the generating plants, Southern Company has
entered into various long-term commitments for the procurement of fossil and nuclear fuel. In
most cases, these contracts contain provisions for price escalations, minimum purchase levels,
and other financial commitments. Coal commitments include forward contract purchases for sulfur
dioxide emission allowances. Natural gas purchase commitments contain given volumes with prices
based on various indices at the time of delivery. Amounts included in the chart below represent
estimates based on New York Mercantile Exchange future prices at December 31, 2004. Also,
Southern Company has entered into various long-term commitments for the purchase of electricity.

Operating Leases

In May 2001, Mississippi Power began the initial 10-year term of a lease agreement for a
combined cycle generating facility built at Plant Daniel. The facility cost approximately $370
million. In 2003, the generating facility was acquired by Juniper Capital L.P. (Juniper), whose
partners are unaffiliated with Mississippi Power. Simultaneously, Juniper entered into a
restructured lease agreement with Mississippi Power. In 2003, approximately $11 million in
lease termination costs were also included in operation expenses. Juniper has also entered into
leases with other parties unrelated to Mississippi Power. The assets leased by Mississippi
Power comprise less than 50 percent of Juniper’s assets. Mississippi Power is not required to
consolidate the leased assets and related liabilities, and the lease with Juniper is considered
an operating lease. The initial lease term ends in 2011, and the lease includes a purchase and
renewal option based on the cost of the facility at the inception of the lease. Mississippi
Power is required to amortize approximately 4 percent of the initial acquisition cost over the
initial lease term. Eighteen months prior to the end of the initial lease, Mississippi Power
may elect to renew for 10 years. If the lease is renewed, the agreement calls for Mississippi
Power to amortize an additional 17 percent of the initial completion cost over the renewal
period. Upon termination of the lease, at Mississippi Power’s option, it may either exercise
its purchase option or the facility can be sold to a third party.

The lease provides for a residual value guarantee — approximately 73 percent of the
acquisition cost — by Mississippi Power that is due upon termination of the lease in the event
that Mississippi Power does not renew the lease or purchase the assets and that the fair market
value is less than the unamortized cost of the asset. A liability of approximately $13 million
for the fair market value of this residual value guarantee is included in the balance sheet as
of December 31, 2004.

Southern Company also has other operating lease agreements with various terms and
expiration dates. Total operating lease expenses were $156 million, $172 million, and $169
million for 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. At December 31, 2004, estimated minimum rental
commitments for noncancelable operating leases were as follows:

For the retail operating companies, the rail car lease expenses are recoverable through
fuel cost recovery provisions. In addition to the above rental commitments, Alabama Power and
Georgia Power have obligations upon expiration of certain leases with respect to the residual
value of the leased property. These leases expire in 2006, 2009, and 2011, and the maximum
obligations are $66 million, $19.5 million, and $72 million, respectively. At the termination
of the leases, the lessee may either exercise its purchase option, or the property can be sold
to a third party. Alabama Power and Georgia Power expect that the fair market value of the
leased property would substantially reduce or eliminate the payments under the residual value
obligations.

Guarantees

Southern Company has made separate guarantees to certain counterparties regarding performance of
contractual commitments by Mirant’s trading and marketing subsidiaries. The total notional
amount of guarantees outstanding at December 31, 2004 is less than $20 million, all of which
will expire by 2009.

Southern Company has executed a keep-well agreement with a subsidiary of Southern Holdings
to make capital contributions in the event of any shortfall in payments due under a
participation agreement with an entity in which the subsidiary holds a 30 percent investment.
The maximum aggregate amount of Southern Company’s liability under this keep-well agreement is
$50 million.

As
discussed earlier in this Note under “Operating Leases,” Alabama Power, Georgia Power,
and Mississippi Power have entered into certain residual value guarantees.

9. NUCLEAR INSURANCE

Under the Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 1988, Alabama Power and Georgia Power maintain
agreements of indemnity with the NRC that, together with private insurance, cover third-party
liability arising from any nuclear incident occurring at the companies’ nuclear power plants. The
act provides funds up to $10.76 billion for public liability claims that could arise from a single
nuclear incident. Each nuclear plant is insured against this liability to a maximum of $300
million by American Nuclear Insurers (ANI), with the remaining coverage provided by a mandatory
program of deferred premiums that could be assessed, after a nuclear incident, against all owners
of nuclear reactors. A company could be assessed up to $101 million per incident for each licensed
reactor it operates but not more than an aggregate of $10 million per incident to be paid in a
calendar year for each reactor. Such maximum assessment, excluding any applicable state premium
taxes, for Alabama Power and Georgia Power — based on its ownership and buyback interests — is
$201 million and $203 million, respectively, per incident, but not more than an aggregate of $20
million per company to be paid for each incident in any one year. The Price-Anderson Amendments
Act expired in August 2002; however, the indemnity provisions of the act remain in place for
commercial nuclear reactors.

Alabama Power and Georgia Power are members of Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), a
mutual insurer established to provide property damage insurance in an amount up to $500 million
for members’ nuclear generating facilities.

Additionally, both companies have policies that currently provide decontamination, excess
property insurance, and premature decommissioning coverage up to $2.25 billion for losses in
excess of the $500 million primary coverage. This excess insurance is also provided by NEIL.

NEIL also covers the additional costs that would be incurred in obtaining replacement power
during a prolonged accidental outage at a member’s nuclear plant. Members can purchase this
coverage, subject to a deductible waiting period of up to 26 weeks, with a maximum per occurrence
per unit limit of $490 million. After the deductible period, weekly indemnity payments would be
received until either the unit is operational or until the limit is exhausted in approximately
three years. Alabama Power and Georgia Power each purchase the maximum limit allowed by NEIL,
subject to ownership limitations. Each facility has elected a 12-week waiting period.

Under each of the NEIL policies, members are subject to assessments if losses each year
exceed the accumulated funds available to the insurer under that policy. The current maximum
annual assessments for Alabama Power and Georgia Power under the NEIL policies would be $39
million and $43 million, respectively.

Following the terrorist attacks of September 2001, both ANI and NEIL confirmed that terrorist
acts against commercial nuclear power plants would be covered under their insurance. Both
companies, however, revised their policy terms on a prospective basis to include an industry
aggregate for all “non-certified” terrorist acts, i.e., acts that are not certified acts of
terrorism pursuant to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA). The NEIL aggregate, which
applies to non-certified claims stemming from terrorism within a 12-month duration, is $3.24
billion plus any amounts available through reinsurance or indemnity from an outside source. The
non-certified ANI cap is a $300 million shared industry aggregate. Any act of terrorism that is
certified pursuant to the TRIA will not be subject to the foregoing NEIL and ANI limitations but
will be subject to the TRIA annual aggregate limitation of $100 billion of insured losses arising
from certified acts of terrorism. The TRIA will expire on December 31, 2005.

For all on-site property damage insurance policies for commercial nuclear power plants, the
NRC requires that the proceeds of such policies shall be dedicated first for the sole purpose of
placing the reactor in a safe and stable condition after an accident. Any remaining proceeds
are to be applied next toward the costs of decontamination and debris removal operations ordered
by the NRC, and any further remaining proceeds are to be paid either to the company or to its
bond trustees as may be appropriate under the policies and applicable trust indentures.

All retrospective assessments — whether generated for liability, property, or replacement
power — may be subject to applicable state premium taxes.

ALABAMA POWER COMPANY

FINANCIAL SECTION

II-73


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Alabama Power Company:

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements of capitalization of Alabama Power
Company (a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company) as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the
related statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder’s equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004. These financial statements are the
responsibility of Alabama Power Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a
basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express
no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements (pages II-93 to II-118) present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Alabama Power Company at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, in 2003 Alabama Power Company changed its
method of accounting for asset retirement obligations.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION

Alabama Power Company 2004 Annual Report

OVERVIEW

Business Activities

Alabama Power Company (the Company) operates as a vertically integrated utility providing
electricity to retail customers within its traditional service area located within the State of
Alabama and to wholesale customers in the Southeast.

Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Company’s primary business
of selling electricity. These factors include the ability to maintain a stable regulatory
environment, to achieve energy sales growth while containing costs, and to recover costs related to
growing demand and increasingly more stringent environmental standards.

On September 15 and 16, 2004, Hurricane Ivan hit the Gulf Coast of Florida and Alabama and
continued north through the state of Alabama, causing substantial damage in the service
territory of the Company. Approximately 826,000 of the Company’s 1,370,000 customer accounts
were without electrical service immediately after the hurricane. Almost 95% of those without
power had service restored within one week, and two weeks after the storm, power had been
restored to all who could receive service.

In 2004, the Company completed a retail rate proceeding that should help enable the recovery
of substantial capital investments associated with environmental improvements.

Key Performance Indicators

In striving to maximize shareholder value while providing low-cost energy to nearly 1.4 million
customers, the Company focuses on several key indicators. These indicators include customer
satisfaction, peak season equivalent forced outage rate (Peak Season EFOR), and return on equity
(ROE). The Company’s financial success is directly tied to the satisfaction of its customers.
Key elements of ensuring customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high reliability, and
competitive prices. Management uses nationally recognized customer satisfaction surveys and
reliability indicators to evaluate the Company’s results. Peak Season EFOR is an indicator of
plant availability and efficient generation fleet operations during the months when generation
needs are greatest. The rate is calculated
by dividing the number of hours of forced outages by total generation hours. ROE is a performance
standard used by both the investment community and many regulatory agencies. The Company’s 2004
results compared with its targets for each of these indicators are reflected in the following
chart.

The strong financial performance achieved in 2004 reflects the focus that management places on
these indicators, as well as the commitment shown by the Company’s employees in achieving or
exceeding management’s expectations.

Earnings

The Company’s 2004 net income after dividends on preferred stock was $481 million, representing an
$8 million (1.8 percent) increase from the prior year. This improvement is due primarily to higher
retail sales, increases in other revenues, and lower interest expense, partially offset by higher
non-fuel operating expenses.

The Company’s 2003 net income after dividends on preferred stock was $473 million,
representing a $12 million (2.5 percent) increase from the prior year. This improvement was due
primarily to higher retail sales, higher sales for resale, increases in other revenues, and lower
interest expense, partially offset by higher non-fuel operating expenses. In 2002, earnings were
$461 million, representing a 19.3 percent increase from the prior year. This improvement was
primarily attributable to increased territorial energy sales and higher retail rates when compared
to the prior year. More favorable weather conditions in 2002 as compared to the unusually mild
weather experienced in 2001 contributed to the increases in territorial sales. The increases in
revenues were partially offset by increased non-fuel operating expenses.

The return on average common equity for 2004 was 13.53 percent compared to 13.75 percent in
2003 and 13.80 percent in 2002.

Retail revenues in 2004 were $3.3 billion. Revenues increased $242 million (7.9 percent) from
the prior year, increased $100 million (3.4 percent) in 2003, and increased $203 million (7.4
percent) in 2002. All sectors of retail revenues increased $68 million (3.7 percent) for the
Company in 2004. These 2004 and 2003 increases were primarily due to increased fuel revenue and
2.6 percent and 0.8 percent increases in retail base rates which went into effect in July 2003 and
July 2004, respectively. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Rate Adjustment
Procedures” for additional information.

The primary contributors to the increase in revenues in 2002 were the positive effect of
favorable weather conditions on energy sales and increases in retail base rates (0.6 percent
increase in July 2001 and 2 percent increases in both October 2001 and April 2002). The Company
mitigated the effect of these increases to customers with a decrease to the energy cost recovery
factor in April 2002.

Fuel rates billed to customers are designed to fully recover fluctuating fuel and purchased
power costs over a period of time. At December 31, 2004, the Company had $102 million of
unrecovered fuel costs. Fuel revenues generally have no effect on net income because they
represent the recording of revenues to offset fuel and purchased power expenses.

Sales for resale to non-affiliates are predominantly unit power sales under long-term
contracts to Florida utilities. Revenues from power sales contracts have both capacity and energy
components. Capacity revenues reflect the recovery of fixed costs and a return on investment under
the contracts. Energy is generally sold at variable cost. These capacity and energy components of
the unit power contracts were as follows:

Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in sales for resale to non-affiliates.
These opportunity sales are made at market based rates that generally provide a margin above the
Company’s variable cost to produce

Revenues from sales to affiliated companies within the Southern Company electric system, as
well as purchases of energy, will vary from year to year depending on demand and the availability
and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliated sales and purchases are made in
accordance with the affiliated company interchange agreements as approved by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC). In 2004, sales for resale revenues increased $31 million primarily
due to increases in fuel-related expenses. Sales for resale revenues increased $89.1 million in
2003 due to increased capacity payments received from affiliates. Excluding the capacity revenues,
these transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since the energy is generally sold
at marginal cost and energy purchases are generally offset by energy revenues through the Company’s
energy cost recovery clause.

Other operating revenues in 2004 increased $7.0 million (4.9 percent) from 2003 due to an
increase of $7.7 million in revenues from gas-fueled co-generation steam facilities — primarily as
a result of higher gas prices – and a $2.4 million increase in revenues from rent from electric
property offset by a $2.0 million decrease in transmission revenues. Since co-generation steam
revenues are generally offset by fuel expense, these revenues did not have a significant impact on
earnings.

Other operating revenues in 2003 increased $47 million (48.6 percent) from 2002 due to an
increase of $19.4 million in revenues from gas-fueled co-generation steam facilities — primarily
as a result of higher gas prices — and a $14.8 million increase in revenues from Alabama Public
Service Commission (Alabama PSC) approved fees charged to customers for connection, reconnection,
and collection when compared to the same period in 2002.

The $11 million (9.9 percent) decrease in other operating revenues in 2002 resulted primarily
from a $7.0 million decrease in revenues from gas-fueled co-generation steam facilities due to
lower gas prices and lower demand.

Energy Sales

Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the volume of energy sold each year. Kilowatt-hour
(KWH) sales for 2004 and the percent change by year were as follows:

Energy sales in the residential sector grew by 2.4 percent in 2004 due primarily to continued
customer growth and a return to normal summer temperatures. Commercial sales increased 2.8 percent
in 2004 primarily due to the State of Alabama’s continuing transition from a manufacturing-based
economy to a more service-based economy. Industrial sales rebounded 5.8 percent during the year
with primary metal, chemical, and paper sectors leading the growth.

In 2003, residential energy sales experienced a 2.5 percent decrease over the prior year and
total retail energy sales grew by 0.3 percent primarily as a result of milder-than-normal summer
temperatures compared to the previous year. Although retail sales to industrial customers
increased 2.3 percent in 2003 and 3.1 percent in 2002, overall sales to industrial customers
remained depressed due to the continuing effect of sluggish economic conditions.

Residential energy sales for 2002 experienced a 9.6 percent increase over the prior year and
total retail energy sales grew by 5.5 percent primarily as a result of warmer summer temperatures
and colder winter weather conditions compared to the previous year.

Assuming normal weather, sales to retail customers are projected to grow approximately 1.7
percent annually on average during 2005 through 2009.

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2004 Annual Report

Expenses

Total operating expenses in 2004 grew $270 million (9.2 percent) to $3.2 billion. This increase
over the previous year was primarily related to an increase in natural gas and coal prices. In
addition, purchased power expenses increased $98 million (31.0 percent) primarily due to a 71.7
percent increase in energy purchased, while purchased power prices decreased by 1.9 percent.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased $13 million (3.1 percent) primarily due to an
increase in utility plant in service.

The total operating expenses in 2003 were approximately $3.0 billion, an increase of $257
million (9.6 percent) over the previous year. This increase is mainly due to a $98 million
increase in fuel expense primarily related to an increase in the average cost of natural gas and
coal. In addition, purchased power expenses increased a total of $66 million, maintenance expense
increased $30 million primarily related to transmission and distribution overhead lines, and
depreciation and amortization expense increased $15 million.

In 2002, total operating expenses of $2.7 billion increased by $13 million (0.5 percent) over
the previous year. This slight increase was mainly due to a $35 million increase in administrative
and general expenses primarily related to employee salaries, insurance expense, and accrued
expenses for liability insurance, litigation, and workers compensation, a $19 million increase in
production expenses related to boiler plant maintenance, and a $15 million increase in depreciation
and amortization expenses due to an increase in depreciable property. These increases were offset
by a $43 million decrease in purchased power expenses and a $14 million decrease in fuel expenses
related to lower coal prices.

Fuel costs constitute the single largest expense for the Company.
The mix of fuel sources for generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand,
the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the availability of fossil and nuclear generating units and
hydro generation. The amount and sources of generation and the average cost of fuel per net
kilowatt-hour (KWH) generated and the average cost of purchased power were as follows:

Fuel and purchased power expenses totaled $1.6 billion in 2004, an increase of $216 million
(15.6 percent). This was due to the average natural gas prices increasing by 30.5 percent, the
average coal prices increasing 3.1 percent over the previous year, and higher capacity payments
associated with an existing power purchase agreement (PPA). In 2003, total fuel and purchased
power expenses of $1.4 billion increased $164 million (13.4 percent) over 2002 due to a 58.3
percent increase in average gas prices and a 2.2 percent increase in average coal prices. Fuel and
purchased power expenses in 2002 of $1.2 billion decreased $75 million (5.8 percent) due primarily
to lower average fuel cost, while total energy sales increased 3.0 billion KWHs (4.1 percent)
compared with the amounts recorded in 2001.

A significant upward trend in the cost of coal and natural gas has emerged since 2003, and
volatility in these markets is expected to continue. Increased coal prices have been influenced
by a worldwide increase in demand as a result of rapid economic growth in China as well as by
increases in mining costs. Higher natural gas prices in the United States are the result of
slightly lower gas supplies despite increased drilling activity. Natural gas supply
interruptions, such as those caused by the 2004 hurricanes, result in an immediate market
response; however, the impact of this price volatility may be reduced by imports of natural gas
and liquefied natural gas. Fuel expenses, including purchased power, are offset by fuel
revenues through the Company’s energy cost recovery clause and generally have no effect on net
income.

Purchased power consists of purchases from affiliates in the Southern Company electric system
and non-affiliated companies. Purchased power transactions among the Company and its affiliates
will vary from period to period depending on demand, the availability, and the variable production
cost of generating resources at

II-78

Alabama Power Company 2004 Annual Report

each company. Purchased power from non-affiliates increased $75 million (68 percent) in 2004.
This was due to a 71.7 percent increase in energy purchased offset by a 1.9 percent decrease in
purchased power prices over the previous year. In 2003, purchased power from non-affiliates
increased $20 million (22 percent) due to a 19.3 percent increase in price and a 9.5 percent
increase in energy purchased when compared to 2002. During 2002, purchased power transactions from
non-affiliates decreased $54 million (37 percent) due to the addition in May 2001 of a combined
cycle unit which generated 6.1 billion KWHs in 2002, an 18.4 percent increase over the previous
year.

Depreciation and amortization expense increased 3.1 percent in 2004, 3.6 percent in 2003, and
3.9 percent in 2002. These increases reflect additions to property, plant, and equipment.

Allowance for equity funds used during construction (AFUDC) increased $3.5 million (28.2
percent) in 2004 due primarily to an increase in the amount of construction work in progress
over the prior year. AFUDC increased $1.4 million (12.8 percent) in 2003 due to an increase in
the applicable AFUDC rate. AFUDC increased $4 million (57.5 percent) in 2002 due to an increase
in the amount of construction work in progress over the prior year. See Note 1 to the financial
statements under “AFUDC” for additional information.

Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized of $194 million in 2004 decreased $20.7 million
(9.7 percent) from 2003, which had decreased $11.4 million (5.1 percent) from 2002, which had
decreased $21 million (8.4 percent) from 2001. All years reflect a decrease in interest rates on
long-term debt due to refinancing activities.

Effects of Inflation

The Company is subject to rate regulation that is based on the recovery of historical costs. In
addition, the income tax laws are based on historical costs. Therefore, inflation creates an
economic loss because the Company is recovering its costs of investments in dollars that have less
purchasing power. While the inflation rate has been relatively low in recent years, it continues
to have an adverse effect on the Company because of the large investment in utility plant with long
economic lives. Conventional accounting for historical cost does not recognize this economic loss
nor the partially offsetting gain that arises through financing facilities with fixed-money
obligations, such as long-term debt and preferred securities. Any recognition of inflation by
regulatory authorities is reflected in the rate of return allowed in the Company’s approved
electric rates.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL

General

The Company operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electricity to retail customers
within its traditional service area located in the State of Alabama and to wholesale customers in
the Southeast. Prices for electricity provided by the Company to retail customers are set by the
Alabama PSC under cost-based regulatory principles. Prices for electricity relating to jointly
owned generating facilities, interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power
are set by the FERC. Retail rates and earnings are reviewed and adjusted periodically within
certain limitations based on ROE. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES – “Application of Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates – Electric Utility Regulation” herein and Note 3 to the financial statements
for additional information about these and other regulatory matters.

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of future
earnings potential. The level of the Company’s future earnings depends on numerous factors that
affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Company’s primary business of selling
electricity. These factors include the Company’s ability to maintain a stable regulatory
environment, to achieve energy sales growth while containing costs, and to recover costs related to
growing demand and increasingly more stringent environmental standards. Future earnings for the
electricity business in the near term will depend, in part, upon growth in energy sales, which is
subject to a number of factors. These factors include weather, competition, new energy contracts
with neighboring utilities, energy conservation practiced by customers, the price of electricity,
the price elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic growth in the Company’s service area.

Since 2001, merchant energy companies and traditional electric utilities with significant
energy marketing and trading activities have come under severe financial pressures. Many of these
companies have completely exited or drastically reduced all energy marketing and trading activities
and sold foreign and domestic electric infrastructure assets. The Company has not experienced any
material adverse financial impact

regarding its limited energy trading operations through Southern Company Services, Inc. (SCS).

Environmental Matters

New Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil action in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against the Company, alleging that the Company
had violated the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act and related state laws
with respect to coal-fired generating facilities at the Company’s Plants Miller, Barry, and Gorgas.
The EPA concurrently issued to the Company a notice of violation relating to these specific
facilities, as well as Plants Greene County and Gaston. In early 2000, the EPA filed a motion to
amend its complaint to add the violations alleged in its notice of violation. The civil action
requests penalties and injunctive relief, including an order requiring the installation of the best
available control technology at the affected units. The action against the Company was effectively
stayed in the spring of 2001 pending the appeal of a similar NSR action against the Tennessee
Valley Authority before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. In June 2004,
following the final resolution of that appeal, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
Alabama lifted the stay in the action against the Company, placing the case back onto the court’s
active docket. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “New Source Review Actions” for
additional information.

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act
authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $32,500 per day, per violation at each generating
unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in this matter could
require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly
require payment of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of operations, cash
flows, and possibly financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

In December 2002 and October 2003, the EPA issued final revisions to its NSR regulations under
the Clean Air Act. The December 2002 revisions included changes to the regulatory exclusions and
the methods of calculating emissions increases. The October 2003 regulations clarified the scope
of the existing Routine Maintenance, Repair, and Replacement (RMRR) exclusion. A coalition of
states and environmental organizations has filed petitions for review of these revisions with the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The October 2003 RMRR rules have been
stayed by the Court of Appeals pending its review of the rules. In any event, the final
regulations must also be adopted by the State of Alabama in order to apply to the Company’s
facilities. The effect of these final regulations, related legal challenges, and potential state
rulemakings cannot be determined at this time.

Carbon Dioxide Litigation

On July 21, 2004, attorneys general from eight states, each outside of Southern Company’s service
territory, and the corporation counsel for New York City filed a complaint in the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York against Southern Company and four other electric power
companies. A nearly identical complaint was filed by three environmental groups in the same court.
The complaints allege that the companies’ emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas,
contribute to global warming, which the plaintiffs assert is a public nuisance. Under common law
public and private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs seek a judicial order (1) holding each
defendant jointly and severally liable for creating, contributing to, and/or maintaining global
warming and (2) requiring each of the defendants to cap its emissions of carbon dioxide and then
reduce those emissions by a specified percentage each year for at least a decade. Plaintiffs have
not, however, requested that damages be awarded in connection with their claims. Southern Company
believes these claims are without merit and notes that the complaint cites no statutory or
regulatory basis for the claims. Southern Company and the other defendants have filed motions to
dismiss both lawsuits. Southern Company intends to vigorously defend against these claims. While
the outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time, an adverse judgment in either of
these actions could result in substantial capital expenditures.

MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2004 Annual Report

Environmental Statutes and Regulations

The Company’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by state and federal environmental
agencies under a variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental media, including air,
water, and land resources. Compliance with these environmental requirements involves significant
capital and operating costs, a major portion of which is expected to be recovered through existing
ratemaking provisions. See “FERC and Alabama PSC Matters – Environmental Rate Filing” and Note 3
to the financial statements under “Retail Rate Adjustment Procedures” for additional information.
Environmental costs that are known and estimable at this time are included in capital expenditures
discussed under FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – “Capital Requirements and Contractual
Obligations” herein. There is no assurance, however, that all such costs will, in fact, be
recovered.

Compliance with the Clean Air Act and resulting regulations has been and will continue to be a
significant focus for the Company. The Title IV acid rain provisions of the Clean Air Act, for
example, required significant reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions and
resulted in total construction expenditures of approximately $66 million through 2000. Some of
these previous expenditures also assisted the Company in complying with nitrogen oxide emission
reduction requirements under Title I of the Clean Air Act, which were designed to address one-hour
ozone nonattainment problems in Birmingham, Alabama. In December 2000, the Alabama Department of
Environmental Management (ADEM) adopted revisions to the state implementation plan for meeting the
one-hour ozone standard. These revisions required additional nitrogen oxide emission reductions
from May through September of each year at plants in and/or near those nonattainment areas. Two
plants in the Birmingham area are currently subject to those requirements, the most recent of which
went into effect in 2003. Construction expenditures for compliance with the nitrogen oxide
emission reduction requirements totaled approximately $249 million through 2004.

To help attain the one-hour ozone standard, the EPA issued regional nitrogen oxide reduction
rules in 1998. Those rules required 21 states, including Alabama, to reduce and cap nitrogen
oxide emissions from power plants and other large industrial sources. Affected sources, including
five of the Company’s coal-fired plants, were required to comply with these reductions by May 31,
2004. Additional construction expenditures for compliance with these rules are currently
estimated at approximately $369 million, of which $169 million remains to be spent. In March
2004, the EPA redesignated the Birmingham, Alabama area from nonattainment to attainment under the
one-hour ozone standard.

In July 1997, the EPA revised the national ambient air quality standards for ozone and
particulate matter. These revisions made the standards significantly more stringent and included
development of an eight-hour ozone standard, as opposed to the previous one-hour ozone standard.
In the subsequent litigation of these standards, the U.S. Supreme Court found the EPA’s
implementation program for the new eight-hour ozone standard unlawful and remanded it to the EPA
for further rulemaking. During 2003, the EPA proposed implementation rules designed to address the
court’s concerns. On April 30, 2004, the EPA published its eight-hour ozone nonattainment
designations and a portion of the rules implementing the new eight-hour ozone standard. The
counties around Birmingham have been designated as nonattainment under the eight-hour ozone
standard. Under the implementation provisions of the new rule, the EPA announced that the one-hour
ozone standard will be revoked on June 15, 2005. With respect to the eight-hour nonattainment
areas, state implementation plans, including new emission control regulations necessary to bring
those areas into attainment, could be required as early as 2007. These state implementation plans
could require reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions from power plants. The impact of the
eight-hour designations and the new standard will depend on the development and implementation of
Alabama’s state implementation plan and therefore cannot be determined at this time.

On December 17, 2004, the EPA issued its final “nonattainment” designations for the fine
particulate national ambient air quality standard. Several areas within the Company’s service area
were included in the EPA’s final particulate matter designations. The EPA plans to propose a fine
particulate matter implementation rule in 2005 and finalize the implementation rule in 2006. State
implementation plans addressing the nonattainment designations may be required by 2008 and could
require reductions in sulfur dioxide emissions and further reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions
from power plants. The impact of the fine particulate designations will depend on the development
and implementation of Alabama state implementation plans and therefore cannot be determined at this
time.

In January 2004, the EPA issued a proposed Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) to address
interstate transport of

II-81


MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2004 Annual Report

ozone and fine particles. This proposed rule would require additional year-round sulfur dioxide
and nitrogen oxide emission reductions from power plants in the eastern United States in two phases
– in 2010 and 2015. The EPA currently plans to finalize this rule in 2005. If finalized, the rule
could modify or supplant other state requirements for attainment of the fine particulate matter
standard and the eight-hour ozone standard, as well as other air quality regulations. The impact
of this rule on the Company will depend upon the specific requirements of the final rule and cannot
be determined at this time.

The Company has developed and maintains an environmental compliance strategy for the
installation of additional control technologies and the purchase of emission allowances to
assure continued compliance with current sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission regulations.
Additional expenses associated with these regulations are anticipated to be incurred each year
to maintain current and future compliance. Because the Company’s compliance strategy is
impacted by factors such as changes to existing environmental laws and regulations, increases in
the cost of emissions allowances, and any change in the Company’s fuel mix, future environmental
compliance costs cannot be determined at this time.

Further reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides could also be required under the
EPA’s Regional Haze rules. The Regional Haze rules require states to establish Best Available
Retrofit Technology (BART) standards for certain sources that contribute to regional haze and to
implement emission reduction requirements that make progress toward remedying current visibility
impairment in certain natural areas. The Company has a number of plants that could be subject to
these rules. The EPA’s Regional Haze program calls for states to submit implementation plans in
2008 that contain emission reduction strategies for implementing BART and for achieving sufficient
progress toward the Clean Air Act’s visibility improvement goal. In response to litigation, the
EPA proposed revised rules in May 2004, which it plans to finalize in April 2005. The impact of
these regulations will depend on the promulgation of final rules and implementation of those rules
by the states and, therefore, it is not possible to determine the effect of these rules on the
Company at this time.

In January 2004, the EPA issued proposed rules regulating mercury emissions from electric
utility boilers. The proposal solicits comments on two possible approaches for the new regulations
– a Maximum Achievable Control Technology approach and a cap-and-trade approach. Either approach
would require significant reductions in mercury emissions from Company facilities. The regulations
are scheduled to be finalized by March 2005, and compliance could be required as early as 2008.
Because the regulations have not been finalized, the impact on the Company cannot be determined at
this time.

Major bills to amend the Clean Air Act to impose more stringent emissions limitations on power
plants, including the Bush Administration’s Clear Skies Act, have been re-proposed in 2005. The
Clear Skies Act is expected to further limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen
oxides, and mercury and to supplement the proposed CAIR and mercury regulatory programs. Other
proposals to limit emissions of carbon dioxide have also been introduced. The cost impacts of such
legislation would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined at this
time.

Under the Clean Water Act, the EPA has been developing new rules aimed at reducing impingement
and entrainment of fish and fish larvae at power plants’ cooling water intake structures. In July
2004, the EPA published final rules that will require biological studies and, perhaps, retrofits to
some intake structures at existing power plants. The impact of these new rules will depend on the
results of studies and analyses performed as part of the rules’ implementation and the actual
limits established by the regulatory agencies.

Several major pieces of environmental legislation are periodically considered for
reauthorization or amendment by Congress. These include: the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act;
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Emergency Planning & Community
Right-to-Know Act; and the Endangered Species Act. Compliance with possible additional federal or
state legislation or regulations related to global climate change or other environmental and
health concerns could also significantly affect the Company. The impact of any new legislation,
changes to existing legislation, or environmental regulations could affect many areas of the
Company’s operations. The full impact of any such changes cannot, however, be determined at this
time.

Global Climate Issues

Domestic efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions have been spurred by international discussions
surrounding the Framework Convention on Climate Change — and specifically the Kyoto Protocol —
which proposes

II-82


MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2004 Annual Report

constraints on the emissions of greenhouse gases for a group of industrialized countries. The Bush
Administration has not supported U.S. ratification of the Kyoto Protocol or other mandatory carbon
dioxide reduction legislation and, in 2002, announced a goal to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity
of the U.S. – the ratio of greenhouse gas emissions to the value of U.S. economic output — by 18
percent by 2012. A year later, the Department of Energy (DOE) announced the Climate VISION program
to support this goal. Energy-intensive industries, including electricity generation, are the
initial focus of this program. Southern Company is leading the development of a voluntary electric
utility sector climate change initiative in partnership with the government. The utility sector
has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions rate by 3 to 5 percent over the next decade and,
on December 13, 2004, signed a memorandum of understanding with the DOE initiating this program
under Climate VISION. Because efforts under this voluntary program are just beginning, the impact
of this program on the Company cannot be determined at this time.

Environmental Remediation Reserves

The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling and
disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations,
the Company could incur substantial costs to clean up properties. The Company conducts studies to
determine the extent of any required cleanup and has recognized in its financial statements the
costs to clean up known sites. Amounts for cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs were not material
for any year presented. The Company may be liable for some or all required cleanup costs for
additional sites that may require environmental remediation. The Company has not incurred any
significant cleanup costs to date.

FERC and Alabama PSC Matters

Transmission

In December 1999, the FERC issued its final rule on Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs).
Since that time, there have been a number of additional proceedings at the FERC designed to
encourage further voluntary formation of RTOs or to mandate their formation. However, at the
current time, there are no active proceedings that would require the Company to participate in
an RTO. Current FERC efforts that may potentially change the regulatory and/or operational
structure of transmission include rules related to the standardization of generation
interconnection, as well as an inquiry into, among other things, market power by vertically
integrated utilities. See “Generation Interconnection Agreements” and “Market-Based Rate
Authority” herein for additional information. The final outcome of these proceedings cannot now
be determined. However, the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows
could be adversely affected by future changes in the federal regulatory or operational structure
of transmission.

Generation Interconnection Agreements

In July 2003, the FERC issued its final rule on the standardization of generation interconnection
agreements and procedures (Order 2003). Order 2003 shifts much of the financial burden of new
transmission investment from the generator to the transmission provider. The FERC has indicated
that Order 2003, which was effective January 20, 2004, is to be applied prospectively to
interconnection agreements. Subsidiaries of Tenaska, Inc., as counterparties to two previously
executed interconnection agreements with the Company, have filed complaints at the FERC requesting
that the FERC modify the agreements and that the Company refund a total of $11 million previously
paid for interconnection facilities, with interest. The Company has also received similar requests
from other entities totaling $2.5 million. The Company has opposed such relief, and the
proceedings are still pending. The impact of Order 2003 and its subsequent rehearings on the
Company and the final results of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Market-Based Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to nonaffiliates at market-based prices.
Through SCS, as an agent, the Company also has FERC authority to make short-term opportunity sales
at market rates. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a market-based contract
with an affiliate. In November 2001, the FERC modified the test it uses to consider utilities’
applications to charge market-based rates and adopted a new test called the Supply Margin
Assessment (SMA). The FERC applied the SMA to several utilities, including Southern Company, the
retail operating companies, and Southern Power, and found them and others to be “pivotal suppliers”
in their retail service territories and ordered the implementation of several mitigation measures.
Southern Company and others sought rehearing of the FERC order, and the FERC delayed the
implementation of certain mitigation measures. In April 2004, the FERC issued an order that
abandoned the SMA test and adopted a new interim analysis for measuring generation market power.
This

MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2004 Annual Report

new interim approach requires utilities to submit a pivotal supplier screen and a wholesale market
share screen. If the applicant does not pass both screens, there will be a rebuttable presumption
regarding generation market power. The FERC’s order also sets forth procedures for rebutting these
presumptions and addresses mitigation measures for those entities that are found to have market
power. In the absence of specific mitigation measures, the order includes several cost-based
mitigation measures that would apply by default. The FERC also initiated a new rulemaking
proceeding that, among other things, will adopt a final methodology for assessing generation market
power.

In July 2004, the FERC denied Southern Company’s request for rehearing, along with a number
of others, and reaffirmed the interim tests that it adopted in April. In August 2004, Southern
Company submitted a filing to the FERC that included results showing that Southern Company
passed the pivotal supplier screen for all markets and the wholesale market share screen for all
markets except the Southern Company retail service territory. Southern Company also submitted
other analyses to demonstrate that it lacks generation market power. On December 17, 2004, the
FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation dominance within its retail
service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other markets is not at issue.
As directed by this order, on February 15, 2005, Southern Company submitted additional
information related to generation dominance in its retail service territory. Any new
market-based rate transactions in Southern Company’s retail service territory entered into after
February 27, 2005 will be subject to refund to the level of the default cost-based rates,
pending the outcome of the proceeding. Southern Company, along with other utilities, has also
filed an appeal of the FERC’s April and July 2004 orders with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit. The FERC has asked the court to dismiss the appeal on the grounds
that it is premature.

In the event that the FERC’s default mitigation measures are ultimately applied, the
Company may be required to charge cost-based rates for certain wholesale sales in Southern
Company’s retail service territory, which may be lower than negotiated market-based rates. The
final outcome of this matter will depend on the form in which the final methodology for
assessing generation market power and mitigation rules may be ultimately adopted and cannot be
determined at this time.

Hydro Relicensing

In 2002, the Company initiated the relicensing process for the Company’s seven hydroelectric
projects on the Coosa River (Weiss, Henry, Logan Martin, Lay, Mitchell, Jordan, and Bouldin) and
the Smith and Bankhead projects on the Warrior River. The FERC licenses for all of these nine
projects expire in 2007. Upon or after the expiration of each license, the United States
Government, by act of Congress, may take over the project or the FERC may relicense the project
either to the original licensee or to a new licensee. The FERC may grant relicenses subject to
certain requirements that could result in additional costs to the Company. The final outcome of
this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Nuclear Relicensing

The Company filed an application with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in September 2003
to extend the operating license for Plant Farley for an additional 20 years. The NRC is
expected to rule on the application by July 2005. If the NRC approves the extension, the
Company’s annual decommissioning expense could decrease, subject to Alabama PSC approval. See
Note 1 to the financial statements under “Nuclear Decommissioning” for additional information.

Environmental Rate Filing

On October 5, 2004, the Alabama PSC approved a specific rate mechanism for the recovery of the
Company’s retail costs associated with environmental laws, regulations, or other such mandates.
The rate mechanism began operation in January 2005 and provides for the recovery of these costs
pursuant to a factor that will be calculated annually. Environmental costs to be recovered
include operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation and a return on invested capital.
Retail rates have increased 1 percent in 2005, which should yield an annual recovery of
approximately $33 million, and are expected to increase an additional 1 percent in 2006. In
conjunction with the Alabama PSC’s approval, the Company agreed to a moratorium until March 2007
on any retail rate increase under the previously approved Rate Stabilization and Equalization
plan (RSE). Any increase in March 2007 would be based upon the earned return on retail common
equity at December 31, 2006. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Rate
Adjustment Procedures” for further information on RSE.

II-84


MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2004 Annual Report

Retail Rate Adjustments

The Company’s retail rates, approved by the Alabama PSC, also provide for adjustments to recognize
the placing of new generating facilities into retail service and the recovery of retail costs
associated with certificated PPAs under Rate Certificated New Plant (CNP). Effective July 2003,
the Company’s retail rates were adjusted by approximately 2.6% under Rate CNP as a result of two
new certificated PPAs that began in June 2003. An additional increase of $25 million annually was
effective July 2004 under Rate CNP for new certificated PPAs. In April 2005, an adjustment to Rate
CNP is expected to decrease retail rates by approximately 0.5 percent, or $18.5 million annually.
See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Rate Adjustment Procedures” for additional
information.

Retail Fuel Cost Recovery

The Company has established fuel cost recovery rates approved by the Alabama PSC. In recent
months, the Company has experienced higher than expected fuel costs for coal and gas. Those higher
fuel costs have increased the under recovered fuel costs included in the balance sheets. In April
2005, the retail energy clause recovery factor is scheduled to increase from its current level.
The Company will continue to monitor the under recovered fuel cost balance to determine if an
additional adjustment to billing rates should be requested from the Alabama PSC.

Natural Disaster Cost Recovery

The Company maintains a reserve for operation and maintenance expense to cover the cost of
damages from major storms to its transmission and distribution lines and the cost of uninsured
damages to its generation facilities and other property. On September 15 and 16, 2004,
Hurricane Ivan hit the Gulf Coast of Florida and Alabama and continued north through the state
of Alabama, causing substantial damage in the service territory of the Company. Approximately
826,000 of the Company’s 1,370,000 customer accounts were without electrical service immediately
after the hurricane. Almost 95% of those without power had service restored within one week,
and two weeks after the storm, power had been restored to all who could receive service.

The operation and maintenance expenses associated with repairing the damage to the
Company’s facilities and restoring service to customers as a result of Hurricane Ivan were $57.8
million for 2004. The balance in the Company’s natural disaster reserve prior to the storm was
$14.6 million. On October 19, 2004, the Company received approval from the Alabama PSC to record
its hurricane related operation and maintenance expenses in its natural disaster reserve,
thereby deferring the regulatory asset for recovery in future periods. The Company is allowed
to accrue $250 thousand per month until a maximum accumulated provision of $32 million is
attained. Higher accruals to restore the reserve to its authorized level are allowed whenever
the balance in the reserve declines below $22.4 million. During 2004, the Company accrued $9.9
million, including an additional amount of $6.9 million, to the reserve and at December 31, 2004
the regulatory asset totaled $37.7 million.

In February 2005, the Company requested and received Alabama PSC approval of an accounting
order that allows the Company to immediately return certain regulatory liabilities to the retail
customers. The order also allows the Company to simultaneously recover from customers an
accrual of approximately $45 million to offset the costs of Hurricane Ivan and restore the
natural disaster reserve. The combined effects of this order will have no impact on the
Company’s net income in 2005. See Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements under “Natural
Disaster Reserve” and “Natural Disaster Cost Recovery,” respectively, for additional information
on these reserves.

Income Tax Matters

American Jobs Creation Act of 2004

On October 22, 2004, President Bush signed the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Jobs Act)
into law. The Jobs Act includes a provision that allows a generation tax deduction for
utilities. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the Jobs Act, including this
deduction, as well as the related regulatory treatment, on its taxable income. However, the
Company currently does not expect the Jobs Act to have a material impact on its financial
statements.

Other Matters

In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 87, Employers’
Accounting for Pensions, the Company recorded non-cash pension income, before tax, of approximately
$36 million, $52 million, and $56 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Future pension
income is dependent on several factors including trust earnings and changes to the pension plan.
The decline in pension income is expected to continue, but should not become a pension expense in

II-85


MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2004 Annual Report

the foreseeable future. Postretirement benefit costs for the Company were $22 million, $23
million, and $23 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively, and are expected to trend upward.
A portion of pension income and postretirement benefit costs is capitalized based on
construction-related labor charges. Pension and postretirement benefit costs are a component of
the regulated rates and generally do not have a long-term effect on net income. For more
information regarding pension and postretirement benefits, see Note 2 to the financial statements.

The Company is involved in various other matters being litigated and regulatory matters that
could affect future earnings. See Note 3 to the financial statements for information regarding
material issues.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may
have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations and related disclosures.
Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different
from those recorded in the financial statements. Southern Company senior management has
discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates
described below with the Audit Committee of Southern Company’s Board of Directors.

Electric Utility Regulation

The Company is subject to retail regulation by the Alabama PSC and wholesale regulation by the
FERC. These regulatory agencies set the rates the Company is permitted to charge customers
based on allowable costs. As a result, the Company applies FASB Statement No. 71, Accounting
for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, which requires the financial statements to
reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the ratemaking process, the regulators may
require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when they would be
recognized by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of expenses
and the recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery through
rates or the deferral of gains or creation of liabilities and the recording of related
regulatory liabilities. The application of Statement No. 71 has a further effect on the
Company’s financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the
ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from those actually incurred by the Company;
therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation, nuclear
decommissioning, and pension and postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on the
Company’s results of operations than they would on a non-regulated company.

As reflected in Note 1 to the financial statements under “Regulatory Assets and
Liabilities,” significant regulatory assets and liabilities have been recorded. Management
reviews the ultimate recoverability of these regulatory assets and liabilities based on
applicable regulatory guidelines. However, adverse legislative, judicial, or regulatory actions
could materially impact the amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could
adversely impact the Company’s financial statements.

Contingent Obligations

The Company is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other
factors and conditions that potentially subject it to environmental, litigation, income tax, and
other risks. See “FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL” herein and Note 3 to the financial statements for
more information regarding certain of these contingencies. The Company periodically evaluates
its exposure to such risks and records reserves for those matters where a loss is considered
probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or conditions that can
be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially affect the
Company’s financial statements. These events or conditions include the following:

•

Changes in existing state or federal regulation by governmental
authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality,
control of toxic substances, hazardous and solid wastes, and other
environmental matters.

•

Changes in existing income tax regulations or changes in Internal
Revenue Service interpretations of existing regulations.

•

Identification of additional sites that require environmental
remediation or the filing of other complaints in which the Company may
be asserted to be a potentially responsible party.

II-86


MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2004 Annual Report

•

Identification and evaluation of other potential lawsuits or
complaints in which the Company may be named as a defendant.

•

Resolution or progression of existing matters through the legislative
process, the court systems, or the EPA.

Unbilled Revenues

Revenues related to the sale of electricity are recorded when electricity is delivered to
customers. However, the determination of KWH sales to individual customers is based on the reading
of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each
month, amounts of electricity delivered to customers, but not yet metered and billed, are
estimated. Components of the unbilled revenue estimates include total KWH territorial supply,
total KWH billed, estimated total electricity lost in delivery, and customer usage. These
components can fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including weather, generation patterns,
power delivery volume, and other operational constraints. These factors can be unpredictable and
can vary from historical trends. As a result, the overall estimate of unbilled revenues could be
significantly affected, which could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations.

New Accounting Standards

On March 31, 2004, the Company prospectively adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities, which requires the primary beneficiary of a variable interest
entity to consolidate the related assets and liabilities. The adoption of FASB Interpretation
No. 46R had no impact on the Company’s net income. However, as a result of the adoption, the
Company deconsolidated certain wholly-owned trusts established to issue preferred securities
since the Company does not meet the definition of primary beneficiary established by FASB
Interpretation No. 46R. See Note 1 to the financial statements under “Variable Interest
Entities” for additional information.

In the third quarter 2004, the Company prospectively adopted FASB Staff Position (FSP)
106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act). The Medicare Act provides a 28
percent prescription drug subsidy for Medicare eligible retirees. FSP 106-2 requires recognition
of the impacts of the Medicare Act in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO)
and future cost of service for postretirement medical plans. The effect of the subsidy reduced
the Company’s expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2004 by approximately $3.2 million
and is expected to have a similar impact on future expenses. The subsidy’s impact on the
postretirement medical plan APBO was a reduction of approximately $59.8 million. However, the
ultimate impact on future periods is subject to final interpretation of the federal regulations
which were published on January 21, 2005. See Note 2 to the financial statements under
“Postretirement Benefits” for additional information.

FASB Statement No. 123R, Share-Based Payment was issued in December 2004. This statement
requires that compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions be recognized in
financial statements. That cost will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the
equity or liability instruments issued. For the Company, this statement is effective beginning
on July 1, 2005. Although the compensation expense calculation required under the revised
statement differs slightly, the impact on the Company’s financial statements are expected to be
similar to the pro forma disclosures included in Note 1 to the financial statements under “Stock
Options.”

See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “Income Tax Matters — American Jobs Creation Act of 2004”
herein for information regarding the adoption of new tax legislation. In December 2004, the
FASB issued FSP 109-1, Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to
the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities provided by the American Jobs Creation Act
of 2004, which requires that the generation deduction be accounted for as a special tax
deduction rather than as a tax rate reduction. The Company is currently assessing the Jobs Act
and this pronouncement, as well as the related regulatory treatment, but currently does not
expect a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

The Company’s financial condition continued to be strong at December 31, 2004. Net cash flow from
operating activities totaled $1.0 billion, $1.1 billion, and $973 million for 2004, 2003, and 2002,
respectively. The $107 million decrease for 2004 in operating activities primarily relates to an
increase in under recovered fuel cost and storm damage costs related to Hurricane Ivan. These
increases were partially offset by the deferral of income tax liabilities arising from accelerated
depreciation

II-87


MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2004 Annual Report

deductions. Fuel costs are recoverable in future periods and are reflected on the balance sheets
as under recovered regulatory clause revenues. The $145 million increase from 2002 to 2003 resulted
from the deferral of income tax liabilities arising from accelerated depreciation deductions offset
by the settlement of interest rate hedges.

Significant balance sheet changes include the $478 million increase in long-term debt for 2004
primarily due to the replacement of debt due within one year with long-term debt, and an increase
of $412 million in gross plant.

The Company’s ratio of common equity to total capitalization — including short-term debt —
was 42.6 percent in 2004, 43.3 percent in 2003, and 42.6 percent in 2002. See Note 6 to the
financial statements for additional information.

Sources of Capital

The Company plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from sources
similar to those used in the past, which were primarily from operating cash flows. However, the
type and timing of any financings — if needed — will depend on market conditions and regulatory
approval. In recent years, financings primarily have utilized unsecured debt, preferred stock, and
preferred securities.

Security issuances are subject to regulatory approval by the Alabama PSC. Additionally, with
respect to the public offering of securities, the Company must file registration statements with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (1933
Act). The amounts of securities authorized by the Alabama PSC, as well as the amounts registered
under the 1933 Act, are continuously monitored and appropriate filings are made to ensure
flexibility in the capital markets.

The Company obtains financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. The
Southern Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of
the Company are not commingled with funds of any other company. In accordance with the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended (PUHCA), most loans between affiliated companies
must be approved in advance by the SEC.

The Company’s current liabilities frequently exceed current assets because of the continued
use of short-term debt as a funding source to meet cash needs which can fluctuate significantly due
to the seasonality of the business.

To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the Company has various internal and external
sources of liquidity. At the beginning of 2005, the Company had approximately $84 million of cash
and cash equivalents and $868 million of unused credit arrangements with banks. In addition, the
Company has substantial cash flow from operating activities and access to the capital markets,
including commercial paper programs, to meet liquidity needs.

The Company maintains committed lines of credit in the amount of $868 million of which $643
million will expire at various times during 2005. $225 million of the credit facilities expiring
in 2005 allow for the execution of term loans for an additional two-year period, and $245 million
allow for the execution of one-year term loans. See Note 6 to the financial statements under “Bank
Credit Arrangements” for additional information.

The Company may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company subsidiary
organized to issue and sell commercial paper and extendible commercial notes at the request and for
the benefit of the Company and the other Southern Company retail operating companies. Proceeds
from such issuances for the benefit of the Company are loaned directly to the Company and are not
commingled with proceeds from such issuances for the benefit of any other retail operating company.
The obligations of each company under these arrangements are several and there is no cross
affiliate credit support.

At December 31, 2004, the Company had no commercial paper or extendible commercial notes
outstanding.

Financing Activities

During 2004, the Company issued $900 million of long-term debt and $100 million of preferred
stock. In addition, the Company issued 1 million new shares of common stock to Southern Company
at $40.00 a share and realized proceeds of $40 million. The proceeds of these issues were used
to redeem or repay at maturity long-term debt, to repay short-term indebtedness, and for other
general corporate purposes.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Credit Rating Risk

The Company does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment
schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. However, the Company is party
to certain derivative agreements that could require collateral and/or accelerated payment in the
event of a credit rating change to below investment grade. These agreements are primarily for
natural gas price and interest rate risk management activities. At December 31, 2004, the
Company’s maximum potential exposure to these contracts was $9.8 million.

Market Price Risk

Due to cost-based rate regulations, the Company has limited exposure to market volatility in
interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity. To manage the volatility
attributable to these exposures, the Company nets the exposures to take advantage of natural
offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to the
Company’s policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and risk management practices. Company
policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and mandates strict
adherence to all applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are monitored using
techniques including, but not limited to, market valuation, value at risk, stress testing, and
sensitivity analysis.

To mitigate exposure to interest rates, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps that
have been designated as hedges. The weighted average interest rate on outstanding variable
long-term debt that has not been hedged at January 1, 2005 was 2.57 percent. If the Company
sustained a 100 basis point change in interest rates for all unhedged variable rate long-term debt,
the change would affect annualized interest expense by approximately $2.5 million at January 1,
2005. The Company is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly affect such
exposures in the near term. For further information, see Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements
under “Financial Instruments.”

To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the Company enters
into fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale
electricity market and, to a lesser extent, into similar contracts for gas purchases. The Company
has implemented fuel hedging programs at the instruction of the Alabama PSC.

In addition, the Company’s Rate ECR allows the recovery of specific costs associated with the
sales of natural gas that become necessary due to operating considerations at the Company’s
electric generating facilities. Rate ECR also allows recovery of the cost of financial instruments
used for hedging market price risk up to 75 percent of the budgeted annual amount of natural gas
purchases. The Company may not engage in natural gas hedging activities that extend beyond a
rolling 42-month window. Also, the premiums paid for natural gas financial options may not exceed
5 percent of the Company’s natural gas budget for that year.

At December 31, 2004, exposure from these activities was not material to the Company’s
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The fair value changes in energy related
derivative contracts and year-end valuations were as follows at December 31:

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2004 Annual Report

Unrealized gains and losses from mark to market adjustments on derivative contracts related to
the Company’s fuel hedging programs are recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities. Realized
gains and losses from these programs are included in fuel expense and are recovered through the
Company’s fuel cost recovery clause. Gains and losses on derivative contracts that are not
designated as hedges are recognized in the income statement as incurred. At December 31, 2004, the
fair value of derivative energy contracts was reflected in the financial statements as follows:

Unrealized pre-tax gains (losses) on energy contracts recognized in income in 2004 and 2003
were not material. For 2002, pre-tax losses of $2.0 million were recognized in income. The
Company is exposed to market price risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the
derivative energy contracts. The Company’s policy is to enter into agreements with counterparties
that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s or with counterparties
who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. Therefore, the Company does not
anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the counterparties. For additional
information, see Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements under “Financial Instruments.”

Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations

The construction program of the Company is currently estimated to be $902 million for 2005, $921
million for 2006, and $1.0 billion for 2007. Over the next three years, the Company estimates
spending $913 million on environmental related additions (including $276 million on selective
catalytic reduction facilities), $238 million on Plant Farley (including $177 million for nuclear
fuel), $767 million on distribution facilities, and $411 million on transmission additions. See
Note 7 to the financial statements under “Construction Program” for additional details.

Actual construction costs may vary from this estimate because of changes in such factors as:
business conditions; environmental regulations; nuclear plant
regulations; FERC rules and transmission regulations; load projections; the cost and efficiency of
construction labor, equipment, and materials; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be
no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered.

In addition to the funds required for the Company’s construction program, approximately $1.4
billion will be required by the end of 2007 for maturities of long-term debt. The Company plans to
continue, when economically feasible, to retire higher cost securities and replace these
obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit.

As a result of requirements by the NRC, the Company has established external trust funds for
the purpose of funding nuclear decommissioning costs. Annual provisions for nuclear
decommissioning are based on an annuity method as approved by the Alabama PSC. The amount expensed
in 2004 was $18 million. For additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements under
“Nuclear Decommissioning.” Additionally, as discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements under
“Fuel Costs,” in 1993 the DOE implemented a special assessment over a 15-year period on utilities
with nuclear plants to be used for the decontamination and decommissioning of its nuclear fuel
enrichment facilities.

The Company has also established an external trust fund for postretirement benefits as ordered
by the Alabama PSC. The cumulative effect of funding these items over a long period will diminish
internally funded capital for other purposes and may require the Company to seek capital from other
sources. For additional information, see Note 2 to the financial statements under “Postretirement
Benefits.”

Other funding requirements related to obligations associated with scheduled maturities of
long-term debt and preferred securities, as well as the related interest, preferred stock
dividends, leases, and other purchase commitments, are as follows. See Notes 1, 6, and 7 to the
financial statements for additional information.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2004 Annual Report

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

The Company’s 2004 Annual Report contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking
statements include, among other things, statements concerning retail sales growth and retail
rates, storm damage cost recovery, environmental regulations and expenditures, the Company’s
projections for postretirement benefit trust contributions, and estimated construction and other
expenditures. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such
as “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,”
“projects,” “predicts,” “potential,” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other
similar terminology. There are various factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements; accordingly, there can be no
assurance that such indicated results will be realized. These factors include:

•

the impact of recent and future federal and state regulatory change, including legislative and
regulatory initiatives regarding deregulation and restructuring of the electric utility
industry, and also changes in environmental, tax, and other laws and regulations to which the
Company is subject, as well as changes in application of existing laws and regulations;

•

current and future litigation, regulatory investigations, proceedings or inquiries, including
the pending EPA civil action against the Company;

•

the effects, extent, and timing of the entry of additional competition in the markets in which
the Company operates;

•

variations in demand for electricity and gas, including those relating to weather, the general
economy and population
and business growth (and declines);

•

available sources and costs of fuels;

•

ability to control costs;

•

investment performance of the Company’s employee benefit plans;

•

advances in technology;

•

state and federal rate regulations and the impact of pending and future rate cases and negotiations;

•

internal restructuring or other restructuring options that may be pursued;

•

potential business strategies, including acquisitions or dispositions of assets or businesses,
which cannot be assured to be
completed or beneficial to the Company;

•

the ability of counterparties of the Company to make payments as and when due;

•

the ability to obtain new short- and long-term contracts with neighboring utilities;

•

the direct or indirect effect on the Company’s business resulting from terrorist incidents and the threat of
terrorist incidents;

•

interest rate fluctuations and financial market conditions and the results of financing efforts, including the
Company’s credit ratings;

•

the ability of the Company to obtain additional generating capacity at competitive prices;

•

catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, hurricanes, or other similar occurrences;

•

the direct or indirect effects on the Company’s business resulting from incidents similar to the August 2003
power outage in the Northeast;

•

the effect of accounting pronouncements issued periodically by standard-setting bodies; and

•

other factors discussed elsewhere herein and in other reports (including the Form 10-K) filed
by the Company from time to time by the Company with the SEC.

The Company expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Alabama Power Company 2004 Annual Report

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General

Alabama Power Company (the Company) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company, which is the
parent company of five retail operating companies, Southern Power Company (Southern Power),
Southern Company Services (SCS), Southern Communications Services (SouthernLINC Wireless), Southern
Company Gas (Southern Company GAS), Southern Company Holdings (Southern Holdings), Southern Nuclear
Operating Company (Southern Nuclear), Southern Telecom, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries.
The retail operating companies — the Company, Georgia Power Company, Gulf Power Company,
Mississippi Power Company, and Savannah Electric and Power Company — provide electric service in
four Southeastern states. The Company operates as a vertically integrated utility providing
electricity to retail customers within its traditional service area located within the State of
Alabama and to wholesale customers in the Southeast. Southern Power constructs, owns, and manages
Southern Company’s competitive generation assets and sells electricity at market-based rates in the
wholesale market. Contracts among the retail operating companies and Southern Power — related to
jointly-owned generating facilities, interconnecting transmission lines, or the exchange of
electric power — are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and/or the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). SCS — the system service company — provides, at cost,
specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. SouthernLINC Wireless
provides digital wireless communications services to the retail operating companies and also
markets these services to the public within the Southeast. Southern Telecom provides fiber cable
services within the Southeast. Southern Company GAS is a competitive retail natural gas marketer
serving customers in Georgia. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding subsidiary for Southern
Company’s investments in synthetic fuels and leveraged leases and various other energy-related
businesses. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to Southern Company’s nuclear power
plants, including the Company’s Plant Farley.

The equity method is used for subsidiaries in which the Company has significant influence but
does not control and for variable interest entities where the Company is not the primary
beneficiary. Certain prior years’ data presented in the financial statements have been
reclassified to conform with current year presentation.

Southern Company is registered as a holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, as amended (PUHCA). Both Southern Company and its subsidiaries are subject to the
regulatory provisions of the PUHCA. In addition, the Company is subject to regulation by the FERC
and the Alabama Public Service Commission (Alabama PSC). The Company follows accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States and complies with the accounting policies and practices
prescribed by its regulatory commissions. The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the use of estimates,
and the actual results may differ from those estimates.

Affiliate Transactions

The Company has an agreement with SCS under which the following services are rendered to the
Company at direct or allocated cost: general and design engineering, purchasing, accounting and
statistical analysis, finance and treasury, tax, information resources, marketing, auditing,
insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, and other services
with respect to business and operations and power pool transactions. Costs for these services
amounted to $224 million, $217 million, and $218 million during 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.
Cost allocation methodologies used by SCS are approved by the SEC and management believes they are
reasonable.

The Company has an agreement with Southern Nuclear under which Southern Nuclear operates the
Company’s Plant Farley and provides the following nuclear-related services at cost: general
executive and advisory services, general operations, management and technical services,
administrative services including procurement, accounting, statistical analysis, employee
relations, and other services with respect to business and operations. Costs for these services
amounted to $169 million, $153 million, and $154 million during 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

The Company jointly owns Plant Greene County with Mississippi Power. The Company has an
agreement with Mississippi Power under which the Company operates Plant Greene County, and
Mississippi Power reimburses the Company for its proportionate share of expenses which were $7.2
million in 2004, $6.6 million in 2003, and $6.4 million in 2002. See Note 4 for additional
information.

II-100


NOTES (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2004 Annual Report

Southern Company holds a 30 percent ownership interest in Alabama Fuel Products, LLC (AFP),
which produces synthetic fuel. The Company has an agreement with an indirect subsidiary of
Southern Company that provides services for AFP. Under this agreement, the Company provides
certain accounting functions, including processing and paying fuel transportation invoices, and the
Company is reimbursed for its expenses. Amounts billed under this agreement totaled approximately
$28.7 million, $27.5 million, and $34.5 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In addition,
the Company purchases synthetic fuel from AFP for use at several of the Company’s plants. Fuel
purchases for 2004, 2003, and 2002 totaled $236.9 million, $209.2 million, and $211.0 million,
respectively.

In June 2003, the Company entered into an agreement with Southern Power under which the
Company operates and maintains Plant Harris at cost. In 2004 and 2003, the Company billed Southern
Power $1.8 million and $0.8 million, respectively, for operation and maintenance. Under a power
purchase agreement (PPA) with Southern Power, the Company’s purchased power costs from Plant Harris
in 2004 and 2003 totaled $59.0 million and $41.7 million, respectively. The Company also provides
the fuel, at cost, associated with the PPA and the fuel cost recognized by the Company in 2004 was
$65.7 million and $33.9 million in 2003. Additionally, the Company recorded $8.3 million of
prepaid capacity expenses included in Other Deferred Charges and Other Assets on the balance sheets
at December 31, 2004 and 2003. See Note 3 under “Retail Rate Adjustment Procedures” and Note 7
under “Purchased Power Commitments” for additional information.

The Company has an agreement with SouthernLINC Wireless to provide digital wireless
communications services to the Company. Costs for these services amounted to $5.3 million, $4.9
million, and $4.4 million during 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

Also, see Note 4 for information regarding the Company’s ownership in and PPA with Southern
Electric Generating Company (SEGCO) and Note 5 for information on certain deferred tax liabilities
due to affiliates.

The retail operating companies, including the Company, Southern Power, and Southern Company
GAS jointly enter into various types of wholesale energy, natural gas, and certain other contracts,
either directly or through SCS as agent. Each participating company may be jointly and severally
liable for the obligations incurred under these agreements.

Fuel Costs

Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is used. Fuel expense includes the cost of purchased emission
allowances as they are used. Fuel expense also includes the amortization of the cost of nuclear
fuel and a charge, based on nuclear generation, for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel.
Total charges for nuclear fuel included in fuel expense amounted to $61 million in 2004, $64
million in 2003, and $63 million in 2002. The Company has a contract with the U.S. Department of
Energy (DOE) that provides for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to
begin disposing of spent nuclear fuel in 1998 as required by the contract, and the Company is
pursuing legal remedies against the government for breach of contract. Sufficient pool storage
capacity for spent fuel is available at Plant Farley to maintain full-core discharge capability
until the refueling outage scheduled in 2006 for Plant Farley Unit 1 and the refueling outage
scheduled in 2008 for Plant Farley Unit 2. Construction of an on-site dry spent fuel storage
facility at Plant Farley is in progress and scheduled for operation in 2005. The onsite storage
facility is expected to provide adequate spent fuel storage through 2015 for both units and can be expanded
to provide storage through 2025. See Note 7 under “Construction Program” for additional
information.

Also, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 established a Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and
Decommissioning Fund, which is funded in part by a special assessment on utilities with nuclear
plants. This assessment is being paid over a 15-year period, which began in 1993. This fund will
be used by the DOE for the decontamination and decommissioning of
its nuclear fuel enrichment
facilities. The law provides that utilities will recover these payments in the same manner as any
other fuel expense. The Company estimates its remaining liability at December 31, 2004 under this
law to be approximately $9 million.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

The Company is subject to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement
No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. Regulatory assets represent
probable future revenues associated with certain costs that are expected to be recovered from
customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future
reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are

In the event that a portion of the Company’s operations is no longer subject to the
provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, the Company would be required to write off related regulatory
assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable through regulated rates. In addition,
the Company would be required to determine if any impairment to other assets exists, including
plant, and write down the assets, if impaired, to their fair values. All regulatory assets and
liabilities are currently reflected in rates.

Revenues

Energy and other revenues are recognized as services are provided. Capacity revenues are generally
recognized on a levelized basis over the appropriate contract periods. Unbilled revenues are
accrued at the end of each fiscal period. Electric rates for the Company include provisions to
adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, fuel hedging, the energy component of purchased
power costs, and certain other costs. Revenues are adjusted for differences between the actual
recoverable costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates.

The Company has a diversified base of customers. No single customer or industry comprises 10
percent or more of revenues. For all periods presented, uncollectible accounts averaged less than
1 percent of revenues.

Income Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provides deferred
income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences. Investment tax credits utilized
are deferred and amortized to income over the average life of the related property.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation of the original cost of depreciable utility plant in service is provided primarily by
using composite straight-line rates, which approximated 3.0 percent in 2004, 3.1 percent in 2003,
and 3.2 percent in 2002. When property subject to depreciation is retired or otherwise disposed of
in the normal course of business, its original cost — together with the cost of removal, less
salvage — is charged to accumulated depreciation. Minor items of property included in the
original cost of the plant are retired when the related property unit is retired.

Asset Retirement Obligations

and Other Costs of Removal

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations. Statement No. 143 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for
legal obligations associated with the ultimate costs of retiring long-lived assets. The present
value of the ultimate costs of an asset’s future retirement is recorded in the period in which
the liability is incurred. The costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and
depreciated over the asset’s useful life. Although Statement No. 143 does not permit the
continued accrual of future

II-102


NOTES (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2004 Annual Report

retirement costs for long-lived assets that the Company does not have
a legal obligation to retire, the Company has received accounting guidance from the Alabama PSC
allowing such treatment. Accordingly, the accumulated removal costs for other obligations
previously accrued will continue to be reflected on the balance sheets as a regulatory liability.
Therefore, the Company had no cumulative effect to net income resulting from the adoption of
Statement No. 143.

The liability recognized to retire long-lived assets primarily relates to the Company’s
nuclear facility, Plant Farley. The fair value of assets legally restricted for settling
retirement obligations related to nuclear facilities as of December 31, 2004 was $446 million.
In addition, the Company has retirement obligations related to various landfill sites and
underground storage tanks. The Company has also identified retirement obligations related to
certain transmission and distribution facilities, co-generation facilities, certain wireless
communication towers, and certain structures authorized by the United States Army Corps of
Engineers. However, liabilities for the removal of these transmission and distribution assets
have not been recorded because no reasonable estimate can be made regarding the timing of the
obligations. The Company will continue to recognize in the statements of income allowed removal
costs in accordance with its regulatory treatment. Any difference between costs recognized
under Statement No. 143 and those reflected in rates are recognized as either a regulatory asset
or liability, as ordered by the Alabama PSC, and are reflected in the balance sheets. See
“Nuclear Decommissioning” herein for further information on amounts included in rates.

Nuclear Decommissioning

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requires licensees of commercial nuclear power reactors to
establish a plan for providing reasonable assurance of funds for future decommissioning. The
Company has established external trust funds to comply with the NRC’s regulations. The funds set
aside for decommissioning are managed and invested in accordance with applicable requirements of
various regulatory bodies, including the NRC, the FERC, and the Alabama PSC, as well as the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Funds are invested in a tax efficient manner in a diversified mix
of equity and fixed income securities. Equity securities typically range from 50 to 75 percent of
the funds and fixed income securities from 25 to 50 percent. Amounts previously recorded in
internal reserves are being transferred into the external trust funds over periods approved by the
Alabama PSC. The NRC’s minimum external funding requirements are based on a generic estimate of
the cost to decommission only the radioactive portions of a nuclear unit based on the size and type
of reactor. The Company has filed plans with the NRC to ensure that — over time — the deposits
and earnings of the external trust funds will provide the minimum funding amounts prescribed by the
NRC.

Site study cost is the estimate to decommission the facility as of the site study year. The
estimated costs of decommissioning, based on the most current study as of December 31, 2004, for
Plant Farley were as follows:

Decommissioning periods:

Beginning year


Completion year


(in millions)

Site study costs:

The decommissioning cost estimates are based on prompt dismantlement and removal of the plant
from service. The actual decommissioning costs may vary from the above estimates because of
changes in the assumed date of decommissioning, changes in NRC requirements, or changes in the
assumptions used in making these estimates.

II-103


NOTES (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2004 Annual Report

Annual provisions for nuclear decommissioning are based on an annuity method as approved by
the Alabama PSC. The amount expensed in 2004 and fund balances were as follows:

(in millions)

Accumulated provisions:

All of the Company’s decommissioning costs for ratemaking are based on the site study. The
Company expects the Alabama PSC to periodically review and adjust, if necessary, the amounts paid
into the reserve and deposited into external trusts. Significant assumptions used to determine
these costs for ratemaking were an inflation rate of 4.5 percent and a trust earnings rate of 7.0
percent.

The Company filed an application with the NRC in September 2003 to extend the operating
license for Plant Farley for an additional 20 years. The NRC is expected to rule on the
application by July 2005. If the NRC approves the extension, the annual provision for nuclear
decommissioning could decrease, subject to Alabama PSC approval.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC)

In accordance with regulatory treatment, the Company records AFUDC. AFUDC represents the estimated
debt and equity costs of capital funds that are necessary to finance the construction of new
regulated facilities. While cash is not realized currently from such allowance, it increases the
revenue requirement over the service life of the plant through a higher rate base and higher
depreciation expense. All current construction costs are included in retail rates. The composite
rate used to determine the amount of AFUDC was 8.6 percent in 2004, 9.0 percent in 2003, and 8.2
percent in 2002. AFUDC, net of income tax, as a percent of net income after dividends on preferred
stock was 4.2 percent in 2004, 3.5 percent in 2003, and 3.3 percent in 2002.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost less regulatory disallowances and
impairments. Original cost includes: materials; labor; minor items of property; appropriate
administrative and general costs; payroll-related costs such as taxes, pensions, and other
benefits; and the interest capitalized and/or cost of funds used during construction.

The cost of replacements of property — exclusive of minor items of property — is
capitalized. The cost of maintenance, repairs and replacement of minor items of property is
charged to maintenance expense as incurred or performed with the exception of nuclear refueling
costs, which are recorded in accordance with specific Alabama PSC orders. The Company accrues
estimated refueling costs in advance of the unit’s next refueling outage. The refueling cycle is
18 months for each unit. During 2004, the Company accrued $22.6 million to the nuclear refueling
outage reserve and at December 31, 2004 the reserve balance was a regulatory asset of $0.6 million.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles

The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of
whether an impairment has occurred is based on either a specific regulatory disallowance or an
estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared with the
carrying value of the assets. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment
recognized is determined by either the amount of the regulatory disallowance or by estimating the
fair value of the assets and recording a provision for loss if the carrying value is greater than
the fair value. For assets identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the
estimated fair value less the cost to sell in order to determine if an impairment provision is
required. Until the assets are disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when
circumstances or events change.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are considered cash
equivalents. Temporary cash investments are securities with original maturities of 90 days or
less.

II-104


NOTES (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2004 Annual Report

Materials and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include the average cost of transmission, distribution, and
generating plant materials. Materials are charged to inventory when purchased and then expensed or
capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when installed.

Natural Disaster Reserve

In accordance with an Alabama PSC order, the Company has established a natural disaster reserve to


cover the cost of uninsured damages from major storms to transmission and distribution lines and to
generation facilities and other property. The Company is allowed to accrue $250 thousand per month
until the maximum accumulated provision of $32 million is attained. Higher accruals to restore the
reserve to its authorized level are allowed whenever the balance in the reserve declines below
$22.4 million. During 2004, the Company accrued $9.9 million, including an additional amount of
$6.9 million, to the reserve and at December 31, 2004, the reserve balance was a regulatory asset
of $37.7 million. See Note 3 under “Natural Disaster Cost Recovery” for further information.

Environmental Cost Recovery

The Company must comply with environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling and
disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations,
the Company may also incur substantial costs to clean up properties. The Company has received
authority from the Alabama PSC to recover approved environmental compliance costs through specific
retail rate clauses. Within limits approved by the Alabama PSC, these rates are adjusted annually.
See Note 3 under “Retail Regulatory Matters” for additional information.

Stock Options

Southern Company provides non-qualified stock options to a large segment of the Company’s employees
ranging from line management to executives. The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation
plans in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25. Accordingly, no compensation
expense has been recognized because the exercise price of all options granted equaled the
fair-market value of Southern Company’s common stock on the date of grant. When options are
exercised, the Company receives a capital contribution from Southern Company equivalent to the
related income tax benefit.

Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to fluctuations in interest
rates, the prices of certain fuel purchases, and electricity purchases and sales. All derivative
financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair
value. Substantially all of the Company’s bulk energy purchases and sales contracts that meet the
definition of a derivative are exempt from fair value accounting requirements and are accounted for
under the accrual method. Other derivative contracts qualify as cash flow hedges of anticipated
transactions. This results in the deferral of related gains and losses in other comprehensive
income or regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate until the hedged transactions occur. Any
ineffectiveness is recognized currently in net income. Other derivative contracts are marked to
market through current period income and are recorded on a net basis in the statements of income.

The Company is exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of
counterparties’ nonperformance. The Company has established controls to determine and monitor the
creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate the Company’s exposure to counterparty
credit risk.

payable to affiliated trusts.

Comprehensive Income

The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of all changes in common stock equity
of an enterprise that result from transactions and other economic events of the period other than
transactions with owners. Comprehensive income consists of net income, changes in the fair value
of qualifying cash flow hedges and marketable securities, and changes in additional minimum pension
liability, less income taxes and reclassifications for amounts included in net income.

Variable Interest Entities

On March 31, 2004, the Company prospectively adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46R, “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities,” which requires the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity
to consolidate the related assets and liabilities. The adoption of Interpretation No. 46R had no
impact on the net income of the Company. However, as a result of the adoption, the Company
deconsolidated certain wholly-owned trusts established to issue preferred securities since the
Company is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts. Therefore, the investments in these trusts
are reflected as Other Investments, and the related loans from the trusts are reflected as
Long-term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts on the balance sheets. This treatment resulted in a $9
million increase in both total assets and total liabilities as of March 31, 2004.

2. RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company has a defined benefit, trusteed, pension plan covering substantially all employees.
The plan is funded in accordance with Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
(ERISA), requirements. No contributions to the plan are expected for the year ending December 31,
2005. The Company also provides certain non-qualified benefit plans for a selected group of
management and highly-compensated employees. Benefits under these non-qualified plans are funded
on a cash basis. In addition, the Company provides certain medical care and life insurance
benefits for retired employees. The Company funds trusts to the extent required by the Alabama
PSC. For the year ended December 31, 2005, postretirement trust contributions are expected to
total approximately $25.3 million.

The measurement date for plan assets and obligations is September 30 for each year.

Pension Plans

The accumulated benefit obligation for the pension plans was $1.21 billion in 2004 and $1.10
billion in 2003. Changes during the year in the projected benefit obligations, accumulated benefit
obligations, and fair value of plan assets were as follows:

In the third quarter 2004, the Company prospectively adopted FASB Staff Position (FSP)
106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Medicare Act). The Medicare Act provides a 28
percent prescription drug subsidy for Medicare eligible retirees. FSP 106-2 requires recognition
of the impacts of the Medicare Act in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO)
and future cost of service for postretirement medical plans. The effect of the subsidy reduced
the Company’s expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2004 by approximately $3.2 million
and is expected to have a similar impact on future expenses. The subsidy’s impact on the
postretirement medical plan APBO was a reduction of approximately $59.8 million. However, the
ultimate impact on future periods is subject to federal regulations governing the subsidy
created in the Medicare Act which are being finalized.

Future benefit payments, including prescription drug benefits, reflect expected future service
and are estimated based on assumptions used to measure the accumulated benefit obligation for the
postretirement plans. Estimated benefit payments are reduced by drug subsidy receipts expected as
a result of the Medicare Act as follows:

An additional assumption used in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations
was a weighted average medical care cost trend rate of 11 percent for 2004, decreasing gradually to
5 percent through the year 2012, and remaining at that level thereafter. An annual increase or
decrease in the assumed medical care cost trend rate of 1 percent would affect the

3. CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY MATTERS

General Litigation Matters

The Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of
business. In addition, the Company’s business activities are subject to extensive governmental
regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation over environmental issues and
claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, and citizen enforcement of
environmental requirements, has increased generally throughout the United States. In particular,
personal injury claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become
more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such litigation against the Company cannot be predicted at
this time; however, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such
current proceedings would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements.

Environmental Matters

New Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil action in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against the Company. The complaint alleged
violations of the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act and related state laws
with respect to coal-fired generating facilities at the Company’s Plants Miller, Barry, and Gorgas.
The EPA concurrently issued to the Company a notice of violation relating to these specific
facilities, as well as Plants Greene County and Gaston. In early 2000, the EPA filed a motion to
amend its complaint to add the violations alleged in its notice of violation.

The U.S. District Court in Georgia subsequently granted the Company’s motion to dismiss for
lack of jurisdiction in Georgia. In March 2001, the court granted the EPA’s motion to add
Savannah Electric as a defendant. As directed by the court, the EPA refiled its amended
complaint limiting claims to those brought against Georgia Power and Savannah Electric. In
addition, the EPA refiled its claims against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Alabama. These civil complaints allege violations with respect to eight
coal-fired generating facilities in Alabama and Georgia, and they request penalties and
injunctive relief, including an order requiring the installation of the best available control
technology at the affected units. The EPA has not refiled against Gulf Power or Mississippi
Power.

The actions against the Company, Georgia Power, and Savannah Electric were effectively
stayed in the spring of 2001 during the appeal of a similar NSR enforcement action against the
Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. In
June 2003, the Court of Appeals issued its ruling in the TVA case, dismissing the appeal for
reasons unrelated to the issues in the cases pending against the Company, Georgia Power, and
Savannah Electric. In May 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the EPA’s petition for review of
the case. In June 2004, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama lifted the
stay in the action against Alabama Power, placing the case back onto the Court’s active docket.
At this time, no party to the case against Georgia Power and Savannah Electric has sought to
reopen that case, which remains administratively closed in the District Court for the Northern
District of Georgia.

Since the inception of the NSR proceedings against the Company, Georgia Power, and Savannah
Electric, the EPA has also been proceeding with similar NSR enforcement actions against other
utilities, involving many of the same legal issues. In each case, the EPA alleged that the
utilities failed to comply with the NSR permitting requirements when performing maintenance and
construction activities at coal-burning plants, which activities the utilities considered to be
routine or otherwise not subject to NSR. District courts addressing these cases have, to date,
issued opinions that reached conflicting conclusions.

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act
authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $32,500 per day, per violation at each generating
unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in any one of these cases
could require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could
possibly require payment of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of operations,
cash flows, and possibly financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated
rates.

II-109


NOTES (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2004 Annual Report

In December 2002 and October 2003, the EPA issued final revisions to its NSR regulations under
the Clean Air Act. The December 2002 revisions included changes to the regulatory exclusions and
the methods of calculating emissions increases. The October 2003 regulations clarified the scope
of the existing Routine Maintenance, Repair, and Replacement (RMRR) exclusion. A coalition of
states and environmental organizations has filed petitions for review of these revisions with the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The October 2003 RMRR rules have been
stayed by the Court of Appeals pending its review of the rules. In any event, the final
regulations must be adopted by the State of Alabama in order to apply to the Company’s facilities.
The effect of these final regulations, related legal challenges, and potential state rulemakings
cannot be determined at this time.

Generation Interconnection Agreements

In July 2003, the FERC issued its final rule on the standardization of generation interconnection
agreements and procedures (Order 2003). Order 2003 shifts much of the financial burden of new
transmission investment from the generator to the transmission provider. The FERC has indicated
that Order 2003, which was effective January 20, 2004, is to be applied prospectively to
interconnection agreements. Subsidiaries of Tenaska, Inc., as counterparties to two previously
executed interconnection agreements with the Company, have filed complaints at the FERC requesting
that the FERC modify the agreements and that the Company refund a total of $11 million previously
paid for interconnection facilities, with interest. The Company has also received similar requests
from other entities totaling $2.5 million. The Company has opposed such relief, and the
proceedings are still pending. The impact of Order 2003 and its subsequent rehearings on the
Company and the final results of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Market-Based Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to nonaffiliates at market-based
prices. Through SCS, as agent, the Company also has FERC authority to make short-term
opportunity sales at market rates. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a
market-based contract with an affiliate. In November 2001, the FERC modified the test it uses
to consider utilities’ applications to charge market-based rates and adopted a new test called
the Supply Margin Assessment (SMA). The FERC applied the SMA to several utilities, including
Southern Company, the retail operating companies, and Southern Power, and found them and others
to be “pivotal suppliers” in their retail service territories and ordered the implementation of
several mitigation measures. Southern Company and others sought rehearing of the FERC order,
and the FERC delayed the implementation of certain mitigation measures. In April 2004, the FERC
issued an order that abandoned the SMA test and adopted a new interim analysis for measuring
generation market power. This new interim approach requires utilities to submit a pivotal
supplier screen and a wholesale market share screen. If the applicant does not pass both
screens, there will be a rebuttable presumption regarding generation market power. The FERC’s
order also sets forth procedures for rebutting these presumptions and addresses mitigation
measures for those entities that are found to have market power. In the absence of specific
mitigation measures, the order includes several cost-based mitigation measures that would apply
by default. The FERC also initiated a new rulemaking proceeding that, among other things, will
adopt a final methodology for assessing generation market power.

In July 2004, the FERC denied Southern Company’s request for rehearing, along with a number
of others, and reaffirmed the interim tests that it adopted in April. In August 2004, Southern
Company submitted a filing to the FERC that included results showing that Southern Company
passed the pivotal supplier screen for all markets and the wholesale market share screen for all
markets except the Southern Company retail service territory. Southern Company also submitted
other analyses to demonstrate that it lacks generation market power. On December 17, 2004, the
FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation dominance within its retail
service territory. The ability to charge market- based rates in other markets is not at issue.
As directed by this order, Southern Company submitted additional information on February 15,
2005 related to generation dominance in its retail service territory. Any new market based rate
transactions in Southern Company’s retail service territory entered into after February 27, 2005
will be subject to refund to the level of the default cost-based rates, pending the outcome of
the proceeding. Southern Company, along with other utilities, has also filed an appeal of the
FERC’s April and July 2004 orders with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit. The FERC has asked the court to dismiss the appeal on the grounds that it is
premature.

In the event that the FERC’s default mitigation measures are ultimately applied, the
Company may be required to charge cost-based rates for certain wholesale sales in Southern
Company’s retail service

II-110

territory, which may be lower than negotiated market-based rates. The final outcome of this
matter will depend on the form in which the final methodology for assessing generation market
power and mitigation rules may be ultimately adopted and cannot be determined at this time.

Natural Disaster Cost Recovery

In September 2004, Hurricane Ivan hit the Gulf Coast of Florida and Alabama and continued north
through the Company’s service territory causing substantial damage. The related costs charged to
the Company’s natural disaster reserve were $57.8 million. During 2004, the Company accrued $9.9
million to the reserve and at December 31, 2004, the reserve balance was a regulatory asset of
$37.7 million.

In February 2005, the Company requested and received Alabama PSC approval of an accounting
order that allows the Company to immediately return certain regulatory liabilities to the retail
customers. The order also allows the Company to simultaneously recover from customers an accrual
of approximately $45 million to offset the costs of Hurricane Ivan and restore the natural disaster
reserve. The combined effects of this order will have no impact on the Company’s net income in
2005.

Retail Regulatory Matters

The Alabama PSC has adopted a Rate Stabilization and Equalization plan (Rate RSE) that provides
for periodic annual adjustments based upon the Company’s earned return on end-of-period retail
common equity. Such annual adjustments are limited to 3 percent. Rates remain unchanged when
the return on common equity ranges between 13.0 percent and 14.5 percent. The Alabama PSC has
also approved a rate mechanism that provides for adjustments to recognize the placing of new
generating facilities in retail service and for the recovery of retail costs associated with
certificated purchased power agreements (Rate CNP). Both increases and decreases have been
placed into effect since the adoption of these rates.

In accordance with Rate RSE, a 2 percent increase in retail rates was effective in April
2002, amounting to an annual increase of $55 million. Also, to recover certificated purchased
power costs under Rate CNP, an increase of 2.6 percent in retail rates, or $79 million annually,
was effective July 2003. An additional increase of $25 million annually was effective July 2004
under Rate CNP for new certificated purchased power costs. In April 2005, an annual true-up
adjustment to Rate CNP will decrease retail rates by approximately 0.5 percent, or $18.5 million
annually.

In October 2004, the Alabama PSC approved a request by the Company to amend Rate CNP to
also provide for the recovery of retail costs associated with environmental laws and
regulations, effective in January 2005. In conjunction with the Alabama PSC’s approval, the
Company agreed to a moratorium until March 2007 on any retail rate increase under Rate RSE. Any
increase in March 2007 would be based upon the earned return on retail common equity at December
31, 2006 and would become effective with the April 2007 billing.

The Company’s fuel costs are recovered under Rate ECR (Energy Cost Recovery), which
provides for the addition of a fuel and energy cost factor to base rates. In April 2005, this
factor is scheduled to increase from its current level.

The ratemaking procedures will remain in effect until the Alabama PSC votes to modify or
discontinue them.

4. JOINT OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS

The Company and Georgia Power own equally all of the outstanding capital stock of SEGCO, which owns
electric generating units with a total rated capacity of 1,020 megawatts, as well as associated
transmission facilities. The capacity of these units is sold equally to the Company and Georgia
Power under a contract which, in substance, requires payments sufficient to provide for the
operating expenses, taxes, interest expense and a return on equity, whether or not SEGCO has any
capacity and energy available. The term of the contract extends automatically for two-year
periods, subject to either party’s right to cancel upon two year’s notice. The Company’s share of
purchased power totaled $86 million in 2004, $87 million in 2003, and $84 million in 2002 and is
included in “Purchased power from affiliates” in the statements of income. The Company accounts
for SEGCO using the equity method on the balance sheets.

In addition the Company has guaranteed unconditionally the obligation of SEGCO under an
installment sale agreement for the purchase of certain pollution control facilities at SEGCO’s
generating units, pursuant to which $24.5 million principal amount of pollution control revenue
bonds are outstanding. Also, the Company has guaranteed $50 million principal amount of unsecured
senior notes issued by SEGCO for general corporate purposes. Georgia Power has agreed to reimburse

II-111


NOTES (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2004 Annual Report

the Company for the pro rata portion of such obligations corresponding to its then proportionate
ownership of stock of SEGCO if the Company is called upon to make such payment under its guaranty.

At December 31, 2004, the capitalization of SEGCO consisted of $59 million of equity and $88
million of debt on which the annual interest requirement is $3.2 million. SEGCO paid dividends
totaling $12.0 million in 2004, $2.3 million in 2003, and $5.8 million in 2002, of which one-half
of each was paid to the Company. In addition, the Company recognizes 50 percent of SEGCO’s net
income.

In addition to the Company’s ownership of SEGCO, the Company’s percentage ownership and
investment in jointly-owned generating plants at December 31, 2004 is as follows:

5. INCOME TAXES

Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and a combined State of Georgia
income tax return. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement, as required by
the PUHCA, each subsidiary’s current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis
and no subsidiary is allocated more expense than would be paid if they filed a separate income
tax return. In accordance with IRS regulations, each company is jointly and severally liable
for the tax liability.

In 2004, in order to avoid the loss of certain federal income tax credits related to the
production of synthetic fuel, Southern Company chose to defer certain deductions otherwise
available to the subsidiaries. The cash flow benefit associated with the utilization of the tax
credits was allocated to the subsidiary that otherwise would have claimed the available deductions
on a separate company basis without the deferral. This allocation concurrently reduced the tax
benefit of the credits allocated to those subsidiaries that generated the credits. As the deferred
expenses are deducted, the benefit of the tax credits will be repaid to the subsidiaries that
generated the tax credits. The Company has recorded $21.4 million and $2.3 million payable to
these subsidiaries in “Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes” and “Accrued Taxes – Income Tax”,
respectively, on the balance sheets.

At December 31, 2004, the Company’s tax-related regulatory assets and liabilities were $317
million and $148 million, respectively. These assets are attributable to tax benefits flowed
through to customers in prior years and to taxes applicable to capitalized interest. These
liabilities are attributable to deferred taxes previously recognized at rates higher than the
current enacted tax law and to unamortized investment tax credits.

In accordance with regulatory requirements, deferred investment tax credits are amortized over
the lives of the related property with such amortization normally applied as a credit to reduce
depreciation in the statements of income. Credits amortized in this manner amounted to $11 million
in each of 2004, 2003, and 2002. At December 31, 2004, all investment tax credits available to

6. FINANCING

Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities/Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts

The Company has formed certain wholly owned trust subsidiaries for the purpose of issuing preferred
securities. The proceeds of the related equity investments and preferred security sales were
loaned back to the Company through the issuance of junior subordinated notes totaling $309 million,
which constitute substantially all assets of these trusts and are reflected on the balance sheets
as Long-term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts. The Company considers that the mechanisms and
obligations relating to the preferred securities issued for its benefit, taken together, constitute
a full and unconditional guarantee by it of the respective trusts’ payment obligations with respect
to these securities. At December 31, 2004, preferred securities of $300 million were outstanding.
See Note 1 under “Variable Interest Entities” for additional information on the accounting
treatment for these trusts and the related securities.

First Mortgage Bonds

The Company has a firm power sales contract with the Alabama Municipal Electric Authority (AMEA)
entitling AMEA to scheduled amounts of capacity (up to a maximum 80 megawatts) for a period through
October 2006. Under the terms of the contract, the Company received payments from AMEA
representing the net present value of the revenues associated with the capacity entitlement,
discounted at an effective annual rate of 11.19 percent. These payments are being recognized as
operating revenues and the discount is amortized to other interest expense as scheduled capacity is
made available over the terms of the contract.

To secure AMEA’s advance payments and the Company’s performance obligation under the
contracts, the Company issued and delivered to an escrow agent first mortgage bonds representing
the maximum amount of liquidated damages payable by the Company in the event of a default under the
contracts. No principal or interest is payable on such bonds unless and until a default by the
Company occurs. As the liquidated damages decline, a portion of the bond equal to the decrease is
returned to the Company. At December 31, 2004, $18.7 million of these bonds were held by the
escrow agent under the contract.

Pollution Control Bonds

Pollution control obligations represent installment purchases of pollution control facilities
financed by funds derived from sales by public authorities of revenue bonds. The Company is
required to make payments sufficient for the authorities to meet principal and interest
requirements of such bonds. With respect to $114.2 million of such pollution control obligations,
the Company has authenticated and delivered to the trustees a like principal amount of first
mortgage bonds as security for its obligations under the installment purchase agreements. No
principal or interest on these first mortgage bonds is payable unless and until a default occurs on
the installment purchase agreements.

Senior Notes and Preferred Stock

The Company issued a total of $900 million of unsecured senior notes and $100 million of preferred
stock in 2004. The proceeds of these issues were used to redeem or repay at maturity long-term
debt, to repay short-term indebtedness, and for other general corporate purposes.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had $3.5 billion and $3.4 billion of senior notes
outstanding, respectively. These senior notes are subordinate to all secured debt of the Company
which amounted to approximately $286 million at December 31, 2004.

Long-Term Debt Due Within One Year

A summary of the improvement fund requirements and scheduled maturities and redemptions of
long-term debt due within one year at December 31 is as follows:

in 2009.

Assets Subject to Lien

The Company’s mortgage, as amended and supplemented, securing the first mortgage bonds issued by
the Company, constitutes a direct lien on substantially all of the Company’s fixed property and
franchises.

Bank Credit Arrangements

The Company maintains committed lines of credit in the amount of $868 million (including $504
million of such lines which are dedicated to funding purchase obligations relating to variable rate
pollution control bonds), of which $643 million will expire at various times during 2005. $225
million of the credit facilities expiring in 2005 allow for the execution of term loans for an
additional two-year period, and $245 million allow for the execution of one-year term loans. All
of the credit arrangements require payment of a commitment fee based on the unused portion of the
commitment or the maintenance of compensating balances with the banks. Commitment fees are less
than 1/4 of 1 percent for the Company. Because the arrangements are based on an average balance,
the Company does not consider any of its cash balances to be restricted as of any specific date.
For syndicated credit arrangements, a fee is also paid to the agent banks.

Most of the Company’s credit arrangements with banks have covenants that limit the Company’s
debt to 65 percent of total capitalization, as defined in the arrangements. For purposes of
calculating these covenants, long-term notes payable to affiliated trusts are excluded from debt
but included in capitalization. Exceeding this debt level would result in a default under the
credit arrangements. At December 31, 2004, the Company was in compliance with the debt limit
covenants. In addition, the credit arrangements typically contain cross default provisions that
would be triggered if the Company defaulted on other indebtedness (including guarantee
obligations) above a specified threshold. None of the arrangements contain material adverse
change clauses at the time of borrowings.

The Company borrows through commercial paper programs that have the liquidity support of
committed bank credit arrangements. In addition, the Company borrows from time to time through
extendible commercial note programs. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had no
extendible commercial notes and no commercial paper outstanding. During 2004, the peak amount
outstanding for commercial paper was $190 million and the average amount outstanding was $41.5
million. The average annual interest rate on commercial paper in 2004 was 1.51 percent.
Commercial paper and extendible commercial notes are included in notes payable on the balance
sheets.

At December 31, 2004, the Company had regulatory approval to have outstanding up to $1 billion
of short-term borrowings.

Financial Instruments

The Company enters into energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, gas, and
other fuel price changes. However, due to cost-based rate regulations, the Company has limited
exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity. The Company
has implemented fuel-hedging programs at the instruction of the Alabama PSC. The Company also
enters into hedges of forward electricity sales. There was no material ineffectiveness recorded
in earnings in 2004 and 2003.

At December 31, 2004, the fair value of derivative energy contracts was reflected in the
financial statements as follows:

Amounts

The fair value gain or loss for cash flow hedges that are recoverable through the
regulatory fuel clauses are recorded in the regulatory assets and liabilities and are recognized
in earnings at the same time the hedged items affect earnings. The Company has energy-related
hedges in place through 2007.

The Company also enters into derivatives to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates.
Derivatives related to variable rate securities or forecasted transactions are accounted for as
cash flow hedges. As the derivatives employed as hedging instruments are generally structured
to match the critical terms of the hedged debt instruments, no material ineffectiveness has been
recorded in earnings.

At December 31, 2004, the Company had $981 million notional amount of interest rate swaps
outstanding with net fair value losses of $7.2 million as follows:

The fair value gain or loss for cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive
income and is reclassified into earnings at the same time the hedged items affect earnings. In
2004 and 2003, the Company settled gains (losses) of $5.5 million and $(8) million, respectively,
upon termination of certain interest derivatives at the same time it issued debt. These gains
(losses) have been deferred in other comprehensive income and will be amortized to interest expense
over the life of the original interest derivative, which approximates to the underlying related
debt.

For the years 2004, 2003 and 2002, approximately $6.3 million, $11.3 million, and $2.1
million, respectively, of pre-tax losses were reclassified from other comprehensive income to
interest expense. For 2005, pre-tax gains of approximately $0.7 million are expected to be
reclassified from other comprehensive income to interest expense. The Company has interest-related
hedges in place through 2035.

7. COMMITMENTS

Construction Program

The Company is engaged in continuous construction programs, currently estimated to total $902
million in 2005, $921 million in 2006, and $1.0 billion in 2007. These amounts include $24
million, $12 million, and $11 million in 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively, for construction
expenditures related to contractual purchase commitments for uranium and nuclear fuel
conversion, enrichment, and fabrication services included under “Fuel Commitments.” The
construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs
may vary from the above estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes
in business conditions; revised load growth estimates; changes in environmental regulations;
changes in existing nuclear plants to meet new regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules
and transmission regulations; increasing costs of labor, equipment, and materials; and cost of
capital. At December 31, 2004, significant purchase commitments were outstanding in connection
with the construction program. The Company has no generating plants under construction.
Construction of new transmission and distribution facilities and capital improvements, including
those needed to meet environmental standards for existing generation, transmission, and
distribution facilities, will continue.

Long-Term Service Agreements

The Company has entered into several Long-Term Service Agreements (LTSAs) with General Electric
(GE) for the purpose of securing maintenance support for its combined cycle and combustion
turbine generating facilities. The LTSAs stipulate that GE will perform all planned inspections
on the covered equipment, which includes the cost of all labor and materials. GE is also
obligated to cover the costs of unplanned maintenance on the covered equipment subject to a
limit specified in each contract.

In general, these LTSAs are in effect through two major inspection cycles per unit.
Scheduled payments to GE are made at various intervals based on actual operating hours of the
respective units. Total payments to GE under these agreements for facilities owned are
currently estimated at $253 million over the term of the agreements, which are approximately 12
to 14 years per unit. At December 31, 2004, the remaining balance was approximately $193
million. However, the LTSAs contain various cancellation provisions at the option of the
Company.

Payments made to GE prior to the performance of any planned maintenance are recorded as
either prepayments or other deferred charges and assets in the balance sheets. Inspection costs
are capitalized or charged to expense based on the nature of the work performed.

Purchased Power Commitments

The Company has entered into various long-term commitments for the purchase of electricity. Total

Fuel Commitments

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of its generating plants, the Company has entered into
various long-term commitments for the procurement of fossil and nuclear fuel. In most cases, these
contracts contain provisions for price escalations, minimum purchase levels, and other financial
commitments. Coal commitments include forward contract purchases for sulfur dioxide emission
allowances. Natural gas purchase commitments contain given volumes with prices based on various
indices at the time of delivery. Amounts included in the chart below represent estimates based on
New York Mercantile Exchange future prices at December 31, 2004. Total estimated minimum long-term

SCS may enter into various types of wholesale energy and natural gas contracts acting as an
agent for the Company and all of the other Southern Company retail operating companies, Southern
Power, and Southern Company GAS. Under these agreements, each of the retail operating companies,
Southern Power, and Southern Company GAS may be jointly and severally liable. The creditworthiness
of Southern Power and Southern Company GAS is currently inferior to the creditworthiness of the
retail operating companies. Accordingly, Southern Company has entered into keep-well agreements
with the Company and each of the other retail operating companies to insure the Company will not
subsidize or be responsible for any costs, losses, liabilities, or damages resulting from the
inclusion of Southern Power or Southern Company GAS as a contracting party under these agreements.

Operating Leases

The Company has entered into rental agreements for coal rail cars, vehicles, and other equipment
with various terms and expiration dates. These expenses totaled $28.3

In addition to the rental commitments above, the Company has potential obligations upon
expiration of certain leases with respect to the residual value of the leased property. These
leases expire in 2006 and 2009, and the Company’s maximum obligations are $66 million and $19.5
million, respectively. At the termination of the leases, at the Company’s option, the Company may
negotiate an extension, exercise its purchase option, or the property can be sold to a third party.
The Company expects that the fair market value of the leased property would substantially reduce
or eliminate the Company’s payments under the residual value obligations.

Guarantees

At December 31, 2004, the Company had outstanding guarantees related to SEGCO’s purchase of certain
pollution control facilities and issuance of senior notes, as discussed in Note 4, and to certain
residual values of leased assets. See “Operating Leases” above.

8. STOCK OPTION PLAN

Southern Company provides non-qualified stock options to a large segment of the Company’s
employees ranging from line management to executives. As of December 31, 2004, 1,111 current
and former employees of the Company participated in this stock option plan. The maximum number
of shares of Southern Company common stock that may be issued under the plan may not exceed 55
million. The prices of options granted to date have been at the fair market value of the shares
on the dates of grant. Options granted to date become exercisable pro rata over a maximum
period of three years from the date of grant. Options outstanding will expire no later than 10
years after the date of grant, unless terminated earlier by the Southern Company Board of
Directors in accordance with the stock option plan. Activity from 2002 to 2004 for the options
granted to the Company’s employees under the stock option plan is summarized below:

9. NUCLEAR INSURANCE

Under the Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 1988 (Act), the Company maintains agreements of
indemnity with the NRC that, together with private insurance, cover third-party liability arising
from any nuclear incident occurring at Plant Farley. The Act provides funds up to $10.76 billion
for public liability claims that could arise from a single nuclear incident. Plant Farley is
insured against this liability to a maximum of $300 million by

II-117


NOTES (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2004 Annual Report

American Nuclear Insurers (ANI), with the remaining coverage provided by a mandatory program of
deferred premiums that could be assessed, after a nuclear incident, against all owners of nuclear
reactors. The Company could be assessed up to $100.5 million per incident for each licensed
reactor it operates but not more than an aggregate of $10 million per incident to be paid in a
calendar year for each reactor. Such maximum assessment, excluding any applicable state premium
taxes, for the Company is $201 million per incident but not more than an aggregate of $20 million
to be paid for each incident in any one year. The Act expired in August 2002; however, the
indemnity provisions of the act remain in place for commercial nuclear reactors.

The Company is a member of Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), a mutual insurer
established to provide property damage insurance in an amount up to $500 million for members’
nuclear generating facilities.

Additionally, the Company has policies that currently provide decontamination, excess property
insurance, and premature decommissioning coverage up to $2.25 billion for losses in excess of the
$500 million primary coverage. This excess insurance is also provided by NEIL.

NEIL also covers the additional costs that would be incurred in obtaining replacement power
during a prolonged accidental outage at a member’s nuclear plant. Members can purchase this
coverage, subject to a deductible waiting period of up to 26 weeks, with a maximum per occurrence
per unit limit of $490 million. After this deductible period, weekly indemnity payments would be
received until either the unit is operational or until the limit is exhausted in approximately
three years. The Company purchases the maximum limit allowed by NEIL and has elected a 12 week
waiting period.

Under each of the NEIL policies, members are subject to assessments if losses each year exceed
the accumulated funds available to the insurer under that policy. The current maximum annual
assessments for the Company under the NEIL policies would be $39 million.

Following the terrorist attacks of September 2001, both ANI and NEIL confirmed that terrorist
acts against commercial nuclear power plants would be covered under their insurance. Both
companies, however, revised their policy terms on a prospective basis to include an industry
aggregate for all “non-certified” terrorist acts, (i.e., acts that are not certified acts of
terrorism pursuant to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA)). The NEIL aggregate,
applies to non-certified claims stemming from terrorism within a 12 month duration, is $3.24
billion plus any amounts available through reinsurance or indemnity from an outside source. The
non-certified ANI cap is a $300 million shared industry aggregate. Any act of terrorism that is
certified pursuant to the TRIA will not be subject to the foregoing NEIL and ANI limitations but
will be subject to the TRIA annual aggregate limitation of $100 billion of insured losses arising
from certified acts of terrorism. The TRIA will expire on December 31, 2005.

For all on-site property damage insurance policies for commercial nuclear power plants, the
NRC requires that the proceeds of such policies shall be dedicated first for the sole purpose of
placing the reactor in a safe and stable condition after an accident. Any remaining proceeds are
to be applied next toward the costs of decontamination and debris removal operations ordered by the
NRC, and any further remaining proceeds are to be paid either to the Company or to its bond
trustees as may be appropriate under the policies and applicable trust indentures.

All retrospective assessments, whether generated for liability, property, or replacement
power, may be subject to applicable state premium taxes.

obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a
basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements (pages II-143 to II-173) present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Georgia Power Company at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, in 2003 Georgia Power Company changed its
method of accounting for asset retirement obligations.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2004 Annual Report

OVERVIEW

Business Activities

Georgia Power Company (Company) operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electricity
to retail customers within its traditional service area located within the State of Georgia and to
wholesale customers in the Southeast.

Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges and risks of the Company’s primary
business of selling electricity. These factors include the ability to maintain a stable
regulatory environment, to achieve energy sales growth while containing costs, and to recover
costs related to growing demand and increasingly stringent environmental standards. In 2004,
the Company completed a major retail rate proceeding that should help provide future earnings
stability. This regulatory action will also enable the recovery of substantial capital
investments to facilitate the continued reliability of the transmission and distribution network
and continue environmental improvements at the generating plants. Appropriately balancing
environmental expenditures with customer prices will continue to challenge the Company for the
foreseeable future.

Key Performance Indicators

The Company strives to maximize shareholder value while providing low-cost energy to more than 2
million customers by focusing on several key indicators. These include customer satisfaction,
peak season equivalent forced outage rate (Peak Season EFOR), and return on equity (ROE). The
Company’s financial success is directly tied to the satisfaction of its customers. Key elements
of ensuring that satisfaction include outstanding service, high reliability, and competitive
prices. Management uses nationally recognized customer satisfaction surveys and reliability
indicators to evaluate the Company’s results. Peak Season EFOR is an indicator of plant
availability and efficient generation fleet operations during the months when generation needs
are greatest. The rate is calculated by dividing the number of hours of forced outages by total
generation hours. ROE is a performance standard used by the investment community and many
regulatory agencies.

The Company’s 2004 results compared to its targets for each of these indicators are
reflected in the following chart.

The strong financial performance achieved in 2004 reflects the focus that management places
on these indicators, as well as the commitment shown by employees in achieving or exceeding
management’s expectations.

Earnings

The Company’s 2004 earnings totaled $658 million representing a $27 million (4.3 percent) increase
over 2003. Operating income increased in 2004 due to higher base retail revenues attributable to
more favorable weather and customer growth during the year, partially offset by higher non-fuel
operating expenses. In addition, lower depreciation and amortization expense in the final year of
a Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC) retail rate plan that was effective January 2002 (2001
Retail Rate Plan) significantly offset increased purchased power capacity expenses. The Company’s
2003 earnings totaled $631 million, representing a $13 million (2.1 percent) increase over 2002.
Operating income increased in 2003 despite lower base retail revenues resulting from the extremely
mild summer weather. Higher wholesale revenues and lower non-fuel operating expenses contributed
to the increase. The Company’s 2002 earnings totaled $618 million, representing an $8 million (1.2
percent) increase over 2001 resulting from lower financing costs and a lower effective tax rate due
to the realization of certain state tax credits. Operating income declined slightly in 2002.
Lower retail and wholesale revenues, higher other operating and maintenance expenses, and increased
purchased power capacity expenses were significantly offset by lower depreciation and amortization
expense as a result of the 2001 Retail Rate Plan.

Retail base revenues of $3.2 billion in 2004 increased by $183 million (6.0 percent) from
2003 primarily due to an improved economy, customer growth, generally higher prices to the
Company’s large business customers, and more favorable weather. Retail base revenues of $3 billion
in 2003 decreased by $36 million (1.2 percent) from 2002 primarily due to extremely mild summer
temperatures in 2003 and the sluggish economy. Retail base revenues of $3.1 billion in 2002
decreased by $34 million (1.1 percent) from 2001 primarily due to a base rate reduction effective
January 2002 under the 2001 Retail Rate Plan and generally lower prices to large business
customers.

Electric rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, the
energy component of purchased power costs, and certain other costs. Under these fuel cost recovery
provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses — including the fuel component of
purchased energy — and do not affect net income. In August 2003, the Georgia PSC issued an order
allowing the Company to increase customer fuel rates to recover existing under recovered deferred
fuel costs. In recent months, the Company has experienced higher than expected fuel costs for coal
and gas. Those higher fuel costs have increased the under recovered fuel costs. On February 18,
2005, the Company filed a

II-124


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2004 Annual Report

request with the Georgia PSC for a fuel cost recovery rate increase. In the ordinary course, these
new rates will be effective June 1, 2005 following a hearing before and approval by the Georgia
PSC. In its filing, the Company asked that the Georgia PSC accept the new rate, effective April 1,
2005, prior to a formal hearing on the Company’s request. This action, if taken by the Georgia
PSC, would serve to mitigate expected increases in the under recovered balance during April and
May, but will not preclude the Georgia PSC from subsequently adjusting the rates. The requested
increase, representing an annual increase in revenues of approximately 11.7 percent, will allow for
the recovery of fuel costs based on an estimate of future fuel costs, as well as the collection of
the existing under recovery of fuel costs. The Company’s under recovered fuel costs as of January
31, 2005 totaled $390 million. The Georgia PSC will examine the Company’s fuel expenditures and
determine whether the proposed fuel cost recovery rate is just and reasonable before issuing its
decision in May 2005. The final outcome of the filing cannot be determined at this time. See Note
3 to the financial statements under “Fuel Cost Recovery” for further information regarding this
filing.

Revenues from unit power sales contracts remained relatively constant in 2004. Revenues from
unit power contracts decreased slightly in 2003 due to decreased energy sales. Revenues from other
non-affiliated sales decreased $12 million (6.2 percent), $8 million (3.9 percent), and $102
million (33.4 percent) in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively, primarily due to fluctuations in
off-system sale transactions that were generally offset by corresponding purchase transactions.
These transactions had no significant effect on income. In 2002, revenues also decreased $37
million as a result of transferring Plant Dahlberg to Southern Power Company (Southern Power) in
July 2001.

Revenues from sales to affiliated companies within the Southern Company electric system, as
well as purchases of energy, will vary from year to year depending on demand and the availability
and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliated sales and purchases are made in
accordance with the affiliate company interchange agreement, as approved by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC). In 2004, kilowatt-hour (KWH) energy sales to affiliates decreased
18.2 percent due to lower demand. However, the decline in associated revenues was only 4.9 percent
due to higher fuel prices. In 2003, KWH energy sales to affiliates increased 47.5 percent due to
the combination of increased demand by Southern Power to meet contractual obligations and the
availability of power due to milder-than-normal weather in the Company’s service territory. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at
marginal cost.

Other operating revenues increased $11.7 million (6.9 percent) in 2004 primarily due to higher
revenues from outdoor lighting of $4.2 million and pole attachment rentals of $4.9 million and
higher gains on sales of emission allowances of $2 million. Other operating revenues increased $4
million (2.4 percent) in 2003 primarily due to an increase in the open access transmission tariff
rate, which increased revenues $7 million, and higher revenues from increased customer demand for
outdoor lighting services of $4 million, partially offset by lower revenues from the rental of
electric property of $4 million. Other operating revenues in 2002 increased $14 million (9.5
percent) primarily due to the collection of new late payment fees approved under the 2001 Retail
Rate Plan of $7 million and higher revenues from increased customer demand for outdoor lighting
services of $5 million and the transmission of electricity of $3 million.

increased 2.5 percent in 2004 due to the improved economy. Residential KWH sales decreased 1.7
percent in 2003 due to the effect of the milder summer weather, despite the 2.0 percent increase in
residential customers. Commercial KWH sales in 2003 declined slightly due to the milder summer
weather, while industrial KWH sales declined slightly due to the sluggish economy. Residential KWH
sales increased 10.1 percent in 2002 due to the effect of the warmer weather. Commercial and
industrial KWH sales in 2002 increased 1.7 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively, due to
corresponding increases of 2.6 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively, in customers. Retail sales
growth assuming normal weather is expected to be 1.9 percent on average from 2005 to 2009.

Expenses

Fuel costs constitute the single largest expense for the Company. The mix of fuel sources for
generation of electricity is determined primarily by system load, the unit cost of fuel consumed,
and the availability of hydro and nuclear generating units. The amount and sources of generation,
the average cost of fuel per net KWH generated, and the average cost of purchased power per net KWH
were as follows:

Fuel expense increased 11.6 percent in 2004 primarily due to an increase in the average cost
of fuel. Fuel expense increased 10.1 percent in 2003 due to an increase in generation of 3.9
percent because of higher wholesale energy demands and a 2.8 percent higher average cost of fuel
due to the higher prices of coal and natural gas in 2003. Fuel expense increased 6.8 percent in
2002 due to a 2.2 percent increase in generation because of higher energy demands and a 2.9 percent
higher average cost of fuel due to the higher cost of coal.

Purchased power expense increased $200 million (25.9 percent) in 2004 primarily due to a 38.5
percent increase in the average cost of fuel per net KWH and $65 million of additional capacity
expense associated with new purchased power agreements (PPAs) between the Company and Southern
Power that went into effect in June 2004 and June 2003. Purchased power expense increased $92
million (13.3 percent) in 2003 primarily due to $75 million of additional capacity expense
associated with new PPAs between the Company and Southern Power that went into effect in 2003 and
2002. Purchased power expense decreased $87 million (11.2 percent) in 2002 primarily due to
fluctuations in off-system energy purchases used to meet off-system sales commitments. The 2002
decrease in energy purchases was partially offset by a $43 million increase in capacity expense
associated with new PPAs between the Company and Southern Power.

II-126


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2004 Annual Report

A significant upward trend in the cost of coal and natural gas has emerged since 2003, and
volatility in these markets is expected to continue. Increased coal prices have been influenced
by a worldwide increase in demand as a result of rapid economic growth in China as well as by
increases in mining costs. Higher natural gas prices in the United States are the result of
slightly lower gas supplies despite increased drilling activity. Natural gas supply
interruptions, such as those caused by the 2004 hurricanes, result in an immediate market
response; however, the impact of this price volatility may be reduced by imports of natural gas
and liquefied natural gas. Fuel expenses generally do not affect net income, since they are
offset by fuel revenues under the Company’s fuel cost recovery provisions.

In 2004, other operation and maintenance expenses increased $153 million (12.3 percent) due to
the timing of generating plant maintenance of $39 million and transmission and distribution
maintenance of $39 million. Increased employee benefit expense of $30 million related to pension
and medical benefits and higher workers compensation expense of $8 million also contributed to the
increase. In 2003, other operation and maintenance expenses decreased $78 million (5.9 percent)
due to the timing of generating plant maintenance of $46 million and transmission and distribution
maintenance of $8 million and lower severance costs of $8 million. In 2002, other operation and
maintenance expenses increased $85 million (6.8 percent) due to the timing of generating plant
maintenance of $44 million and transmission maintenance of $17 million and increased property
insurance expense of $5 million.

Depreciation and amortization decreased $74 million and $54 million in 2004 and 2003,
respectively, primarily as a result of the amortization of a regulatory liability related to the
inclusion of new certified PPAs in retail rates on a levelized basis as ordered by the Georgia PSC.
Depreciation and amortization decreased $197 million in 2002 primarily as a result of
discontinuing accelerated depreciation, beginning amortization of the regulatory liability for
accelerated cost recovery, and lowering the composite depreciation rates as part of the 2001 Retail
Rate Plan. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Rate Orders” for additional
information.

Taxes other than income taxes increased $15 million (7.0 percent) in 2004 due to higher
municipal gross receipts taxes associated with increased operating revenues. Taxes other than
income taxes increased $11 million (5.4 percent) in 2003 due mainly to a favorable true-up of state
property tax valuations in 2002. Taxes other than income taxes remained relatively constant in
2002.

Allowance for equity funds used during construction increased $15.9 million in 2004 primarily
due to the Company’s acquisition of the Plant McIntosh combined cycle Units 10 and 11 construction
project from Southern Power. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “FERC and Georgia PSC Matters” and
Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Rate Orders” and “Plant McIntosh Construction
Project” for additional information.

Interest income decreased $9 million in 2004 and increased $12 million in 2003 when compared
to the prior year primarily due to interest on a favorable income tax settlement of $14.5 million
in 2003. Interest income remained relatively constant in 2002.

Interest expense remained relatively constant in 2004. Interest expense increased in 2003
primarily due to an increase in senior notes outstanding that was partially offset by a reduction
in short-term debt outstanding. Interest expense decreased in 2002 primarily due to lower interest
rates that offset new financing costs. The Company refinanced or retired $400 million, $665
million, and $929 million of securities in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Interest
capitalized increased in 2004 due to the Plant McIntosh construction project referenced above and
decreased in 2003 and 2002 due to the transfer of three generation projects to Southern Power in
2002 and 2001. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Rate Orders” and “Plant
McIntosh Construction Project” for additional information regarding the Plant McIntosh construction
project.

Other income and (expense), net decreased in 2004 primarily due to the $13 million
disallowance of Plant McIntosh construction costs pursuant to a Georgia PSC order issued on
December 21, 2004 (2004 Retail Rate Plan), partially offset by a $7.5 million decrease in donations
and $3.4 million in increased income from a customer pricing program. See Note 3 to the financial

II-127


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2004 Annual Report

statements under “Retail Rate Orders” and “Plant McIntosh Construction Project” for additional
information on the disallowance.

Effects of Inflation

The Company is subject to rate regulation that is based on the recovery of historical costs. In
addition, the income tax laws are also based on historical costs. Therefore, inflation creates an
economic loss because the Company is recovering its costs of investments in dollars that have less
purchasing power. While the inflation rate has been relatively low in recent years, it continues
to have an adverse effect on the Company because of the large investment in utility plant with long
economic lives. Conventional accounting for historical cost does not recognize this economic loss
nor the partially offsetting gain that arises through financing facilities with fixed-money
obligations such as long-term debt, preferred stock, and preferred securities. Any recognition of
inflation by regulatory authorities is reflected in the rate of return allowed in the Company’s
approved electric rates.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL

General

The Company operates as a vertically integrated company providing electricity to retail customers
within its traditional service territory located within the State of Georgia and to wholesale
customers in the southeastern United States. Prices for electricity provided by the Company to
retail customers are set by the Georgia PSC under cost-based regulatory principles. Prices for
electricity relating to jointly owned generating facilities, interconnecting transmission lines,
and the exchange of electric power are set by the FERC. Retail rates and revenues are reviewed and
adjusted periodically within certain limitations based on earned ROE. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES –
“Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Electric Utility Regulation” herein
and Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Rate Orders” and “Market-Based Rate Authority”
for additional information about this and other regulatory matters.

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of future
earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous factors that affect the
opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Company’s business of selling electricity. These
factors include the ability to maintain a stable regulatory environment, to recover costs related
to growing demand, to achieve energy sales growth while containing costs, and to meet
increasingly stringent environmental standards. Future earnings in the near term will depend, in
part, upon growth in energy sales which is subject to a number of factors. These factors include
weather, competition, new energy contracts with neighboring utilities, energy conservation
practiced by customers, the price of electricity, the price elasticity of demand, and the rate of
economic growth in the service area.

Since 2001, merchant energy companies and traditional electric utilities with significant
energy marketing and trading activities have come under severe financial pressures. Many of
these companies have completely exited or drastically reduced all energy marketing and trading
activities and sold foreign and domestic electric infrastructure assets. The Company has not
experienced any material adverse financial impact regarding its limited energy trading
operations through Southern Company Services, Inc. (SCS).

Environmental Matters

New Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil action in the U.S
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against the Company, alleging that the Company
had violated the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act and related state laws
with respect to coal-fired generating facilities at plants Bowen and Scherer. The civil action
requests penalties and injunctive relief, including an order requiring the installation of the best
available control technology at the affected units. The action against the Company was effectively
stayed in the spring of 2001 pending the appeal of a similar NSR action against the Tennessee
Valley Authority (TVA) before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. In June 2003,
the Court of Appeals issued its ruling in the TVA case, dismissing the appeal for reasons unrelated
to the issues in the case pending against the Company. At this time, no party to the case against
the Company has sought to reopen the case, which remains administratively closed in the U.S.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2004 Annual Report

District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. See Note 3 to the financial statements under
“New Source Review Actions” for additional information.

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act
authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $32,500 per day, per violation at each generating
unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in this case could
require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly
require payment of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of operations, cash
flows, and possibly financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

In December 2002 and October 2003, the EPA issued final revisions to its NSR regulations under
the Clean Air Act. The December 2002 revisions included changes to the regulatory exclusions and
the methods of calculating emissions increases. The October 2003 regulations clarified the scope
of the existing Routine Maintenance, Repair, and Replacement (RMRR) exclusion. A coalition of
states and environmental organizations has filed petitions for review of these revisions with the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The October 2003 RMRR rules have been
stayed by the Court of Appeals pending its review of the rules. In any event, the final
regulations must also be adopted by the State of Georgia in order to apply to the Company’s
facilities. The effect of these final regulations, related legal challenges, and potential
rulemakings by the State of Georgia cannot be determined at this time.

Plant Wansley Environmental Litigation

On December 30, 2002, the Sierra Club, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Georgia Forestwatch,
and one individual filed a civil suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
Georgia against the Company for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act at four of the units at
Plant Wansley. The civil action requests injunctive and declaratory relief, civil penalties, a
supplemental environmental project, and attorneys’ fees. The Clean Air Act authorizes civil
penalties of up to $27,500 per day, per violation at each generating unit. The liability phase of
the case has concluded with the Court ruling in favor of the Company in part and the plaintiffs in
part. The Company has filed a petition for review of the decision with the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Eleventh Circuit. The district court case has been administratively closed pending that
appeal. If necessary, the district court will hold a separate remedy trial which will address
civil penalties and possible injunctive relief requested by the plaintiffs. See Note 3 to the
financial statements under “Plant Wansley Environmental Litigation” for additional information.
The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot currently be determined; however, an adverse outcome
could result in substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could
possibly require payment of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of operations,
cash flows, and possibly financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated
rates.

Carbon Dioxide Litigation

On July 21, 2004, attorneys general from eight states, each outside of Southern Company’s service
territory, and the corporation counsel of New York filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of New York against Southern Company and four other electric power companies.
A nearly identical complaint was filed by three environmental groups in the same court. The
complaints allege that the companies’ emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, contribute to
global warming, which the plaintiffs assert is a public nuisance. Under common law public and
private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs seek a judicial order (1) holding each defendant jointly
and severally liable for creating, contributing to, and/or maintaining, global warming and (2)
requiring each of the defendants to cap its emissions of carbon dioxide and then reduce those
emissions by a specified percentage each year for at least a decade. Plaintiffs have not, however,
requested that damages be awarded in connection with their claims. Southern Company believes these
claims are without merit and notes that the complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis for
the claims. Southern Company and the other defendants have filed motions to dismiss both lawsuits.
Southern Company intends to vigorously defend against these claims. While the outcome of these
matters cannot be determined at this time, an adverse judgment could result in substantial capital
expenditures.

II-129


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2004 Annual Report

Environmental Statutes and Regulations

The Company’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by state and federal environmental
agencies under a variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental media, including air,
water, and land resources. Compliance with these environmental requirements involves significant
capital and operating costs, a major portion of which is expected to be recovered through existing
ratemaking provisions. Environmental costs that are known and estimable at this time are included
in capital expenditures under FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – “Capital Requirements and
Contractual Obligations” herein. There is no assurance, however, that all such costs will, in
fact, be recovered.

Compliance with the Clean Air Act and resulting regulations has been and will continue to be a
significant focus for the Company. The Title IV acid rain provisions of the Clean Air Act, for
example, required significant reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions and
resulted in total construction expenditures of approximately $206 million through 2000. Some of
these previous expenditures also assisted the Company in complying with nitrogen oxide emission
reduction requirements under Title I of the Clean Air Act, which were designed to address one-hour
ozone nonattainment problems in Atlanta, Georgia. The State of Georgia adopted regulations that
required additional nitrogen oxide emission reductions from May through September of each year at
plants in and/or near nonattainment areas. Seven generating plants in the Atlanta area are
currently subject to those requirements, the most recent of which went into effect in 2003.
Construction expenditures for compliance with the nitrogen oxide emission reduction requirements
totaled $687.2 million through 2004, with an additional $6 million committed through 2007.

To help attain the one-hour ozone standard, the EPA issued regional nitrogen oxide reduction
rules in 1998. Those rules required 21 states, including Georgia, to reduce and cap nitrogen oxide
emissions from power plants and other large industrial sources. As a result of litigation
challenging the rule, the courts required the EPA to complete a separate rulemaking before the
requirements could be applied in Georgia. In April 2004, the EPA published final regional
nitrogen oxide reduction rules applicable to Georgia, specifying a May 1, 2007 compliance date.
However, in October 2004, the EPA announced that it would stay implementation of the rule as it
relates to Georgia, while it initiates rulemakings to address issues raised in a petition for
reconsideration filed by a coalition of Georgia industries. The impact of the nitrogen oxide
reduction rules will depend on the outcome of the petition for reconsideration and/or any
subsequent development and approval of Georgia’s state implementation plan and cannot be determined
at this time.

In September 2003, the EPA reclassified the Atlanta area from a “serious” to a “severe”
nonattainment area for the one-hour ozone standard effective January 1, 2004. However, based on
the last three years of data, the State of Georgia believes that the Atlanta area has attained the
one-hour standard and is in the process of applying for redesignation from the EPA.

In July 1997, the EPA revised the national ambient air quality standards for ozone and
particulate matter. These revisions made the standards significantly more stringent and included
development of an eight-hour ozone standard, as opposed to the previous one-hour ozone standard.
In the subsequent litigation of these standards, the U.S. Supreme Court found the EPA’s
implementation program for the new eight-hour ozone standard unlawful and remanded it to the EPA
for further rulemaking. During 2003, the EPA proposed implementation rules designed to address the
court’s concerns. On April 30, 2004, the EPA published its eight-hour ozone nonattainment
designations and a portion of the rules implementing the new eight-hour standard. Areas within the
Company’s service territory that have been designated as nonattainment under the eight-hour ozone
standard include Macon, Georgia and a 20-county area within metropolitan Atlanta. Under the
implementation provisions of the new rule, the EPA announced that the one-hour ozone standard will
be revoked on June 15, 2005, and that areas classified as “severe” nonattainment areas under the
one-hour standard, such as Atlanta, will not be required to impose emissions fees if those areas
fail to come into attainment with the one-hour standard. With respect to the eight-hour
nonattainment areas, state implementation plans, including new emission control regulations
necessary to bring those areas into attainment, could be required as early as 2007. These state
implementation plans could require reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions from power plants. The
impact of the eight-hour designations and the new standard will depend on the development and
implementation of applicable state implementation plans and therefore cannot be determined at this
time.

II-130


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2004 Annual Report

On December 17, 2004, the EPA issued its final “nonattainment” designations for the fine
particulate national ambient air quality standard. Several areas within the Company’s service
territory in Georgia were included in the EPA’s final particulate matter designations. The EPA
plans to propose a fine particulate matter implementation rule in 2005 and finalize the
implementation rule in 2006. State implementation plans addressing the nonattainment designations
may be required by 2008 and could require reductions in sulfur dioxide emissions and further
reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions from power plants. The impact of the fine particulate
designations will depend on the development and implementation of applicable state implementation
plans and therefore cannot be determined at this time.

In January 2004, the EPA issued a proposed Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) to address
interstate transport of ozone and fine particles. This proposed rule would require additional
year-round sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission reductions from power plants in the eastern
United States in two phases – in 2010 and 2015. The EPA currently plans to finalize this rule in
2005. If finalized, the rule could modify or supplant other state requirements for attainment of
the fine particulate matter standard, the eight-hour ozone standard, and other air quality
regulations. The impact of this rule on the Company will depend upon the specific requirements of
the final rule and cannot be determined at this time.

The Company has developed and maintains an environmental compliance strategy for the
installation of additional control technologies and the purchase of emission allowances to assure
continued compliance with current sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission regulations.
Additional expenses associated with these regulations are anticipated to be incurred each year to
maintain current and future compliance. Because the Company’s compliance strategy is impacted by
factors such as changes to existing environmental laws and regulations, increases in the cost of
emissions allowances, and any changes in the Company’s fuel mix, future environmental compliance
costs cannot be determined at this time.

Further reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides could also be required under the
EPA’s Regional Haze rules. The Regional Haze rules require states to establish Best Available
Retrofit Technology (BART) standards for certain sources that contribute to regional haze and to
implement emission reduction requirements that make progress toward remedying current visibility
impairment in certain natural areas. The Company has a number of plants that could be subject to
these rules. The EPA’s Regional Haze program calls for states to submit implementation plans in
2008 that contain emission reduction strategies for implementing BART and for achieving sufficient
progress toward the Clean Air Act’s visibility improvement goal. In response to litigation, the
EPA proposed revised rules in May 2004, which it plans to finalize in April 2005. The impact of
these regulations will depend on the promulgation of final rules and implementation of those rules
by the states and, therefore, it is not possible to determine the effect of these rules on the
Company at this time.

In January 2004, the EPA issued proposed rules regulating mercury emissions from electric
utility boilers. The proposal solicits comments on two possible approaches for the new regulations
– a Maximum Achievable Control Technology approach and a cap-and-trade approach. Either approach
would require significant reductions in mercury emissions from Company facilities. The regulations
are scheduled to be finalized by March 2005, and compliance could be required as early as 2008.
Because the regulations have not been finalized, the impact on the Company cannot be determined at
this time.

Major bills to amend the Clean Air Act to impose more stringent emissions limitations on power
plants, including the Bush Administration’s Clear Skies Act, have been proposed in 2005. The Clear
Skies Act is expected to further limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides,
and mercury and to supplement the proposed CAIR and mercury regulatory programs. Other proposals
have also been introduced to limit emissions of carbon dioxide. The cost impacts of such
legislation would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined at this
time.

Under the Clean Water Act, the EPA has been developing new rules aimed at reducing impingement
and entrainment of fish and fish larvae at power plants’ cooling water intake structures. In July
2004, the EPA published final rules that will require biological studies and, perhaps, retrofits to
some intake structures at existing power plants. The impact of these new rules will depend on the
results of studies and analyses performed as part of the rules’ implementation and the actual
limits established by the regulatory agencies.

II-131


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2004 Annual Report

The Company is installing cooling towers at additional facilities under the Clean Water Act to
cool water prior to discharge. Near Atlanta, a cooling tower for one plant was completed in 2004
with two others scheduled for completion in 2008. The total estimated cost of these projects is
$248 million, with $170 million remaining to be spent. Also, the Company is conducting a study of
the aquatic environment at another facility to determine if further thermal controls are necessary
at that plant.

Several major pieces of environmental legislation are periodically considered for
reauthorization or amendment by Congress. These include: the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act;
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Emergency Planning & Community
Right-to-Know Act; and the Endangered Species Act. Compliance with possible additional federal or
state legislation or regulations related to global climate change or other environmental and health
concerns could also significantly affect the Company. The impact of any new legislation, changes
to existing legislation, or environmental regulations could affect many areas of the Company’s
operations. The full impact of any such changes cannot, however, be determined at this time.

Global Climate Issues

Domestic efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions have been spurred by international discussions
surrounding the Framework Convention on Climate Change — and specifically the Kyoto Protocol —
which proposes constraints on the emissions of greenhouse gases for a group of industrialized
countries. The Bush Administration has not supported U.S. ratification of the Kyoto Protocol or
other mandatory carbon dioxide reduction legislation and, in 2002, announced a goal to reduce the
greenhouse gas intensity of the U.S. – the ratio of greenhouse gas emissions to the value of U.S.
economic output — by 18 percent by 2012. A year later, the Department of Energy (DOE) announced
the Climate VISION program to support this goal. Energy-intensive industries, including
electricity generation, are the initial focus of this program. Southern Company is leading the
development of a voluntary electric utility sector climate change initiative in partnership with
the government. The utility sector has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions rate by 3 to
5 percent over the next decade and, on December 13, 2004, signed a memorandum of understanding with
the DOE initiating this program under Climate VISION. Because efforts under this voluntary program
are just beginning, the impact of this program on the Company cannot be determined at this time.

Environmental Remediation Reserves

The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling and
disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations,
the Company could incur substantial costs to clean up properties. The Company conducts studies to
determine the extent of any required cleanup and has recognized in its financial statements the
costs to clean up and monitor known sites. Amounts for cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs were
not material for any year presented. The Company may be liable for some or all required cleanup
costs for additional sites that may require environmental remediation. See Note 3 to the financial
statements under “Environmental Remediation” for additional information.

Under Georgia PSC ratemaking provisions, $22 million has been deferred in a regulatory
liability account for use in meeting future environmental remediation costs of the Company. Under
the 2004 Retail Rate Plan, this regulatory liability will be amortized as a credit to expense over
a three-year period beginning January 1, 2005. However, the Georgia PSC also approved an annual
environmental accrual of $5.4 million. Environmental remediation expenditures will be charged
against the reserve as they are incurred. The annual accrual amount will be reviewed and adjusted
in future regulatory proceedings.

FERC and Georgia PSC Matters

Transmission

In December 1999, the FERC issued its final rule on Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs).
Since that time, there have been a number of additional proceedings at the FERC designed to
encourage further voluntary formation of RTOs or to mandate their formation. However, at the
current time, there are no active proceedings that would require the Company to participate in an
RTO. Current FERC efforts that may potentially change the regulatory and/or operational structure
of transmission include rules related to the standardization of generation interconnection, as well
as

II-132


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2004 Annual Report

an inquiry into, among other things, market power by vertically integrated utilities. See
“Generation Interconnection Agreements” and “Market-Based Rate Authority” herein for additional
information. The final outcome of these proceedings cannot now be determined. However, the
Company’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected by
future changes in the federal regulatory or operational structure of transmission.

Generation Interconnection Agreements

In July 2003, the FERC issued its final rule on the standardization of generation
interconnection agreements and procedures (Order 2003). Order 2003 shifts much of the financial
burden of new transmission investment from the generator to the transmission provider. The FERC
has indicated that Order 2003, which was effective January 20, 2004, is to be applied
prospectively to interconnection agreements. Subsidiaries of Tenaska, Inc., as counterparties
to previously executed interconnection agreements with the Company and another Southern Company subsidiary, have
filed complaints at the FERC requesting that the FERC modify the agreements and that the Company
refund a total of $7.9 million previously paid for interconnection facilities, with interest.
The Company has opposed such relief and the proceedings are still pending. The impact of Order
2003 and its subsequent rehearings on the Company and the final results of these matters cannot
be determined at this time.

Market-Based Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to nonaffiliates at market-based prices.
Through SCS, as agent, the Company also has FERC authority to make short-term opportunity sales at
market rates. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a market-based contract with
an affiliate. In November 2001, the FERC modified the test it uses to consider utilities’
applications to charge market-based rates and adopted a new test called the Supply Margin
Assessment (SMA). The FERC applied the SMA to several utilities, including Southern Company, the
retail operating companies, and Southern Power, and found Southern Company and others to be
“pivotal suppliers” in their retail service territories and ordered the implementation of several
mitigation measures. Southern Company and others sought rehearing of the
FERC order, and the FERC delayed the implementation of certain mitigation measures. In April 2004,
the FERC issued an order that abandoned the SMA test and adopted a new interim analysis for
measuring generation market power. This new interim approach requires utilities to submit a
pivotal supplier screen and a wholesale market share screen. If the applicant does not pass both
screens, there will be a rebuttable presumption regarding generation market power. The FERC’s
order also sets forth procedures for rebutting these presumptions and addresses mitigation measures
for those entities that are found to have market power. In the absence of specific mitigation
measures, the order includes several cost-based mitigation measures that would apply by default.
The FERC also initiated a new rulemaking proceeding that, among other things, will adopt a final
methodology for assessing generation market power.

In July 2004, the FERC denied Southern Company’s request for rehearing, along with a number
of others, and reaffirmed the interim tests that it adopted in April 2004. In August 2004,
Southern Company submitted a filing to the FERC which included results showing that Southern
Company passed the pivotal supplier screen for all markets and the wholesale market share screen
for all markets except the Southern Company retail service territory. Southern Company also
submitted other analyses to demonstrate that it lacks generation market power. On December 17,
2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation dominance within
its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other markets is not
at issue. As directed by this order, on February 15, 2005, Southern Company submitted
additional information related to generation dominance in its retail service territory. Any new
market-based rate transactions in the Southern Company retail service territory entered into
after February 27, 2005 will be subject to refund to the level of the default cost-based rates,
pending the outcome of the proceeding. Southern Company, along with other utilities, has also
filed an appeal of the FERC’s April and July 2004 orders with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit. The FERC has asked the court to dismiss the appeal on the grounds
that it is premature.

In the event that the FERC’s default mitigation measures are ultimately applied, the
Company may be required to charge cost-based rates for certain wholesale sales in the Southern
Company retail service territory, which may be lower than negotiated

II-133


MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2004 Annual Report

market-based rates. The final outcome of this matter will depend on the form in which the final
methodology for assessing generation market power and mitigation rules may be ultimately adopted
and cannot be determined at this time.

Retail Rate Case

On December 21, 2004, the Georgia PSC approved the 2004 Retail Rate Plan for the three-year
period ending December 31, 2007. Under the terms of the 2004 Retail Rate Plan, earnings will be
evaluated annually against a retail ROE range of 10.25 percent to 12.25 percent. Two-thirds of
any earnings above 12.25 percent will be applied to rate refunds, with the remaining one-third
retained by the Company. Retail rates will be increased by approximately $194 million and
customer fees will be increased by approximately $9 million effective January 1, 2005 to cover
the higher costs of purchased power; operating and maintenance expenses; environmental
compliance; and continued investment in new generation, transmission and distribution facilities
to support growth and ensure reliability.

The Company will not file for a general base rate increase unless its projected retail ROE
falls below 10.25 percent. The Company is required to file a general rate case by July 1, 2007, in
response to which the Georgia PSC would be expected to determine whether the 2004 Retail Rate Plan
should be continued, modified or discontinued. See Note 3 to the financial statements under
“Retail Rate Orders” for additional information.

Plant McIntosh Construction Project

In December 2002 after a competitive bidding process, the Georgia PSC certified PPAs between
Southern Power and the Company and Savannah Electric and Power Company (Savannah Electric) for
capacity from Plant McIntosh Units 10 and 11, construction of which is scheduled to be completed
in June 2005. In April 2003, Southern Power applied for FERC approval of these PPAs. In July
2003, the FERC accepted the PPAs to become effective June 1, 2005, subject to refund, and
ordered that hearings be held. Intervenors opposed the FERC’s acceptance of the PPAs, alleging
that they did not meet the applicable standards for market-based rates between affiliates. To
ensure the timely completion of the Plant McIntosh construction project and the availability of
the units in the summer of 2005 for their retail customers, in May 2004, the Company and
Savannah Electric requested the Georgia PSC to direct them to acquire the McIntosh construction
project. The Georgia PSC issued such an order and the transfer occurred on May 24, 2004 at a
total cost of approximately $415 million, including $14 million of transmission interconnection
facilities. Subsequently, Southern Power filed a request to withdraw the PPAs and to terminate
the ongoing FERC proceedings. In August 2004, the FERC issued a notice accepting the request to
withdraw the PPAs and permitting such request to become effective by operation of law.
However, the FERC made no determination on what additional steps may need to be taken with
respect to testimony provided in the proceedings. The ultimate outcome of any additional FERC
action cannot now be determined at this time.

As directed by the Georgia PSC order, in June 2004, the Company and Savannah Electric filed
an application to amend the resource certificate granted by the Georgia PSC in 2002 to change
the character of the resource from a PPA to a self-owned, rate based asset and to describe the
approximate construction schedule and the proposed rate base treatment. In connection with the
2004 Retail Rate Plan, the Georgia PSC approved the transfer of the Plant McIntosh construction
project at a total fair market value of approximately $385 million. This value reflects an
approximate $16 million disallowance, of which $13 million is attributable to the Company, and
reduced the Company’s net income by approximately $8 million. The Georgia PSC also certified a
total completion cost of $547 million for the project. The amount of the disallowance will be
adjusted accordingly based on the actual completion cost of the project. Under the 2004 Retail
Rate Plan, the Plant McIntosh revenue requirements impact will be reflected in the Company’s
rates evenly over the three years ending 2007. See Note 3 to the financial statements under
“Retail Rate Orders” and “Plant McIntosh Construction Project” for additional information.

Retail Fuel Cost Recovery

The Company has established fuel cost recovery rates approved by the Georgia PSC. In recent
months, the Company has experienced higher than expected fuel costs for coal and gas. Those higher
fuel costs have increased the under recovered fuel costs included in the balance sheets herein. On
February 18, 2005, the Company filed a request with the Georgia PSC for a fuel cost recovery rate
increase. In the ordinary course, these

II-134


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2004 Annual Report

new rates will be effective June 1, 2005 following a hearing before and approval by the Georgia
PSC. In its filing, the Company asked that the Georgia PSC accept the new rate, effective April 1,
2005, prior to a formal hearing on the Company’s request. This action, if taken by the Georgia
PSC, would serve to mitigate expected increases in the under recovered balance during April and
May, but will not preclude the Georgia PSC from subsequently adjusting the rates. The requested
increase, representing an annual increase in revenues of approximately 11.7 percent, will allow for
the recovery of fuel costs based on an estimate of future fuel costs, as well as the collection of
the existing under recovery of fuel costs. The Company’s under recovered fuel costs as of January
31, 2005 totaled $390 million. The Georgia PSC will examine the Company’s fuel expenditures and
determine whether the proposed fuel cost recovery rate is just and reasonable before issuing its
decision in May 2005. The final outcome of the filing cannot be determined at this time. See Note
3 to the financial statements under “Fuel Cost Recovery” for further information regarding this
filing.

Storm Damage Cost Recovery

During the month of September 2004, the Company’s service territory was impacted by Hurricanes
Frances, Ivan and Jeanne. The Company maintains a reserve for property damage to cover the cost
of damages from major storms to its transmission and distribution lines and the cost of
uninsured damages to its generation facilities and other property as mandated by the Georgia
PSC. The total amount of damage related to these hurricanes was estimated to be approximately
$15 million and was charged to the storm damage reserve in 2004. These costs are expected to be
recovered through regular monthly accruals which total $6.3 million annually under the 2004
Retail Rate Plan. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Rate Orders” for
additional information.

Other Matters

In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 87, Employers’
Accounting for Pensions, the Company recorded non-cash pension income, before tax, of approximately
$35 million, $54 million, and $59 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Future pension
income is dependent on several factors including trust earnings and changes to the pension plan.
The decline in pension income is expected to continue and to become an expense by as early as 2007.
Postretirement benefit costs for the Company were $44 million, $41 million and $43 million in
2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively, and are expected to trend upward. A portion of pension income
and postretirement benefit costs is capitalized based on construction-related labor charges. For
the Company, pension income or expense and postretirement benefit costs are a component of the
regulated rates and generally do not have a long-term effect on net income. For more information
regarding pension and postretirement benefits, see Note 2 to the financial statements.

On October 22, 2004, President Bush signed the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Jobs Act)
into law. The Jobs Act includes a provision that allows a generation tax deduction for utilities.
The Company is currently assessing the impact of the Jobs Act, including this deduction, as well as
the related regulatory treatment, on its taxable income. However, the Company currently does not
expect the Jobs Act to have a material impact on its financial statements.

The Company is involved in various other matters being litigated, regulatory matters, and
related issues that could affect future earnings. See Note 3 to the financial statements for
information regarding material issues.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may
have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations and related disclosures.
Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different
from those recorded in the financial statements. Southern Company senior management has
discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates
described below with the Audit Committee of Southern Company’s Board of Directors.

II-135


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2004 Annual Report

Electric Utility Regulation

The Company is subject to retail regulation by the Georgia PSC and wholesale regulation by the
FERC. These regulatory agencies set the rates the Company is permitted to charge customers
based on allowable costs. As a result, the Company applies FASB Statement No. 71, Accounting
for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, which requires the financial statements to
reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the ratemaking process, the regulators may
require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when they would be
recognized by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of expenses
and the recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery through
rates or the deferral of gains or creation of liabilities and the recording of related
regulatory liabilities. The application of Statement No. 71 has a further effect on the
Company’s financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the
ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from those actually incurred by the Company;
therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation, nuclear
decommissioning, and pension and postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on the
Company’s results of operations than they would on a non-regulated company.

As reflected in Note 1 to the financial statements, significant regulatory assets and
liabilities have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of these
regulatory assets and liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines. However, adverse
legislative, judicial or regulatory actions could materially impact the amounts of such
regulatory assets and liabilities and could adversely impact the Company’s financial statements.

Contingent Obligations

The Company is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other
factors and conditions that potentially subject it to environmental, litigation, income tax, and
other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Note 3 to the financial statements for
more information regarding certain of these contingencies. The Company periodically evaluates
its exposure to such risks and records reserves for those matters where a loss is considered
probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or conditions that can
be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially affect the
Company’s financial statements. These events or conditions include the following:

Unbilled Revenues

Revenues related to the sale of electricity are recorded when electricity is delivered to
customers. However, the determination of KWH sales to individual customers is based on the reading
of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each
month, amounts of electricity delivered to customers, but not yet metered and billed, are
estimated. Components of the unbilled revenue estimates include total KWH territorial supply,
total KWH billed, estimated total electricity lost in delivery, and customer usage. These
components can fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including weather, generation patterns,
power delivery volume and other power delivery operational constraints. These factors can be
unpredictable and can vary from historical trends. As a result, the overall estimate of unbilled
revenues could be significantly affected, which could have a material impact on the Company’s
results of operations.

Georgia Power Company 2004 Annual Report

New Accounting Standards

On March 31, 2004, the Company prospectively adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46R, “Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities,” which requires the primary beneficiary of a variable interest
entity to consolidate the related assets and liabilities. The adoption of FASB Interpretation
No. 46R had no impact on the Company’s net income. However, as a result of the adoption, the
Company deconsolidated certain wholly-owned trusts established to issue preferred securities
since the Company did not meet the definition of primary beneficiary established by FASB
Interpretation No. 46R. See Note 1 to the financial statements under “Variable Interest
Entities” for additional information.

In the third quarter 2004, the Company prospectively adopted FASB Staff Position (FSP)
106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act). The Medicare Act provides a 28
percent prescription drug subsidy for Medicare eligible retirees. FSP 106-2 requires
recognition of the impacts of the Medicare Act in the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation (APBO) and future cost of service for postretirement medical plans. The effect of
the subsidy reduced the Company’s expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2004 by
approximately $5 million and is expected to have a similar impact on future expenses. The
subsidy’s impact on the postretirement medical plan APBO was a reduction of approximately $72
million. However, the ultimate impact on future periods is subject to final interpretation of
the federal regulations which were published on January 21, 2005. See Note 2 to the financial
statements under “Postretirement Benefits” for additional information.

FASB Statement No. 123R, Share-Based Payments, was issued in December 2004. This statement
requires that compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions be recognized in
financial statements. That cost will be measured based on the grant date
fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. For the Company, this statement is
effective beginning July 1, 2005. Although the compensation expense calculation required under
the revised statement differs slightly, the impacts on the financial statements are expected to
be similar to the pro forma disclosures included in Note 1 to the financial statements under
“Stock Options.”

See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “Other Matters” herein for information regarding the
adoption of new tax legislation. In December 2004, the FASB issued FSP 109-1, Application of
FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified
Production Activities provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004, which
requires that the generation deduction be accounted for as a special tax deduction rather than
as a tax rate reduction. The Company is currently assessing the Jobs Act and this
pronouncement, as well as the related regulatory treatment, but currently does not expect a
material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

Over the last several years, the Company’s financial condition has remained stable with emphasis on
cost control measures combined with significantly lower costs of capital, achieved through the
refinancing and/or redemption of higher-cost securities. Cash flow from operations decreased $219
million resulting primarily from the increase in under recovered deferred fuel costs.

In 2004, gross utility plant additions were $1.1 billion. These additions were primarily
related to the construction of Plant McIntosh Units 10 and 11, transmission and distribution
facilities, and the purchase of nuclear fuel and equipment to comply with environmental standards.
The majority of funds needed for gross property additions for the last several years have been
provided from operating activities and capital contributions from Southern Company. The statements
of cash flows provide additional details.

The Company’s ratio of common equity to total capitalization — including short-term debt —
was 47.7 percent in 2004 and 48.3 percent in 2003 and 2002. See Note 6 to the financial statements
for additional information.

Sources of Capital

The Company expects to meet future capital requirements primarily using funds generated from
operating activities and capital contributions from

II-137


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2004 Annual Report

Southern Company and by the issuance of new debt securities, term loans, and short-term borrowings.
The type and timing of future financings will depend on market conditions and regulatory approval
of additional financing authority. Recently, the Company has relied on the issuance of unsecured
securities to meet its long-term external financing requirements.

The issuance of securities by the Company is subject to regulatory approval by the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended
(PUHCA), and by the Georgia PSC. Additionally, with respect to the public offering of securities,
the Company must file registration statements with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (1933 Act). The amounts of securities authorized by the appropriate regulatory
authorities, as well as the amounts registered under the 1933 Act, are continuously monitored and
appropriate filings are made to ensure flexibility in the capital markets.

The Company obtains financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. The
Southern Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of
the Company are not commingled with funds of any other company. In accordance with the PUHCA, most
loans between affiliated companies must be approved in advance by the SEC.

The Company’s current liabilities frequently exceed current assets because of the continued
use of short-term debt as a funding source to meet cash needs which can fluctuate significantly due
to the seasonality of the business.

To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the Company had approximately $773.1 million
of unused credit arrangements with banks at the beginning of 2005. See Note 6 to the financial
statements under “Bank Credit Arrangements” for additional information.

The Company may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company subsidiary
organized to issue and sell commercial paper and extendible commercial notes at the request and for
the benefit of the Company and the other Southern Company operating companies. Proceeds from such
issuances for the benefit of the Company are loaned directly to the Company and are not commingled
with proceeds from issuances for the benefits of any other operating company. The obligations of
each company under these arrangements are several; there is no cross affiliate credit support. As
of December 31, 2004, the Company had outstanding $208 million of commercial paper and no
extendible commercial notes.

At the beginning of 2005, the Company had not used any of its available credit arrangements.
Bank credit arrangements are as follows:

The credit arrangements that expire in 2005 allow for the execution of term loans for an
additional two-year period.

Financing Activities

During 2004, the Company issued $806 million of long-term debt including long-term debt payable to
affiliated trusts. The issuances were used to refund $400 million of long-term debt, as well as to
finance the Company’s purchase of the Plant McIntosh construction project from Southern Power. The
remainder was used to reduce short-term debt and fund the Company’s ongoing construction program.

Subsequent to December 31, 2004, the Company has issued $250 million of securities with the
proceeds used to fund the February 2005 maturity of floating rate senior notes.

Credit Rating Risk

The Company does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment
schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. There are certain contracts
that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change
to BBB- or Baa3 or below. Generally, collateral may be provided for by a Southern Company
guaranty, letter of credit or cash. These contracts are primarily for physical electricity
purchases and sales. At December 31, 2004, the maximum potential collateral requirements at a BBB-
or Baa3 rating were approximately $8 million. The

II-138


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2004 Annual Report

maximum potential collateral requirements at a
rating below BBB- or Baa3 were approximately $247 million. The Company is also party to certain
derivative agreements that could require collateral and/or accelerated payment in the event of a
credit rating change to below investment grade. These agreements are primarily for natural gas
price and interest rate risk management activities. At December 31, 2004, the Company had no
material exposure related to these agreements.

Market Price Risk

Due to cost-based regulations, the Company has limited exposure to market volatility in interest
rates, commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity. To manage the volatility attributable to
these exposures, the Company nets the exposures to take advantage of natural offsets and enters
into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to the Company’s policies
in areas such as counterparty exposure and hedging practices. Company policy is that derivatives
are to be used primarily for hedging purposes. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques
that include market valuation and sensitivity analysis.

To mitigate exposure to interest rates, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps that
have been designated as hedges. The weighted average interest rate on outstanding variable
long-term debt that has not been hedged at January 1, 2005 was 2.04 percent. If the Company
sustained a 100 basis point change in interest rates for all unhedged variable rate long-term debt,
the change would affect annualized interest expense by approximately $8 million at January 1, 2005.
The Company is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly affect such
exposures in the near term. For further information, see Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements
under “Financial Instruments.”

To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the Company enters
into fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale
electricity market and, to a lesser extent, into similar contracts for gas purchases.

The Company has implemented a fuel hedging program at the instruction of the Georgia PSC.

is exposed to market price risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the
derivative energy contracts. The Company’s policy is to enter into agreements with counterparties
that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s or with counterparties
who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. Therefore, the Company does not
anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the counterparties. For additional
information, see Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements under “Financial Instruments.”

Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations

The construction program of the Company is currently estimated to be $911 million for 2005, $1.1
billion for 2006, and $1.2 billion for 2007. Environmental expenditures included in these amounts
are $127 million, $284 million, and $506 million for 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively. Actual
construction costs may vary from this estimate because of changes in such factors as: business
conditions; environmental regulations; nuclear plant regulations; FERC rules and transmission
regulations; load projections; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and
materials; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to
capital expenditures will be fully recovered.

The Company currently has under construction Plant McIntosh Units 10 and 11 scheduled for
completion in June 2005. In addition, construction related to new transmission and distribution
facilities and capital improvements to existing generation, transmission and distribution
facilities, including those needed to meet the environmental standards previously discussed, are
ongoing.

As a result of requirements by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Company has established
external trust funds for nuclear decommissioning costs. For additional information, see Note 1 to
the financial statements under “Nuclear Decommissioning.” Also as discussed in Note 1 to the
financial statements under “Fuel Costs,” in 1993 the DOE implemented a special assessment over a
15-year period on utilities with nuclear plants to be used for the decontamination and
decommissioning of its nuclear fuel enrichment facilities.

In addition, as discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company provides
postretirement benefits to substantially all employees and funds trusts to the extent required by
the Georgia PSC and the FERC.

Other funding requirements related to obligations associated with scheduled maturities of
long-term debt and preferred securities and the related interest, preferred stock dividends, leases, and
other purchase commitments are as follows. See Notes 1, 6, and 7 to the financial statements
for additional information.

pension plans, including estimated benefit payments. Certain benefit payments will
be made through the related trusts. Other benefit payments will be made
from the Company’s corporate assets.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

Georgia Power Company 2004 Annual Report

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General

Georgia Power Company (Company) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company, which is the
parent company of five retail operating companies, Southern Power Company (Southern Power),
Southern Company Services (SCS), Southern Communications Services (SouthernLINC Wireless), Southern
Company Gas (Southern Company GAS), Southern Company Holdings (Southern Holdings), Southern Nuclear
Operating Company (Southern Nuclear), Southern Telecom, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries.
The retail operating companies — Alabama Power, the Company, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, and
Savannah Electric — provide electric service in four Southeastern states. Southern Power
constructs, owns, and manages Southern Company’s competitive generation assets and sells
electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Contracts among the retail operating
companies and Southern Power — related to jointly owned generating facilities, interconnecting
transmission lines, or the exchange of electric power — are regulated by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) and/or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). SCS — the
system service company — provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and the
subsidiary companies. SouthernLINC Wireless provides digital wireless communications services to
the retail operating companies and also markets these services to the public within the Southeast.
Southern Telecom provides fiber cable services within the Southeast. Southern Company GAS is a
competitive retail natural gas marketer serving customers in Georgia. Southern Holdings is an
intermediate holding subsidiary for Southern Company’s investments in synthetic fuels and leveraged
leases and various other energy-related businesses. Southern Nuclear operates and provides
services to Southern Company’s nuclear power plants.

Southern Company is registered as a holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, as amended (PUHCA). Both Southern Company and its subsidiaries are subject to the
regulatory provisions of the PUHCA. In addition, the Company is subject to regulation by the FERC
and the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC). The Company follows accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States and complies with the accounting policies and practices
prescribed by its regulatory commissions. The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the use of estimates
and the actual results may differ from those estimates.

Certain prior years’ data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to
conform with current year presentation.

Affiliate Transactions

The Company has an agreement with SCS under which the following services are rendered to the
Company at direct or allocated cost: general and design engineering, purchasing, accounting and
statistical analysis, finance and treasury, tax, information resources, marketing, auditing,
insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, and other services
with respect to business and operations and power pool operations. Costs for these services
amounted to $292 million in 2004, $303 million in 2003, and $318 million in 2002. Cost allocation
methodologies used by SCS are approved by the SEC and management believes they are reasonable.

The Company has an agreement with Southern Nuclear under which the following nuclear-related
services are rendered to the Company at cost: general executive and advisory services; general
operations, management and technical services; administrative services including procurement,
accounting, employee relations, and systems and procedures services; strategic planning and
budgeting services; and other services with respect to business and operations. Costs for these
services amounted to $311 million in 2004, $289 million in 2003, and $301 million in 2002.

The Company has an agreement with Southern Power under which the Company operates and
maintains Southern Power owned plants Dahlberg, Franklin, Wansley, and Stanton at cost.
Reimbursements under these agreements with Southern Power amounted to $4.9 million in 2004, $5.3
million in 2003, and $5.3 million in 2002.

The Company has an agreement with SouthernLINC Wireless under which the Company receives
digital wireless communications services and purchases digital equipment. Costs for these services
amounted to $7.7

II-149


NOTES (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2004 Annual Report

million in 2004, $7.4 million in 2003 and $5.9 million in 2002.

Southern Company holds a 30 percent ownership in Alabama Fuel Products, LLC (AFP), which
produces synthetic fuel. The Company has an agreement with an indirect subsidiary of Southern
Company that provides services for AFP. Under this agreement, the Company provides certain
accounting functions, including processing and paying fuel transportation invoices, and the Company
is reimbursed for its expenses. Amounts billed under this agreement totaled approximately $53
million in 2004 and $38 million in 2003. In addition, the Company purchases synthetic fuel from
AFP for use at plants Branch, McDonough, and Bowen. Fuel purchases totaled $163 million in 2004
and $91 million in 2003.

The Company has entered into several purchased power agreements (PPAs) with Southern Power for
capacity and energy. Purchased power costs were $282 million, $203 million and $128 million in
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Additionally, the Company recorded $11 million and $7 million
of prepaid capacity expenses included on the balance sheets at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. See Note 7 under “Purchased Power Commitments” for additional information.

The Company has an agreement with Gulf Power under which Gulf Power jointly owns a portion of
Plant Scherer. Under this agreement, the Company operates Plant Scherer and Gulf Power reimburses
the Company for its proportionate share of the related expenses which were $6.8 million in 2004,
$4.9 million in 2003, and $4.5 million in 2002. The Company has an agreement with Savannah
Electric under which the Company jointly owns a portion of Plant McIntosh. Under this agreement,
Savannah Electric operates Plant McIntosh and the Company reimburses Savannah Electric for its
proportionate share of the related expenses which were $3.3 million in 2004, $3.7 million in 2003,
and $2.2 million in 2002. See Note 4 for additional information.

Also see Note 4 for information regarding the Company’s ownership in and purchased power
agreement with Southern Electric Generating Company (SEGCO) and Note 5 for information on certain
deferred tax liabilities due to affiliates.

The retail operating companies, including the Company, Southern Power, and Southern Company
GAS, may jointly enter into various types of wholesale energy, natural gas and certain other
contracts, either directly or through SCS as agent. Each participating company may be jointly and
severally liable for the obligations incurred under these agreements. See Note 7 under “Fuel
Commitments” for additional information.

Revenues

Energy and other revenues are recognized as services are provided. Unbilled revenues are accrued
at the end of each fiscal period. Electric rates for the Company include provisions to adjust
billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, fuel hedging, the energy component of purchased power
costs, and certain other costs. Revenues are adjusted for differences between recoverable costs
and amounts billed in current regulated rates.

The Company has a diversified base of customers. No single customer or industry comprises 10
percent or more of revenues. For all periods presented, uncollectible accounts averaged less than
1 percent of revenues despite an increase in customer bankruptcies.

Fuel Costs

Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is used. Fuel expense includes the cost of purchased emission
allowances as they are used. Fuel expense also includes the amortization of the cost of nuclear
fuel and a charge, based on nuclear generation, for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel.
Total charges for nuclear fuel included in fuel expense amounted to $73 million in 2004, $74
million in 2003, and $71 million in 2002. The Company has contracts with the Department of Energy
(DOE) that provide for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin
disposing of spent nuclear fuel in 1998 as required by the contracts, and the Company is pursuing
legal remedies against the government for breach of contract. Sufficient pool storage capacity for
spent fuel is available at Plant Vogtle to maintain full-core discharge capability for both units
into 2015. Construction of an on-site dry storage facility at Plant Vogtle is expected to begin in
sufficient time to maintain pool full-core discharge capability. At Plant Hatch, an on-site dry
storage facility became operational in 2000 and can be expanded to accommodate spent fuel through
the life of the plant.

II-150


NOTES (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2004 Annual Report

Also, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 required the establishment of a Uranium Enrichment
Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund, which is funded in part by a special assessment on
utilities with nuclear plants. This assessment is being paid over a 15-year period, ending in
2008. This fund will be used by the DOE for the decontamination and decommissioning of its nuclear
fuel enrichment facilities. The law provides that utilities will recover these payments in the
same manner as any other fuel expense. The Company — based on its ownership interest — estimates
its remaining liability at December 31, 2004 under this law to be approximately $7 million.

Income Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provides deferred
income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences. Investment tax credits utilized
are deferred and amortized to income over the average lives of the related property.

Manufacturer’s Tax Credits

The State of Georgia provides a tax credit for qualified investment property to manufacturing
companies that construct new facilities. The credit ranges from 1 percent to 8 percent of
qualified construction expenditures depending upon the county in which the new facility is located.
The Company’s policy is to recognize these credits when management believes that they are more
likely than not to be allowed by the Georgia Department of Revenue. Manufacturer’s tax credits of
$12.9 million, $12.0 million, and $4.7 million were recorded on the Company’s books in 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

The Company is subject to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement
No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. Regulatory assets represent
probable future revenues associated with certain costs that are expected to be recovered from
customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future
reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be credited to customers
through the ratemaking process.

Regulatory assets and (liabilities) reflected in the Company’s balance sheets at December 31
relate to the following:

Note:

The recovery and amortization periods for these regulatory assets and (liabilities) are as follows:

(a)

Asset retirement and removal liabilities are recorded, deferred income tax assets are
recovered, and deferred tax liabilities are amortized over the related property lives, which
may range up to 60 years. Asset retirement and removal liabilities will be settled and trued
up following completion of the related activities.

(b)

Recovered over either the remaining life of the original issue or, if refinanced, over the
life of the new issue which may range up to 50 years.

(c)

Assessments for the decontamination and decommissioning of the DOE’s nuclear fuel enrichment
facilities are recorded annually from 1993 through 2008.

(d)

Recorded as earned by employees and recovered as paid, generally within one year.

(e)

Amortized over a three-year period ending in 2004. See Note 3 under “Retail Rate Orders.”

(f)

Recorded and recovered or amortized as approved by the Georgia PSC.

(g)

Amortized over a three-year period
ending in 2007. See Note 3 under “Retail Rate Orders.”

(h)

See “Property, Plant, and Equipment” herein.

In the event that a portion of the Company’s operations is no longer subject to the
provisions of Statement No. 71, the Company would be required to write off related regulatory
assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable through regulated rates. In addition,
the Company would be required to determine if any impairment to other assets, including plant,
exists and, if impaired, write down the assets to their fair value. All regulatory assets and
liabilities are reflected in rates.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation of the original cost of plant in service is provided primarily by using composite
straight-line rates, which approximated 2.6 percent in 2004, 2.7 percent in 2003, and 2.9 percent
in 2002. Under a new retail rate plan for the Company ending December 31, 2007 (2004 Retail Rate
Plan), the depreciation rates have been revised by the Georgia PSC. When property subject to
depreciation is retired or otherwise disposed of in the normal course of business, its original
cost — together with the cost of removal, less salvage — is charged to accumulated depreciation.
Minor items of property included in the original cost of the plant are retired when the related
property unit is retired.

Under the three-year retail rate plan for the Company ending December 31, 2004 (2001 Retail
Rate Plan), the Company discontinued recording accelerated depreciation and amortization. Also,
the Company was ordered to amortize $333 million — the cumulative balance previously expensed —
equally over three years as a credit to amortization expense beginning January 2002.
Additionally, the Company was ordered to recognize new Georgia PSC certified purchased power costs
in rates evenly over the three years covered by the 2001 Retail Rate Plan. As a result of the
purchased power regulatory adjustment, the Company recorded amortization expenses of $14 million
and $63 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company recorded a credit to amortization
expense of $77 million in 2004. See Note 3 under “Retail Rate Orders” for additional information.

Asset Retirement
Obligations and Other Costs of Removal

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations. Statement No. 143 established new accounting and reporting standards for
legal obligations associated with the ultimate costs of retiring long-lived assets. The present
value of the ultimate costs for an asset’s future retirement is recorded in the period in which
the liability is incurred. The costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and
depreciated over the asset’s useful life. Although Statement No. 143 does not permit the
continued accrual of future retirement costs for long-lived assets that the Company does not have
a legal obligation to retire, the Company has received accounting guidance from the Georgia PSC
allowing such treatment. Accordingly, the accumulated removal costs for other obligations
previously accrued will continue to be reflected on the balance sheets as a regulatory liability.
Therefore, the Company had no cumulative effect to net income resulting from the adoption of
Statement No. 143.

The liability recognized to retire long-lived assets primarily relates to the Company’s
nuclear facilities, which include the Company’s ownership interests in plants Hatch and Vogtle.
The fair value of assets legally restricted for settling retirement obligations related to nuclear
facilities as of December 31, 2004 was $459 million. In addition, the Company has recognized
retirement obligations related to various landfill sites, ash ponds, and underground storage tanks.
The Company has also identified retirement obligations related to certain transmission and
distribution facilities, leasehold improvements, equipment on customer property, and property
associated with the Company’s rail lines. However, liabilities for the removal of these facilities
have not been recorded because no reasonable estimate can be made regarding the timing of any
related retirements. The Company will continue to recognize in the statements of income the
ultimate removal costs in accordance with its regulatory treatment. Any difference between costs
recognized under Statement No. 143 and those reflected in rates will be recognized as either a
regulatory asset or liability in the balance sheets. In 2003, the Company revised the estimated
cost to retire plants Hatch and Vogtle as a result of a new 2003 site-specific decommissioning
study. The effect of the revision is a decrease of $24 million for the Statement No. 143 liability
included in “Asset Retirement Obligations” with a corresponding decrease in property, plant and
equipment. See “Nuclear Decommissioning” herein for further information on amounts included in
rates.

Nuclear Decommissioning

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requires licensees of commercial nuclear power reactors
to establish a plan for providing reasonable assurance of funds for future decommissioning. The
Company has established external trust funds to comply with the NRC’s regulations. The funds set
aside for decommissioning are managed and invested in accordance with applicable requirements of
various regulatory bodies, including the NRC, the FERC, and the Georgia PSC as well as the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Funds are invested in a tax efficient manner in a diversified mix
of equity and fixed income securities. Equity securities typically range from 50 to 75 percent of
the funds and fixed income securities from 25 to 50 percent. Amounts previously recorded in
internal reserves are being transferred into the external trust funds over periods approved by the
Georgia PSC. The NRC’s minimum external funding requirements are based on a generic estimate of
the cost to decommission only the radioactive portions of a nuclear unit based on the size and
type of reactor. The Company has filed plans with the NRC to ensure that — over time — the
deposits and earnings of the external trust funds will provide the minimum funding amounts
prescribed by the NRC.

Site study cost is the estimate to decommission a specific facility as of the site study year.
The estimated costs of decommissioning based on the most current
study as of December 31, 2004 for the Company’s ownership interests in plants Hatch and Vogtle were
as follows:

The decommissioning cost estimates are based on prompt dismantlement and removal of the
plant from service. The actual decommissioning costs may vary from the above estimates because of
changes in the assumed date of decommissioning, changes in NRC requirements, or changes in the
assumptions used in making these estimates.

Annual provisions for nuclear decommissioning are based on an annuity method as approved by
the Georgia PSC. The amount expensed in 2004 and fund balances were as follows:

Based on the 2001 Retail Rate Plan, effective January 1, 2002, the Georgia PSC decreased the
annual decommissioning costs for ratemaking to $9 million. This amount was based on the NRC
generic estimate to decommission the radioactive portion of the facilities as of 2000. The
estimates were $383 million and $282 million for plants Hatch and Vogtle, respectively.
Significant assumptions used to determine the costs for ratemaking included an estimated inflation
rate of 4.7 percent and an estimated trust earnings rate of 6.5 percent.

II-153


NOTES (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2004 Annual Report

Effective January 1, 2005, the Georgia PSC has ordered the annual decommissioning costs for
ratemaking be decreased from $9 million to $7 million. This amount is based on the NRC generic
estimate to decommission the radioactive portion of the facilities as of 2003. The estimates are
$421 million and $326 million for plants Hatch and Vogtle, respectively. Significant assumptions
used to determine the costs for ratemaking include an estimated inflation rate of 3.1 percent and
an estimated trust earnings rate of 5.1 percent. Another significant assumption used was the
change in the operating license for Plant Hatch. In January 2002, the NRC granted the Company a
20-year extension of the licenses for both units at Plant Hatch which permits the operation of
units 1 and 2 until 2034 and 2038, respectively. The Company expects the Georgia PSC to
periodically review and adjust, if necessary, the amounts collected in rates for the anticipated
cost of decommissioning.

Allowance for Funds Used
During Construction (AFUDC) and Interest Capitalized

In accordance with regulatory treatment, the Company records AFUDC. AFUDC represents the estimated
debt and equity costs of capital funds that are necessary to finance the construction of new
regulated facilities. While cash is not realized currently from such allowance, it increases the
revenue requirement over the service life of the plant through a higher rate base and higher
depreciation expense. Interest related to the construction of new facilities not included in the
Company’s retail rates is capitalized in accordance with standard interest capitalization
requirements. For the years 2004, 2003, and 2002, the average AFUDC rates were 8.22 percent, 5.51
percent, and 3.79 percent, respectively. AFUDC and interest capitalized, net of taxes, were 4.9
percent of net income after dividends on preferred stock for 2004 and less than 3 percent for 2003
and 2002.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost, less regulatory disallowances and
impairments. Original cost includes: materials; labor; minor items of property; appropriate
administrative and general costs; payroll-related costs such as taxes, pensions, and other
benefits; and the interest capitalized and/or cost of funds used during construction.

The cost of replacements of property — exclusive of minor items of property — is
capitalized. The cost of maintenance, repairs, and replacement of minor items of property is
charged to maintenance expense as incurred or performed with the exception of certain generating
plant maintenance costs. As mandated by the Georgia PSC, the Company defers and amortizes nuclear
refueling costs over the unit’s operating cycle before the next refueling. The refueling cycles
are 18 and 24 months for plants Vogtle and Hatch, respectively. In accordance with the 2001 Retail
Rate Plan, the Company defers the costs of certain significant inspection costs for the combustion
turbines at Plant McIntosh and amortizes such costs over 10 years, which approximates the expected
maintenance cycle.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles

The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of
whether an impairment has occurred is based on either a specific regulatory disallowance or an
estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared with the
carrying value of the assets. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment
recognized is determined by either the amount of regulatory disallowance or by estimating the fair
value of the assets and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. For
assets identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value less
the cost to sell in order to determine if an impairment provision is required. Until the assets
are disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or events change.
See Note 3 under “Retail Rate Orders” and “Plant McIntosh Construction Project” for information
regarding the disallowance of Plant McIntosh costs under the 2004 Retail Rate Plan.

Storm Damage Reserve

The Company maintains a reserve for property damage to cover the cost of damages from major
storms to its transmission and distribution lines and the cost of uninsured damages to its
generation facilities and other property as mandated by the Georgia PSC. These costs are
expected to be recovered through regular monthly accruals which
total $6.3 million annually under the 2004 Retail Rate Plan.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are considered cash
equivalents. Temporary cash investments are securities with original maturities of 90 days or
less.

Materials and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include the average costs of transmission, distribution, and
generating plant materials. Materials are charged to inventory when purchased and then expensed or
capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when installed.

Stock Options

Southern Company provides non-qualified stock options to a large segment of the Company’s
employees ranging from line management to executives. The Company accounts for its stock-based
compensation plans in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25. Accordingly,
no compensation expense has been recognized because the exercise price of all options granted
equaled the fair-market value of Southern Company’s common stock on the date of grant. When
options are exercised, the Company receives a capital contribution from Southern Company
equivalent to the related income-tax benefit.

The pro forma impact of fair-value accounting for options granted on earnings is as

Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposures to fluctuations in interest
rates, the prices of certain fuel purchases and electricity purchases and sales. All derivative
financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair
value.

The Company and its affiliates, through SCS acting as their agent, enter into commodity
related forward and option contracts to limit exposure to changing prices on certain fuel purchases
and electricity purchases and sales. Substantially all of the Company’s bulk energy purchases and
sales contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are exempt from fair value accounting
requirements and are accounted for under the accrual method. Other derivative contracts qualify as
cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions. This results in the deferral of related gains and
losses in other comprehensive income or regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate until the
hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness is recognized currently in net income. Other
derivative contracts are marked to market through current period income and are recorded on a net
basis in the statements of income.

The Company is exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of
counterparties’ nonperformance. The Company has established controls to determine and monitor
the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate the Company’s exposure to
counterparty credit risk.

Comprehensive Income

The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of all changes in common stock equity
of an enterprise that result from transactions and other economic events of the period other than
transactions with owners. Comprehensive income consists of net income, changes in the fair value
of marketable securities and qualifying cash flow hedges, and changes in additional minimum pension
liability, less income taxes less reclassifications for amounts included in net income.

Variable Interest Entities

On March 31, 2004, the Company prospectively adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46R, “Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities,” which requires the primary beneficiary of a variable interest
entity to consolidate the related assets and liabilities. The adoption of Interpretation No.
46R had no impact on the net income of the Company. However, as a result of the adoption, the
Company deconsolidated certain wholly-owned trusts established to issue preferred securities
since the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts. Therefore, the investments in
these trusts are reflected as Other Investments and the related loans from the trusts are
reflected as Long-term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts on the balance sheets. This treatment
resulted in a $29 million increase in both total assets and total liabilities as of March 31,
2004.

2.

RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company has a defined benefit, trusteed, pension plan covering substantially all employees.
The plan is funded in accordance with Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
(ERISA), requirements. No contributions to the plan are expected for the year ending December 31,
2005. The Company also provides certain non-qualified benefit plans for a selected group of
management and highly compensated employees. Benefits under these non-qualified plans are funded
on a cash basis. In addition, the Company provides certain medical care and life insurance
benefits for retired employees. The Company funds related trusts to the extent required by the
Georgia PSC and the FERC. For the year ended December 31, 2005, such contributions are expected to
total approximately $7.7 million.

The measurement date for plan assets and obligations is September 30 for each year.

Pension Plans

The accumulated benefit obligation for the pension plans was $1.7 billion in 2004 and $1.6 billion

In the third quarter 2004, the Company prospectively adopted FASB Staff Position (FSP)
106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act). The Medicare Act provides a 28
percent prescription drug subsidy for Medicare eligible retirees. FSP 106-2 requires
recognition of the impacts of the Medicare Act in the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation (APBO) and future cost of service for postretirement medical plans. The effect of
the subsidy reduced the Company’s expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2004 by
approximately $5 million and is expected to have a similar impact on future expenses. The
subsidy’s impact on the postretirement medical plan APBO was a reduction of approximately $72
million. However, the ultimate impact on future periods is subject to federal regulations
governing the subsidy created in the Medicare Act which are being finalized.

Future benefit payments, including prescription drug benefits, reflect expected future service
and are estimated based on assumptions used to measure the accumulated benefit obligation for the
postretirement plans. Estimated benefit payments are reduced by drug

CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY
MATTERS

General Litigation Matters

The Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of
business. In addition, the Company’s business activities are subject to extensive governmental
regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation over environmental issues and
claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, and citizen enforcement of
environmental requirements, has increased generally throughout the United States. In particular,
personal injury claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become
more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such litigation against the Company cannot be predicted at
this time; however, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such
current proceedings would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements.

Retail Rate Orders

On December 21, 2004, the Georgia PSC voted to approve the 2004 Retail Rate Plan. Under the terms
of the 2004 Retail Rate Plan, earnings will be evaluated against a retail return on common equity
range of 10.25 percent to 12.25 percent. Two-thirds of any earnings above 12.25 percent will be
applied to rate refunds, with the remaining one-third retained by the Company. Retail rates will
be increased by approximately $194 million and customer fees by approximately $9 million effective
January 1, 2005 to cover the higher costs of purchased power; operating and maintenance expenses;
environmental compliance; and continued investment in new generation, transmission and distribution
facilities to support growth and ensure reliability.

In the 2004 Retail Rate Plan, the Georgia PSC also approved the transfer of the Plant McIntosh
construction project, which is scheduled for completion in June 2005, to the Company and Savannah
Electric at a total fair market value of approximately $385 million. This value

II-159


NOTES (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2004 Annual Report

reflects an approximate $16 million disallowance, of which $13 million is attributable to the
Company, and reduced the Company’s 2004 net income by approximately $8 million. The Georgia PSC
also certified the total completion cost of $547 million for the project. The amount of the
disallowance will be adjusted accordingly based on the actual completion cost of the project.
Under the 2004 Retail Rate Plan, the Plant McIntosh revenue requirement impact will be reflected in
the Company’s rates evenly over the three years ending 2007.

The Company will not file for a general base rate increase unless its projected retail return
on common equity falls below 10.25 percent. The Company is required to file a general rate case by
July 1, 2007, in response to which the Georgia PSC would be expected to determine whether the rate
order should be continued, modified, or discontinued.

Under Georgia PSC ratemaking provisions, $22 million has been deferred in a regulatory
liability account for use in meeting future environmental remediation costs. Under the 2004 Retail
Rate Plan, this regulatory liability will be amortized over a three-year period beginning January
1, 2005. However, the Georgia PSC also approved an annual environmental accrual of $5.4 million.
Environmental remediation expenditures will be charged against the reserve as they are incurred.
The annual accrual amount will be reviewed and adjusted in future regulatory proceedings.

Under the 2001 Retail Rate Plan, retail rates were decreased by $118 million effective January
1, 2002. Under the terms of the 2001 Retail Rate Plan, earnings were evaluated against a retail
return on common equity range of 10 percent to 12.95 percent. Two-thirds of any earnings above the
12.95 percent return were to be applied to rate refunds, with the remaining one-third retained by
the Company. The Company’s earnings in 2004, 2003 and 2002 were within the common equity range.

Under the 2001 Retail Rate Plan, the Company discontinued recording accelerated depreciation
and amortization and began amortizing the accumulated balance equally over three years as a credit
to expense beginning in 2002. Also, the 2001 Retail Rate Plan required the Company to recognize
capacity and operating and maintenance costs related to new Georgia PSC-certified PPAs evenly in
rates over a three-year period ended December 31, 2004.

Retail Fuel Hedging Program

Effective in January 2003, the Georgia PSC approved an order allowing the Company to implement a
natural gas and oil procurement and hedging program. This order allows the Company to use
financial instruments to hedge price and commodity risk associated with these fuels. The order
limits the program in terms of time, volume, dollars, and physical amounts hedged. The costs of
the program, including any net losses, are recovered as a fuel cost through the fuel cost recovery
clause. Annual net financial gains from the hedging program will be shared with the retail
customers receiving 75 percent and the Company retaining 25 percent of the total net gains. In
2004, the Company had a total net gain of $7.4 million, of which the Company retained $1.9 million.

Fuel Cost Recovery

On August 19, 2003, the Georgia PSC issued an order allowing the Company to increase fuel rates to
recover existing under recovered deferred fuel costs over the period of October 1, 2003 through
March 31, 2005, as well as future projected fuel costs. The new fuel rate represented an average
annual increase in rates paid by customers of approximately 1.6 percent. In recent months, the
Company has experienced higher than expected fuel costs since the order was issued. Those higher
fuel costs have increased the under recovered fuel costs. On February 18, 2005, the Company filed
a request with the Georgia PSC for a fuel cost recovery rate increase. In the ordinary course,
these new rates will be effective June 1, 2005 following a hearing before and approval by the
Georgia PSC. In its filing, the Company asked that the Georgia PSC accept the new rate, effective
April 1, 2005, prior to a formal hearing on the Company’s request. This action, if taken by the
Georgia PSC, would serve to mitigate expected increases in the under recovered balance during April
and May, but will not preclude the Georgia PSC from subsequently adjusting the rates. The
requested increase, representing an annual increase in revenues of approximately 11.7 percent, will
allow for the recovery of fuel costs based on an estimate of future fuel costs, as well as the
collection of the existing under recovery of fuel costs. The Company’s under recovered fuel costs
as of January 31, 2005 totaled $390 million. The Georgia

Georgia Power Company 2004 Annual Report

PSC will examine the Company’s fuel expenditures and determine whether the proposed fuel cost
recovery rate is just and reasonable before issuing its decision in May 2005. The final outcome of
the filing cannot be determined at this time.

Nuclear Performance Standards

Through December 31, 2004, the Company has operated in accordance with the nuclear performance
standard the Georgia PSC adopted for the Company’s nuclear generating units, under which the
performance of plants Hatch and Vogtle is evaluated every three years. The performance standard is
based on each unit’s capacity factor as compared to the average of all comparable U.S. nuclear
units operating at a capacity factor of 50 percent or higher during the three-year period of
evaluation. Depending on the performance of the units, the Company could receive a monetary award
or penalty under the performance standards criteria. Such amounts flow through the fuel cost
recovery mechanism. Any award or penalty for the 2002-2004 evaluation period will not be known
until the second quarter of 2005.

Effective January 1, 2005, the Georgia PSC has discontinued the nuclear performance standard.

New Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil action in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against the Company, alleging violations of the
New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act and related state laws with respect to
coal-fired generating facilities at the Company’s Bowen and Scherer plants. The civil action
requests penalties and injunctive relief, including an order requiring the installation of the best
available control technology at the affected units. The action against the Company was stayed in
the spring of 2001 during the appeal of a similar NSR enforcement action against the Tennessee
Valley Authority (TVA) before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. In June 2003,
the Court of Appeals issued its ruling in the TVA case, dismissing the appeal for reasons unrelated
to the issues in the case pending against the Company. In May 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court denied
the EPA’s petition for review of the case. At this time, no party to the case against the Company
has sought to reopen the case, which remains administratively closed in the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of Georgia.

Since the inception of the NSR proceedings against the Company, the EPA has also been
proceeding with similar NSR enforcement actions against other utilities, involving many of the same
legal issues. In each case, the EPA alleged that the utilities failed to comply with the NSR
permitting requirements when performing maintenance and construction activities at coal-burning
plants, which activities the utilities considered to be routine or otherwise not subject to NSR.
District courts addressing these cases have, to date, issued opinions that reached conflicting
conclusions.

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA’s regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act
authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $32,500 per day, per violation at each generating
unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in this matter could
require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly
require payment of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of operations, cash
flows, and possibly financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

In December 2002 and October 2003, the EPA issued final revisions to its NSR regulations under
the Clean Air Act. The December 2002 revisions included changes to the regulatory exclusions and
the methods of calculating emissions increases. The October 2003 regulations clarified the scope
of the existing Routine Maintenance, Repair, and Replacement (RMRR) exclusion. A coalition of
states and environmental organizations has filed petitions for review of these revisions with the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The October 2003 RMRR rules have been
stayed by the Court of Appeals pending its review of the rules. In any event, the final
regulations must be adopted by the State of Georgia in order to apply to the Company’s facilities.
The effect of these final regulations, related legal challenges and potential rulemakings by the
State of Georgia cannot be determined at this time.

Plant Wansley Environmental Litigation

On December 30, 2002, the Sierra Club, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Georgia Forestwatch,
and one individual filed a civil suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
Georgia against the Company for

II-161


NOTES (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2004 Annual Report

alleged violations of the Clean Air Act at four of the units at Plant Wansley. The complaint
alleges Clean Air Act violations at both the existing coal-fired units and the new combined cycle
units. Specifically, the plaintiffs allege (1) opacity violations at the coal-fired units, (2)
violations of a permit provision that requires the combined cycle units to operate above certain
levels, (3) violation of nitrogen oxide emission offset requirements, and (4) violation of
hazardous air pollutant requirements. The civil action requests injunctive and declaratory relief,
civil penalties, a supplemental environmental project, and attorneys’ fees. The Clean Air Act
authorizes civil penalties of up to $27,500, per day, per violation at each generating unit.

The court has concluded the liability phase of the action. The court ruled in favor of the
Company on the allegations regarding the hazardous air pollutants, the allegations regarding
emission offsets, and a majority of the allegations regarding the permit provision that requires
the combined cycle units to operate above certain levels. The court ruled in favor of the
plaintiffs on a majority of the opacity incidents. The Company has filed a petition for review of
the decision with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The district court case has
been administratively closed pending that appeal. If necessary, the district court will hold a
separate remedy trial which will address civil penalties and possible injunctive relief requested
by the plaintiffs. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot currently be determined; however, an
adverse outcome could require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this
time and could possibly require the payment of substantial penalties. This could affect future
results of operations, cash flows, and possibly financial condition if such costs are not recovered
through regulated rates.

Environmental Remediation

The Company has been designated as a potentially responsible party at sites governed by the Georgia
Hazardous Site Response Act and/or by the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act. The Company has recognized $35 million in cumulative expenses
through December 31, 2004 for the assessment and anticipated cleanup of sites on the Georgia
Hazardous Sites Inventory. In addition, in 1995 the EPA designated the Company and four other
unrelated entities as potentially responsible parties at a site in Brunswick, Georgia that is
listed on the federal National Priorities List. The Company has contributed to the removal and
remedial investigation and feasibility study costs for the site. Additional claims for recovery of
natural resource damages at the site are anticipated. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had
recorded approximately $6 million in cumulative expenses associated with the Company’s agreed-upon
share of the removal and remedial investigation and feasibility study costs for the Brunswick site.

The final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined. However, based on the currently
known conditions at these sites and the nature and extent of the Company’s activities relating to
these sites, management does not believe that the Company’s additional liability, if any, at these
sites would be material to the financial statements.

Race Discrimination Litigation

In July 2000, a lawsuit alleging race discrimination was filed by three of the Company’s
employees against the Company, Southern Company, and SCS in the Superior Court of Fulton County,
Georgia. Shortly thereafter, the lawsuit was removed to the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Georgia. The lawsuit also raised claims on behalf of a purported class.
The plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages in an unspecified amount, as well as
injunctive relief. In August 2000, the lawsuit was amended to add four more plaintiffs. Also,
an additional indirect subsidiary of Southern Company, Southern Company Energy Solutions, was
named a defendant.

In October 2001, the district court denied the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit subsequently denied plaintiff’s petition
seeking permission to file an appeal of the October 2001 decision. In March 2003, the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia granted summary judgment in favor of the
defendants on all claims raised by all seven plaintiffs. In April 2003, plaintiffs filed an
appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit challenging these adverse summary
judgment rulings, as well as the District Court’s October 2001 ruling denying class
certification. On November 10, 2004, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Eleventh Circuit issued an order affirming in all respects the district court’s

II-162


NOTES (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2004 Annual Report

rulings. On December 1, 2004, the plaintiffs filed a petition for rehearing seeking a review of
the November 2004 order by the entire Eleventh Circuit panel of judges. If this petition is
denied, the plaintiffs will have 90 days from the date of the court’s order denying the petition
within which to file a petition for writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court. The final
outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Right of Way Litigation

Southern Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including the Company, Gulf Power, Mississippi
Power, and Southern Telecom, have been named as defendants in numerous lawsuits brought by
landowners since 2001. The plaintiffs’ lawsuits claim that defendants may not use, or sublease
to third parties, some or all of the fiber optic communications lines on the rights of way that
cross the plaintiffs’ properties and that such actions exceed the easements or other property
rights held by defendants. The plaintiffs assert claims for, among other things, trespass and
unjust enrichment, and seek compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief.

On January 14, 2005, the Superior Court of Decatur County, Georgia granted partial summary
judgment in a lawsuit brought by landowners against the Company based on the plaintiffs’
declaratory judgment claim that the easements do not permit general telecommunications use. The
Company is appealing this ruling to the Georgia Court of Appeals. The question of damages and
other liabilities or remedies issues with respect to this action, if any, will be decided at a
future trial. In the event of an adverse verdict in the case, the Company could appeal both
liability and damages or other relief granted. Management believes that the Company has
complied with applicable laws and that the plaintiffs’ claims are without merit. An adverse
outcome in these matters could result in substantial judgments; however, the final outcome
cannot now be determined.

In addition, in late 2001, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company, including Alabama
Power, the Company, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, Savannah Electric,
and Southern Telecom, were
named as defendants in a lawsuit brought by a telecommunications company that uses certain of
the defendants’ rights of way. This lawsuit alleges, among other things, that the defendants
are contractually obligated to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the telecommunications
company from any liability that may be assessed against it in pending and future right of way
litigation. The Company believes that the plaintiff’s claims are without merit. In the fall of
2004, the trial court stayed the case until resolution of the underlying landowner litigation
discussed above. On January 12, 2005, the Georgia Court of Appeals dismissed the
telecommunications company’s appeal of the trial court’s order for lack of jurisdiction. An
adverse outcome in this matter, combined with an adverse outcome against the telecommunications
company in one or more of the right of way lawsuits, could result in substantial judgments;
however, the final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.

Generation Interconnection Agreements

In July 2003, the FERC issued its final rule on the standardization of generation
interconnection agreements and procedures (Order 2003). Order 2003 shifts much of the financial
burden of new transmission investment from the generator to the transmission provider. The FERC
has indicated that Order 2003, which was effective January 20, 2004, is to be applied
prospectively to interconnection agreements. Subsidiaries of Tenaska, Inc., as counterparties
to previously executed interconnection agreements with the Company
and another Southern Company subsidiary, have filed complaints at the
FERC requesting that the FERC modify the agreements and that the Company refund a total of $7.9
million previously paid for interconnection facilities, with interest. The Company has opposed
such relief and the proceedings are still pending. The impact of Order 2003 and its subsequent
rehearings on the Company and the final results of these matters cannot be determined at this
time.

Market-Based Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to nonaffiliates at market-based
prices. Through SCS, as agent, the Company also has FERC authority to make short-term
opportunity sales at market rates. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a
market-based contract with an affiliate. In November 2001, the FERC modified the test it uses
to consider utilities’ applications to charge market-based rates and adopted a new test called
the Supply Margin Assessment (SMA). The FERC applied the SMA to several utilities, including
Southern Company, the retail operating companies,

II-163


NOTES (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2004 Annual Report

and Southern Power and found them to be “pivotal suppliers” in their retail service territories
and ordered the implementation of certain mitigation measures. Southern Company and others
sought rehearing of the FERC order, and the FERC delayed implementation of certain mitigation
measures. In April 2004, the FERC issued an order that abandoned the SMA test and adopted a new
interim analysis for measuring generation market power. This new interim approach requires
utilities to submit a pivotal supplier screen and a wholesale market share screen. If the
applicant does not pass both screens, there will be a rebuttable presumption regarding
generation market power. The FERC’s order also sets forth procedures for rebutting these
presumptions and addresses mitigation measures for those entities that are found to have market
power. In the absence of specific mitigation measures, the order includes several cost-based
mitigation measures that would apply by default. The FERC also initiated a new rulemaking
proceeding that, among other things, will adopt a final methodology for assessing generation
market power.

In July 2004, the FERC denied Southern Company’s request for rehearing, along with a number
of others, and reaffirmed the interim tests that it adopted in April. In August 2004, Southern
Company submitted a filing to the FERC which included results showing that Southern Company
passed the pivotal supplier screen for all markets and the wholesale market share screen for all
markets except the Southern Company retail service territory. Southern Company also submitted
other analyses to demonstrate that it lacks generation market power. On December 17, 2004, the
FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation dominance within the
Southern Company retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other
markets is not at issue. As directed by this order, on February 15 2005, Southern Company
submitted additional information related to generation dominance in the retail service
territory. Any new market-based rate transactions in Southern Company’s retail service
territory entered into after February 27, 2005 will be subject to refund to the level of the
default cost-based rates, pending the outcome of the proceeding. Southern Company, along with
other utilities, has also filed an appeal of the FERC’s April and July 2004 orders with the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The FERC has asked the court to dismiss
the appeal on the grounds that it is premature.

In the event that the FERC’s default mitigation measures are ultimately applied, the
Company may be required to charge cost-based rates for certain wholesale sales in the Southern
Company retail service territory, which may be lower than negotiated market-based rates. The
final outcome of this matter will depend on the form in which the final methodology for
assessing generation market power and mitigation rules may be ultimately adopted and cannot be
determined at this time.

Plant McIntosh Construction Project

In December 2002 after a competitive bidding process, the Georgia PSC certified PPAs between
Southern Power and the Company and Savannah Electric for capacity from Plant McIntosh Units 10
and 11, construction of which is scheduled to be completed in June 2005. In April 2003,
Southern Power applied for FERC approval of these PPAs. In July 2003, the FERC accepted the
PPAs to become effective June 1, 2005, subject to refund, and ordered that hearings be held.
Intervenors opposed the FERC’s acceptance of the PPAs, alleging that they did not meet the
applicable standards for market-based rates between affiliates. To ensure the timely completion
of the Plant McIntosh construction project and the availability of the units in the summer of
2005 for their retail customers, in May 2004, the Company and Savannah Electric requested the
Georgia PSC to direct them to acquire the McIntosh construction project. The Georgia PSC issued
such an order and the transfer occurred on May 24, 2004 at a total cost of approximately $415
million, including approximately $14 million of transmission interconnection facilities.
Subsequently, Southern Power filed a request to withdraw the PPAs and to terminate the ongoing
FERC proceedings. In August 2004, the FERC issued a notice accepting the request to withdraw
the PPAs and permitting such request to become effective by operation of law. However, the FERC
made no determination on what additional steps may need to be taken with respect to testimony
provided in the proceedings. The ultimate outcome of any additional FERC action cannot be
determined at this time.

As directed by the Georgia PSC order, on June 3, 2004, the Company and Savannah Electric
filed an application to amend the resource certificate granted by the Georgia PSC in 2002. In
connection with the 2004 Retail Rate Plan, the Georgia PSC approved the transfer of the Plant
McIntosh construction project at

II-164


Notes (continued)

a total fair market value of approximately $385 million. This value reflects an
approximate $16 million disallowance, of which $13 million is attributable to the Company, and
reduced the Company’s net income by approximately $8 million. The Georgia PSC also certified a
total completion cost of $547 million for the project. The amount of the disallowance will be
adjusted accordingly based on the actual completion cost of the project. Under the 2004 Retail
Rate Plan, the Plant McIntosh revenue requirements impact will be reflected in the Company’s
rates evenly over the three years ending 2007. See “Retail Rate Orders” herein for additional
information regarding the transfer of the Plant McIntosh construction project.

4. JOINT OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS

The Company and an affiliate, Alabama Power, own equally all of the outstanding capital stock of
SEGCO which owns electric generating units with a total rated capacity of 1,020 megawatts, as well
as associated transmission facilities. The capacity of the units has been sold equally to the
Company and Alabama Power under a contract which, in substance, requires payments sufficient to
provide for the operating expenses, taxes, debt service, and return on investment, whether or not
SEGCO has any capacity and energy available. The term of the contract extends automatically for
two-year periods, subject to either party’s right to cancel upon two year’s notice. The Company’s
share of expenses included in purchased power from affiliates in the statements of income is as
follows:

Georgia (MEAG), the city of Dalton, Georgia, Florida Power & Light Company, Jacksonville Electric
Authority, and Gulf Power. Under these agreements, the Company is jointly and severally liable for
third party claims related to these plants. In addition, the Company jointly owns the Rocky
Mountain pumped storage hydroelectric plant with OPC who is the operator of the plant. The Company
also jointly owns Plant McIntosh combustion- turbine units with Savannah Electric who operates the
plant. The Company and Florida Power Corporation (FPC) jointly own a combustion turbine unit
(Intercession City) operated by FPC.

5. INCOME TAXES

Southern Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return and a combined
State of Georgia income tax return. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement, as
required by the PUHCA, each subsidiary’s current and deferred tax expense is computed on a
stand-alone basis and no subsidiary is allocated more expense than would be paid if they filed a
separate tax return. In accordance with IRS regulations, each company is jointly and severally
liable for the tax liability.

In 2004, in order to avoid the loss of certain federal income tax credits related to the
production of synthetic fuel, Southern Company chose to defer certain

II-165


Notes (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2004 Annual Report

deductions otherwise available to the subsidiaries. The cash flow benefit associated with the utilization of the tax
credits was allocated to the subsidiary that otherwise would have claimed the available deductions
on a separate company basis without the deferral. This allocation concurrently reduced the tax
benefit of the credits allocated to those subsidiaries that generated the credits. As the deferred
expenses are deducted, the benefit of the tax credits will be repaid to the subsidiaries that
generated the tax credits. The Company has recorded $25 million payable to these subsidiaries in
Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes on the balance sheets at December 31, 2004.

The transfer of the Plant McIntosh construction project from Southern Power to the Company
resulted in a deferred gain to Southern Power for federal income tax purposes. The Company will
reimburse Southern Power for the related $5.4 million deferred taxes reflected in Southern Power’s
future taxable income. This payable to Southern Power is included in Other Deferred Credits on the
balance sheets at December 31, 2004.

The transfer of the Dahlberg, Wansley and Franklin projects to Southern Power from the Company
in 2001 and 2002 also resulted in a deferred gain for federal income tax purposes. Southern Power
will reimburse the Company for the remaining balance of the related deferred taxes of $13.3 million
reflected in the Company’s future taxable income. This receivable from Southern Power is included
in Other Deferred Debits on the balance sheets at December 31, 2004.

At December 31, 2004, tax-related regulatory assets were $506 million and tax-related
regulatory liabilities were $171 million. The assets are attributable to tax benefits flowed
through to customers in prior years and to taxes applicable to capitalized interest. The
liabilities are attributable to deferred taxes previously recognized at rates higher than current
enacted tax law and to unamortized investment tax credits.

6. FINANCING

Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities/Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts

The Company has formed certain wholly-owned trust subsidiaries for the purpose of issuing preferred
securities. The proceeds of the related equity investments and preferred security sales were
loaned back to the Company through the issuance of junior subordinated notes totaling $969 million,
which constitute substantially all of the assets of the trusts and are reflected in the balance
sheets as Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts. The Company considers that the mechanisms
and obligations relating to the preferred securities issued for its benefit, taken together,
constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by it of the respective trusts’ payment obligations
with respect to these securities. At December 31, 2004, preferred securities of $940 million were
outstanding. See Note 1 under “Variable Interest Entities” for additional information on the
accounting treatment for these trusts and the related securities. The preferred securities are
recognized as liabilities in the balance sheets.

Pollution Control Bonds

Pollution control obligations represent loans to the Company from public authorities of funds
derived from sales by such authorities of revenue bonds issued to finance pollution control
facilities. The Company is required to make payments sufficient for the authorities to meet
principal and interest requirements of such bonds. The Company has incurred obligations in
connection with the sale by public authorities of tax-exempt pollution control revenue bonds. The
amount of tax-exempt pollution control revenue bonds outstanding at December 31, 2004 was $1.7
billion.

Capital Leases

Assets acquired under capital leases are recorded in the balance sheets as utility plant in
service, and the related obligations are classified as long-term debt. At December 31, 2004 and
2003, the Company had a capitalized lease obligation for its corporate headquarters building of $77
million and $79 million, respectively, with an interest rate of 8.1 percent. For ratemaking
purposes, the Georgia PSC has treated the lease as an operating lease and has allowed only the
lease payments in cost of service. The difference between the accrued expense and the lease
payments allowed for ratemaking purposes has been deferred and is being amortized to expense as
ordered by the Georgia PSC. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the interest and lease amortization
deferred on the balance sheets were $53 million and $54 million, respectively.

Bank Credit Arrangements

At the beginning of 2005, the Company had an unused credit arrangement with banks totaling $773.1
million. Of these facilities, $423.1 million expire at various times throughout 2005, with the
remaining $350 million expiring in 2007. The facilities that expire in 2005 provide the option of
converting borrowings into a two-year term loan. The agreements contain stated borrowing rates but
also allow for competitive bid loans. All the agreements require payment of commitment fees based
on the unused portion of the commitments or the maintenance of compensating balances with the
banks. Commitment fees are less than 1/8 of 1 percent for the Company. Compensating balances are
not legally

II-167

restricted from withdrawal. A fee is also paid to the agent bank.

The credit arrangements contain covenants that limit the level of indebtedness to
capitalization to 65 percent, as defined in the arrangements. For purposes of these definitions,
indebtedness excludes the long-term debt payable to affiliated trusts. In addition, the credit
arrangements contain cross default provisions that would trigger an event of default if the Company
defaulted on other indebtedness above a specified threshold. The Company is currently in
compliance with all such covenants.

This $773.1 million in unused credit arrangements provides liquidity support to the Company’s
variable rate pollution control bonds. The amount of variable rate pollution control bonds
outstanding requiring liquidity support as of December 31, 2004 was $106 million. In addition, the
Company borrows under a commercial paper program and an extendible commercial note program. The
amount of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2004 was $208 million. There were no
outstanding extendible commercial notes at December 31, 2004. The amount of commercial paper
outstanding at December 31, 2003 was $137 million. During 2004, the peak amount of commercial
paper outstanding was $391.5 million and the average amount outstanding was $130.7 million. The
average annual interest rate on commercial paper in 2004 was 1.27 percent. Commercial paper is
included in notes payable on the balance sheets.

Financial Instruments

The Company enters into energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, gas, and
other fuel price changes. However, due to cost-based rate regulations, the Company has limited
exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity. The Company has
implemented fuel-hedging programs at the instruction of the Georgia PSC. The Company also enters
into hedges of forward electricity sales. There was no material ineffectiveness recorded in
earnings in 2004 and 2003.

At December 31, 2004, the fair value of derivative energy contracts was reflected in the
financial statements as follows:

The fair value gain or loss for cash flow hedges that are recoverable through the regulatory
fuel clauses are recorded in regulatory assets and liabilities and are recognized in earnings at
the same time the hedged items affect earnings. The Company has energy-related hedges in place up
to and including 2007.

The Company enters into derivatives to hedge exposure to interest rate changes. Derivatives
related to variable rate securities or forecasted transactions are accounted for as cash flow
hedges. The derivatives are generally structured to mirror the critical terms of the hedged debt
instruments; therefore, no material ineffectiveness has been recorded in earnings. In addition to
interest rate swaps, the Company has also entered into certain options agreements that effectively
cap its interest rate exposure in return for payment of a premium. In some cases, costless collars
have been used that effectively establish a floor and a ceiling to interest rate expense.

The fair value gain or loss for cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive
income and is reclassified into earnings at the same time the hedged items affect earnings. In
2004, the Company settled losses totaling $12.4 million upon termination of certain interest
derivatives at the same time it issued debt. For the years 2004 and 2003, approximately $3.9
million and $3.4 million, respectively, were reclassified from other comprehensive income to
interest expense. For 2002, the amounts reclassified were immaterial. For 2005, pre-tax losses of
approximately $0.4 million are expected to be reclassified from other comprehensive income to
interest expense. The Company has interest-related hedges in place through 2017. Subsequent to
December 31, 2004, the Company terminated an interest rate swap with a notional amount of $250
million at a gain of $1.2 million. The gain will be amortized to interest expense over a 10-year
period.

7. COMMITMENTS

Construction Program

The Company currently estimates property additions to be approximately $911 million, $1.1 billion,
and $1.2 billion in 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively. These amounts include $40 million, $33
million, and $28 million in 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively, for construction expenditures
related to contractual purchase commitments for uranium and nuclear fuel conversion, enrichment,
and fabrication services included under “Fuel Commitments.” The construction program is subject to
periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from estimates because of
numerous factors, including, but not limited to, changes in business conditions, changes in FERC
rules and transmission regulations, revised load growth estimates, changes in environmental
regulations, changes in existing nuclear plants to meet new regulatory requirements, increasing
costs of labor, equipment, and materials, and cost of capital. At December 31, 2004, significant
purchase commitments were outstanding in connection with the construction program.

The Company currently has under construction Plant McIntosh Units 10 and 11 scheduled for
completion in June 2005. In addition, construction related to new transmission and distribution
facilities and capital improvements to existing generation, transmission and distribution
facilities, including those needed to meet environmental standards, are ongoing.

Long-Term Service Agreements

The Company and Savannah Electric have entered into a Long-Term Service Agreement (LTSA) with
General Electric (GE) for the purpose of securing maintenance support for the combustion
turbines at the Plant McIntosh combine cycle facility. In summary, the LTSA stipulates that GE
will perform all planned inspections on the covered equipment, which includes the cost of all
labor and materials. GE is also obligated to cover the costs of unplanned maintenance on the
covered equipment subject to a limit specified in each contract.

In general, this LTSA is in effect through two major inspection cycles per unit. Scheduled
payments to GE are made at various intervals based on actual operating hours of the respective
units. Total payments to GE under this agreement are currently estimated at $182 million over the remaining term of the agreement,
which may range up to 30 years. However, the LTSA contains various cancellation provisions at
the option of the Company.

The Company has entered into a LTSA with GE to provide all necessary labor and parts for
neutron monitoring at Plant Hatch for a period of 10 years. Total payments to GE under this
agreement are currently estimated at $14.9 million, of which $7.4 is

expected to be billed to the joint owners.

Fuel Commitments

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of its generating plants, the Company has entered into
various long-term commitments for the procurement of fossil and nuclear fuel. In most cases, these
contracts contain provisions for price escalations, minimum purchase levels, and other financial
commitments. Natural gas purchase commitments contain fixed volumes with prices based on various
indices at the time of delivery. Amounts included in the chart below represent estimates based on
New York Mercantile Exchange future prices at December 31, 2004. Also the Company has entered into
various long-term commitments for the purchase of electricity. Total estimated minimum long-term
obligations at December 31, 2004 were as follows:

SCS may enter into various types of wholesale energy and natural gas contracts acting as an
agent for the Company and all of the other Southern Company retail operating companies, Southern
Power, and Southern Company GAS. Under these agreements, each of the retail operating companies,
Southern Power, and Southern Company GAS may be jointly and severally liable. The creditworthiness
of Southern Power and Southern Company GAS is currently inferior to the creditworthiness of the
retail operating companies. Accordingly, Southern Company has entered into keep-well agreements
with the Company and each of the retail operating companies to insure they will not subsidize or be
responsible for any costs, losses, liabilities, or damages resulting from the inclusion of Southern
Power or Southern Company GAS as a contracting party under these agreements.

Purchased Power Commitments

The Company has commitments regarding a portion of a 5 percent interest in Plant Vogtle owned by
MEAG that are in effect until the latter of the retirement of the plant or the latest stated
maturity date of MEAG’s bonds issued to finance such ownership interest. The payments for capacity
are required whether or not any capacity is available. The energy cost is a function of each
unit’s variable operating costs. Except as noted below, the cost of such capacity and energy is
included in purchased power from non-affiliates in the Company’s statements of income. Capacity
payments totaled $55 million, $57 million, and $57 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.
The current projected Plant Vogtle capacity payments are:

Rental expenses related to these operating leases totaled $38 million for 2004, $36 million for
2003, and $35 million for 2002. At December 31, 2004, estimated minimum rental commitments for
these noncancelable operating leases were as follows:

In addition to the rental commitments above, the Company has obligations upon expiration of
certain rail car leases with respect to the residual value of the leased property. These leases
expire in 2011, and the Company’s maximum obligation is $72 million. At the termination of the
leases, at the Company’s option, the Company may either exercise its purchase option or the
property can be sold to a third party. The Company expects that the fair market value of the
leased property would substantially reduce or eliminate the Company’s payments under the residual
value obligation. A portion of the rail car lease obligations is shared with the joint owners of
plants Scherer and Wansley. Rental expenses related to the rail car leases are fully recoverable
through the fuel cost recovery clause as ordered by the Georgia PSC.

Guarantees

Prior to 1999, a subsidiary of Southern Company originated loans to residential customers of the
Company for heat pump purchases. These loans were sold to Fannie Mae with recourse for any loan
with payments outstanding over 120 days. The Company is responsible for the repurchase of
customers’ delinquent loans. As of December 31, 2004, the outstanding loans guaranteed by the
Company were $5.1 million and loan loss reserves of $1.1 million have been recorded.

Alabama Power has guaranteed unconditionally the obligation of SEGCO under an installment sale
agreement for the purchase of certain pollution control facilities at SEGCO’s generating units,
pursuant to which $24.5 million principal amount of pollution control revenue bonds are
outstanding. The Company has agreed to reimburse Alabama Power for the pro rata portion of such
obligation corresponding to the Company’s then proportionate ownership of stock of SEGCO if Alabama
Power is called upon to make such payment under its guaranty. In May 2003, SEGCO issued an
additional $50 million in senior notes. Alabama Power guaranteed the debt obligation and in
October 2003, the Company agreed to reimburse Alabama Power for the pro rata portion of such
obligation corresponding to its then proportionate ownership of stock of SEGCO if Alabama Power is
called upon to make such payment under its guaranty.

As discussed earlier in this note under “Operating Leases,” the Company has entered into
certain residual value guarantees related to rail car leases.

8. STOCK OPTION PLAN

Southern Company provides non-qualified stock options to a large segment of its employees ranging
from line management to executives. As of December 31, 2004, 1,547 current and former employees
of the Company participated in the stock option plan. The maximum number of shares of Southern
Company common stock that may be issued under this plan may not exceed 55 million. The prices of
options granted to date have been at the fair market value of the shares on the dates of grant.
Options granted to date become exercisable pro

9. NUCLEAR INSURANCE

Under the Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 1988, the Company maintains agreements of indemnity with
the NRC that, together with private insurance, cover third-party liability arising from any nuclear
incident occurring at the Company’s nuclear power plants. The act provides funds up to $10.76
billion for public liability claims that could arise from a single nuclear incident. Each nuclear
plant is insured against this liability to a maximum of $300 million by American Nuclear Insurers (ANI), with the remaining coverage provided by a mandatory program of
deferred premiums that could be assessed, after a nuclear incident, against all owners of nuclear
reactors. The Company could be assessed up to $101 million per incident for each licensed reactor
it operates but not more than an aggregate of $10 million per incident to be paid in a calendar
year for each reactor. Such maximum assessment for the Company, excluding any applicable state
premium taxes — based on its ownership and buyback interests — is $203 million per incident but
not more than an aggregate of $20 million to be paid for each incident in any one year. The
Price-Anderson Amendments Act expired in August 2002; however, the indemnity provisions of the Act
remain in place for commercial nuclear reactors.

The Company is a member of Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), a mutual insurer
established to provide property damage insurance in an amount up to $500 million for members’
nuclear generating facilities.

Additionally, the Company has policies that currently provide decontamination, excess property
insurance, and premature decommissioning coverage up to $2.25 billion for losses in excess of the
$500 million primary coverage. This excess insurance is also provided by NEIL.

NEIL also covers additional costs that would be incurred in obtaining replacement power during
a prolonged accidental outage at a member’s nuclear plant. Members can purchase this coverage,
subject to a deductible waiting period of up to 26 weeks, with a maximum per occurrence per unit
limit of $490 million. After this deductible period, weekly indemnity payments would be received
until either the unit is operational or until the limit is exhausted in approximately three years.
The Company purchases the maximum limit allowed by NEIL subject to ownership limitations and has
elected a 12 week waiting period.

Under each of the NEIL policies, members are subject to assessments if losses each year exceed
the

II-172


NOTES (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2004 Annual Report

accumulated funds available to the insurer under that policy. The current maximum annual
assessments for the Company under the NEIL policies would be $43 million.

Following the terrorist attacks of September 2001, both ANI and NEIL confirmed that terrorist
acts against commercial nuclear power stations would be covered under their insurance. Both
companies, however, revised their policy terms on a prospective basis to include an industry
aggregate for all “non-certified” terrorist acts (i.e., acts that are not certified acts of
terrorism pursuant to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA). The NEIL aggregate —
applies to non-certified claims stemming from terrorism within a 12-month duration — is $3.24
billion plus any amounts available through reinsurance or indemnity from an outside source. The
non-certified ANI cap is a $300 million shared industry aggregate. Any act of terrorism that is
certified pursuant to the TRIA will not be subject to the foregoing NEIL and ANI limitations but
will be subject to the TRIA annual aggregate limitation of $100 billion of insured losses arising
from certified acts of terrorism. The TRIA will expire on December 31, 2005.

For all on-site property damage insurance policies for commercial nuclear power plants, the
NRC requires that the proceeds of such policies shall be dedicated first for the sole purpose of
placing the reactor in a safe and stable condition after an accident. Any remaining proceeds are
to be applied next toward the costs of decontamination and debris removal operations ordered by the
NRC, and any further remaining proceeds are to be paid either to the Company or to its bond
trustees as may be appropriate under the policies and applicable trust indentures.

All retrospective assessments, whether generated for liability, property, or replacement
power, may be subject to applicable state premium taxes.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Gulf Power Company:

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements of capitalization of Gulf Power
Company (a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company) as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the
related statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder’s equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004. These financial statements are the
responsibility of Gulf Power Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a
basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements (pages II-196 to II-219) present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Gulf Power Company at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, in 2003 Gulf Power Company changed its
method of accounting for asset retirement obligations.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Gulf Power Company 2004 Annual Report

OVERVIEW

Business Activities

Gulf Power Company (Company) operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electricity
to customers within its traditional service area located in northwest Florida and to wholesale
customers in the Southeast. Prices for electricity provided by the Company to retail customers
are set by the Florida Public Service Commission (PSC).

Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of selling electricity. These
factors include the Company’s ability to maintain a stable regulatory environment, to achieve
energy sales growth while containing costs, and to recover costs related to growing demand and
increasingly more stringent environmental standards.

On September 15 and 16, 2004, Hurricane Ivan hit the Gulf Coast of Florida and Alabama
causing substantial damage. Nearly 90% of the Company’s customers were without electric service
immediately after the hurricane. Almost 95% of those without power had service restored within
one week, and two weeks after the storm, power had been restored to all who could receive
service. The hurricane’s financial impact to the Company is provided herein, along with
management’s discussion and analysis.

Key Performance Indicators

In striving to maximize shareholder value while providing low-cost energy to nearly 400,000
customers, the Company focuses on several key indicators. These indicators include customer
satisfaction, peak season equivalent forced outage rate (Peak Season EFOR), and return on equity
(ROE). The Company’s financial success is directly tied to the satisfaction of its customers.
Key elements of ensuring satisfaction include outstanding service, high reliability, and
competitive prices. Management uses nationally recognized customer satisfaction surveys and
reliability indicators to evaluate the Company’s results. Peak Season EFOR is an indicator of
plant availability and efficient generation fleet operations during the months when generation
needs are greatest. The rate is calculated by dividing the number of hours of forced outages by
total generation hours. ROE is a performance standard used by both the investment community and
many regulatory agencies. The Company’s 2004 results compared with its targets for each of
these indicators are reflected in the following chart.

Customer Satisfaction

Top quartile performance

surveys

Top quartile

Peak Season EFOR

2.33%

2.64%

ROE

12.33%

11.83%

The financial performance achieved in 2004 reflects the focus that management places on
these indicators, as well as the commitment shown by the Company’s employees in achieving or
exceeding management’s expectations. The Company’s 2004 actual ROE was below the targeted
performance level primarily due to an additional discretionary accrual made to the property
insurance reserve. The Peak Season EFOR target was not achieved due to outages caused by
Hurricane Ivan. See Note 1 to the financial statements under “Provision for Property Damage”
for additional information.

Earnings

The Company’s 2004 net income after dividends on preferred stock was $68.2 million, a decrease of
$0.8 million from the previous year. In 2003, earnings were $69.0 million, an increase of $2.0
million from the previous year. In 2002, earnings were $67.0 million, an increase of $8.7 million
from the previous year. The decrease in earnings in 2004 is due primarily to higher operating
expenses related to storm damage reserves and employee benefits. The improvement in earnings in
2003 was primarily due to higher operating revenues related to an increase in base rates effective
in May 2002, offset somewhat by higher operating expenses and increases in depreciation expense
primarily related to the commercial operation of Plant Smith Unit 3 beginning in April 2002. The
improvement in earnings in 2002 was primarily due to higher operating revenues related to the
increase in base rates, offset somewhat by higher operating expenses and higher financing costs
primarily related to the commercial operation of the new unit.

these changes are shown in the table above. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail
Regulatory Matters” for additional information on the base rate increase that became effective in
May 2002.

Fuel and other cost recovery includes recovery provisions for fuel expenses and the energy
component of purchased power costs, energy conservation costs, purchased power capacity costs, and
environmental compliance costs. Annually, the Company seeks recovery of projected costs including
any true-up amount from prior periods. Approved rates are implemented each January. Therefore,
the recovery provisions generally equal the related expenses and have no material effect on net
income. See Note 1 to the financial statements under “Revenues” and “Environmental Cost Recovery”
for additional information.

Sales for resale were $183.8 million in 2004, an increase of $43.8 million, or 31.3 percent,
as compared to 2003, primarily due to increased energy sales to affiliates at a higher unit cost
resulting from higher incremental fuel prices. Sales for resale were $140.0 million in 2003, an
increase of $22.5 million, or 19.1 percent, as compared to 2002, primarily due to increased energy
sales to affiliates reflecting the availability of additional generation

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2004 Annual Report

following the commercial operation of Plant Smith Unit 3. Sales for resale were $117.6 million in
2002, an increase of $8.1 million, or 7.4 percent, as compared to 2001, primarily due to increased
energy sales to affiliates reflecting the commercial operation of Plant Smith Unit 3. Sales to
affiliated companies, as well as purchases, vary from year to year depending on demand and the
availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliate sales and purchases
are made in accordance with the affiliate company interchange agreement, as approved by the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). These transactions do not have a significant impact on
earnings, since the energy is generally sold at marginal cost and energy purchases are generally
offset by revenues through the Company’s fuel cost recovery clause.

Sales for resale to non-affiliates are predominantly unit power sales under long-term
contracts to other Florida utilities. Revenues from contracts have both capacity and energy
components. Capacity revenues reflect the recovery of fixed costs and a return on investment under
the contracts. Energy is generally sold at variable cost. The capacity and energy components
under these unit power contracts were as follows:

2010. The new contracts will extend the sale of the capacity discussed above. See FUTURE EARNINGS
POTENTIAL – “Other Matters” herein for additional information.

Other operating revenues increased $1.0 million, $1.4 million, and $3.3 million in 2004, 2003,
and 2002, respectively, primarily due to an increase in franchise fees, which are proportional to
changes in revenue. Other operating revenues for 2002 also increased as a result of a $1.7 million
settlement related to a purchased power agreement (PPA) and a $0.9 million increase in revenues
from the transmission of electricity to others.

primarily due to milder summer weather, as compared to 2002. In 2002, residential sales increased
9.1 percent over 2001 primarily due to more extreme summer and winter weather combined with
increased summer sales. Residential sales are expected to increase just over 2 percent annually
over the next five years, given normal weather conditions.

Commercial sales increased 2.2 percent in 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to more
favorable weather conditions and customer growth. Commercial sales increased 1.7 percent in 2003,
as compared to 2002, primarily due to customer growth, which offset milder summer weather. In
2002, commercial sales increased 4.0 percent primarily due to more extreme weather as compared to
2001. Commercial sales are expected to increase approximately 3 percent annually over the next
five years, given normal weather conditions.

Industrial sales decreased 1.6 percent in 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to the
short-term outage experienced as a result of Hurricane Ivan in September 2004. Industrial sales
increased 4.5 percent in 2003, when compared to 2002, primarily due to additional sales resulting
from high natural gas prices. In 2002, industrial sales increased 1.8 percent, when compared to
2001, primarily due to normal customer growth. Industrial sales are expected to increase
approximately 1 percent annually over the next five years.

II-180


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2004 Annual Report

Sales for resale to non-affiliates decreased 9.9 percent in 2004, increased 16.1 percent in
2003, and increased 3.1 percent in 2002 primarily as a result of fluctuations in the fuel cost to
produce energy sold to Florida utilities under long-term contracts and energy sold to other
non-affiliated utilities under short-term contracts. The degree to which oil and natural gas
prices, which are the primary fuel sources for these customers, differ from the Company’s fuel
costs will influence these changes in sales. However, these fluctuations in energy sales under
long-term contracts have a minimal effect on earnings because the energy is generally sold at
marginal cost.

Expenses

Total operating expenses increased $89.6 million, or 12.3 percent, in 2004, and $50.8 million, or
7.5 percent, in 2003 over the amount recorded in the prior year primarily due to higher fuel and
operation and maintenance expenses. In 2002, total operating expenses increased $67.0 million, or
11 percent, compared to 2001 primarily due to higher fuel and maintenance costs.

In 2004, other operation and maintenance expenses increased $19.0 million, or 9.0 percent,
primarily due to increases of $7.9 million in the accumulated provision for property damage,
$2.9 million in the accrued expenses for uninsured litigation and workers compensation claims,
$3.4 million for employee benefit expenses, and $2.5 million for production expenses. See Notes
1 and 3 to the financial statements under “Provision for Property Damage” and “Retail Regulatory
Matters,” respectively, for additional information. In 2003, other operation and maintenance
expenses increased $10.6 million, or 5.3 percent, primarily due to an increase of $1.6 million
of customer accounts expense and an increase of $7.1 million in the accumulated provision for
property damage. In 2002, other operation and maintenance expenses increased $22.5 million, or
12.7 percent, mainly due to scheduled generating plant maintenance.

Depreciation and amortization expense remained flat in 2004 due to no significant change in
depreciable assets. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $5.3 million, or 6.9 percent,
and $8.8 million, or 12.9 percent, in 2003 and 2002, respectively, primarily due to the commercial
operation of Plant Smith Unit 3 beginning in April 2002. The 2003 increase also reflects the
amortization of a regulatory asset related to corporate facilities, in accordance with an order
from the Florida PSC.

Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses

Fuel costs constitute the single largest expense for the Company. The mix of fuel sources for
generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and
the availability of generation resources. Fuel expense increased $50.7 million, or 16.0
percent, in 2004 and $42.6 million, or 15.6 percent, in 2003, compared to the prior year
primarily due to increased generation to meet the demand for energy and higher average costs of
fuel. Fuel expense in 2002, compared to 2001, increased $73.2 million, or 36.5 percent,
primarily due to the commercial operation of Plant Smith Unit 3 beginning in April 2002.

The amount and sources of generation, the average cost of fuel per net kilowatt-hour
generated, and the average costs of purchased power were as follows:

Purchased power expense in 2004 increased $15.7 million, or 31.4 percent, as compared to 2003,
primarily due to increased power purchases from merchant generation resources to minimize total
system production cost. Purchased power expense decreased in 2003 by $12.8 million, or 20.4
percent, as compared to 2002, primarily due to a decrease in the volume of energy needed to meet
the Company’s load requirements. Purchased power expense decreased in 2002 by $43.2 million, or
40.7 percent, as compared to 2001, primarily due to the additional generating capacity from the
Company’s Plant Smith Unit 3.

II-181


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2004 Annual Report

A significant upward trend in the cost of coal and natural gas has emerged since 2003, and
volatility in these markets is expected to continue. Increased coal prices have been influenced by
a worldwide increase in demand as a result of rapid economic growth in China as well as by
increases in mining costs. Higher natural gas prices in the United States are the result of
slightly lower gas supplies despite increased drilling activity. Natural gas supply interruptions,
such as those caused by the 2004 hurricanes, result in an immediate market response, however, the
impact of this price volatility may be reduced by imports of natural gas and liquefied natural gas.

Fuel costs and purchases of energy will vary from year to year depending on demand and the
availability and cost of generating resources. These costs do not have a significant impact on
earnings, since they are generally offset by revenues through the Company’s fuel cost recovery
mechanism.

Other Income and (Expense)

The equity portion of the
allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) increased $1.1 million in 2004
primarily due to ongoing construction activities related to the installation of pollution control
equipment at Plant Crist. AFUDC decreased $2.3 million, or 76.1 percent, in 2003 and $2.4 million,
or 44.5 percent, in 2002 primarily due to the completion of Plant Smith Unit 3 in April 2002. See
FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “Environmental Matters — Environmental Statutes and Regulations”
herein and Note 1 to the financial statements under “AFUDC” for additional information.

Interest expense decreased $2.1 million, or 5.5 percent, in 2004 and $1.8 million, or 4.6
percent, in 2003 primarily as the result of refinancing higher cost securities. Interest expense
increased $8.5 million, or 26.9 percent, in 2002 primarily due to the issuance of $180 million of
senior notes in 2001 and 2002 that were used to finance the construction of Plant Smith Unit 3.

Effects of Inflation

The Company is subject to rate regulation based on the recovery of historical costs. In addition,
the income tax laws are based on historical costs. Therefore, inflation creates an economic loss
because the Company is recovering its cost of investments in dollars that have less purchasing
power. While the inflation rate has been relatively low in recent years, it continues to have an
adverse effect on the Company because of the large investment in utility plant with long economic
lives. Conventional accounting for historical cost does not recognize this economic loss nor the
partially offsetting gain that arises through financing facilities with fixed-money obligations,
such as long-term debt and preferred securities. Any recognition of inflation by regulatory
authorities is reflected in the rate of return allowed in the Company’s approved electric rates.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL

General

The Company operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electricity to customers within
its traditional service area located in northwest Florida and to wholesale customers in the
Southeast. Prices for electricity provided by the Company to retail customers are set by the
Florida PSC under cost–based regulatory principles. Prices for electricity relating to jointly
owned generating facilities, interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power
are set by the FERC. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES – “Application of Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates – Electric Utility Regulation” herein and Note 3 to the financial statements for
additional information about these and other regulatory matters.

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of future
earnings potential. The level of the Company’s future earnings depends on numerous factors.
These factors include the ability of the Company to maintain a stable regulatory environment, to
achieve energy sales growth while containing costs, and to recover costs related to growing
demand and increasingly more stringent environmental standards. Future earnings in the near
term will depend, in part, upon growth in energy sales, which is subject to a number of factors.
These factors include weather, competition, new energy contracts with neighboring utilities,
energy conservation practiced by customers, the price of electricity, the price elasticity of
demand, and the rate of economic growth in the Company’s service area.

Since 2001, merchant energy companies and traditional electric utilities with significant
energy marketing and trading activities have come under severe financial pressures. Many of
these companies

II-182


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2004 Annual Report

have completely exited or drastically reduced all energy marketing and trading activities and
sold foreign and domestic electric infrastructure assets. The Company has not experienced any
material adverse financial impact regarding its limited energy trading operations through
Southern Company Services (SCS) and its recent generating capacity additions.

Environmental Matters

New Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil action in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against Alabama Power and Georgia Power.
The complaint alleged violations of the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act
and related state laws at five coal-fired generating facilities in Alabama and Georgia. The
civil action requested penalties and injunctive relief, including an order requiring the
installation of the best available control technology at the affected units. The EPA
concurrently issued to the retail operating companies notices of violation relating to ten
generating facilities, which included the five facilities mentioned previously and the Company’s
Plants Crist and Scherer. See Note 4 to the financial statements for information on the
Company’s ownership interest in Plant Scherer Unit 3. In early 2000, the EPA filed a motion to
amend its complaint to add the violations alleged in its notices of violation and to add the
Company, Mississippi Power, and Savannah Electric as defendants. However, in March 2001, the
court denied the motion with respect to the Company and Mississippi Power based on lack of
jurisdiction, and the EPA has not refiled. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “New
Source Review Actions” for additional information.

The Company believes that it has complied with applicable laws and the EPA regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act
authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $32,500 per day, per violation at each generating
unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in this matter could
require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly
require payment of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of operations, cash
flows, and possibly financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

In December 2002 and October 2003, the EPA issued final revisions to its NSR regulations under
the Clean Air Act. The December 2002 revisions included changes to the regulatory exclusions and
the methods of calculating emissions increases. The October 2003 regulations clarified the scope
of the existing Routine Maintenance, Repair, and Replacement (RMRR) exclusion. A coalition of
states and environmental organizations has filed petitions for review of these revisions with the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The October 2003 RMRR rules have been
stayed by the Court of Appeals pending its review of the rules. In any event, the final
regulations must be adopted by the individual states within the Company’s service territory in
order to apply to the Company’s facilities. The effect of these final regulations, related legal
challenges, and potential state rulemaking cannot be determined at this time.

Carbon Dioxide Litigation

On July 21, 2004, attorneys general from eight states, each outside of Southern Company’s service
territory, and the corporation counsel for New York City filed a complaint in the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York against Southern Company and four other electric power
companies. A nearly identical complaint was filed by three environmental groups in the same court.
The complaints allege that the companies’ emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas,
contribute to global warming, which the plaintiffs assert is a public nuisance. Under common law
public and private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs seek a judicial order (1) holding each
defendant jointly and severally liable for creating, contributing to, and/or maintaining global
warming and (2) requiring each of the defendants to cap its emissions of carbon dioxide and then
reduce those emissions by a specified percentage each year for at least a decade. Plaintiffs have
not, however, requested that damages be awarded in connection with their claims. Southern Company
believes these claims are without merit and notes that the complaint cites no statutory or
regulatory basis for the claims. Southern Company and the other defendants have filed motions to
dismiss both lawsuits. Southern Company intends to vigorously defend against these claims. While
the outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time, an adverse judgment in either of
these actions could result in substantial capital expenditures.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2004 Annual Report

Environmental Statutes and Regulations

The Company’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by state and federal environmental
agencies under a variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental media, including air,
water, and land resources. Compliance with these environmental requirements involves significant
capital and operating costs, a major portion of which is expected to be recovered through existing
ratemaking provisions. Environmental costs that are known and estimable at this time are included
in capital expenditures discussed under FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – “Capital Requirements
and Contractual Obligations” herein. The Florida Legislature has adopted legislation that allows a
utility to petition the Florida PSC for specific recovery of prudent environmental compliance costs
that are not being recovered through base rates or any other recovery mechanism. The legislation
is discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements under “Environmental Remediation.”
Substantially all of the costs for the Clean Air Act and other new environmental legislation
discussed below are expected to be recovered through the Environmental Cost Recovery Clause (ECRC).
There is no assurance, however, that all such costs will, in fact, be recovered.

Compliance with the Clean Air Act and resulting regulations has been and will continue to
be a significant focus for the Company. The Title IV acid rain provisions of the Clean Air Act,
for example, required significant reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide (NOx)
emissions and resulted in total construction expenditures of approximately $42 million through
2000.

In July 1997, the EPA revised the national ambient air quality standards for ozone and
particulate matter. These revisions made the standards significantly more stringent and included
development of an eight-hour ozone standard, as opposed to the one-hour ozone standard previously
established by the EPA. In the subsequent litigation of these standards, the U.S. Supreme Court
found the EPA’s implementation program for the new eight-hour ozone standard unlawful and remanded
it to the EPA for further rulemaking. During 2003, the EPA proposed implementation rules designed
to address the court’s concerns. On April 30, 2004, the EPA published its eight-hour ozone
nonattainment designations and a portion of the rules implementing the new eight-hour ozone
standard. Based on recommendations from the State of Florida, the EPA designated the entire State
of Florida as in attainment for the eight-hour ozone standard. The Company is, however, a partial owner of
a plant in Georgia that is located in an area determined by the EPA to be in nonattainment for the
standard. State implementation plans, including new emission control regulations necessary to
bring nonattainment areas into attainment, could be required as early as 2007. These state
implementation plans could require reductions in NOx emissions from power plants. The impact of
the eight-hour designations and the new standard will depend on the development and implementation
of applicable state implementation plans and therefore cannot be determined at this time.

On December 17, 2004, the EPA issued its final “nonattainment” designations for the fine
particulate national ambient air quality standard. The Company is a partial owner of a plant in
Georgia that is located in an area included in the EPA’s final particulate matter designations.
The EPA plans to propose a fine particulate matter implementation rule in 2005 and finalize the
implementation rule in 2006. State implementation plans addressing the nonattainment designations
may be required by 2008 and could require reductions in sulfur dioxide emissions and further
reductions in NOx emissions from power plants. The impact of the fine particulate designations
will depend on the development and implementation of applicable state implementation plans and
therefore cannot be determined at this time.

In August 2002, the Company entered into an agreement with the Florida Department of
Environmental Protection (FDEP) calling for NOx emission reductions at Plant Crist to help ensure
attainment of the new standards in the Pensacola area. Under the agreement, the Company will
install selective catalytic reduction controls and a new precipitator on Plant Crist Unit 7 during
2005. In addition, the Company agreed to retire Plant Crist Unit 1 in 2003 and Units 2 and 3 by
2006. The conditions of the agreement will be fully implemented by 2006 at a cost of approximately
$138 million, of which $43.6 million remains to be spent. Costs for implementation of the
agreement have been approved for recovery through the ECRC. See Note 1 to the financial statements
under “Environmental Cost Recovery” for additional information.

In January 2004, the EPA issued a proposed Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) to address
interstate transport of ozone and fine particles. This proposed rule would require additional
year-round sulfur dioxide and NOx emission reductions from power plants in the eastern United
States in two phases – in 2010 and 2015. The EPA

II-184


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2004 Annual Report

currently plans to finalize this rule in 2005. If finalized, the rule could modify or supplant
other state requirements for attainment of the fine particulate matter standard and the eight-hour
ozone standard, as well as other air quality regulations. The impact of this rule on the Company
will depend upon the specific requirements of the final rule and cannot be determined at this time.

The Company has developed and maintains an environmental compliance strategy for the
installation of additional control technologies and the purchase of emission allowances to
assure continued compliance with current sulfur dioxide and NOx emission regulations.
Additional expenses associated with these regulations are anticipated to be incurred each year
to maintain current and future compliance. Because the Company’s compliance strategy is
impacted by factors such as changes to existing environmental laws and regulations, increases in
the cost of emissions allowances, and any changes in the Company’s fuel mix, future
environmental compliance costs cannot be determined at this time.

Further reductions in sulfur dioxide and NOx could also be required under the EPA’s Regional
Haze rules. The Regional Haze rules require states to establish Best Available Retrofit Technology
(BART) standards for certain sources that contribute to regional haze and to implement emission
reduction requirements that make progress toward remedying current visibility impairment in certain
natural areas. The Company has a number of plants that could be subject to these rules. The EPA’s
Regional Haze program calls for states to submit implementation plans in 2008 that contain emission
reduction strategies for implementing BART and for achieving sufficient progress toward the Clean
Air Act’s visibility improvement goal. In response to litigation, the EPA proposed revised rules
in May 2004, which it plans to finalize in April 2005. The impact of these regulations will depend
on the promulgation of final rules and implementation of those rules by the states and, therefore,
it is not possible to determine the effect of these rules on the Company at this time.

The EPA’s Compliance Assurance Monitoring (CAM) regulations under Title V of the Clean Air Act
require that monitoring be performed to ensure compliance with emissions limitations on an ongoing
basis. This will begin taking place in 2005 for the Company’s affected units. Field testing
information collected in 2002, 2003, and 2004 was used to develop CAM protocols which were
successfully adopted into the Title V permit renewals at all affected Company plants.

In January 2004, the EPA issued proposed rules regulating mercury emissions from electric
utility boilers. The proposal solicits comments on two possible approaches for the new regulations
– a Maximum Achievable Control Technology approach and a cap-and-trade approach. Either approach
would require significant reductions in mercury emissions from Company facilities. The regulations
are scheduled to be finalized by March 2005, and compliance could be required as early as 2008.
Because the regulations have not been finalized, the impact on the Company cannot be determined at
this time.

Major bills to amend the Clean Air Act to impose more stringent emissions limitations on power
plants, including the Bush Administration’s Clear Skies Act, have been re-proposed in 2005. The
Clear Skies Act is expected to further limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide, NOx, and
mercury and to supplement the proposed CAIR and mercury regulatory programs. Other proposals to
limit emissions of carbon dioxide have also been introduced. The cost impacts of such legislation
would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined at this time.

Under the Clean Water Act, the EPA has been developing new rules aimed at reducing impingement
and entrainment of fish and fish larvae at power plants’ cooling water intake structures. In July
2004, the EPA published final rules that will require biological studies and, perhaps, retrofits to
some intake structures at existing power plants. The impact of these new rules will depend on the
results of studies and analyses performed as part of the rules’ implementation and the actual
limits established by the regulatory agencies.

Several major pieces of environmental legislation are periodically considered for
reauthorization or amendment by Congress. These include: the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water
Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Emergency Planning &
Community Right-to-Know Act; and the Endangered Species Act. Compliance with possible
additional federal or state legislation or regulations related to global climate change, or
other environmental and health concerns could also significantly affect the Company. The impact
of any new legislation, changes to existing legislation, or environmental regulations could
affect many areas of the Company’s operations.

II-185


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2004 Annual Report

The full impact of any such changes cannot, however, be determined at this time.

Global Climate Issues

Domestic efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions have been spurred by international discussions
surrounding the Framework Convention on Climate Change — and specifically the Kyoto Protocol —
which proposes constraints on the emissions of greenhouse gases for a group of industrialized
countries. The Bush Administration has not supported U.S. ratification of the Kyoto Protocol or
other mandatory carbon dioxide reduction legislation and, in 2002, announced a goal to reduce the
greenhouse gas intensity of the U.S. – the ratio of greenhouse gas emissions to the value of U.S.
economic output — by 18 percent by 2012. A year later, the Department of Energy (DOE) announced
the Climate VISION program to support this goal. Energy-intensive industries, including
electricity generation, are the initial focus of this program. Southern Company is leading the
development of a voluntary electric utility sector climate change initiative in partnership with
the government. The utility sector has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions rate by 3 to
5 percent over the next decade and, on December 13, 2004, signed a memorandum of understanding with
the DOE initiating this program under Climate VISION. Because efforts under this voluntary program
are just beginning, the impact of this program on the Company cannot be determined at this time.

Environmental Remediation Reserves

The Company must comply with environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling and
disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and
regulations, the Company may incur substantial costs to remediate properties. The Company
conducts studies to determine the extent of any required remediation and has recognized in the
financial statements costs to remediate known sites. During the third quarter 2004, the
Company increased its estimated liability for the estimated costs of environmental remediation
projects by approximately $47 million. This increase relates to new regulations and more
stringent site closure criteria by the FDEP for impacts to soil and groundwater from herbicide
applications at certain substation sites. Because FDEP approval is required prior to the
issuance of site closure, a timeframe for the completion of the remediation projects cannot be
determined. The projects have been approved by the Florida PSC for recovery, as expended,
through the Company’s ECRC; therefore, there was no impact on the Company’s net income as a
result of these revised estimates. Amounts for actual cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs were
not material for any year presented. The Company may be liable for some or all required
remediation costs for additional sites that may require environmental remediation. See Note 3
to the financial statements under “Environmental Remediation” for additional information.

FERC and Florida PSC Matters

Transmission

In December 1999, the FERC issued its final rule on Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs).
Since that time, there have been a number of additional proceedings at the FERC designed to
encourage further voluntary formation of RTOs or to mandate their formation. However, at the
current time, there are no active proceedings that would require the Company to participate in
an RTO. Current FERC efforts that may potentially change the regulatory and/or operational
structure of transmission include rules related to the standardization of generation
interconnection, as well as an inquiry into, among other things, market power by vertically
integrated utilities. See “Generation Interconnection Agreements” and “Market-Based Rate
Authority” herein for additional information. The final outcome of these proceedings cannot now
be determined. However, the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash
flows could be adversely affected by future changes in the federal regulatory or operational
structure of transmission.

Generation Interconnection Agreements

In July 2003, the FERC issued its final rule on the standardization of generation
interconnection agreements and procedures (Order 2003). Order 2003 shifts much of the financial
burden of new transmission investment from the generator to the transmission provider. The FERC
has indicated that Order 2003, which was effective January 20, 2004, is to be applied
prospectively to interconnection agreements. Subsidiaries of Tenaska, Inc., as counterparties
to three previously executed interconnection agreements with other subsidiaries of Southern
Company, have filed complaints at the FERC requesting that the FERC modify the agreements and
that Southern Company refund amounts previously paid for interconnection facilities, with
interest. The Company has received

II-186


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2004 Annual Report

similar requests from other entities totaling $6.6 million. The Company has opposed such
relief, and these matters are still outstanding. The impact of Order 2003 and its subsequent
rehearings on the Company and the final results of these matters cannot be determined at this
time.

Market-Based Rate Authority

The Company has obtained FERC approval to sell power to nonaffiliates at market-based prices under
specific contracts. Through SCS, as agent, the Company also has FERC authority to make
short-term opportunity sales at market rates. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect
to a market-based contract with an affiliate. In November 2001, the FERC modified the test it uses
to consider utilities’ applications to charge market-based rates and adopted a new test called the
Supply Margin Assessment (SMA). The FERC applied the SMA to several utilities, including Southern
Company, the retail operating companies, and Southern Power, and found Southern Company and others
to be “pivotal suppliers” in their retail service territories and ordered the implementation of
several mitigation measures. Southern Company and others sought rehearing of the FERC order, and
the FERC delayed the implementation of certain mitigation measures. In April 2004, the FERC issued
an order that abandoned the SMA test and adopted a new interim analysis for measuring generation
market power. This new interim approach requires utilities to submit a pivotal supplier screen and
a wholesale market share screen. If the applicant does not pass both screens, there will be a
rebuttable presumption regarding generation market power. The FERC’s order also sets forth
procedures for rebutting these presumptions and addresses mitigation measures for those entities
that are found to have market power. In the absence of specific mitigation measures, the order
includes several cost-based mitigation measures that would apply by default. The FERC also
initiated a new rulemaking proceeding that, among other things, will adopt a final methodology for
assessing generation market power.

In July 2004, the FERC denied Southern Company’s request for rehearing, along with a number of
others, and reaffirmed the interim tests that it adopted in April 2004. In August 2004, Southern
Company submitted a filing to the FERC that included results showing that Southern Company passed
the pivotal supplier screen for all markets and the wholesale market share screen for all markets
except the Southern Company retail service territory. Southern Company also submitted other
analyses to demonstrate that it lacks generation market power. On December 17, 2004, the FERC
initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation dominance within its retail service
territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other markets is not at issue. As directed
by this order, on February 15, 2005, Southern Company submitted additional information related to
generation dominance in its retail service territory. Any new market-based rate transactions in
the Southern Company retail service territory entered into after February 27, 2005 will be subject
to refund to the level of the default cost-based rates, pending the outcome of the proceeding.
Southern Company, along with other utilities, has also filed an appeal of the FERC’s April and July
2004 orders with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The FERC has
asked the court to dismiss the appeal on the grounds that it is premature.

In the event that the FERC’s default mitigation measures are ultimately applied, the Company
may be required to charge cost-based rates for certain wholesale sales in the Southern Company
retail service territory, which may be lower than negotiated market-based rates. The final outcome
of this matter will depend on the form in which the final methodology for assessing generation
market power and mitigation rules may be ultimately adopted and cannot be determined at this time.

Florida PSC and FDEP Report on Renewable Energy

The Florida PSC, in collaboration with the FDEP, was directed by the Florida Legislature to prepare
a report on renewable energy. A final report was prepared by the Florida PSC and the FDEP in
January 2003. This report describes various renewable and green energy options. The report
provided the Florida PSC, the FDEP, and the Florida Legislature with information on current and
potential technologies, costs, feasibility, and status of current renewable technologies within the
State of Florida. The report does not provide any formal policy recommendations with respect to
renewable energy but is intended to provide the Florida Legislature and policymakers a sound
starting point if they consider new legislation in this area. While the Company is actively
pursuing a renewable energy portfolio that may be incorporated into its offering to its customers,
the pursuit of a mandatory renewable portfolio standard or a benefits charge that could not be
passed on to customers by the state could add additional costs to the Company’s operations and
affect the Company’s competitive position.

II-187


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2004 Annual Report

Retail Fuel Cost Recovery

The Company has established fuel cost recovery rates approved by the Florida PSC. The Company
experienced higher than projected fuel costs for coal and natural gas which increased the under
recovered fuel costs included in the balance sheet in 2003. At December 31, 2004, the under
recovered amount was $7.9 million, a decrease of $12.4 million, or 61 percent, when compared to
2003, primarily due to more sales for resale which reduced the net amount of fuel expense to be
recovered from retail customers. Annually, the Company seeks recovery of projected costs including
any true-up amount from prior periods. Approved rates are implemented each January. Therefore,
the recovery provisions generally equal the related expenses and have no material effect on net
income.

Storm Damage Cost Recovery

On September 15 and 16, 2004, Hurricane Ivan hit the Gulf Coast of Florida and Alabama causing
substantial damage. Nearly 90% of the Company’s customers were without electric service
immediately after the hurricane. Almost 95% of those without power had service restored within
one week, and two weeks after the storm, power had been restored to all who could receive
service.

Under authority granted by the Florida PSC, the Company maintains a reserve for property
damage to cover the cost of damages from major storms to its transmission and distribution lines
and the cost of uninsured damages to its generation facilities and other property. Prior to
Hurricane Ivan, the Company’s reserve balance was approximately $27.8 million. The Company’s
estimated total cost of Hurricane Ivan is $141.5 million. Of this amount, approximately $17.2
million is covered by insurance. As a result, the accumulated reserve had a deficit balance of
approximately $96.5 million to be addressed through future accruals to the reserve or other
alternative recovery mechanisms. The Company’s current annual accrual to the property damage
reserve, as approved by the Florida PSC, is $3.5 million. The Florida PSC has also authorized the
Company to make additional accruals at the Company’s discretion.

On February 2, 2005, the Citizens of the State of Florida through the Office of Public
Counsel, the Florida Industrial Power Users Group, and the Company filed a Stipulation and
Settlement with the Florida PSC to resolve all matters regarding the effects of Hurricane Ivan
on the Company’s reserve for property damage (Stipulation).

Under the terms of the Stipulation, the Company will recover the retail portion of $51.7
million of Hurricane Ivan storm damage costs, plus interest and revenue taxes, through a monthly
surcharge applied to retail customer bills for a 24-month period. For purposes of the Stipulation,
such recovery amount excludes $44.8 million from the amount to be recovered, including $26.4
million in capital that will be included in retail rate base, and a $15 million discretionary
accrual to the reserve recorded by the Company in 2004 pursuant to the agreement between the
parties reached in the Stipulation.

Except under circumstances provided for within the Stipulation, the Company has agreed that it
will not seek any additional increase in its base rates and charges to become effective on or
before March 1, 2007. The Stipulation is subject to the approval of the Florida PSC, which is
expected to rule on the Stipulation at its next meeting in March 2005. The ultimate outcome of
this matter cannot now be determined. See Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements under
“Provision for Property Damage” and “Retail Regulatory Matters,” respectively, for additional
information.

Income Tax Matters

American Jobs Creation Act of 2004

On October 22, 2004, President Bush signed the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Jobs Act)
into law. The Jobs Act includes a provision that allows a generation tax deduction for
utilities. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the Jobs Act, including this
deduction, as well as the related regulatory treatment, on its taxable income. However, the
Company currently does not expect the Jobs Act to have a material impact on its financial
statements.

Other Matters

On August 12, 2004, Georgia Power and the Company entered into a PPA with FP&L. Under the
agreement, Georgia Power and the Company will provide FP&L with 165 megawatts of capacity annually
from the jointly owned Plant Scherer Unit 3 for the period from June 2010 through December 2015.
The contract provides for fixed capacity payments and variable energy payments based on actual
energy delivered. The Florida PSC approved the

II-188


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2004 Annual Report

contract on January 24, 2005; however, it is still contingent on certain events.

On November 29, 2004, Georgia Power and the Company entered into a PPA with Progress Energy
Florida. Under the PPA, Georgia Power and the Company will provide Progress Energy with 74
megawatts of capacity annually from the jointly owned Plant Scherer Unit 3 for the period from June
2010 through December 2015. The contract provides for fixed capacity payments and variable energy
payments based on actual energy delivered. The contract is contingent upon certain events,
including approval of the Florida PSC. A hearing has been scheduled for March 2005. The final
outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Also in 2004, Georgia Power and the Company entered into a PPA with Flint Electric
Membership Corporation. Under the agreement, Georgia Power and the Company will provide Flint
Electric Membership Corporation with 75 megawatts of capacity annually from the jointly owned Plant Scherer Unit 3 for
the period from June 2010 through December 2019. The contract provides for fixed capacity
payments and variable energy payments based on actual energy delivered.

In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 87, Employers’
Accounting for Pensions, the Company recorded non-cash pension income, before tax, of
approximately $2.5 million, $4.9 million, and $5.6 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002,
respectively. Future pension income is dependent on several factors including trust earnings
and changes to the pension plan. The decline in pension income is expected to continue and
become an expense as early as 2006. Postretirement benefit costs for the Company were $5.1
million, $4.9 million, and $4.5 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively, and are expected
to continue to trend upward. A portion of pension income and postretirement benefit costs is
capitalized based on construction-related labor charges. Pension and postretirement benefit
costs are a component of regulated rates and generally do not have a long-term effect on net
income. For more information regarding pension and postretirement benefits, see Note 2 to the
financial statements.

The Company is involved in various other matters being litigated and regulatory matters that
could affect future earnings. See Note 3 to the financial statements for information regarding
material issues.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may
have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations and related disclosures.
Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different
from those recorded in the financial statements. Southern Company senior management has
discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates
described below with the Audit Committee of Southern Company’s Board of Directors.

Electric Utility Regulation

The Company is subject to retail regulation by the Florida PSC and wholesale regulation by the
FERC. These regulatory agencies set the rates the Company is permitted to charge customers
based on allowable costs. As a result, the Company applies FASB Statement No. 71, Accounting
for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, which requires the financial statements to
reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the ratemaking process, the regulators may
require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when they would be
recognized by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of expenses
and the recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery through
rates or the deferral of gains or creation of liabilities and the recording of related
regulatory liabilities. The application of Statement No. 71 has a further effect on the
Company’s financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the
ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from those actually incurred by the Company;
therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation and pension
and postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on the Company’s results of operations
than they would on a non-regulated company.

As reflected in Note 1 to the financial statements, significant regulatory assets and
liabilities have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of these
regulatory assets and liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines. However,

II-189


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2004 Annual Report

adverse legislative, judicial, or regulatory actions could materially impact the amounts of such
regulatory assets and liabilities and could adversely impact the Company’s financial statements.

Contingent Obligations

The Company is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other
factors and conditions that potentially subject it to environmental, litigation, income tax, and
other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Note 3 to the financial statements for
more information regarding certain of these contingencies. The Company periodically evaluates
its exposure to such risks and records reserves for those matters where a loss is considered
probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or conditions that can
be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially affect the
Company’s financial statements. These events or conditions include the following:

•

Changes in existing state or federal regulation by governmental
authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality,
control of toxic substances, hazardous and solid wastes, and other
environmental matters.

•

Changes in existing income tax regulations or changes in Internal
Revenue Service interpretations of existing regulations.

•

Identification of additional sites that require environmental
remediation or the filing of other complaints in which the Company may
be asserted to be a potentially responsible party.

•

Identification and evaluation of other potential lawsuits or
complaints in which the Company may be named as a defendant.

•

Resolution or progression of existing matters through the legislative
process, the court systems, or the EPA.

Unbilled Revenues

Revenues related to the sale of electricity are recorded when electricity is delivered to
customers. However, the determination of KWH sales to individual customers is based on the
reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis through the month. At the end
of each month, amounts of electricity delivered to customers, but not yet metered and billed,
are estimated. Components of the unbilled revenue estimates include total KWH territorial
supply, total KWH billed, estimated total electricity lost in delivery, and customer usage.
These components can fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including weather, generation
patterns, power delivery volume, and other operational constraints. These factors can be
unpredictable and can vary from historical trends. As a result, the overall estimate of
unbilled revenues could be significantly affected, which could have a material impact on the
Company’s results of operations.

New Accounting Standards

On March 31, 2004, the Company prospectively adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities, which requires the primary beneficiary of a variable interest
entity to consolidate the related assets and liabilities. The adoption of FASB Interpretation
No. 46R had no impact on the Company’s net income. However, as a result of the adoption, the
Company deconsolidated certain wholly-owned trusts established to issue preferred securities
since the Company does not meet the definition of primary beneficiary established by FASB
Interpretation No. 46R. See Note 1 to the financial statements under “Variable Interest
Entities” for additional information

.

In the third quarter 2004, the Company prospectively adopted FASB Staff Position (FSP)
106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act). The Medicare Act provides a 28
percent prescription drug subsidy for Medicare eligible retirees. FSP 106-2 requires
recognition of the impacts of the Medicare Act in the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation (APBO) and future cost of service for postretirement medical plans. The effect of
the subsidy reduced the Company’s expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2004 by
approximately $0.5 million and is expected to have a similar impact on future years. The
subsidy’s impact on the postretirement medical plan APBO was a reduction of approximately $8.0
million. However, the ultimate impact on future periods is subject to final interpretation of
the federal regulations which were published on January 21, 2005. See Note 2 to the financial
statements under “Postretirement Benefits” for additional information.

FASB Statement No. 123R, Share-Based Payment was issued in December 2004. This statement
requires

II-190


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2004 Annual Report

that compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions be recognized in financial
statements. That cost will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity or
liability instruments issued. For the Company, this statement is effective beginning on July 1,
2005. Although the compensation expense required under the revised statement differs slightly,
the impacts on the financial statements are expected to be similar to the pro forma disclosures
included in Note 1 to the financial statements under “Stock Options.”

See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “Income Tax Matters — American Jobs Creation Act of 2004”
herein for information regarding the adoption of new tax legislation. In December 2004, the
FASB issued FSP 109-1, Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to
the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act
of 2004, which requires that the generation deduction be accounted for as a special tax
deduction rather than as a tax rate reduction. The Company is currently assessing the Jobs Act
and this pronouncement, as well as the related regulatory treatment, but currently does not
expect a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

The Company’s financial
condition continued to be strong at December 31, 2004. Net cash flow from operating activities
totaled $143.2 million, $191.2 million, and $135.9 million for 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.
The majority of the decrease from 2003 to 2004 is due to payments related to storm damage from
Hurricane Ivan. The increase from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to an increase in prepayments,
reduced accounts receivable from customers and the recovery of additional fuel costs. Gross
property additions were $161.2 million in 2004. Funds for the Company’s property additions were
provided by operating activities, capital contributions, and other financing activities. See the
statements of cash flows for additional information.

Significant balance sheet changes include the $50 million increase in securities due within
one year due to bank notes issued to temporarily finance costs associated with Hurricane Ivan
restoration.

The Company’s ratio of common equity to total capitalization — including short-term debt
— was 43.2 percent in 2004, 45.3 percent in 2003, and 44.0 percent in 2002. See Note 6 to the
financial statements for additional information.

The Company has received investment grade ratings from the major rating agencies.

Sources of Capital

The Company plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes, including
compliance with environmental regulations, from sources similar to those used in the past. These
sources include operating cash flows and the issuance of unsecured debt and preferred securities,
as well as pollution control revenue bonds issued for the Company’s benefit by public authorities.
However, the type and timing of any future financings—if needed—will depend on market conditions
and regulatory approval.

The Company has no restrictions on the amounts of unsecured indebtedness it may incur.
However, the Company is required to meet certain coverage requirements specified in its mortgage
indenture and corporate charter in order to issue new first mortgage bonds and preferred stock.
The Company’s coverage ratios are high enough to permit, at present interest rate levels, any
foreseeable security sales. The amount of securities that the Company will be permitted to issue
in the future will depend upon market conditions and other factors prevailing at that time.

The issuance of securities, including financing associated with the issuance of pollution
control bonds, is subject to regulatory approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 as amended (PUHCA), and the Florida PSC
pursuant to its rules and regulations. In recent years, financings primarily have utilized
unsecured debt and preferred securities. Additionally, with respect to the public offering of
securities, the Company must file registration statements with the SEC under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (1933 Act). The amounts of securities authorized by the appropriate
regulatory authorities, as well as the amounts registered under the 1933 Act, are continuously
monitored and appropriate filings are made to ensure flexibility in the capital markets.

The Company obtains financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. The
Southern Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money

II-191


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2004 Annual Report

pool. Therefore, funds of the Company are not commingled with funds of any other company. In
accordance with PUHCA, most loans between affiliated companies must be approved in advance by the
SEC.

The Company’s current liabilities exceed current assets due to the scheduled maturity of $100
million in bank notes issued to temporarily finance costs associated with Hurricane Ivan repairs.
See “Financing Activities” herein for additional information.

To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the Company has various internal and external
sources of liquidity. At the beginning of 2005, the Company had approximately $64.8 million of
cash and cash equivalents, along with $56.3 million of unused committed lines of credit with banks
to meet its short-term cash needs. These bank credit arrangements will expire during 2005. The
Company plans to renew these lines of credit during 2005. In addition, the Company has substantial
cash flow from operating activities. See Note 6 to the financial statements under “Bank Credit
Arrangements” for additional information.

The Company may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company subsidiary
organized to issue and sell commercial paper and extendible commercial notes at the request and for
the benefit of the Company and the other Southern Company retail operating companies. Proceeds
from such issuances for the benefit of the Company are loaned directly to the Company and are not
commingled with proceeds from such issuances for the benefit of any other operating company. There
is no cross affiliate credit support. At December 31, 2004, the Company had no commercial paper or
extendible commercial notes outstanding.

Financing Activities

During 2004, the Company issued $110 million of senior notes. The issuances were used to refund
$75 million of senior notes and to pay at maturity $50 million of senior notes due August 15, 2004.
In addition, on October 27, 2004, the Company issued $100 million of bank notes due October 28,
2005. This issuance was used to temporarily finance costs associated with Hurricane Ivan repairs.
See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “Storm Damage Cost Recovery” herein for additional information.

Composite financing rates for long-term debt have decreased from 5.34 percent in 2002, to 4.60
percent in 2003, and 4.18 percent in 2004.

Credit Rating Risk

The Company does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment
schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. There are certain contracts
that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change
to BBB- or Baa3, or below. Generally, collateral may be provided for by a Southern Company
guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. These contracts are primarily for physical electricity
purchases and sales. At December 31, 2004, the maximum potential collateral requirements at a BBB-
or Baa3 rating were approximately $5 million. The maximum potential collateral requirements at a
rating below BBB- or Baa3 were approximately $10 million. The Company is also party to certain
derivative agreements that could require collateral and/or accelerated payment in the event of a
credit rating change to below investment grade. These agreements are primarily for natural gas
price and interest rate risk management activities. At December 31, 2004, the Company had no
material exposure related to these agreements.

Market Price Risk

Due to cost-based rate regulation, the Company has limited exposure to market volatility in
interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity. To manage the volatility
attributable to these exposures, the Company nets the exposures to take advantage of natural
offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to the
Company’s policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and risk management practices. Company
policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and mandates strict
adherence to all applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are monitored using
techniques including but not limited to market valuation, value at risk, stress testing, and
sensitivity analysis.

The weighted average interest rate on $144.6 million variable long-term debt that has not been
hedged at January 1, 2005 was 1.97 percent. If the Company sustained a 100 basis point change in
interest rates for all variable rate long-term debt, the change would affect annualized interest
expense by approximately $1.4 million

at January 1, 2005. The Company is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
significantly affect such exposures in the near term. See Notes 1 and 6 to the financial
statements under “Financial Instruments” for additional information.

Unrealized gains and losses from mark-to-market adjustments on derivative contracts related to
the Company’s fuel hedging programs are recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities. Realized
gains and losses from these programs are included in fuel expense and are recovered through the
Company’s fuel cost recovery clause. Gains and losses on derivative contracts that are not
designated as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as incurred. At December 31, 2004,
the fair value of derivative energy contracts was reflected in the financial statements as follows:

Unrealized gains (losses) recognized in income were not material in any year presented. The
Company is exposed to market price risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the
derivative energy contracts. The Company’s policy is to enter into agreements with counterparties
that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s or with counterparties
who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. Therefore, the Company does not
anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the counterparties. See Notes 1 and 6 to
the financial statements under “Financial Instruments” for additional information.

Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations

The construction program of the Company is currently estimated to be $154 million in 2005, $112
million in 2006, and $103 million in 2007. These amounts include $40 million and $4 million in
2005 and 2006, respectively, for capital expenditures related to environmental controls at
Plant Crist as part of an agreement with the FDEP to reduce NOx emissions. The Florida PSC
authorized the Company to recover the costs related to these environmental projects through the
ECRC. The construction program also includes $15 million in 2005, $9 million in 2006, and $23
million in 2007 for other environmental expenditures. Actual construction costs may vary from
this estimate because of changes in such factors as the following: business conditions;
environmental regulations; FERC rules and transmission regulations; load projections; the cost
and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; and the cost of capital. In
addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully
recovered.

The Company does not have any new generating capacity scheduled to be placed in service
through 2007. Construction of new transmission and distribution facilities and capital
improvements, including those needed to meet environmental standards for the Company’s existing
generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, are ongoing.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

The Company’s 2004 Annual Report contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements
include, among other things, statements concerning the strategic goals for the Company’s retail
sales growth, environmental regulations and expenditures, storm damage cost recovery, the Company’s
projections for postretirement benefit trust contributions, and estimated construction and other
expenditures. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as
“may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,”
“projects,” “predicts,” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other similar
terminology. There are various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from
those suggested by the forward-looking statements; accordingly, there can be no assurance that such
indicated results will be realized. These factors include:

•

the impact of recent and future federal and state regulatory change, including legislative and regulatory initiatives
regarding deregulation and restructuring of the electric utility industry, and also changes in environmental, tax and
other laws and regulations to which the Company is subject, as well as changes in application of existing laws and
regulations;

•

current and future litigation, regulatory investigations, proceedings or inquiries actions against the Company;

•

the effects, extent, and timing of the entry of additional competition in the markets in which the Company operates;

•

variations in demand for electricity and gas, including those relating to weather, the general economy and population
and business growth (and declines);

•

available sources and costs of fuels;

•

ability to control costs;

•

investment performance of the Company’s employee benefit plans;

•

advances in technology;

•

state and federal rate regulations and the impact of pending and future rate cases and negotiations;

•

internal restructuring or other restructuring options that may be pursued;

•

potential business strategies, including acquisitions or dispositions of assets or businesses, which cannot be assured
to be completed or beneficial to the Company;

•

the ability of counterparties of the Company to make payments as and when due;

•

the ability to obtain new short- and long-term contracts with neighboring utilities;

•

the direct or indirect effect on the Company’s business resulting from terrorist incidents and the threat of terrorist
incidents;

•

interest rate fluctuations and financial market conditions and the results of financing efforts, including the
Company’s credit ratings;

•

the ability of the Company to obtain additional generating capacity at competitive prices;

•

catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, hurricanes or other similar occurrences;

•

the direct or indirect effects on the Company’s business resulting from incidents similar to the August 2003 power
outage in the Northeast;

•

the effect of accounting pronouncements issued periodically by standard setting bodies; and

•

other factors discussed elsewhere herein and in other reports (including the Form 10-K) filed by the Company from time
to time with the SEC.

The Company expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

Gulf Power Company 2004 Annual Report

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General

Gulf Power Company (Company) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company, which is the parent company of five retail operating companies,
Southern Power Company (Southern Power), Southern Company Services (SCS), Southern Communications
Services (SouthernLINC Wireless), Southern Company Gas (Southern Company GAS), Southern Company
Holdings (Southern Holdings), Southern Nuclear Operating Company (Southern Nuclear), Southern
Telecom, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The retail operating companies — Alabama
Power, Georgia Power, the Company, Mississippi Power, and Savannah Electric — provide electric
service in four Southeastern states. The Company operates as a vertically integrated utility
providing service to customers in northwest Florida and to wholesale customers in the Southeast.
Southern Power constructs, owns, and manages Southern Company’s competitive generation assets and
sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Contracts among the retail
operating companies and Southern Power — related to jointly owned generating facilities,
interconnecting transmission lines, or the exchange of electric power — are regulated by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and/or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and
the subsidiary companies. SouthernLINC Wireless provides digital wireless communications services
to the retail operating companies and also markets these services to the public within the
Southeast. Southern Telecom provides fiber cable services within the Southeast. Southern Company
GAS is a competitive retail natural gas marketer serving customers in Georgia. Southern Holdings
is an intermediate holding subsidiary for Southern Company’s investments in synthetic fuels and
leveraged leases and various other energy-related businesses. Southern Nuclear operates and
provides services to Southern Company’s nuclear power plants.

Southern Company is registered as a holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, as amended (PUHCA). Both Southern Company and its subsidiaries, including the
Company, are subject to the regulatory provisions of the PUHCA. The Company is also subject to
regulation by the FERC and the Florida Public Service Commission (PSC). The Company follows
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and complies with the accounting
policies and practices prescribed by its regulatory commissions. The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates.

The equity method is used for subsidiaries in which the Company has significant influence but
does not control and for variable interest entities where the Company is not the primary
beneficiary. Certain prior years’ data presented in the financial statements have been
reclassified to conform with current year presentation.

Affiliate Transactions

The Company has an agreement with SCS under which the following services are rendered to the
Company at direct or allocated cost: general and design engineering, purchasing, accounting and
statistical analysis, finance and treasury, tax, information resources, marketing, auditing,
insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, and other services
with respect to business and operations and power pool transactions. Costs for these services
amounted to $56 million, $55 million, and $49 million during 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.
Cost allocation methodologies used by SCS are approved by the SEC and management believes they are
reasonable.

The Company has agreements with Georgia Power and Mississippi Power under which the Company
owns a portion of Plant Scherer and Plant Daniel. Georgia Power operates Plant Scherer and
Mississippi Power operates Plant Daniel. The Company reimbursed Georgia Power $6.8 million, $4.9
million, and $4.5 million and Mississippi Power $17.8 million, $17.7 million, and $16.6 million in
2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively, for its proportionate share of related expenses. See Note 4
and Note 7 under “Operating Leases” for additional information. Also, see Note 5 for information
on certain deferred tax liabilities due to affiliates.

The retail operating companies (including the Company), Southern Power, and Southern Company
GAS

II-202


NOTES (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2004 Annual Report

may jointly enter into various types of wholesale energy, natural gas, and certain other contracts,
either directly or through SCS, as agent. Each participating company may be jointly and severally
liable for the obligations incurred under these agreements. See Note 7 under “Fuel and Purchased
Power Commitments” for additional information.

Revenues

Revenues are recognized as services are rendered. Unbilled revenues are accrued at the end of each
fiscal period. Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is used. The Company’s retail electric rates
include provisions to annually adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, the energy component
of purchased power costs, and certain other costs. The Company has similar retail cost recovery
clauses for energy conservation costs, purchased power capacity costs, and environmental compliance
costs. Revenues are adjusted for differences between the actual recoverable costs and amounts
billed in current regulated rates.

The Company has a diversified base of customers and no single customer or industry comprises
10 percent or more of revenues. For all periods presented, uncollectible accounts averaged
significantly less than 1 percent of revenues.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

The Company is subject to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement
No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. Regulatory assets represent
probable future revenues associated with certain costs that are expected to be recovered from
customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future
reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be credited to customers
through the ratemaking process. Regulatory assets and (liabilities) reflected in the balance
sheets at December 31 relate to:

Note: The recovery and amortization periods for these regulatory assets and (liabilities) are
as follows:

In the event that a portion of the Company’s operations is no longer subject to the
provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, the Company would be required to write off related regulatory
assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable through regulated rates. In addition,
the Company would be required to determine if any impairment to other assets, including plant,
exists and write down the assets, if impaired, to their fair value. All regulatory assets and
liabilities are currently reflected in rates.

Income Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provides
deferred income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences. Investment tax
credits utilized are deferred

II-203


NOTES (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2004 Annual Report

and amortized to income over the average life of the related property.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation of the original cost of plant in service is provided primarily by using composite
straight-line rates, which approximated 3.8 percent in 2004, 3.8 percent in 2003, and 3.9
percent in 2002. When property subject to depreciation is retired or otherwise disposed of in
the normal course of business, its cost — together with the cost of removal, less salvage — is
charged to the accumulated provision for depreciation. Minor items of property included in the
original cost of the plant are retired when the related property unit is retired.

Asset Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of Removal

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations. Statement No. 143 establishes new accounting and reporting standards
for legal obligations associated with the ultimate cost of retiring long-lived assets. The
present value of the ultimate cost for an asset’s future retirement is recorded in the period in
which the liability is incurred. The costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived
asset and depreciated over the asset’s useful life. Although Statement No. 143 does not permit
the continued accrual of future retirement costs for long-lived assets that the Company does not
have a legal obligation to retire, the Company has received accounting guidance from the Florida
PSC allowing such treatment. Accordingly, the accumulated removal costs for other obligations
previously accrued will continue to be reflected on the balance sheets as a regulatory
liability. Therefore, the Company had no cumulative effect to net income resulting from the
adoption of Statement No. 143.

The liability recognized under Statement No. 143 to retire long-lived assets primarily
relates to the Company’s combustion turbines at its Pea Ridge facility, various landfill sites,
ash ponds, and a barge unloading dock. The Company has also identified retirement obligations
related to certain transmission and distribution facilities. However, liabilities for the
removal of these transmission and distribution assets have not been recorded because no
reasonable estimate can be made regarding the timing of the obligations. The Company will
continue to recognize in statements of income allowed removal costs in accordance with its
regulatory treatment. Any differences between costs recognized under Statement No. 143 and
those reflected in rates are recognized as either a regulatory asset or liability and are
reflected in the balance sheets.

Details of the asset retirement obligations included in the balance sheets are as follows:

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC)

In accordance with regulatory treatment, the Company records AFUDC on certain construction
projects. AFUDC represents the estimated debt and equity costs of capital funds that are necessary
to finance the construction of new regulated facilities. While cash is not realized currently from
such allowance, it increases the revenue requirement over the service life of the plant through a
higher rate base and higher depreciation expense. For the years 2004, 2003, and 2002, the average
AFUDC rates were 7.48 percent, 7.48 percent, and 7.35 percent, respectively. AFUDC, net of taxes,
as a percentage of net income after dividends on preferred stock was 3.46 percent, 1.31 percent,
and 5.72 percent, respectively, for 2004, 2003, and 2002.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost less regulatory disallowances and
impairments. Original cost includes: materials; labor; minor items of property; appropriate
administrative and general costs; payroll-related costs such as taxes, pensions, and other
benefits, and the interest capitalized and/or estimated cost of funds used during construction.
The cost of maintenance, repairs, and replacement of minor items of property is charged to
maintenance expense as incurred or performed. The cost of replacements of property — exclusive of
minor items of property — is capitalized.

II-204


NOTES (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2004 Annual Report

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles

The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of
whether an impairment has occurred is based on either a specific regulatory disallowance or an
estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared to the carrying
value of the assets. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment recognized is
determined by either the amount of regulatory disallowance or by estimating the fair value of the
assets and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. For assets
identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value less the
cost to sell in order to determine if an impairment provision is required. Until the assets are
disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or events change.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are considered cash
equivalents. Temporary cash investments are securities with original maturities of 90 days or
less.

Materials and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include the average cost of transmission, distribution, and
generating plant materials. Materials are charged to inventory when purchased and then expensed or
capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when installed.

Stock Options

Southern Company provides non-qualified stock options to a large segment of the Company’s employees
ranging from line management to executives. The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation
plans in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25. Accordingly, no compensation
expense has been recognized because the exercise price of all options granted equaled the
fair-market value of Southern Company’s common stock on the date of grant. When options are
exercised, the Company receives a capital contribution from Southern Company equivalent to the
related income tax benefit.

Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to fluctuations in interest
rates, the prices of certain fuel purchases, and electricity purchases and sales. All
derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured
at fair value. Substantially all of the Company’s bulk energy purchases and sales contracts
that meet the definition of a derivative are exempt from fair value accounting requirements and
are accounted for under the accrual method. Other derivative contracts qualify as cash flow
hedges of anticipated transactions. This results in the deferral of related gains and losses in
other comprehensive income or regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate until the hedged
transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness is recognized currently in net income. Other
derivative contracts are marked to market through current period income and are recorded on a
net basis in the statements of income.

The Company is exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of
counterparties’ nonperformance. The Company has established

controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate

The fair values were based on either closing market price or closing price of comparable

Preferred Securities/ Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts” for additional information.

Comprehensive Income

The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of all changes in common stock
equity of an enterprise that result from transactions and other economic events of the period
other than transactions with owners. Comprehensive income consists of net income, changes in
the fair value of qualifying cash flow hedges and marketable securities, and changes in
additional minimum pension liability, less income taxes and reclassifications for amounts
included in net income.

Provision for Injuries and Damages

The Company is subject to claims and suits arising in the ordinary course of business. As
permitted by regulatory authorities, the Company accrues for the uninsured costs of injuries and
damages by charges to income amounting to $1.6 million annually. The Florida PSC has also given
the Company the flexibility to increase its annual accrual above $1.6 million to the extent the
balance in the accumulated provision does not exceed $2 million. The cost of settling claims is
charged to the provision. The accumulated provision of $1.7 million and $0.1 million at December
31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, is included in other current liabilities in the balance sheets.
See Note 3 under “Personal Injury Litigation” for additional information. In addition to the
accumulated provision, at December 31, 2004, the Company had a liability with a corresponding
regulatory asset of $4.8 million for estimated liabilities related to outstanding claims and suits.

Provision for Property Damage

The Company accrues for the cost of repairing damages from major storms and other uninsured
property damages, including damages to transmission and distribution lines and the cost of
uninsured damages to its generation facilities and other property. The cost of such damages is
charged to the accrual. The Florida PSC approved annual accrual to the accumulated provision for
property damage is $3.5 million, with a target level for the accumulated provision account between
$25.1 million and $36.0 million. The Florida PSC also authorized the Company to make additional
accruals above the $3.5 million at the Company’s discretion. The Company accrued total expenses of
$18.5 million in 2004, $10.6 million in 2003, and $3.5 million in 2002. At December 31, 2004, the
accumulated provision for property damage was $(48.3) million and is included in miscellaneous
regulatory assets in the balance sheets. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail
Regulatory Matters” for additional information.

Environmental Cost Recovery

The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling
and disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and
regulations, the Company may also incur substantial costs to clean up properties. The Company
received authority from the Florida PSC to recover approved environmental compliance costs
through the ECRC. The Florida PSC reviews costs and adjusts rates up or down annually. See
Note 3 under “Environmental Remediation” for information on additional environmental remediation
accruals in 2004.

Variable Interest Entities

On March 31, 2004, the Company prospectively adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities, which requires the primary beneficiary of a variable interest
entity to consolidate the related assets and liabilities. The adoption of Interpretation No.
46R had no impact on the net income

II-206


NOTES (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2004 Annual Report

of the Company. However, as a result of the adoption, the Company deconsolidated certain
wholly-owned trusts established to issue preferred securities since the Company is not the
primary beneficiary of the trusts. Therefore, the investments in these trusts are reflected as
Other Investments for the Company. The related loans from the trusts are reflected as Long-term
Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts on the balance sheets. This treatment resulted in an increase
of $2.2 million in both total assets and total liabilities as of March 31, 2004.

2. RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company has a defined benefit, trusteed, pension plan covering substantially all employees.
The plan is funded in accordance with Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
(ERISA), requirements. No contributions to the plan are expected for the year ending December 31,
2005. The Company also provides certain non-qualified benefit plans for a selected group of
management and highly compensated employees. Benefits under these non-qualified plans are funded
on a cash basis. The Company provides certain medical care and life insurance benefits for retired
employees. In addition, trusts are funded to the extent required by the Florida PSC and the FERC.
For the year ended December 31, 2005, postretirement trust contributions are expected to total
approximately $70,000.

The measurement date for plan assets and obligations is September 30 of each year.

Pension Plans

The accumulated benefit obligation for the pension plans was $204 million in 2004 and $186 million
in 2003. Changes during the year in the projected benefit obligations, accumulated benefit
obligations, and fair value of plan assets were as follows:

In the third quarter 2004, the Company prospectively adopted FASB Staff Position (FSP)
106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act). The Medicare Act provides a 28
percent prescription drug subsidy for Medicare eligible retirees. FSP 106-2 requires
recognition of the impacts of the Medicare Act in the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation (APBO) and future cost of service for postretirement medical plan. The effect of the
subsidy reduced the Company’s expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2004 by
approximately $0.5 million and is expected to have a similar impact on future years. The
subsidy’s impact on the postretirement medical plan APBO was a reduction of approximately $8.0
million. However, the ultimate impact on future periods is subject to federal regulations
governing the subsidy created in the Medicare Act which are being finalized.

Future benefit payments, including prescription drug benefits, reflect expected future
service and are estimated based on the assumptions used to measure the accumulated benefit
obligation for the postretirement plan. Estimated benefit payments are reduced by drug subsidy
receipts expected as a result of the Medicare Act as follows:

An additional assumption used in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation
was a weighted average medical care cost trend rate of 11 percent for 2004, decreasing gradually to
5 percent through the year 2012, and remaining at that level thereafter. An annual increase or

CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY MATTERS

General Litigation Matters

The Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of
business. In addition, the Company’s business activities are subject to extensive governmental
regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation over environmental issues and
claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, and citizen enforcement of
environmental requirements, has increased generally throughout the United States. In particular,
personal injury claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become
more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such litigation against the Company cannot be predicted at
this time; however, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such
current proceedings would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements.

New Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil action in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against Alabama Power and Georgia Power,
alleging violations of the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act and related
state laws at five coal-fired generating facilities in Alabama and Georgia. The EPA
concurrently issued to each of the retail operating companies notices of violation relating to
10 generating facilities, which included the five facilities mentioned previously and the
Company’s Plants Crist and Scherer. See Note 4 for information on the Company’s ownership
interest in Plant Scherer Unit 3. In early 2000, the EPA filed a motion to amend its complaint
to add the violations alleged in its notices of violation and to add the Company, Mississippi
Power, and Savannah Electric as defendants.

The U.S. District Court in Georgia subsequently granted Alabama Power’s motion to dismiss
and denied the EPA’s motion to add the Company and Mississippi Power for lack of jurisdiction in
Georgia. In March 2001, the court granted the EPA’s motion to add Savannah Electric as a
defendant and to add allegations regarding two additional generating facilities owned by Alabama
Power. As directed by the court, the EPA refiled its amended complaint limiting claims to those
brought against Georgia Power and Savannah Electric. In addition, the EPA refiled its claims
against Alabama Power in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. These
civil complaints allege violations with respect to eight coal-fired generating facilities in
Alabama and Georgia, and they request penalties and injunctive relief, including an order
requiring the installation of the best available control technology at the affected units. The
EPA has not refiled against the Company or Mississippi Power.

The actions against Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Savannah Electric were effectively
stayed in the spring of 2001 during the appeal of a similar NSR enforcement action against the
Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. In
June 2003, the Court of Appeals issued its ruling in the TVA case, dismissing the appeal for
reasons unrelated to the issues in the cases pending against Alabama Power, Georgia Power and
Savannah Electric. In May 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the EPA’s petition for review of
the case. In June 2004, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama lifted the
stay in the action against Alabama Power, placing the case back onto the court’s active docket.
At this time, no party to the case against Georgia Power and Savannah Electric has sought to
reopen that case, which remains administratively closed in the District Court for the Northern
District of Georgia.

Since the inception of the NSR proceedings against Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and
Savannah Electric, the EPA has also been proceeding with similar NSR enforcement actions against
other utilities, involving many of the same legal issues. In each case, the EPA alleged that
the utilities failed to comply with the NSR permitting requirements when performing maintenance
and construction activities at coal-burning plants, which activities the utilities considered to
be routine or otherwise not subject to NSR. District courts addressing these cases have, to
date, issued opinions

II-210


NOTES (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2004 Annual Report

that reached conflicting conclusions.

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA’s regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act
authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $32,500 per day, per violation at each
generating unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in this
matter could require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and
could possibly require payment of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of
operations, cash flows, and possibly financial condition if such costs are not recovered through
regulated rates.

In December 2002 and October 2003, the EPA issued final revisions to its NSR regulations
under the Clean Air Act. The December 2002 revisions included changes to the regulatory
exclusions and the methods of calculating emissions increases. The October 2003 regulations
clarified the scope of the existing Routine Maintenance, Repair, and Replacement (RMRR)
exclusion. A coalition of states and environmental organizations has filed petitions for review
of these revisions with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The
October 2003 RMRR rules have been stayed by the Court of Appeals pending its review of the
rules. In any event, the final regulations must be adopted by the individual states within the
Company’s service territory in order to apply to the Company’s facilities. The effect of these
final regulations, related legal challenges and potential state rulemaking cannot be determined
at this time.

Generation Interconnection Agreements

In July 2003, the FERC issued its final rule on the standardization of generation
interconnection agreements and procedures (Order 2003). Order 2003 shifts much of the financial
burden of new transmission investment from the generator to the transmission provider. The FERC
has indicated that Order 2003, which was effective January 20, 2004, is to be applied
prospectively to interconnection agreements. Subsidiaries of Tenaska, Inc., as counterparties
to three previously executed interconnection agreements with other subsidiaries of Southern
Company, have filed complaints at the FERC requesting that the FERC modify the agreements and
that Southern Company refund amounts previously paid for interconnection facilities, with
interest. The Company has received similar requests from other entities totaling $6.6 million.
Southern Company has opposed such relief and these matters are still outstanding. The impact of
Order 2003 and its subsequent rehearings on the Company and the final results of these matters
cannot be determined at this time.

Market-Based Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to nonaffiliates at market-based
prices. Through SCS, as agent, the Company also has FERC authority to make short-term
opportunity sales at market rates. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a
market-based contract with an affiliate. In November 2001, the FERC modified the test it uses
to consider utilities’ applications to charge market-based rates and adopted a new test called
the Supply Margin Assessment (SMA). The FERC applied the SMA to several utilities, including
Southern Company, the retail operating companies, and Southern Power, and found them and others
to be “pivotal suppliers” in their retail service territories and ordered the implementation of
several mitigation measures. Southern Company sought rehearing of the FERC order, and the FERC
delayed the implementation of certain mitigation measures. In April 2004, the FERC issued an
order that abandoned the SMA test and adopted a new interim analysis for measuring generation
market power. This new interim approach requires utilities to submit a pivotal supplier screen
and a wholesale market share screen. If the applicant does not pass both screens, there will be
a rebuttable presumption regarding generation market power. The FERC’s order also sets forth
procedures for rebutting these presumptions and addresses mitigation measures for those entities
that are found to have market power. In the absence of specific mitigation measures, the order
includes several cost-based mitigation measures that would apply by default. The FERC also
initiated a new rulemaking proceeding that, among other things, will adopt a final methodology
for assessing generation market power.

In July 2004, the FERC denied Southern Company’s request for rehearing, along with a number
of others, and reaffirmed the interim tests that it adopted in April
2004. In August 2004, Southern
Company submitted a filing to the FERC that included results showing that Southern Company
passed the pivotal supplier screen for all markets and the wholesale market share screen for all
markets except the Southern Company retail service territory. Southern Company

II-211


NOTES (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2004 Annual Report

also submitted other analyses to demonstrate that it lacks generation market power. On December
17, 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation dominance
within its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other markets
is not at issue. As directed by this order, Southern Company submitted additional information
on February 15, 2005 related to generation dominance in its retail service territory. Any new
market-based rate transactions in the Southern Company retail service territory entered into
after February 27, 2005 will be subject to refund to the level of the default cost-based rates,
pending the outcome of the proceeding. Southern Company, along with other utilities, has also
filed an appeal of the FERC’s April and July 2004 orders with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit. The FERC has asked the court to dismiss the appeal on the grounds
that it is premature.

In the event that the FERC’s default mitigation measures are ultimately applied, the
Company may be required to charge cost-based rates for certain wholesale sales in the Southern
Company retail service territory, which may be lower than negotiated market-based rates. The
final outcome of this matter will depend on the form in which the final methodology for
assessing generation market power and mitigation rules may be ultimately adopted and cannot be
determined at this time.

Personal Injury Litigation

On January 28, 2003, a jury in Escambia County, Florida returned a verdict of $3 million against
the Company arising out of an alleged electrical injury sustained by the plaintiff in January 1999
while inside his apartment. This matter was the subject of an appeal to Florida’s First District
Court of Appeal. In May 2004, the court affirmed the result of the jury’s verdict without
submitting a written opinion, thereby preempting the Company’s right to appeal the case to the
Florida Supreme Court. Therefore, in June 2004 the Company paid the judgment amount and accrued
interest. As a result of insurance coverage, there was no material impact on the Company’s
financial statements.

Right of Way Litigation

Southern Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including the Company, Georgia Power,
Mississippi Power, and Southern Telecom (collectively, defendants), have been named as
defendants in numerous lawsuits brought by landowners since 2001. The plaintiffs’ lawsuits
claim that defendants may not use, or sublease to third parties, some or all of the fiber optic
communications lines on the rights of way that cross the plaintiffs’ properties, and that such
actions exceed the easements or other property rights held by defendants. The plaintiffs assert
claims for, among other things, trespass and unjust enrichment, and seek compensatory and
punitive damages and injunctive relief.

In November 2003, the Second Circuit Court in Gadsden County, Florida, ruled in favor of
the plaintiffs on their motion for partial summary judgment concerning liability in one such
lawsuit brought by landowners regarding the installation and use of fiber optic cable over the
Company’s rights of way located on the landowners’ property. Subsequently, the plaintiffs sought
to amend their complaint and asked the court to enter a final declaratory judgment and to enter
an order enjoining the Company from allowing expanded general telecommunications use of the
fiber optic cables that are the subject of this litigation. On January 6, 2005, the trial judge
entered an order granting in part the plaintiffs’ motion to amend their Complaint and denying
the requested declaratory and injunctive relief at this time. The question of damages with
respect to this action will be decided at a future trial. In the event of an adverse verdict on
damages, the Company could appeal the verdicts on both liability and damages. The Company
believes that it has complied with applicable laws and that the plaintiffs’ claims are without
merit. An adverse outcome in these matters could result in substantial judgments; however, the
final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.

In addition, in late 2001, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company, including the Company,
Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, Savannah Electric, and Southern Telecom
(collectively, defendants), were named as defendants in a lawsuit brought by a telecommunications
company that uses certain of the defendants’ rights of way. This lawsuit alleges, among other
things, that the defendants are contractually obligated to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the
telecommunications company from any liability that may be assessed against it in pending and future
right of way litigation. The defendants believe that the plaintiff’s claims are without merit. In
the fall of 2004, the trial court stayed the case until resolution of the underlying

II-212


NOTES (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2004 Annual Report

landowner litigation discussed above. On January 12, 2005, the Georgia Court of Appeals dismissed
the telecommunications company’s appeal of the trial court’s order for lack of jurisdiction. An
adverse outcome in this matter, combined with an adverse outcome against the telecommunications
company in one or more of the right of way lawsuits, could result in substantial judgments;
however, the final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.

Retail Regulatory Matters

In May 2002, the Florida PSC approved a retail base rate increase of $53.2 million effective June
7, 2002 primarily related to the commercial operation of Plant Smith Unit 3.

On February 2, 2005, the Citizens of the State of Florida through the Office of Public
Counsel, the Florida Industrial Power Users Group, and the Company filed a Stipulation and
Settlement with the Florida PSC to resolve all matters regarding the effects of Hurricane Ivan
on the Company’s reserve for property damage (Stipulation).

Under the terms of the Stipulation, the Company will recover the retail portion of $51.7
million of Hurricane Ivan storm damage costs, plus interest and revenue taxes, through a monthly
surcharge applied to retail customer bills for a 24-month period. For purposes of the
Stipulation, such recovery amount excludes $44.8 million from the amount to be recovered,
including $26.4 million in capital that will be included in retail rate base, and a $15 million
discretionary accrual made by the Company in 2004 pursuant to the agreement between the parties
reached in the Stipulation.

In the event that the Florida Legislature enacts legislation that allows for the
securitization of storm recovery financing under terms of a financing order that provides for
the establishment of storm recovery property through a surcharge, the Stipulation provides that
the Company may request an order from the Florida PSC under such legislation to securitize the
retail portion of the agreed $51.7 million plus interest and revenue taxes, as well as
additional amounts not to exceed $27.8 million plus interest and revenue taxes.

Except under circumstances provided for within the Stipulation, the Company has agreed that
it will not seek any additional increase in its base rates and charges to become effective on or
before March 1, 2007.

The Stipulation is subject to the approval of the Florida PSC, which is expected to rule on
the Stipulation at its next meeting in March 2005. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot
now be determined.

Environmental Remediation

The Florida Legislature adopted legislation for an ECRC, which allows an electric utility to
petition the Florida PSC for recovery of prudent environmental compliance costs that are not being
recovered through base rates or any other recovery mechanism. Such environmental costs include
operation and maintenance expense, emission allowance expense, depreciation, and a return on
invested capital. This legislation also allows recovery of costs incurred as a result of an
agreement between the Company and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) for the
purpose of ensuring compliance with ozone ambient air quality standards adopted by the EPA. During
2004, 2003, and 2002, the Company recorded ECRC revenues of $14.7 million, $10.7 million, and $10.8
million, respectively.

At December 31, 2004, the Company’s liability for the estimated costs of environmental
remediation projects for known sites was $59.4 million. In September 2004, the Company increased
its liability by approximately $47 million. This increase relates to new regulations and more
stringent site closure criteria by the FDEP for impacts to soil and groundwater from herbicide
applications at Company substations. Because FDEP approval is
required prior to the issuance of site closure, a timeframe for the
completion of the remediation projects cannot be determined. These projects have been approved by the Florida PSC for
recovery through the ECRC. Therefore, the Company recorded $1.4 million in current assets and
current liabilities and $58.0 million in deferred assets and deferred liabilities representing
the future recoverability of these costs.

The final outcome of each of these matters cannot now be determined. However, based on the
currently known conditions at these sites and the nature and extent of the Company’s activities
relating to these sites, management does not believe that the Company’s additional liability, if
any, at these sites would be material to the financial statements.

5. INCOME TAXES

Southern Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return and a combined
State of Georgia income tax return. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement, as
required by the PUHCA, each subsidiary’s current and deferred tax expense is computed on a
stand-alone basis and no subsidiary is allocated more expense than would be paid if they filed a
separate income tax return. In accordance with Internal Revenue Service regulations, each
company is jointly and severally liable for the tax liability.

In 2004, in order to avoid the loss of certain federal income tax credits related to the
production of synthetic fuel, Southern Company chose to defer certain deductions otherwise
available to the subsidiaries. The cash flow benefit associated with the utilization of the tax
credits was allocated to the subsidiary that otherwise would have claimed the available deductions
on a separate company basis without the deferral. This allocation concurrently reduced the tax
benefit of the credits allocated to those subsidiaries that generated the credits. As the deferred
expenses are deducted, the benefit of the tax credits will be repaid to the subsidiaries that
generated the tax credits. The Company has recorded $6.8 million payable to these subsidiaries in
“Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes” on the balance sheets.

At December 31, 2004, the tax-related regulatory assets to be recovered from customers were
$17.6 million. These assets are attributable to tax benefits flowed through to customers in prior
years and to taxes applicable to capitalized allowance for funds used during construction. At
December 31, 2004, the tax-related regulatory liabilities to be credited to customers were $23.4
million. These liabilities are attributable to deferred taxes previously recognized at rates
higher than current enacted tax law and to unamortized investment tax credits.

In accordance with regulatory requirements, deferred investment tax credits are amortized
over the lives of the related property with such amortization normally applied as a credit to
reduce depreciation and amortization in the statements of income. Credits amortized in this manner
amounted to $2.0 million in 2004, $1.8 million in 2003, and $1.8 million in 2002. At December 31,
2004, all investment tax credits available to reduce federal income taxes payable had been
utilized.

6. FINANCING

Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities/ Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts

The Company has formed certain wholly owned trust subsidiaries for the purpose of issuing
preferred securities. The proceeds of the related equity investments and preferred security
sales were loaned back to the Company through the issuance of junior subordinated notes totaling
$72.2 million, which constitute substantially all of the assets of these trusts and are
reflected on the balance sheets as Long-term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts. The Company
considers that the mechanisms and obligations relating to the preferred securities issued for
its benefit, taken together, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by it of the trusts’
payment obligations with respect to these securities. At December 31, 2004, these securities
were outstanding. See Note 1 under “Variable Interest Entities” for additional information on
the accounting treatment for these trusts and the related securities.

Pollution Control Bonds

Pollution control obligations represent loans to the Company from public authorities of funds
derived from sales by such authorities of revenue bonds issued to finance pollution control
facilities. The Company is required to make payments sufficient for the authorities to meet
principal and interest requirements of such bonds. With respect to $12.1 million of such
pollution control obligations, the Company has authenticated and delivered to the trustees a
like principal amount of first mortgage bonds as security for its obligations under the loan
agreements. No principal or interest on these first mortgage bonds is payable unless and until
a default occurs on the loan agreements.

Long-Term Debt Due Within One Year

At December 31, 2004, the Company had an improvement fund requirement of $550,000. The first
mortgage bond improvement fund requirement amounts to 1 percent of each outstanding series of bonds
authenticated under the mortgage indenture prior to January 1 of each year, other than those issued
to collateralize pollution control revenue bond obligations. The requirement may be satisfied by
depositing cash, reacquiring bonds, or by pledging additional property equal to 1 and 2/3 times the
requirement.

The improvement fund requirements of first mortgage bonds were satisfied by certifying
property additions in 2003 and 2002. It is anticipated that the 2004 requirement will be satisfied
by certifying property additions. Sinking fund requirements and/or maturities through 2009
applicable to long-term debt are as follows: $100.0 million

II-215


NOTES (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2004 Annual Report

in 2005; $37.1 million in 2006; and zero in 2007, 2008, and 2009.

Common Stock Dividend Restrictions

The Company’s first mortgage bond indenture contains various common stock dividend restrictions,
which remain in effect as long as the bonds are outstanding. At December 31, 2004, retained
earnings of $127 million were restricted against the payment of cash dividends on common stock
under the terms of the mortgage indenture.

In accordance with the PUHCA, the Company is also restricted from paying common dividends
to the Southern Company from paid-in capital without SEC approval.

Assets Subject to Lien

The Company’s mortgage indenture dated as of September 1, 1941, as amended and supplemented, which
secures the first mortgage bonds issued by the Company, constitutes a direct first lien on
substantially all of the Company’s fixed property and franchises. In addition, the Company has
granted a second lien on its property at Plant Daniel in connection with the issuance of two series
of pollution control bonds.

There are no agreements or other arrangements among the affiliated companies under which the
assets of one company have been pledged or otherwise made available to satisfy obligations of
Southern Company or any of its subsidiaries.

Bank Credit Arrangements

At the beginning of 2005, the Company had $56.3 million of lines of credit with banks subject to
renewal each year, all of which remained unused. The $56.3 million in committed lines of credit
provide liquidity support for the Company’s commercial paper program and for $4.0 million of daily
variable rate pollution control bonds. In connection with these credit lines, the Company has
agreed to pay commitment fees and/or to maintain compensating balances with the banks. The
compensating balances, which represent substantially all of the cash of the Company except for
daily working funds and like items, are not legally restricted from withdrawal.

Certain credit arrangements contain covenants that limit the level of indebtedness to
capitalization to 65 percent, as defined in the arrangements. For purposes of these definitions,
debt excludes the long-term debt payable to affiliated trusts. At December 31, 2004, the Company
was in compliance with these debt limit covenants.

In addition, certain credit arrangements contain cross default provisions to other
indebtedness that would trigger an event of default if the Company defaulted on indebtedness over a
specified threshold. The cross default provisions are restricted only to indebtedness of the
Company. The Company is currently in compliance with all such covenants. Borrowings under unused
credit arrangements totaling $10 million would be prohibited if the Company experiences a material
adverse change (as defined in such arrangements).

The Company borrows through a commercial paper program that has the liquidity support of
committed bank credit arrangements and through an extendible commercial note program. At December
31, 2004, the Company had no commercial paper or extendible commercial notes outstanding. At
December 31, 2003, the Company had $37.7 million in commercial paper outstanding. These amounts
are included in the notes payable on the balance sheets. During 2004, the peak amount outstanding
for commercial paper was $47.6 million and the average amount outstanding was $10.7 million. The
average annual interest rate on commercial paper was 1.23 percent.

In addition, the Company has bid-loan facilities with four major money center banks that total
$50 million, with none committed at December 31, 2004.

Financial Instruments

The Company enters into energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, gas, and
other fuel price changes. However, due to cost-based rate regulations, the Company has limited
exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity. The Company
has implemented fuel-hedging programs with the approval of the Florida PSC. The Company enters
into hedges of forward electricity sales. There was no material ineffectiveness recorded in
earnings in 2004 and 2003.

II-216


NOTES (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2004 Annual Report

At December 31, 2004, the fair value of derivative energy contracts was reflected in the
financial statements as follows:

Amounts

(in thousands)

—

Total fair value

The fair value gains or losses for cash flow hedges that are recoverable through the
regulatory fuel clauses are recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities and are recognized in
earnings at the same time the hedged items affect earnings. The Company has energy-related hedges
in place up to and including 2007.

The Company also enters into derivatives to hedge exposure to interest rate changes.
Derivatives related to variable rate securities or forecasted transactions are accounted for as
cash flow hedges. The derivatives are generally structured to match the critical terms of the
hedged debt instruments; therefore, no material ineffectiveness has been recorded in earnings
for any year presented.

During 2004, the Company did not enter into any interest rate derivatives. During 2003,
the Company settled interest derivatives at the same time it issued debt and recognized losses
totaling $3.3 million. These losses have been deferred in other comprehensive income and will
be reclassified to interest expense over the life of the related debt, maturing in 2013. The
fair value gain or loss for cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income and is
reclassified into earnings at the same time the hedged items affect earnings. For 2004 and
2003, approximately $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of pre-tax losses were
reclassified from other comprehensive income to interest expense. For 2005, pre-tax losses of
approximately $0.3 million are expected to be reclassified from other comprehensive income to
interest expense.

COMMITMENTS

Construction Program

The Company is engaged in a continuous construction program, the cost of which is currently
estimated to total $154 million in 2005, $112 million in 2006, and $103 million in 2007. The
construction program is subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may
vary from the above estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include changes in
business conditions; acquisition of additional generation assets; revised load growth estimates;
changes in environmental regulations; changes in FERC rules and transmission regulations;
increasing costs of labor, equipment, and materials; and cost of capital. At December 31, 2004,
significant purchase commitments were outstanding in connection with the construction program.

Included in the amounts above, the Company has budgeted $40 million and $4 million in 2005 and
2006, respectively, for capital expenditures related to environmental controls at Plant Crist as
part of an agreement with the FDEP to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions. The Florida PSC authorized
the Company to recover the costs related to these environmental projects through the ECRC. The
construction program also includes $15 million in 2005, $9 million in 2006, and $23 million in 2007
for other environmental expenditures. Construction of new transmission and distribution facilities
and other capital improvements, including those needed to meet environmental standards for the
Company’s existing generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, are ongoing.

Long-Term Service Agreement

The Company has entered into a Long-Term Service Agreement (LTSA) with General Electric (GE) for
the purpose of securing maintenance support for combined cycle and combustion turbine generating
facilities. The LTSA stipulates that GE will perform all planned inspections on the covered
equipment, which includes the cost of all labor and materials. GE is also obligated to cover the
costs of unplanned maintenance on the covered equipment subject to a limit specified in the
contract.

In general, the LTSA is in effect through two major inspection cycles of the unit. Scheduled
payments to GE are made at various intervals based on actual operating hours of the unit. Total
payments to GE under this agreement for facilities owned are currently estimated at $81.2 million
over the remaining life of the agreement. However, the LTSA contains various cancellation
provisions at the option of the Company.

II-217


NOTES (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2004 Annual Report

Payments made to GE prior to the performance of any planned inspections are recorded as
prepayments. These amounts are included in prepaid expenses and other assets in the balance
sheets. Inspection costs are capitalized or charged to expense based on the nature of the work
performed.

Fuel and Purchased Power Commitments

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of the generating plants, the Company has entered into
various long-term commitments for the procurement of fossil fuel. In most cases, these contracts
contain provisions for price escalations, minimum purchase levels, and other financial commitments.
Natural gas purchase commitments contain given volumes with prices based on various indices at the
time of delivery. Amounts included in the chart below represent estimates based on New York
Mercantile Exchange future prices at December 31, 2004. Total estimated minimum long-term
obligations at December 31, 2004 were as follows:

SCS may enter into various types of wholesale energy and natural gas contracts acting as an
agent for the Company and all of the other Southern Company retail operating companies, Southern
Power, and Southern Company GAS. Under these agreements, each of the retail operating companies,
Southern Power, and Southern Company GAS may be jointly and severally liable. The creditworthiness
of Southern Power and Southern Company GAS is currently inferior to the creditworthiness of the
retail operating companies. Accordingly, Southern Company has entered into keep-well agreements
with the Company and each of the other retail operating companies to insure the Company will not
subsidize or be responsible for any costs, losses, liabilities, or damages resulting from the
inclusion of Southern Power or Southern Company GAS as a contracting party under these agreements.

Operating Leases

The Company has operating lease agreements with various terms and expiration dates. Total
operating lease expenses were $2.0 million, $2.2 million, and $2.1 million for 2004, 2003, and
2002, respectively.

In 1989, the Company and Mississippi Power jointly entered into a twenty-two year operating
lease agreement for the use of 495 aluminum railcars. In 1994, a second lease agreement for the
use of 250 additional aluminum railcars was entered into for twenty-two years. Both of these leases are for the transportation
of coal to Plant Daniel. The Company has the option to purchase the 745 railcars at the greater of
lease termination value or fair market value or to renew the leases at the end of each lease term.
In 2004, the Company and Mississippi Power entered into a three year operating lease agreement for
the use of 120 aluminum railcars. There is no purchase option associated with this lease.

The Company, as a joint owner of Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2, is responsible for one-half of
the lease costs. The lease costs are charged to fuel inventory and are allocated to fuel expense
as the fuel is used. These expenses are then recovered through the Company’s fuel cost recovery
clause. The Company’s share of the lease costs charged to fuel inventories was $1.9 million in
each of 2004, 2003, and 2002.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Mississippi Power Company:

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements of capitalization of Mississippi
Power Company (a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company) as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and
the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder’s equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004. These financial statements are
the responsibility of Mississippi Power Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a
basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements (pages II-241 to II-265) present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Mississippi Power Company at December 31, 2004 and
2003, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Mississippi Power Company 2004 Annual Report

OVERVIEW

Business Activities

Mississippi Power Company (the Company) operates as a vertically integrated utility providing
electricity to retail customers within its traditional service area located within the State of
Mississippi and to wholesale customers in the Southeast.

Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of selling electricity. These
factors include the Company’s ability to maintain a stable regulatory environment, to achieve
energy sales growth while containing costs, and to recover costs related to growing demand and
increasingly stringent environmental standards. In 2004, the Company completed a major retail rate
proceeding that should help provide future earnings stability. Appropriately balancing
environmental expenditures with reasonable retail rates will continue to challenge the Company for
the foreseeable future.

Key Performance Indicators

The Company strives to maximize shareholder value while providing low-cost, reliable energy to more
than 190,000 customers in southeast Mississippi. In recognition that the Company’s long-term
financial success is dependent upon how well it satisfies its customers’ needs, the Company’s
retail base rate mechanism, the Performance Evaluation Plan (PEP), includes performance indicators
that directly tie customer service indicators to the Company’s allowed return. PEP measures the
Company’s performance on a 10 point scale as a weighted average of results in three areas: average
customer price, as compared to prices of other regional utilities (weighted at 40%); service
reliability, measured in outage minutes per customer (40%); and customer satisfaction, measured in
surveys of residential customers (20%). The Company’s PEP performance score in 2004 was 8.9 out of
10, resulting in an 89 basis point increase to the Company’s retail allowed return on investment
for 2005. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters” for more
information on PEP.

In addition to the PEP performance indicators, the Company focuses on other performance
measures, including broader measures of customer satisfaction, return on equity (ROE), and peak
season equivalent forced outage rate (Peak Season EFOR). ROE is the performance standard used by
both the investment community and many regulatory agencies. Peak Season EFOR is a key element in
the Company’s price performance. It measures plant availability and efficient generation fleet
operations during the months when generation needs are greatest.

The Company’s performance in 2004 reflects the focus that management places on all of these
indicators, as well as the commitment shown by the Company’s employees in achieving or exceeding
management’s expectations.

Earnings

The Company’s net income after dividends on preferred stock was $76.8 million in 2004 compared to
$73.5 million in 2003. The increase in 2004 resulted from increased retail base revenue and higher
non-territorial energy sales. Retail base revenues grew over $3 million as a result of improving
economic conditions in the service area. The increase in sales for resale to non-affiliates
resulted from the additional Plant Daniel capacity available following the 2003 termination of a
contract with a subsidiary of Dynegy, Inc. (Dynegy). The net income after dividends on preferred
stock of $73.5 million in 2003 remained relatively flat from $73.0 million in 2002. However,
operating revenues and expenses recorded by the Company in 2003 were unusually high as compared to
2002. An increase of $62 million in other electric revenues resulted from the termination of the
Dynegy contract, the income effect of which was offset by a $60 million expense related to the
establishment of a regulatory liability in connection with an accounting order issued by the
Mississippi PSC. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters” for
additional information.

II-224


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2004 Annual Report

Excluding these two items, operating revenues and operating expense were lower in 2003 than in
2002 primarily due to decreased fuel revenues and lower fuel and purchased power costs. Also,
milder weather in 2003 caused kilowatt-hour sales to be slightly lower than in 2002. The 2002
increase of $9.1 million in net income as compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to
retail and wholesale rate increases in late 2001 and early 2002, respectively, and lower interest
expense.

Total retail revenues for 2004 increased 13.2 percent when compared to 2003. While
higher fuel costs accounted for 92 percent of this increase, sales growth, particularly in
industrial customers, also contributed to the increase. Industrial sales in 2004 grew over the
prior year for the first time since 2000 as most of the Company’s industrial customers recovered
from the recent economic downturn. Total retail revenues for 2003 decreased approximately 3.8
percent when compared to 2002 as a result of decreased fuel revenues and, to a lesser extent,
decreases in kilowatt-hour energy sales due to milder than normal weather in the Company’s service
area and the sluggish economy. Retail revenues for 2002 increased approximately 9.7 percent when
compared to 2001, primarily due to a retail rate increase which took effect in January 2002 and, to
a lesser extent, higher kilowatt-hour energy sales resulting from colder winter weather. See Note
3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters” for additional information.

Fuel revenues generally represent the direct recovery of fuel expenses including purchased
power. Therefore, changes in recoverable fuel expenses are offset with
corresponding changes in fuel revenues and

II-225


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2004 Annual Report

have no effect on net income. The fuel cost recovery
and other revenues increased in 2004 when compared to 2003 as a result of an increase in fuel
expenses due to consistently higher fuel prices and a slight increase in retail rates that became
effective in 2004. During 2003, the fuel cost recovery and other revenues decreased $20 million
compared to 2002 due to lower generation and fewer fuel purchases as a result of milder than normal
weather in 2003.

Sales for resale to non-affiliates are influenced by the non-affiliate utilities’ own customer
demand, plant availability, and fuel costs. Included in sales for resale to non-affiliates are
revenues from rural electric cooperative associations and municipalities located in southeastern
Mississippi. As compared to the prior year, sales to these utilities increased 3.3 percent in
2004, remained relatively flat in 2003, and increased 8.0 percent in 2002, with the related
revenues increasing 12.4 percent, 1.6 percent, and 19.8 percent, respectively. The customer demand
experienced by these utilities is determined by factors very similar to those of the Company.
Total revenues from sales for resale to non-affiliates increased in
2004 by $14.4 million, or 5.7 percent.
This increase primarily resulted from a $32.7 million increase in related energy revenues, of
which approximately $6 million was associated with increased kilowatt-hour sales and $26.7 million
was associated with higher prices due to increased fuel cost in 2004. The increase was offset by an
$18.3 million decrease in related capacity revenues as a result of the termination of the contract
with Dynegy in 2003. Total revenues from sales for resale to non-affiliates increased in 2003 as a
result of increases in average sales price per kilowatt-hour and increased kilowatt-hour sales to
wholesale non-affiliate customers. Revenues from sales for resale to non-affiliates increased in
2002, primarily as the result of a new power sales contract that began in June 2001, as well as
colder winter months during 2002.

Energy Sales

Energy sales to affiliated companies within the Southern Company electric system vary from year to
year depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company.
These sales are made in accordance with the affiliated company interchange agreement, as approved
by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). These sales do not have a significant impact
on earnings since the energy is generally sold at marginal cost.

Kilowatt-hour (KWH) sales for 2004 and percent change by year were as follows:

Total retail kilowatt-hour sales increased in 2004 when compared to 2003. The increase is the
result of higher sales to all retail classes, particularly the industrial class, due to the effects
of economic recovery in the area. Total retail kilowatt-hour sales decreased in 2003 as the result
of milder weather in 2003 when compared to 2002. Total retail kilowatt-hour sales increased
slightly in 2002 due to colder than average winter weather, which primarily affected residential
sales. Industrial sales decreased in 2003 due to lower kilowatt-hour sales and decreased fuel
costs. Industrial sales fell 2.7 percent in 2002 due to an economic downturn in the Company’s
service area.

The Company anticipates modest growth over the next five years due to a recovery from the
national and regional economic downturn and some growth in the gaming and tourism industry. Retail
sales are expected to grow at an annual average rate of approximately 1.9 percent through 2009,
with increases expected in the local, state, and federal government sectors, as well as increases
in shipbuilding, oil and gas production and refining, and tourism-related industries.

Expenses

In 2004, total operating expenses increased 4.3 percent to $764 million when compared to 2003. The
increase is the result of increased fuel expense, as a result of increased
generation and higher fuel prices. Total operating expenses were $732 million in 2003, which

II-226


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2004 Annual Report

reflects an increase of 7.9 percent over 2002. The increase in 2003 is primarily due to $60
million in Plant Daniel capacity expense recorded in connection with an accounting order from the
Mississippi PSC. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters” for
further information. In 2002, total operating expenses were $679 million, reflecting an increase
of 2.4 percent over the prior year. The increase was due primarily to increased maintenance
expense resulting from planned outages at Plant Watson and Plant Daniel as well as a full year of
rental expense for Plant Daniel Units 3 and 4 and a slight increase in fuel expense.

Fuel costs are the single largest expense for the Company. The mix of fuel sources for
generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and
the availability of fossil generating units. The amount and sources of generation, the average
cost of fuel per net kilowatt-hour generated, and the average cost of purchased power were as
follows:

Fuel expense increased $92 million in 2004 as compared to 2003. Approximately $25 million of
the increase was associated with increased generation and approximately $67 million of the increase
was due to higher coal and gas prices. Fuel expense for 2003 decreased $53 million due to
decreased generation and lower average cost of fuel. Fuel expense for 2002 increased $4 million
due to a fuel hedging loss, which was approved for recovery through the fuel cost recovery clause
authorized by the Mississippi PSC.

A significant upward trend in the cost of coal and natural gas has emerged since 2003, and
volatility in these markets is expected to continue. Increased coal prices have been influenced
by a worldwide increase in demand as a result of rapid economic growth in China as well as by
increases in mining costs. Higher natural gas prices in the United States are the result of
slightly lower gas supplies despite increased drilling activity. Natural gas supply
interruptions, such as those caused by the 2004 hurricanes, result in an immediate market
response; however, the impact of this price volatility may be reduced by imports of natural gas
and liquefied natural gas. Fuel expenses generally do not affect net income since they are
offset by fuel revenues under the Company’s fuel cost recovery clause.

Purchased power expense increased $13.6 million, or 14.6 percent, in 2004 when compared to

2003. The increase is the result of an increase in purchases from non-affiliates. These purchases
were needed to meet increased load and offset higher priced self-generation resulting from
increased fuel costs. In 2003, purchased power expense increased $41.9 million, or 81.6 percent.
The increase was primarily due to an increase in purchased power expense from affiliate companies.
Those purchases were more economical than self generation due to the increased cost of natural gas
in 2003. In 2002, purchased power expense decreased $43.9 million when compared to 2001. This
decrease resulted from both lower prices and lower purchase requirements, primarily due to the
commercial operation of Plant Daniel Units 3 and 4 beginning in May 2001. Energy purchases vary
from year to year depending on demand and the availability and cost of the Company’s generating
resources. These expenses do not have a significant impact on earnings since the energy purchases
are generally offset by energy revenues through the Company’s fuel cost recovery clause.

Other operation expense decreased $65.7 million, or 28.6 percent, in 2004 and increased $71.7
million, or 45.3 percent, in 2003 due to approximately $11 million incurred in 2003 to restructure
the lease agreement for the combined cycle generating units at Plant Daniel and $60 million in
expense recorded in 2003 in connection with the recognition of a regulatory liability following an
accounting order from the Mississippi PSC related to Plant Daniel capacity expense. See FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY—“Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements” and Notes 3 and 7 to the
financial statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters”
and “Operating Leases – Plant Daniel Combined Cycle

Generating Units,” respectively, for additional
information. In 2002, other operation expense increased $23.5 million, or 17.4 percent, primarily
due to lease payments associated with the commercial operation of Plant Daniel Units 3 and 4 and
higher labor related expenses.

Maintenance expense increased $7.0 million, or 9.9 percent, in 2004 as a result of higher
operating hours at Plant Daniel and increased distribution line maintenance during 2004.
Maintenance expense decreased $3.6 million, or 4.9 percent, in 2003 primarily resulting from a
decrease of approximately 50 percent in operating hours at Plant Daniel Units 3 and 4. See Note 7
to the financial statements under “Long-Term Service Agreements” for further information. In 2002,
maintenance expense increased $17.5 million, or 31.2 percent, primarily due to scheduled
maintenance performed at Plant Watson and Plant Daniel.

Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $16.3 million in 2004 as compared to 2003
primarily due to $16.5 million of amortization related to a regulatory liability recorded in 2003
in connection with the Mississippi PSC’s accounting order on the Plant Daniel Capacity. See Note 3
under “Retail Regulatory Matters” for additional information. In 2003, depreciation and
amortization expense decreased $1.9 million compared to 2002 primarily due the amortization related
to the Company’s Environmental Compliance Overview Plan (ECO Plan) approved by the Mississippi PSC.
In 2002, depreciation and amortization expense increased $3.6 million due to increased plant in
service and due to amortization of the Company’s regulatory asset related to the ECO Plan. See
Note 3 to the financial statements under “Environmental Compliance Overview Plan” for further
information.

In 2004, taxes other than income taxes increased 2.9 percent due to additional municipal
franchise taxes, which are directly related to the increase in retail revenues. Taxes other than
income taxes decreased 2.8 percent in 2003 primarily due to lower property taxes in 2003. Taxes
other than income taxes increased 23.5 percent in 2002 due to an increase in property taxes related
to Plant Daniel Units 3 and 4 and increased municipal franchise taxes. The decrease in total other
income and expense is due to interest on long-term debt decreasing in all years presented as a
result of lower interest rates on debt outstanding and lower principal amount of debt outstanding.

Effects of Inflation

The Company is subject to rate regulation based on the recovery of historical costs. In addition,
the income tax laws are based on historical costs. Therefore, inflation creates an economic loss
because the Company is recovering its costs of investments in dollars that have less purchasing
power. While the inflation rate has been relatively low in recent years, it continues to have an
adverse effect on the Company because of the large investment in utility plant with long economic
lives. Conventional accounting for historical cost does not recognize this economic loss nor the
partially offsetting gain that arises through financing facilities with fixed-money obligations,
such as long-term debt and preferred securities. Any recognition of inflation by regulatory
authorities is reflected in the rate of return allowed in the Company’s approved electric rates.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL

General

The Company operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electricity to retail customers
within its traditional service area located in southeastern Mississippi and wholesale customers in
the Southeastern United States. Prices for electricity relating to jointly owned generating
facilities, interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power are set by the
FERC. Prices for electricity provided by the Company to
retail customers are set by the Mississippi PSC under cost-based regulatory principles. Retail
rates and earnings are reviewed and adjusted periodically within certain limitations based on
earned ROE. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES – “Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates –
Electric Utility Regulation” herein and Note 3 to the financial statements for additional
information about these and other regulatory matters.

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of future
earnings potential. The level of the Company’s future earnings depends on
numerous factors that affect the challenges and risks of the Company’s business of selling
electricity. These

II-228


MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2004 Annual Report

factors include the ability of the Company to maintain a stable regulatory
environment, to achieve energy sales growth while containing costs, and to recover costs related to
growing demand and increasingly more stringent environmental standards. Future earnings in the
near term will depend, in part, upon growth in energy sales, which is subject to a number of
factors. These factors include weather, competition, new energy contracts with neighboring
utilities, energy conservation practiced by customers, the price of electricity, the price
elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic growth in the Company’s service area.

Since 2001, merchant energy companies and traditional electric utilities with significant
energy marketing and trading activities have come under severe financial pressures. Many of these
companies have completely exited or drastically reduced all energy marketing and trading activities
and sold foreign and domestic electric infrastructure assets. The Company has not experienced any
material adverse financial impact regarding its limited energy trading operations through Southern
Company Services (SCS).

Environmental Matters

New Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil action in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against Alabama
Power and Georgia Power. The
complaint alleged violations of the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act and
related state laws at five coal-fired generating facilities in Alabama and Georgia. The civil
actions request penalties and injunctive relief, including an order requiring the installation
of the best available control technology at the affected units. The EPA concurrently issued to
the retail operating companies notices of violations relating to ten generating facilities,
which included the five facilities mentioned previously and the Company’s Plants Watson and
Greene County. In early 2000, the EPA filed a motion to amend its complaint to add the
violations alleged in its notices of violation and to add the Company, Gulf Power, and Savannah
Electric as defendants. However, in March 2001, the court denied the motion with respect to the
Company and Gulf Power based on lack of jurisdiction and the EPA has not refiled. See Note 3 to
the financial statements under “New Source Review Actions” for additional information.

The Company believes that it has complied with applicable laws and the EPA regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act
authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $32,500 per day, per violation at each generating
unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in this matter could
require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly
require payment of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of operations, cash
flows, and possibly financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

In December 2002 and October 2003, the EPA issued final revisions to its NSR regulations under
the Clean Air Act. The December 2002 revisions included changes to the regulatory exclusions and
the methods of calculating emissions increases. The October 2003 regulations clarified the scope
of the existing Routine Maintenance, Repair, and Replacement (RMRR) exclusion. A coalition of
states and environmental organizations has filed petitions for review of these revisions with the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The October 2003 RMRR rules have been
stayed by the Court of Appeals pending its review of the rules. In any event, the final
regulations must be adopted by the individual states in the Company’s service territory in order to
apply to the Company’s facilities. The effect of these final regulations, related legal
challenges, and potential state rulemakings cannot be determined at this time.

Carbon Dioxide Litigation

On July 21, 2004, attorneys general from eight states, each outside of Southern Company’s service
territory, and the corporation counsel for New York City filed a complaint in the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York against Southern Company and four other electric power
companies. A nearly identical complaint was filed by three environmental groups in the same court.
The complaints allege that the companies’ emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas,
contribute to global warming, which the plaintiffs assert is a public nuisance. Under common law
public and private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs seek a judicial order (1)
holding each defendant jointly and severally liable for creating, contributing to, and/or

II-229


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2004 Annual Report

maintaining global warming and (2) requiring each of the defendants to cap its emissions of carbon
dioxide and then reduce those emissions by a specified percentage each year for at least a decade.
Plaintiffs have not, however, requested that damages be awarded in connection with their claims.
Southern Company believes these claims are without merit and notes that the complaint cites no
statutory or regulatory basis for the claims. Southern Company and the other defendants have filed
motions to dismiss both lawsuits. Southern Company intends to vigorously defend against these

claims. While the outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time, an adverse judgment
in either of these actions could result in substantial capital expenditures.

Environmental Statutes and Regulations

The Company’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by state and federal environmental
agencies under a variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental media, including air,
water, and land resources. Compliance with these environmental requirements involves significant
capital and operating costs, a major portion of which is expected to be recovered through the
Company’s ECO Plan. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Environmental Compliance
Overview Plan” for additional information. Environmental costs that are known and estimable at
this time are included in capital expenditures discussed under FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY –
“Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations” herein. There is no assurance, however, that
all such costs will, in fact, be recovered.

Compliance with the Clean Air Act and resulting regulations has been and will continue to be a
significant focus for the Company. The Title IV acid rain provisions of the Clean Air Act, for
example, required significant reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions and
resulted in total construction expenditures of approximately $65 million through 2000.

In July 1997, the EPA revised the national ambient air quality standards for ozone and
particulate matter. These revisions made the standards significantly more stringent and included
development of an eight-hour ozone standard, as opposed to the previous one-hour ozone standard. In the subsequent litigation of these standards, the U.S.
Supreme Court found the EPA’s implementation program for the new eight-hour ozone standard unlawful
and remanded it to the EPA for further rulemaking. During 2003, the EPA proposed implementation
rules designed to address the court’s concerns. On April 30, 2004, the EPA published its
eight-hour ozone nonattainment designations and a portion of the rules implementing the new
eight-hour ozone standard. Areas within the Company’s service area have not been designated as
nonattainment under the eight-hour ozone standard.

In January 2004, the EPA issued a proposed Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) to address
interstate transport of ozone and fine particles. This proposed rule would require additional
year-round sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission reductions from power plants in the eastern
United States in two phases – in 2010 and 2015. The EPA currently plans to finalize this rule in
2005. If finalized, the rule could modify or supplant other state requirements for attainment of
the fine particulate matter standard and the eight-hour ozone standard, as well as other air
quality regulations. The impact of this rule on the Company will depend upon the specific
requirements of the final rule and cannot be determined at this time.

The Company has developed and maintains an environmental compliance strategy for the
installation of additional control technologies and the purchase of emission allowances to
assure continued compliance with current sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission regulations.
Additional expenses associated with these regulations are anticipated to be incurred each year
to maintain current and future compliance. Because the Company’s compliance strategy is
impacted by factors such as changes to existing environmental laws and regulations, increases in
the cost of emissions allowances, and any changes in the Company’s fuel mix, future
environmental compliance costs cannot be determined at this time.

Further reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides could also be required under the
EPA’s Regional Haze rules. The Regional Haze rules require states to establish Best Available
Retrofit Technology (BART) standards for certain sources that contribute to regional haze and to
implement emission reduction requirements that make progress toward remedying current visibility
impairment in certain natural areas. The Company has a number of plants that could be subject to
these rules. The EPA’s Regional Haze program calls for states to submit implementation plans in
2008 that contain emission reduction strategies for implementing BART

II-230


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2004 Annual Report

and for achieving sufficient
progress toward the Clean Air Act’s
visibility improvement goal. In response to litigation, the EPA proposed revised rules in May
2004, which it plans to finalize in April 2005. The impact of these regulations will depend on the
promulgation of final rules and implementation of those rules by the states and, therefore, it is
not possible to determine the effect of these rules on the Company at this time.

In January 2004, the EPA issued proposed rules regulating mercury emissions from electric
utility boilers. The proposal solicits comments on two possible approaches for the new regulations
– a Maximum Achievable Control Technology approach and a cap-and-trade approach. Either approach
would require significant reductions in mercury emissions from Company facilities. The regulations
are scheduled to be finalized by March 2005, and compliance could be required as early as 2008.
Because the regulations have not been finalized, the impact on the Company cannot be determined at
this time.

Major bills to amend the Clean Air Act to impose more stringent emissions limitations on power
plants including the Bush Administration’s Clear Skies Act, have been re-proposed in 2005. The
Clear Skies Act is expected to further limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen
oxides, and mercury and to supplement the proposed CAIR and mercury regulatory programs. Other
proposals to limit emissions of carbon dioxide have also been introduced. The cost impacts of such
legislation would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined at this
time.

Under the Clean Water Act, the EPA has been developing new rules aimed at reducing impingement
and entrainment of fish and fish larvae at power plants’ cooling water intake structures. In July
2004, the EPA published final rules that will require biological studies and, perhaps, retrofits to
some intake structures at existing power plants. The impact of these new rules will depend on the
results of studies and analyses performed as part of the rules’ implementation and the actual
limits established by the regulatory agencies.

Several major pieces of environmental legislation are periodically considered for
reauthorization or amendment by Congress. These include: the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act;
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Emergency Planning & Community
Right-to-Know Act; and the Endangered Species Act. Compliance with possible additional federal or
state legislation or regulations related to global climate change or other environmental and health
concerns could also significantly affect the Company. The impact of any new legislation, changes
to existing legislation, or environmental regulations could affect many areas of the Company’s
operations. The full impact of any such changes cannot, however, be determined at this time.

Global Climate Issues

Domestic efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions have been spurred by international discussions
surrounding the Framework Convention on Climate Change — and specifically the Kyoto Protocol —
which proposes constraints on the emissions of greenhouse gases for a group of industrialized
countries. The Bush Administration has not supported U.S. ratification of the Kyoto Protocol or
other mandatory carbon dioxide reduction legislation and, in 2002, announced a goal to reduce the
greenhouse gas intensity of the U.S. – the ratio of greenhouse gas emissions to the value of U.S.
economic output — by 18 percent by 2012. A year later, the Department of Energy (DOE) announced
the Climate VISION program to support this goal. Energy-intensive industries, including
electricity generation are the initial focus of this program. Southern Company is leading the
development of a voluntary electric utility sector climate change initiative in partnership with
the government. The utility sector has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions rate by 3 to
5 percent over the next decade and, on December 13, 2004, signed a memorandum of understanding with
the DOE initiating this program under Climate VISION. Because efforts under this voluntary program
are just beginning, the impact of this program on the Company cannot be determined at this time.

Environmental Remediation Reserves

The Company must comply with environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling and
disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and
regulations, the Company may incur substantial costs to remediate properties. The Company
conducts studies to determine the extent of any required remediation and has recognized in its
financial statements the costs to remediate known sites. Amounts for cleanup and ongoing
monitoring costs were not material for any year presented. The Company may be liable for some
or all required

II-231


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2004 Annual Report

cleanup costs for additional sites that may require environmental remediation.
The Company has received authority from the Mississippi PSC to recover
approved environmental compliance costs through specific retail rate clauses. Within limits
approved by the Mississippi PSC, these rates are adjusted annually. See Note 3 to the financial
statements under “Environmental Remediation” for additional information.

FERC and Mississippi PSC Matters

Transmission

In December 1999, the FERC issued its final rule on Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs).
Since that time, there have been a number of additional proceedings at the FERC designed to
encourage further voluntary formation of RTOs or to mandate their formation. However, at the
current time, there are no active proceedings that would require Southern Company to participate in
an RTO. Current FERC efforts that may potentially change the regulatory and/or operational
structure of transmission include rules related to the standardization of generation
interconnection, as well as an inquiry into, among other things, market power by vertically
integrated utilities. See “Generation Interconnection Agreements” and “Market-Based Rate
Authority” herein for additional information. The final outcome of these proceedings cannot now be
determined. However, Southern Company’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows
could be adversely affected by future changes in the federal regulatory or operational structure of
transmission.

Generation Interconnection Agreements

In July 2003, the FERC issued its final rule on the standardization of generation
interconnection agreements and procedures (Order 2003). Order 2003 shifts much of the financial
burden of new transmission investment from the generator to the transmission provider. The FERC
has indicated that Order 2003, which was effective January 20, 2004, is to be applied
prospectively to interconnection agreements. The impact of Order 2003 and its subsequent
rehearings on the Company cannot be determined at this time.

Market-Based Rate Authority

The Company has obtained FERC approval to sell power to nonaffiliates at market-based prices.
Through SCS, as agent, the Company also has FERC authority to make short-term opportunity sales
at market rates. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a market-based
contract with an affiliate. In November 2001, the FERC modified the test it uses to consider
utilities’ applications to charge market-based rates and adopted a new test called the Supply
Margin Assessment (SMA). The FERC applied the SMA to several utilities, including Southern
Company, its retail operating companies and Southern Power and found Southern Company and others
to be “pivotal suppliers” in their retail service territories and ordered the implementation of
several mitigation measures. Southern Company and others sought rehearing of the FERC order,
and the FERC delayed the implementation of certain mitigation measures. In April 2004, the FERC
issued an order that abandoned the SMA test and adopted a new interim analysis for measuring
generation market power. This new interim approach requires utilities to submit a pivotal
supplier screen and a wholesale market share screen. If the applicant does not pass both
screens, there will be a rebuttable presumption regarding generation market power. The FERC’s
order also sets forth procedures for rebutting these presumptions and addresses mitigation
measures for those entities that are found to have market power. In the absence of specific
mitigation measures, the order includes several cost-based mitigation measures that would apply
by default. The FERC also initiated a new rulemaking proceeding that, among other things, will
adopt a final methodology for assessing generation market power.

In July 2004, the FERC denied SCS’s request for rehearing, along with a number of others, and
reaffirmed the interim tests that it adopted in April 2004. In August 2004, Southern Company submitted a
filing to FERC that included results showing that Southern Company passed the pivotal supplier
screen for all markets and the wholesale market share screen for all markets except its
retail service territory. Southern Company also submitted other analyses to demonstrate that it
lacks generation market power. On December 17, 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess
Southern Company’s generation dominance within the Southern Company retail service territory. The
ability to charge market-based rates in other markets is not at issue. As directed by this order,
on February 15, 2005, Southern Company submitted additional information related to

II-232


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2004 Annual Report

generation dominance in the Southern Company retail service territory. Any new market-based rate
transactions in its retail service territory entered into after February 27, 2005 will be subject
to refund to the level of the default cost-based rates, pending the outcome of the proceeding.
Southern Company, along with other utilities, has also filed an appeal of the FERC’s April and July
2004 orders with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The FERC has
asked the court to dismiss the appeal on the grounds that it is premature.

In the event that the FERC’s default mitigation measures are ultimately applied, the Company
may be required to charge cost-based rates for certain wholesale sales in the Southern Company
retail service territory, which may be lower than negotiated market-based rates. The final outcome
of this matter will depend on the form in which the final methodology for assessing generation
market power and mitigation rules may be ultimately adopted and cannot be determined at this time.

Retail Rate Filing

In May 2004, the Mississippi PSC approved the Company’s request to reclassify 266 megawatts of
Plant Daniel Units 3 and 4 capacity to jurisdictional cost of service effective January 1, 2004
and authorized the Company to include the related costs and revenue credits in jurisdictional
rate base, cost of service, and revenue requirement calculations for purposes of retail rate
recovery. The Company is amortizing the regulatory liability established pursuant to the
Mississippi PSC’s interim December 2003 order, as approved in the May 2004 order, to earnings as
follows: $16.5 million in 2004, $25.1 million in 2005, $13.0 million in 2006, and $5.7 million
in 2007, resulting in reductions of costs in each of those years.

Other Matters

On October 22, 2004, President Bush signed the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Jobs Act) into
law. The Jobs Act includes a provision that allows a generation tax deduction for utilities. The
Company is currently assessing the impact of the Jobs Act, including this deduction, as well as the
related regulatory treatment, on its taxable income. However, the Company currently does not
expect the Jobs Act to have a material impact on its financial statements.

In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 87, Employers’
Accounting for Pensions, the Company recorded non-cash pension income, before tax, of approximately
$.6 million, $1.7 million, and $2.5 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Future pension
income is dependent on several factors including trust earnings and changes to the pension plan.
The decline in pension income is expected to continue, resulting in pension expense in 2005.
Postretirement benefit costs for the Company were $4.5 million, $4 million, and $3.7 million in
2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively, and are expected to continue to trend upward. A portion of
pension and postretirement benefit costs is capitalized based on construction-related labor
charges. Pension income or expense and postretirement benefit costs are a component of regulated
rates and generally do not have a long-term effect on net income. For more information regarding
pension and postretirement benefits, see Note 2 to the financial statements.

The Company is involved in various other matters being litigated and regulatory matters that
could affect future earnings. See Note 3 to the financial statements for information regarding
material issues.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may
have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations and related disclosures. Different
assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those
recorded in the financial statements. Southern Company senior management has discussed the
development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates described below with
the Audit Committee of Southern Company’s Board of Directors.

Electric Utility Regulation

The Company is subject to retail regulation by the Mississippi PSC and wholesale regulation by the
FERC.

II-233


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2004 Annual Report

These regulatory agencies set the rates the Company is
permitted to charge customers based on allowable costs. As a result, the Company applies FASB
Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, which requires the
financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the ratemaking process,
the regulators may require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when they
would be recognized by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of
expenses and the recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery
through rates or the deferral of gains or creation of liabilities and the recording of related
regulatory liabilities. The application of Statement No. 71 has a further effect on the Company’s
financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the ratemaking
process. These estimates may differ from those actually incurred by the Company; therefore, the
accounting estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation and pension and postretirement
benefits have less of a direct impact on the Company’s results of operations than they would on a
non-regulated company.

As reflected in Note 1 to the financial statements, significant regulatory assets and
liabilities have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of these regulatory
assets and liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines. However, adverse legislative,
judicial, or regulatory actions could materially impact the amounts of such regulatory assets and
liabilities and could adversely impact the Company’s financial statements.

Contingent Obligations

The Company is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other
factors and conditions that potentially subject it to environmental, litigation, income tax, and
other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Note 3 to the financial statements for
more information regarding certain of these contingencies. The Company periodically evaluates
its exposure to such risks and records reserves for those matters where a loss is considered
probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or conditions that can
be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially affect the
Company’s financial statements. These events or conditions include the following:

•

Changes in existing state or federal regulation by governmental authorities having
jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances, hazardous and solid
wastes, and other environmental matters.

•

Changes in existing income tax regulations or changes in Internal Revenue Service interpretations of existing regulations.

•

Identification of additional sites that require environmental remediation or the filing of
other complaints in which the Company may be asserted to be a potentially responsible party.

•

Identification and evaluation of other potential lawsuits or complaints in which the
Company may be named as a defendant.

•

Resolution or progression of existing matters through the legislative process, the court
systems, or the EPA.

Unbilled Revenues

Revenues related to the sale of electricity are recorded when electricity is delivered to
customers. However, the determination of kilowatt-hour (KWH) sales to individual customers is
based on the reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the
month. At the end of each month, amounts of electricity delivered to customers, but not yet
metered and billed, are estimated. Components of the unbilled revenue estimates include total KWH
territorial supply, total KWH billed, estimated total electricity lost in delivery, and customer
usage. These components can fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including weather,
generation patterns, power delivery volume, and other operational constraints. These factors can
be unpredictable and can vary from historical trends. As a result, the overall estimate of
unbilled revenues could be significantly affected, which could have a material impact on the
Company’s results of operations.

Plant Daniel Operating Lease

As discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements under “Operating Leases – Plant Daniel Combined
Cycle Generating Units,” the Company leases a 1,064 megawatt natural gas combined cycle facility at
Plant

II-234


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2004 Annual Report

Daniel (Facility) from Juniper Capital L.P. (Juniper). For both
accounting and rate recovery purposes, this transaction is treated as an operating lease, which
means that the related obligations under this agreement are not reflected in the balance
sheets. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – “Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements” herein
for further information. The operating lease determination was based on assumptions and estimates
related to the following:

•

Fair market value of the Facility at lease inception.

•

The Company’s incremental borrowing rate.

•

Timing of debt payments and the related amortization of the initial acquisition cost during
the initial lease term.

•

Residual value of the Facility at the end of the lease term.

•

Estimated economic life of the Facility.

•

Juniper’s status as a voting interest entity.

The determination of operating lease treatment was made at the inception of the lease
agreement and is not subject to change unless subsequent changes are made to the agreement.
However, in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 46R, “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities,” the Company also is required to monitor Juniper’s ongoing status as a voting interest
entity. Changes in that status could require the Company to consolidate the Facility’s assets
and the related debt and to record interest and depreciation expense of approximately $37
million annually, rather than annual lease expense of approximately $29 million.

New Accounting Standards

On March 31, 2004, the Company prospectively adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46R, “Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities,” which requires the primary beneficiary of a variable interest
entity to consolidate the related assets and liabilities. The adoption of FASB Interpretation
No. 46R had no impact on the Company’s net income. However, as a result of the adoption, the
Company deconsolidated a certain wholly-owned trust established to issue preferred securities
since the Company does not meet the definition of primary beneficiary established by FASB
Interpretation No. 46R. See Note 1 to the financial statements under “Variable Interest
Entities” for additional information.

In the third quarter 2004, the Company prospectively adopted FASB Staff Position (FSP)
106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements related to the Medicare Prescription Drug
Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act). The Medicare Act provides a 28
percent prescription drug subsidy for Medicare eligible retirees. FSP 106-2 requires recognition
of the impacts of the Medicare Act in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO)
and future cost of service for postretirement medical plans. The effect of the subsidy reduced
the Company’s expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2004 by approximately $.5 million
and is expected to have a similar impact on future expenses. The subsidy’s impact on the
postretirement medical plan APBO was a reduction of approximately $8 million. However, the
ultimate impact on future periods is subject to final interpretation of the federal regulations
which were published on January 21, 2005. See Note 2 to the financial statements under
“Postretirement Benefits” for additional information.

FASB
Statement No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment” was issued in December 2004. This statement
requires that compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions be recognized in
financial statements. That cost will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the
equity or liability instruments issued. For the Company, this statement is effective beginning
on July 1, 2005. Although the compensation expense required under the revised
statement differs slightly, the impacts on the financial statements are expected to be similar
to the pro forma disclosures included in Note 1 to the financial statements under “Stock
Options.”

See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “Other Matters” herein for information regarding the
adoption of new tax legislation. In December 2004, the FASB issued FSP 109-1, Application of
FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified
Production Activities provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which requires that
the generation deduction be accounted for as a special tax deduction rather than as a tax rate
reduction. The Company is currently assessing the Jobs Act and this pronouncement, as well as
the related regulatory treatment, but currently does not expect a material impact on the
Company’s financial statements.

II-235


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2004 Annual Report

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

The Company’s financial condition continued to be strong at December 31, 2004. Net cash flow from
operating activities totaled $119 million, $183 million, and $193 million for 2004, 2003, and 2002,
respectively. The $64 million decrease for 2004 was primarily due to additional cash received in
2003 related to the termination of the Dynegy contract.

Other significant balance sheet changes from 2003 to 2004 include $78.6 million in property,
plant, and equipment additions, $80 million decrease in long-term securities due within one year,
$40 million increase in long-term debt, $16.5 million reduction in deferred credit associated with
Plant Daniel capacity regulatory liabilities. See “Financing Activities” herein and the statements
of cash flows for additional information.

The Company’s ratio of common equity to total capitalization, excluding long-term debt due
within one year, decreased from 66.4 percent in 2003 to 63.7 percent at December 31, 2004.

Sources of Capital

The Company plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes, including
compliance with environmental regulations, from sources similar to those used in the past. In
recent years, financings primarily have utilized unsecured debt and preferred securities. However,
the type and timing of any future financings—if needed—will depend on market conditions and
regulatory approval.

The issuance of securities by the Company is subject to regulatory approval by the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended
(PUHCA). Additionally, with respect to the public offering of securities, the Company must file
registration statements with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (1933 Act). The
amounts of securities authorized by the SEC, as well as the amounts registered under the 1933 Act,
are continuously monitored and appropriate filings are made to ensure flexibility in the capital
markets.

The Company has no restrictions on the amounts of unsecured indebtedness it may incur.
However, the Company is required to meet certain coverage requirements specified in its mortgage
indenture and corporate charter to issue new first mortgage bonds and preferred stock. The
Company’s coverage ratios are high enough to permit, at present interest rate levels, any
foreseeable security sales. The amount of securities which the Company will be permitted to issue
in the future will depend upon market conditions and other factors prevailing at that time.

The Company obtains financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. The
Southern Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of
the Company are not commingled with funds of any other company. In accordance with the PUHCA, most
loans between affiliated companies must be approved in advance by the SEC.

To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the Company has various internal and external
sources of liquidity. At the beginning of 2005, the Company had approximately $6.9 million of cash
and cash equivalents and $100.5 million of unused credit arrangements with banks. See Note 6 to
the financial statements under “Bank Credit Arrangements” for additional information.

The Company may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company subsidiary
organized to issue and sell commercial paper and extendible commercial notes at the request and for
the benefit of the Company and the other Southern Company retail operating companies. Proceeds
from such issuances for the benefit of the Company are loaned directly to the Company and are not
commingled with proceeds from such issuances for the benefit of any other operating company. The
obligations of each company under these arrangements are several; there is no cross affiliate
credit support. At December 31, 2004, the Company had no outstanding commercial paper or
extendible commercial notes.

Financing Activities

During 2004, the Company continued a program to retire higher-cost securities and replace them with
lower-cost
capital. See the statements of cash flows for further details.

II-236


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2004 Annual Report

In March 2004, the Company issued $40 million of Series F Floating Rate Senior Notes due March
9, 2009. The proceeds from this sale, along with other monies of the Company, were used to repay
at maturity $80 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s Series D Floating Rate Senior
Notes due March 12, 2004.

In April 2004, the Company issued 1,200,000 Depositary Shares ($30 million aggregate stated
capital), each representing one-fourth of a share of 5.25% Series Preferred Stock, cumulative, par
value $100 per share. The proceeds from this sale were primarily used to redeem various issues of
higher cost preferred stock and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes.

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements

In June 2003 the Company entered into a restructured lease agreement for the Facility with Juniper,
as discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements under “Operating Leases – Plant Daniel Combined
Cycle Generating Plant.” Juniper has also entered into leases with other parties unrelated to the
Company. The assets leased by the Company comprise less than 50 percent of Juniper’s assets. The
Company does not consolidate the leased assets and related liabilities, and the lease with Juniper
is considered an operating lease. Accordingly, the lease is not reflected in the balance
sheets.

The initial lease term ends in 2011, and the lease includes a purchase and renewal option
based on the cost of the Facility at the inception of the lease, which was $369 million. The
Company is required to amortize approximately four percent of the initial acquisition cost over the
initial lease term. Eighteen months prior to the end of the initial lease, the Company may elect
to renew for 10 years. If the lease is renewed, the agreement calls for the Company to amortize an
additional 17 percent of the initial completion cost over the renewal period. Upon termination of
the lease, at the Company’s option, it may either exercise its purchase option or the Facility can
be sold to a third party.

The lease also provides for a residual value guarantee — approximately 73 percent of the
acquisition cost — by the Company that is due upon termination of the lease in the event that the
Company does not renew the lease or purchase the Facility and that the fair market value is less
than the unamortized cost of the Facility.

Credit Rating Risk

The Company does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment
schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. The Company is party to
certain derivative agreements that could require collateral and/or accelerated payment in the event
of a credit rating change to below investment grade. These agreements are primarily for natural
gas price risk management activities. At December 31, 2004, the Company’s exposure related to
these agreements was not material.

Market Price Risk

Due to cost-based rate regulation, the Company has limited exposure to market volatility in
interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity. To manage the volatility
attributable to these exposures, the Company nets the exposures to take advantage of natural
offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to the
Company’s policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and hedging practices. Company policy is
that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and mandates strict adherence to all
applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques that
include, but are not limited to, market valuation and sensitivity analysis.

The Company does not currently hedge interest rate risk. The weighted average interest rate
on variable long-term debt at January 1, 2005 was 2.27 percent. If the Company sustained a 100
basis point change in interest rates for all unhedged variable rate long-term debt, the change
would affect annualized interest expense by approximately $1.2 million at January 1, 2005. The
Company is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly affect such exposures
in the near term. See Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements under “Financial Instruments” for
additional information.

To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the Company enters
into fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through
the wholesale electricity market. At January 1, 2005,

exposure from these activities was not
material to the Company’s financial statements.

In addition, at the instruction of the Mississippi PSC, the Company has implemented a
fuel-hedging program. At December 31, 2004, exposure from these activities was not material to the
Company’s financial statements.

The change in fair value of energy contracts and year-end valuations are as follows:

These contracts are related primarily to fuel hedging programs under which unrealized gains
and losses from mark to market adjustments are recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities.
Realized gains and losses from these programs are included in fuel expense and are recovered
through the Company’s energy cost management clause.

Gains and losses on forward contracts for the sale of electricity that do not represent hedges
are recognized in the statements of income as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003, and 2002, these amounts were not material.

At December 31, 2004, the fair value of derivative energy contracts was reflected in the
financial statements as follows:

Unrealized pre-tax gains and losses recognized in income were not material for any year
presented. The Company is exposed to market price risk in the event of nonperformance by
counterparties to the derivative energy contracts. The Company’s policy is to enter into
agreements with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody’s and Standard &
Poor’s or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure.
Therefore, the Company does not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the
counterparties. See Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements under “Financial Instruments” for
additional information.

Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations

The construction program of the Company is currently estimated to be $88 million for 2005, $95
million for 2006, and $90 million for 2007. Environmental expenditures included in these amounts
are $6.3 million, $15.6 million, and $16.2 million for 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively. Actual
construction costs may vary from this estimate because of changes in such factors as: business
conditions; environmental regulations; FERC rules and transmission regulations; load projections;
the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; and the cost of capital.
In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully
recovered.

Other funding requirements related to obligations associated with scheduled maturities of
long-term debt and preferred securities, as well as the related interest, preferred stock
dividends, leases, and other purchase commitments are as follows. See Notes 1, 6, and 7 to the
financial statements for additional information.

All amounts are reflected based on final maturity dates. The Company plans to continue to
retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market
conditions permit. Variable rate interest obligations are estimated based on rates as of
January 1, 2005, as reflected in the statements of capitalization.

(b)

Preferred stock does not mature; therefore, amounts are provided for the next five years
only.

(c)

The Company generally does not enter into non-cancelable commitments for other operation and
maintenance expenditures. Total other operation and maintenance expenses for the last three
years were $241 million, $300 million, and $232 million, respectively.

(d)

The Company forecasts capital expenditures over a three-year period. Amounts represent
current estimates of total expenditures. At December 31, 2004, significant purchase
commitments were outstanding in connection with the construction program.

(e)

Natural gas purchase commitments are based on various indices at the time of delivery.
Amounts reflected have been estimated based on the New York Mercantile Exchange future prices
at December 31, 2004.

(f)

The Company forecasts postretirement trust contributions over a three-year period. No
contributions related to the Company’s pension trust are currently expected during this
period. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information related to the
pension and postretirement plans, including estimated benefit payments. Certain benefit
payments will be made through the related trusts. Other benefit payments will be made from
the Company’s corporate assets.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

The Company’s 2004 Annual Report contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking
statements include, among other things, retail sales growth, environmental regulations and
expenditures, the Company’s projections for postretirement benefit trust contributions and
estimated construction and other expenditures. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be
identified by terminology such as “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,”
“anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “projects,” “predicts,” “potential,” or “continue” or
the negative of these terms or other similar terminology. There are various factors that could
cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by in the forward-looking
statements; accordingly, there can be no assurance that such indicated results will be realized.
These factors include:

•

the impact of recent and future federal and state regulatory change, including legislative and regulatory initiatives
regarding deregulation and restructuring of the electric utility industry, and also changes in environmental, tax, and
other laws and regulations to which the Company is subject, as well as changes in application of existing laws and
regulations;

•

current and future litigation, regulatory investigations, proceedings or inquiries;

•

the effects, extent and timing of the entry of additional competition in the markets in which the Company operates;

•

variations in demand for electricity and gas, including those relating to weather, the general economy and population,
and business growth (and declines);

•

available sources and costs of fuels;

•

ability to control costs;

•

investment performance of the Company’s employee benefit plans;

•

advances in technology;

•

state and federal rate regulations and the impact of pending and future rate cases and negotiations;

•

internal restructuring or other restructuring options that may be pursued;

•

potential business strategies, including acquisitions or dispositions of assets or businesses, which cannot be assured
to be completed or beneficial to the Company;

•

the ability of counterparties of the Company to make payments as and when due;

•

the ability to obtain new short- and long-term contracts with neighboring utilities;

•

the direct or indirect effect on the Company’s business resulting from terrorist incidents and the threat of terrorist
incidents;

•

interest rate fluctuations and financial market conditions and the results of financing efforts, including the
Company’s credit ratings;

•

the ability of the Company to obtain additional generating capacity at competitive prices;

•

catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, hurricanes, or other similar occurrences;

•

the direct or indirect effects on the Company’s business resulting from incidents similar to the August 2003 power
outage in the Northeast;

•

the effect of accounting pronouncements issued periodically by standard setting bodies; and

•

other factors discussed elsewhere herein and in other reports (including the Form 10-K) filed by the Company from time
to time with the SEC.

The Company expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking
statements.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General

Mississippi Power Company (Company) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company, which is
the parent company of five retail operating companies, Southern Power Company (Southern Power),
Southern Company Services (SCS), Southern Communications Services (SouthernLINC Wireless), Southern
Company Gas (Southern Company GAS), Southern Company Holdings (Southern Holdings), Southern Nuclear
Operating Company (Southern Nuclear), Southern Telecom, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries.
The retail operating companies — Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, the Company, and
Savannah Electric — provide electric service in four Southeastern states. The
Company operates as a vertically integrated utility providing service to retail customers in
Southwest Mississippi and to wholesale customers in the Southeast. Southern Power constructs,
owns, and manages Southern Company’s competitive generation assets and sells electricity at
market-based rates in the wholesale market. Contracts among the retail operating companies and
Southern Power — related to jointly owned generating facilities, interconnecting transmission
lines, or the exchange of electric power — are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) and/or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). SCS, the system service
company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and subsidiary companies.
SouthernLINC Wireless provides digital wireless communications services to the retail operating
companies and also markets these services to the public within the Southeast. Southern Telecom
provides fiber cable services within the Southeast. Southern Company GAS is a competitive retail
natural gas marketer serving customers in Georgia. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding
subsidiary for Southern Company’s investments in synthetic fuels and leveraged leases and various
other energy related businesses. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to Southern
Company’s nuclear power plants.

The equity method is used for subsidiaries which are variable interest entities and for
which the Company is not the primary beneficiary. Certain prior years’ data presented in the
financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Southern Company is registered as a holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, as amended (PUHCA). Both Southern Company and its subsidiaries, including the
Company, are subject to the regulatory provisions of PUHCA. The Company is also subject to
regulation by the FERC and the Mississippi Public Service Commission (PSC). The Company follows
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and complies with the accounting
policies and practices prescribed by its regulatory commissions. The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates.

Affiliate Transactions

The Company has an agreement with SCS under which the following services are rendered to the
Company at cost: general and design engineering, purchasing, accounting and statistical analysis,
finance and treasury, tax, information resources, marketing, auditing, insurance and pension
administration, human resources, systems and procedures, and other services with respect to
business and operations and power pool transactions. Costs for these services amounted to $45.3
million, $46.1 million, and $43.8 million during 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Cost
allocation methodologies used by SCS are approved by the SEC, and management believes they are
reasonable.

The Company has an agreement with Alabama Power under which the Company owns a portion of
Greene County Steam Plant. Alabama Power operates Greene County Steam Plant, and the Company
reimburses Alabama Power for its proportionate share of all associated expenditures and costs. The
Company reimbursed Alabama Power for the Company’s proportionate share of related expenses which
totaled $7.2 million, $6.6 million, and $6.4 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. The
Company also has an agreement with Gulf Power under which Gulf Power owns a portion of Plant
Daniel. The Company operates Plant Daniel, and Gulf Power reimburses the Company for its
proportionate share of all associated expenditures and costs. Gulf Power reimbursed the Company
for Gulf Power’s proportionate share of related expenses which totaled $17.8 million, $17.7 million, and $16.6 million in 2004,

2003, and 2002, respectively. See Notes 4 and 5 for additional information on certain deferred tax
liabilities payable to affiliates.

The retail operating companies (including the Company), Southern Power, and Southern Company
GAS may jointly enter into various types of wholesale energy, natural gas, and certain other
contracts, either directly or through SCS, as agent. Each participating company may be jointly and
severally liable for the obligations incurred under these agreements.

Revenues

Energy and other revenues are recognized as services are rendered. Capacity revenues from
long-term contracts are recognized at the lesser of the levelized amount or the amount billable
under the contract over the respective contract period. Unbilled revenues are accrued at the end
of each fiscal period. The Company’s retail and wholesale rates include provisions to adjust
billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, fuel hedging, the energy component of purchased power
costs, and certain other costs. Retail rates also include provisions to adjust billings for
fluctuations in costs for ad valorem taxes and certain qualifying environmental costs. Revenues
are adjusted for differences between the actual recoverable costs and amounts billed in current
regulated rates.

The Company has a diversified base of customers. For the year ended December 31, 2004 and
December 31, 2002, no single customer or industry accounted for 10 percent or more of revenue.
However, for the year ended December 31, 2003, Dynegy, Inc. (Dynegy) accounted for approximately
14.8 percent of revenues as a result of non-recurring contract termination revenues. For all

periods presented, uncollectible accounts continued to average less than 1 percent of revenues.

Fuel Costs

Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is used. Fuel expense includes the cost of purchased emission
allowances as they are used.

Income Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provides deferred
income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences. Investment tax credits utilized
are deferred and amortized to income over the average lives of the related property.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

The Company is subject to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement
No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. Regulatory assets represent
probable future revenues associated with certain costs that are expected to be recovered from
customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future
reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be credited to customers
through the ratemaking process.

Note:

The recovery and amortization periods for these regulatory assets and (liabilities) are
as follows:

In the event that a portion of the Company’s operations is no longer subject to the
provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, the Company would be required to write off related regulatory
assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable through regulated rates. In addition,
the Company would be required to determine if any impairment to other assets, including plant,
exists and write down the assets, if impaired, to their fair value. All regulatory assets and
liabilities are to be currently reflected in rates.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation of the original cost of plant in service is provided primarily by using composite
straight-line rates, which approximated 3.4 percent in each of 2004, 2003, and 2002. When property
subject to depreciation is retired or otherwise disposed of in the normal course of business, its
cost — together with the cost of removal, less salvage — is charged to the accumulated depreciation
provision. Minor items of property included in the original cost of the plant are retired when the
related property unit is retired. Depreciation expense includes an amount for the expected cost of
removal of facilities.

In December 2003, the Mississippi PSC issued an interim accounting order directing the
Company to expense and record a regulatory liability of $60.3 million while it considered the
Company’s request to include 266 megawatts of Plant Daniel Units 3 and 4 generating capacity in
jurisdictional cost of service. In May 2004, the Mississippi PSC approved the Company’s request
effective January 1, 2004 and ordered the Company to amortize the regulatory liability
previously established to earnings as follows: $16.5 million in 2004, $25.1 million in 2005,
$13.0 million in 2006, and $5.7 million in 2007.

Asset Retirement Obligations
and Other Costs of Removal

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted FASB Statement No.143, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations. Statement No. 143 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for
legal obligations associated with the ultimate cost of retiring long-lived assets. The present
value of the ultimate cost for an asset’s future retirement is recorded in the period in which the
liability is incurred. The costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and
depreciated over the asset’s useful life. Although Statement No. 143 does not permit the continued
accrual of future retirement costs for long-lived assets that the Company does not have a legal
obligation to retire, the Company has received accounting guidance from the Mississippi PSC
allowing such treatment. Accordingly, the accumulated removal costs for
other obligations previously accrued will continue to be reflected on the balance sheets as a

II-249

regulatory liability. Therefore, the Company had no cumulative effect to net income resulting from
the adoption of Statement No. 143.

The Company has retirement obligations related to various landfill sites, ash ponds, and
underground storage tanks. The Company has also identified retirement obligations related to
certain transmission and distribution facilities. However, liabilities for the removal of these
transmission and distribution assets have not been recorded because no reasonable estimate can be
made regarding the timing of the obligations. The Company will continue to recognize in the
statements of income allowed removal costs in accordance with its regulatory treatment. Any
difference between costs recognized under Statement No. 143 and those reflected in rates are
recognized as either a regulatory asset or liability and are reflected in the balance sheets.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost less regulatory disallowances and
impairments. Original cost includes: materials; labor; minor items of property; appropriate
administrative and general costs; payroll-related costs such as taxes, pensions, and other
benefits; and the cost of funds used during construction, if applicable. The cost of replacements
of property — exclusive of minor items of property — is capitalized. The cost of maintenance,
repairs, and replacement of minor items of property is charged to maintenance expense except for
the cost of maintenance of coal cars and a portion of the railway track maintenance costs, which
are charged to fuel stock and recovered through the Company’s fuel clause.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles

The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of
whether an impairment has occurred is based on either a specific regulatory disallowance or an
estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared to the carrying
value of the assets. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment recognized is
determined by either the amount of regulatory disallowance or by estimating the fair value of the
asset and recording a loss for the amount of the carrying value that is greater than the fair
value. For assets identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the estimated
fair value less the cost to sell in order to determine if an impairment provision is required.
Until the assets are disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or
events change.

Environmental Cost Recovery

The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling
and disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and
regulations, the Company may also incur substantial costs to clean up properties. The Company
has authority from the Mississippi PSC to recover approved environmental compliance costs
through retail rates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are considered cash
equivalents. Temporary cash investments are securities with original maturities of 90 days or
less.

Materials and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include the average cost of transmission, distribution, and
generating plant materials. Materials are charged to inventory when purchased and then expensed or
capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when installed or used.

Stock Options

Southern Company provides non-qualified stock options to a large segment of the Company’s employees
ranging from line management to executives. The Company currently accounts for its stock-based
compensation plans in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25. Accordingly, no
compensation expense has been recognized because the exercise price of all options granted equaled
the fair-market value of Southern Company’s common stock on the date of grant. When options are
exercised, the Company receives a capital contribution from Southern Company equivalent to the
related income tax benefit.

Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to the prices of certain fuel
purchases and electricity purchases and sales. All derivative financial instruments are recognized
as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. Substantially all of the Company’s
bulk energy purchases and sales contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are exempt from
fair value accounting requirements and are accounted for under the accrual method. Other
derivative contracts qualify as cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions. This results in the
deferral of related gains and losses in other comprehensive income or regulatory assets or
liabilities as appropriate until the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness is recognized
currently in net income. Other derivative contracts are marked to market through current period
income and are recorded on a net basis in the statements of income.

The Mississippi PSC has approved the Company’s request to implement an Energy Cost Management
clause (ECM) which, among other things, allows the Company to utilize financial instruments to
hedge its fuel commitments. Changes in the fair value of these financial instruments are recorded
as regulatory assets or liabilities. Amounts paid or received as a result of financial settlement
of these instruments are classified as fuel expense and are included in the ECM factor applied to
customer billings. The Company’s jurisdictional wholesale customers have a similar ECM mechanism,
which has been approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).

The Company is exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of
counterparties’ nonperformance. The Company has established controls to determine and monitor the
creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate the Company’s exposure to counterparty
credit risk.

Other financial instruments for which the carrying amount did not equal the fair value at

information.

Provision for Property Damage

The Company carries insurance for the cost of certain types of damage to generation plants and
general property. However, the Company is self-insured for the cost of storm, fire, and other
uninsured casualty damage to its property, including transmission and distribution facilities. As
permitted by the Mississippi PSC and the FERC, the Company accrues for the cost of such damage
through an annual expense accrual credited to a regulatory liability account. The cost of
repairing actual damage resulting from such events that individually exceed $50,000 is charged to
the reserve. The annual accruals may range from $1.5 million to $4.6 million with a maximum
reserve totaling $23 million. The Company accrued $4.6 million in 2004, $2.5 million in 2003, and
$1.8 million in 2002. As of December 31, 2004, the accumulated provision amounted to $5 million.

Comprehensive Income

The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of all changes in common stock equity
of an enterprise that result from transactions and other economic events of the period other than
transactions with owners. Comprehensive income consists of net income, changes in the fair value
of qualifying cash flow hedges and marketable securities and changes in additional minimum pension
liability, less income taxes, and reclassifications for amounts included in net income.

Variable Interest Entities

On March 31, 2004, the Company prospectively adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46R, “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities,” which requires the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity
to consolidate the related assets and liabilities. The adoption of Interpretation No. 46R had no
impact on the net income of the Company. However, as a result of the adoption, the Company
deconsolidated a wholly-owned trust established to issue preferred securities since the Company is
not the primary beneficiary of the trust. Therefore, the investments in this trust are reflected as
Other Investments and the related loan from the trust are reflected as Long-term Debt Payable to
Affiliated Trust on the balance sheets. This treatment resulted in a $1 million increase in both
total assets and total liabilities as of December 31, 2004.

2.

RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company has a defined benefit, trusteed, pension plan covering substantially all employees.
The plan is funded in accordance with Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
(ERISA), requirements. No contributions to the plan are expected for the year ending December 31,
2005. The Company also provides certain non-qualified benefit plans for a selected group of
management and highly compensated employees. The Company provides certain medical care and life
insurance benefits for retired employees. Benefits under these non-qualified plans are funded on a
cash basis. In addition, trusts are funded to the extent required by the Mississippi PSC and the
FERC. For the year ending December 31, 2005, postretirement trust contributions are expected to
total approximately $260,000.

The measurement date for plan assets and obligations is September 30 of each year.

Pension Plans

The accumulated benefit obligation for the pension plans was $211 million and $188 million for 2004
and 2003, respectively. Changes during the year in the projected benefit obligations, accumulated
benefit obligations, and fair value of plan assets were as follows:

Pension plan assets are managed and invested in accordance with all applicable requirements,
including ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Internal Revenue Code). The
Company’s investment policy covers a diversified mix of assets, including equity and fixed income
securities, real estate, and private equity, as described in the table below. Derivative
instruments are used primarily as hedging tools but may also be used to gain efficient exposure to
the various asset classes. The Company primarily minimizes the risk of large losses through
diversification but also monitors and manages other aspects of risk.

Postretirement benefits plan assets are managed and invested in accordance with all applicable
requirements, including ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code. The Company’s investment policy
covers a diversified mix of assets, including equity and fixed income securities, real estate, and
private equity, as described in the table below. Derivative instruments are used primarily as
hedging tools but may also be used to gain efficient exposure to the various asset classes. The
Company primarily minimizes the risk of large losses through diversification but also monitors and
manages other aspects of risk.

In the third quarter 2004, the Company prospectively adopted FASB Staff Position (FSP) 106-2,
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and
Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act). The Medicare Act provides a 28 percent prescription drug
subsidy for Medicare eligible retirees. FSP 106-2 requires recognition of the impacts of the
Medicare Act in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) and future cost of service
for postretirement medical plan. The effect of the subsidy reduced the Company’s expenses for the
six months ended December 31, 2004 by approximately $.5 million and is expected to have a similar
impact on future expenses. The subsidy’s impact on the postretirement medical plan APBO was a
reduction of approximately $8 million. However, the ultimate impact on future periods is subject to
federal regulations governing the subsidy created in the Medicare Act which are being finalized.

Future benefit payments, including prescription drug benefits, reflect expected future
service and are estimated based on assumptions used to measure the

An additional assumption used in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation
was a weighted average medical care cost trend rate of 11.0 percent for 2004, decreasing gradually
to 5.0 percent through the year 2012, and remaining at that level thereafter. An annual increase or

CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY MATTERS

General Litigation Matters

The Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of
business. In addition, the Company’s business activities are subject to extensive governmental
regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation over environmental issues and
claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, and citizen enforcement of
environmental requirements, has increased generally throughout the United States. In particular,
personal injury claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become
more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such litigation against the Company cannot be
predicted at this time; however, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any,
arising from such current proceedings would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
financial statements.

New Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil action in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against Alabama Power and Georgia Power
alleging violations of the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act and related
state laws at five coal-fired generating facilities. The EPA concurrently issued to each of the
retail operating companies notices of violation relating to 10 generating facilities, which
included the five facilities mentioned previously and the Company’s Plants Watson and Greene
County. In early 2000, the EPA filed a motion to amend its complaint to add the violations alleged
in its notices of violation and to add Gulf Power, the Company, and Savannah Electric as
defendants.

The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia subsequently granted Alabama Power’s motion to dismiss and
denied the EPA’s motion to add the Company and Gulf Power for lack of jurisdiction in Georgia. In
March 2001, the

II-255


NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2004 Annual Report

court granted the EPA’s motion to add Savannah Electric as a
defendant. As directed by the court, the EPA refiled its amended complaint limiting claims to
those brought against Georgia Power and Savannah Electric. In addition, the EPA refiled its claims
against Alabama Power in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. These civil
complaints allege violations with respect to eight coal-fired generating facilities in Alabama and
Georgia, and they request penalties and injunctive relief, including an order requiring the
installation of the best available control technology at the affected units. The EPA has not
refiled against Gulf Power or the Company.

The actions against Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Savannah Electric were effectively
stayed in the spring of 2001 during the appeal of a similar NSR enforcement action against the
Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. In
June 2003, the Court of Appeals issued its ruling in the TVA case, dismissing the appeal for
reasons unrelated to the issues in the cases pending against Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and
Savannah Electric. In May 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the EPA’s petition for review of
the case. In June 2004, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama lifted the
stay in the action against Alabama Power, placing the case back onto the court’s active docket.
At this time, no party to the case against Georgia Power and Savannah Electric has sought to
reopen that case, which remains administratively closed in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Georgia.

Since the inception of the NSR proceedings against Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Savannah
Electric, the EPA has also been proceeding with similar NSR enforcement actions against other
utilities, involving many of the same legal issues. In each case, the EPA alleged that the
utilities failed to comply with the NSR permitting requirements when performing maintenance and
construction activities at coal-burning plants, which activities the utilities considered to be
routine or otherwise not subject to NSR. District courts addressing these cases have, to date,
issued opinions that reached conflicting conclusions.

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act
authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $32,500 per day, per violation at each generating
unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in any one of these cases
could require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could
possibly require payment of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of operations,
cash flows, and possibly financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated
rates.

In December 2002 and October 2003, the EPA issued final revisions to its NSR regulations under
the Clean Air Act. The December 2002 revisions included changes to the regulatory exclusions and
the methods of calculating emissions increases. The October 2003 regulations clarified the scope
of the existing Routine Maintenance, Repair, and Replacement (RMRR) exclusion. A coalition of
states and environmental organizations has filed petitions for review of these revisions with the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The October 2003 RMRR rules have been
stayed by the Court of Appeals pending its review of the rules. In any event, the final
regulations must be adopted by the individual states in the Company’s service territory to apply to
the Company’s facilities. The effect of these final regulations, related legal challenges, and
potential state rulemakings cannot be determined at this time.

Generation Interconnection Agreements

In July 2003, the FERC issued its final rule on the standardization of generation
interconnection agreements and procedures (Order 2003). Order 2003 shifts much of the financial
burden of new transmission investment from the generator to the transmission provider. The FERC
has indicated that Order 2003, which was effective January 20, 2004, is to be applied
prospectively to interconnection agreements. The impact of Order 2003 and its subsequent
rehearings on the Company and the final results of these matters cannot be determined at this
time.

Market-Based Rate Authority

The Company has obtained FERC approval to sell power to nonaffiliates at market-based prices.
Through SCS, as agent, the Company also has FERC authority to make short-term opportunity sales
at market rates. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a market-based
contract with an affiliate. In November 2001, the FERC modified

II-256


NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2004 Annual Report

the test it uses to consider
utilities’ applications to
charge market-based rates and adopted a new test called the Supply Margin Assessment (SMA). The
FERC applied the SMA to several utilities, including Southern Company, the retail operating
companies, and Southern Power, and found Southern Company and others to be “pivotal suppliers”
in their retail service territories and ordered the implementation of several mitigation
measures. Southern Company and others sought rehearing of the FERC order, and the FERC delayed
the implementation of certain mitigation measures. In April 2004, the FERC issued an order that
abandoned the SMA test and adopted a new interim analysis for measuring generation market power.
This new interim approach requires utilities to submit a pivotal supplier screen and a
wholesale market share screen. If the applicant does not pass both screens, there will be a
rebuttable presumption regarding generation market power. The FERC’s order also sets forth
procedures for rebutting these presumptions and addresses mitigation measures for those entities
that are found to have market power. In the absence of specific mitigation measures, the order
includes several cost-based mitigation measures that would apply by default. The FERC also
initiated a new rulemaking proceeding that, among other things, will adopt a final methodology
for assessing generation market power.

In July 2004, the
FERC denied Southern Company’s request for rehearing, along with a number
of others, and reaffirmed the interim tests that it adopted in April 2004. In August 2004, Southern
Company submitted a filing to the FERC which included results showing that Southern Company
passed the pivotal supplier screen for all markets and the wholesale market share screen for all
markets except its retail service territory. Southern Company also submitted other analyses to
demonstrate that it lacks generation market power. On December 17, 2004, the FERC initiated a
proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation dominance within the Southern Company retail
service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other markets is not at issue. As
directed by this order, Southern Company submitted additional information on February 15, 2005
related to generation dominance in the Southern Company retail service territory. Any new
market-based rate transactions in the Southern Company retail service territory entered into
after February 27, 2005 will be subject to refund to the level of the default cost-based rates,
pending the outcome of the proceeding. Southern Company, along with other utilities, has also
filed an appeal of the FERC’s April and July 2004 orders with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit. The FERC has asked the court to dismiss the appeal on the grounds
that it is premature.

In the event that the FERC’s default mitigation measures are ultimately applied, the Company
may be required to charge cost-based rates for certain wholesale sales in the Southern Company
retail service territory, which may be lower than negotiated market-based rates. The final outcome
of this matter will depend on the form in which the final methodology for assessing generation
market power and mitigation rules may be ultimately adopted and cannot be determined at this time.

Right of Way Litigation

Southern Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including the Company, Georgia Power, Gulf Power,
and Southern Telecom, have been named as defendants in numerous lawsuits brought by landowners
since 2001. The plaintiffs’ lawsuits claim that defendants may not use, or sublease to third
parties, some or all of the fiber optic communications lines on the rights of way that cross the
plaintiffs’ properties and that such actions exceed the easements or other property rights held by
defendants. The Company has entered into an agreement with approximately one-third of the
plaintiffs in the actions pending against the Company to clarify the Company’s easement rights in
the State of Mississippi. This agreement has been approved by the Circuit Court of Harrison County,
Mississippi (First Judicial District) and dismissals of the related cases are in progress. The
remaining plaintiffs assert claims for, among other things, trespass and unjust enrichment, and
seek compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief. Management of the Company believes
that the Company has complied with applicable laws and that the plaintiffs’ claims are without merit. An
adverse outcome in these matters could result in substantial judgments; however, the final outcome
of these matters cannot now be determined.

In addition, in late 2001, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company, including Alabama
Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, the Company, Savannah Electric, and Southern Telecom, were
named as defendants in a lawsuit brought by a telecommunications company that uses certain of
the defendants’ rights of way. This lawsuit alleges, among other
things, that the defendants are

II-257


NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2004 Annual Report

contractually obligated to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the telecommunications
company from any liability that may be assessed against it in pending and future right
of way litigation. The Company believes that the plaintiff’s claims are without merit. In the
fall of 2004, the trial court stayed the case until resolution of the underlying landowner
litigation discussed above. On January 12, 2005, the Georgia Court of Appeals dismissed the
telecommunications company’s appeal of the trial court’s order for lack of jurisdiction. An
adverse outcome in this matter, combined with an adverse outcome against the telecommunications
company in one or more of the right of way lawsuits, could result in substantial judgments;
however, the final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.

Retail Regulatory Matters

The Company’s retail base rates are set under Performance Evaluation Plan (PEP), a rate plan
approved by the Mississippi PSC. PEP was designed with the objective that PEP would reduce the
impact of rate changes on the customer and provide incentives for the Company to keep customer
prices low and customer satisfaction and reliability high. PEP is a mechanism for rate adjustments
based on three indicators: price, customer satisfaction, and service reliability.

In May 2004, the Mississippi PSC approved the Company’s request to modify certain portions of
its PEP and to reclassify, to jurisdictional cost of service the 266 megawatts of Plant Daniel
Units 3 and 4 capacity, effective January 1, 2004. The Mississippi PSC authorized the Company to
include the related costs and revenue credits in jurisdictional rate base, cost of service, and
revenue requirement calculations for purposes of retail rate recovery. The Company is amortizing
the regulatory liability established pursuant to the Mississippi PSC’s interim December 2003
accounting order, as approved in the May 2004 order, to earnings as follows: $16.5 million in 2004,
$25.1 million in 2005, $13.0 million in 2006, and $5.7 million in 2007, resulting in increases to
earnings in each of those years.

In addition, the Mississippi PSC also approved the Company’s requested changes to PEP,

including the use of a forward-looking test year, with appropriate oversight; annual, rather than
semi-annual, filings; and certain changes to the performance indicator mechanisms. Rate changes
will be limited to four percent of retail revenues annually under the revised PEP. The Mississippi
PSC will review all aspects of PEP in 2007. PEP will remain in effect until the Mississippi PSC
modifies, suspends, or terminates the plan. In December 2004, the Company filed its PEP
for the projected 2005 test period. The results from the 2005 filing did not necessitate any
change in rates.

Environmental Compliance Overview Plan

The Company’s Environmental Compliance Overview (ECO) Plan establishes procedures to facilitate the
Mississippi PSC’s overview of the Company’s environmental strategy and provides for recovery of
costs (including cost of capital) associated with environmental projects approved by the
Mississippi PSC. Under the ECO Plan, any increase in the annual revenue requirement is limited to
two percent of retail revenues. However, the ECO Plan also provides for carryover of any amount
over the two percent limit into the next year’s revenue requirement. The Company conducts studies,
when possible, to determine the extent of any required environmental remediation. Should such
remediation be determined to be probable, reasonable estimates of costs to clean up such sites are
developed and recognized in the financial statements. In accordance with the Mississippi PSC
order, the Company recovers such costs under the ECO Plan as they are incurred. The Company’s 2004
ECO Plan filing was approved, as filed, by the Mississippi PSC on March 15, 2004, and resulted in a
slight decrease in rates effective April 2004.

Environmental Remediation

In 2003, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) designated the Company as a
potentially responsible party at a site in Texas. The site was owned by an electric transformer company
that handled the Company’s transformers as well as those of many other entities. The site owner is
now in bankruptcy and the State of Texas has entered into an agreement with the Company and several
other utilities to investigate and remediate the site. Amounts expensed during 2003 and 2004
related to this work were not material. Hundreds of entities have received notices from the TCEQ
requesting their participation in the anticipated site remediation. The final outcome of this
matter to the Company will depend upon further environmental assessment and the ultimate number of
potentially responsible parties and cannot now be determined. The remediation expenses incurred by
the

Company are expected to be recovered through the Company’s ECO Plan.

JOINT OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS

The Company and Alabama Power own, as tenants in common, Units 1 and 2 with a total capacity of 500
megawatts at Greene County Steam Plant, which is located in Alabama and operated by Alabama Power.
Additionally, the Company and Gulf Power, own as tenants in common, Units 1 and 2 with a total
capacity of 1,000 megawatts at Plant Daniel, which is located in Mississippi and operated by the
Company.

At December 31, 2004, the Company’s percentage ownership and investment in these jointly owned

INCOME TAXES

Southern Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. Under a
joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement, as required by the PUHCA, each subsidiary’s
current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis and no subsidiary is allocated more expense than would be paid if they filed a
separate income tax return. In accordance with Internal Revenue Service regulations, each
company is jointly and severally liable for the tax liability.

In 2004, in order to avoid the loss of certain federal income tax credits related to the
production of synthetic fuel, Southern Company chose to defer certain deductions otherwise
available to the subsidiaries. The cash flow benefit associated with the utilization of the tax
credits was allocated to the subsidiary that otherwise would have claimed the available deductions
on a separate company basis without the deferral. This allocation concurrently reduced the tax
benefit of the credits allocated to those subsidiaries that generated the credits. As the deferred
expenses are deducted, the benefit of the tax credits will be repaid to the subsidiaries that
generated the tax credits. The Company has recorded $3.6 million payable to these subsidiaries in
“Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes” on the balance sheets.

At December 31, 2004, the tax-related regulatory assets and liabilities were $11.4 million and
$21.8 million, respectively. These assets are attributable to tax benefits flowed through to
customers in prior years and to taxes applicable to capitalized interest. These liabilities are
attributable to deferred taxes previously recognized at rates higher than current enacted tax law
and to unamortized investment tax credits.

FINANCING

Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities/ Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trust

The Company has formed a wholly-owned trust subsidiary for the purpose of issuing preferred
securities. The proceeds of the related equity investment and preferred security sale were loaned
back to the Company through the issuance of junior subordinated notes totaling $36 million, which
constitute substantially all assets of the trust and are reflected on the balance sheets as
Long-term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trust. The Company considers that the mechanisms and
obligations relating to the preferred securities issued for its benefit, taken together, constitute
a full and unconditional guarantee by it of the trust’s payment obligations with respect to these
securities. At December 31, 2004, preferred securities of $35 million were outstanding. See Note
1 under “Variable Interest Entities” for additional information on the accounting treatment for the
trust and the related securities.

Pollution Control Bonds

Pollution control obligations
represent loans to the Company from public authorities of funds
derived from sales by such authorities of revenue bonds issued to
finance pollution control facilities. The Company is
required to make payments sufficient for authorities to meet principal and interest requirements of
such bonds. The amount of tax-exempt pollution control revenue bonds outstanding at December 31,
2004 was $82.7 million.

The first mortgage bond improvement fund requirement is one percent of each outstanding series
authenticated under the mortgage indenture of the Company prior to January 1 of each year, other
than first mortgage bonds issued as collateral security for certain pollution control obligations.
The requirement must be satisfied by June 1 of each year by depositing cash, reacquiring bonds, or
by pledging additional property equal to 1 and 2/3 times such requirement.

Assets Subject to Lien

The Company’s mortgage indenture dated as of September 1, 1941, as amended and supplemented, which
secures the first mortgage bonds issued by the Company, constitutes a direct first lien on
substantially all of the Company’s fixed property and franchises.

There are no agreements or other arrangements among the affiliated companies under which the
assets of one company have been pledged or otherwise made available to satisfy obligations of
Southern Company or any of its subsidiaries.

Bank Credit Arrangements

At the beginning of 2005, the Company had total committed credit agreements with banks for
approximately $100.5 million, all of which were unused. These credit arrangements expire in 2005.
The Company expects to renew its credit facilities, as needed, prior to expiration. Some of these
agreements allow short-term borrowings to be converted into term loans, payable in eight equal
quarterly installments, with the first installment due at the end of the first calendar quarter
after the applicable termination date or at an earlier date at the Company’s option.

In connection with these credit arrangements, the Company agrees to pay commitment fees based
on the unused portions of the commitments or to maintain compensating balances with the banks.
Commitment fees are less than 1/8 of 1 percent for the Company. Compensating balances are not
legally restricted from withdrawal.

This $100.5 million in unused credit arrangements provides required liquidity support to the
Company’s borrowings through a commercial paper program. At December 31, 2004, the Company had no
outstanding commercial paper or extendible commercial notes. During 2004, the peak amount
outstanding for commercial paper was $59.9 million and the average amount outstanding was $21.5
million. The average annual interest rate on commercial paper was 1.30 percent in 2004. The credit
arrangements also provide support to the Company’s variable daily rate tax-exempt pollution control
bonds.

Financial Instruments

The Company enters into energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, gas, and
other fuel price changes. However, due to cost-based rate regulations, the Company has limited
exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity. The Company has
implemented fuel-hedging programs with the approval of the Mississippi PSC. The Company enters
into hedges of forward electricity sales. There was no material ineffectiveness recorded in
earnings in 2004 and 2003.

At December 31, 2004, the fair value of derivative energy contracts was reflected in the
financial statements as follows:

Mississippi Power Company 2004 Annual Report

The fair value gains or losses for cash flow hedges are recorded as regulatory assets and
liabilities if they are recoverable through the regulatory clauses, otherwise they are recorded in
other comprehensive income, and are recognized in earnings at the same time the hedged items affect
earnings. For the year 2005, approximately $0.5 million of pre-tax losses are expected to be
reclassified from other comprehensive income to fuel expense. The Company has energy-related
hedges in place up to and including 2007.

Common Stock Dividend Restrictions

The Company’s first mortgage bond indenture and the corporate charter contain various common stock
dividend restrictions. At December 31, 2004, approximately $118 million of retained earnings was
restricted against the payment of cash dividends on common stock under the most restrictive terms
of the mortgage indenture or corporate charter.

In accordance with the PUHCA, the Company is also restricted from paying common dividends
from paid-in capital without SEC approval.

COMMITMENTS

Construction Program

The Company is engaged in continuous construction programs, currently estimated to total $88
million in 2005, $95 million in 2006, and $90 million in 2007. The construction program is subject
to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from the above estimates
because of numerous factors. These factors include changes in business conditions; acquisition of
additional generation assets; revised load growth estimates; changes in environmental regulations;
changes in FERC rules and transmission regulations; increasing costs of labor, equipment and
materials; and cost of capital. At December 31, 2004, significant purchase commitments were
outstanding in connection with the construction program. The Company has no generating plants
under construction. Capital improvements to generating, transmission, and distribution facilities
– including those to meet environmental standards – will continue.

Long-Term Service Agreements

The Company has entered into a Long-Term Service Agreement (LTSA) with General Electric (GE) for
the purpose of securing maintenance support for the leased combined cycle units at Plant Daniel.
In summary, the LTSA stipulates that GE will perform all planned inspections on the covered
equipment, which includes the cost of all labor and materials. GE is also obligated to cover the
costs of unplanned maintenance on the covered equipment subject to a limit specified in the
contract.

In general, the LTSA is in effect through two major inspection cycles of the units. Scheduled
payments to GE are made monthly based on estimated operating hours of the units and are recognized
as expense based on actual hours of operation. The Company has recognized $9 million, $6 million,
and $11 million for 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively, which is included in maintenance expense in
the statements of income. Remaining payments to GE under this agreement are currently estimated to
total $160 million over the next 13 years. However, the LTSA contains various cancellation
provisions at the option of the Company.

The Company also has entered into a LTSA with ABB Power Generation Inc. (ABB) for the purpose
of securing maintenance support for its Chevron Unit 5 combustion turbine plant. In summary, the
LTSA stipulates that ABB will perform all planned maintenance on the covered equipment, which
includes the cost of all labor and materials. ABB is also obligated to cover the costs of
unplanned maintenance on the covered equipment subject to a limit specified in the contract.

In general, this LTSA is in effect through two major inspection cycles. Scheduled payments
to ABB are made at various intervals based on actual operating hours of the unit. Payments to ABB
under this agreement are currently estimated to total $4.9 million over the remaining term of the
agreement, which is approximately two years. However, the LTSA contains various cancellation
provisions at the option of the Company. Payments made to ABB prior to the performance of any
planned maintenance are recorded as a prepayment in the balance sheets. Inspection costs are
capitalized or charged to expense based on the nature of the work performed.

Fuel Commitments

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of the generating plants, the Company has entered
into various long-term commitments for the procurement of fuel. In most cases, these contracts
contain provisions for price escalations, minimum purchase levels, and other financial
commitments. Coal commitments include forward contract purchases for
carbon dioxide emission allowances.
Natural gas purchase commitments contain given volumes with prices based on various indices at
the time of delivery. Amounts included in the chart below represent estimates based on New York
Mercantile Exchange future prices at December 31, 2004. Total estimated minimum long-term

SCS may enter into various types of wholesale energy and natural gas contracts acting as an
agent for the Company and all of the other Southern Company retail operating companies, Southern
Power, and Southern Company GAS. Under these agreements, each of the retail operating companies,
Southern Power, and Southern Company GAS may be jointly and severally liable. The
creditworthiness of Southern Power and Southern Company GAS is currently inferior to the
creditworthiness of the retail operating companies. Accordingly, Southern Company has entered
into keep-well agreements with the Company and each of the other operating companies to insure
they will not subsidize or be responsible for any costs, losses, liabilities, or damages resulting
from the inclusion of Southern Power or Southern Company GAS as a contracting party under these
agreements.

Operating Leases

Railcar Leases

In 1989, the Company and Gulf Power jointly entered into a twenty-two year operating lease
agreement for the use of 495 aluminum railcars. In 1994, a second lease agreement for the use of
250 additional aluminum railcars was also entered into for twenty-two years. The Company has the
option to purchase the 745 railcars at the greater of lease termination value or fair market
value, or to renew the leases at the end of the lease term. In 2004, the Company entered into a
three-year operating lease agreement for the use of 120 aluminum railcars. All of these leases
are for the transport of coal to Plant Daniel.

Gulf Power, as joint owner of Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2, is responsible for one half of the
lease costs. The Company’s share (50%) of the leases, charged to fuel stock and recovered through
the ECM, was $1.9 million annually in 2004, 2003, and 2002. The Company’s annual lease payments
for 2005 through 2009 will average approximately $2.3 million and after 2009, lease payments total
in aggregate approximately $6.2 million.

Plant Daniel Combined Cycle Generating Units

In May 2001, the Company began the initial 10-year term of the lease agreement for a 1,064
megawatt natural gas combined cycle generating facility built at Plant Daniel (Facility). The
Company entered into this transaction during a period when retail access was under review by the
Mississippi PSC. The lease arrangement provided a lower cost alternative to its cost based rate
regulated customers than a traditional rate base asset. See Note 3 under “Retail Regulatory
Matters” for a description of PEP, the Company’s formula rate plan.

In 2003, the Facility was acquired by Juniper Capital L.P. (Juniper), whose partners are
unaffiliated with the Company. Simultaneously, Juniper entered into a restructured lease
agreement with the Company. Juniper has also entered into leases with other parties unrelated to
the Company. The assets leased by the Company comprise less than 50 percent of Juniper’s assets.
The Company is not required to consolidate the leased assets and related liabilities, and the
lease with

II-263


NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2004 Annual Report

Juniper is considered an operating lease. The lease agreement is treated as an operating lease for
accounting purposes, as well as for both retail and wholesale rate recovery purposes. For income
tax purposes, the Company retains tax ownership. The initial lease term ends in 2011 and the
lease includes a purchase and renewal option based on the cost of the Facility at the inception of
the lease, which was $369 million. The Company is required to amortize approximately four percent
of the initial acquisition cost over the initial lease term. Eighteen months prior to the end of
the initial lease, the Company may elect to renew for 10 years. If the lease is renewed, the
agreement calls for the Company to amortize an additional 17 percent of the initial completion
cost over the renewal period. Upon termination of the lease, at the Company’s option, it may
either exercise its purchase option or the Facility can be sold to a third party.

The lease provides for a residual value guarantee — approximately 73 percent of the
acquisition cost — by the Company that is due upon termination of the lease in the event that the
Company does not renew the lease or purchase the Facility and that the fair market value is less
than the unamortized cost of the Facility. A liability of approximately $13 million for the fair
market value of this residual value guarantee is included in the balance sheets. In 2003,
approximately $11 million in lease termination costs and were included in other operation expense.
Lease expenses were $27 million, $26 million, and $26 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002,
respectively.

The Company estimates that its annual amount of future minimum operating lease payments under
this arrangement, exclusive of any payment related to the residual value guarantee, as of December
31, 2004, are as follows:

SAVANNAH ELECTRIC AND POWER COMPANY

FINANCIAL SECTION

II-268


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Savannah Electric and Power Company:

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements of capitalization of Savannah
Electric and Power Company (a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company) as of December 31, 2004
and 2003, and the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder’s equity,
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004. These financial
statements are the responsibility of Savannah Electric and Power Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a
basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements (pages II-287
to II-311) present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Savannah Electric and Power Company at December 31,
2004 and 2003, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America.

As
discussed in Note 9 to the financial statements, the 2003 and
2002 financial statements have been restated.

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, in 2003 Savannah Electric and Power
Company changed its method of accounting for asset retirement obligations.

Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of selling electricity. These
factors include the Company’s ability to maintain a stable regulatory environment, to achieve
energy sales growth while containing costs, and to recover costs related to growing demand and
increasingly more stringent environmental standards. In 2004, the Company filed a retail rate case
and completed a retail fuel cost recovery rate case. These regulatory actions were initiated to
help enable the recovery of substantial capital investments in generating plant, to facilitate the
continued reliability of the transmission and distribution network, and to allow for the recovery
of increasing fuel costs. The Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC) is expected to rule on the
Company’s base rate increase request in May 2005.

Restatement

See Note 9 to the financial statements for information regarding the Company’s restatement of its
financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and for the quarters ended
March 31, June 30, and September 30, 2004 and 2003, as
well as quarterly financial information for the quarter ended
December 31, 2003.
The restatement also affects periods prior to 2002. These restatements were a result of errors in the Company’s estimates of unbilled revenues in these periods. All amounts
herein reflect the effects of these restatements. For further information on the estimates of
unbilled revenues, also see ACCOUNTING POLICIES – “Application of Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates – Unbilled Revenues” herein.

Key Performance Indicators

In striving to maximize shareholder value while providing low-cost energy to more than 143,000
customers, the Company focuses on several key indicators. These indicators include customer
satisfaction, peak season equivalent forced outage rate (Peak Season EFOR), and return on equity
(ROE). The Company’s financial success is directly tied to the satisfaction of its customers. Key
elements of ensuring customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high reliability and
competitive prices. Management uses nationally recognized independent customer satisfaction
surveys and reliability indicators to evaluate the Company’s results. Peak Season EFOR is an
indicator of plant availability and efficient generation fleet operations during the months when
generation needs are greatest. The rate is calculated by dividing the number of hours of forced
outages by total generation hours. ROE is a performance standard used by both the investment
community and many regulatory agencies. The Company’s 2004 results compared to its targets for
each of these indicators are reflected in the following chart.

Management focuses on these indicators and employees are committed to achieving or exceeding
management’s expectations. The financial performance achieved in 2004 was adversely affected by
the purchase of the Plant McIntosh Combined Cycle Units 10 and 11
construction project and a related
cost disallowance by the Georgia PSC. See Note 3 under “Plant McIntosh Construction Project” for additional information.

Earnings

The Company’s net income
after preferred stock dividends for 2004 totaled $24.2 million, representing an increase of $0.8 million,
or 3.3 percent, from the prior year. Higher operating revenues were somewhat offset by higher
operating expenses and higher interest expenses. Earnings were $23.5 million in 2003, reflecting
an increase of $2.1 million, or 10.0 percent, from the prior year. Higher operating revenues,
lower depreciation and amortization expenses, and lower interest expenses were somewhat offset by
higher operating expenses and income taxes. In 2002, earnings were $21.3 million, representing
a decrease of $0.2

Total operating revenues for 2004 were $357.0 million, reflecting a 13.3 percent increase
when compared to 2003. Retail revenues increased 14.4 percent, or $43.0 million, in 2004,
increased 5.5 percent, or $15.6 million, in 2003, and increased 5.6 percent, or $15.0 million, in
2002. Retail base rates increased in
2003 and 2002 reflecting the Georgia PSC decision effective June 2002.

On November 30, 2004, the Company filed a traditional one-year rate case with the Georgia PSC
requesting a $23.2 million, or 6.7 percent, increase in retail revenues, effective January 1, 2005.
See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters” for additional
information on the Company’s 2002 rate order and 2004 retail rate case filing.

Electric rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, the
energy component of

purchased power costs, and certain other costs. Under the fuel recovery provisions, fuel revenues
generally equal fuel expenses—including the fuel component of purchased energy—and do not affect
net income. The Georgia PSC approved a Fuel Cost Recovery (FCR) rate increase that became
effective in November 2004. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory
Matters” for additional information on the Company’s rate orders.

Revenues from sales to non-affiliated utilities are primarily energy related. These sales
decreased 10.9 percent in 2004, decreased 11.0 percent in 2003, and decreased 28.5 percent in 2002
primarily due to fluctuations in off-system sale transactions that were generally offset by
corresponding purchase transactions. These sales do not have a significant impact on net income
since the energy is generally sold at variable cost.

Sales to affiliated companies vary from year to year depending on demand and the availability
and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliated sales are made in accordance
with the affiliate company interchange agreement, as approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC). These energy sales do not have a significant impact on earnings since the
energy is generally sold at variable cost.

Energy Sales

Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the amount of energy sold each year. Kilowatt-hour

In 2004, residential and commercial energy sales increased from the prior year primarily
due to continued customer growth. Industrial sales were lower because of lower usage by several
industrial customers due to cogeneration and cutbacks in production.

In 2003, residential energy sales decreased from the prior year primarily due
to weather-related demand. Industrial sales were higher because of an increase in usage by several
industrial customers, reflecting the beginning of an economic recovery from the previous two-year
slowdown. All three customer classes benefited from continued customer growth. In 2002,
residential and commercial energy sales increased from the prior year reflecting the positive
impact of weather and continued customer growth. Industrial sales increased, reflecting customer
growth, and were somewhat offset by a general economic slowdown.

Energy sales to retail customers are projected to increase at a compound average growth rate
of 2.2 percent during the period 2005 through 2009.

Expenses

Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses

Fuel and purchased power costs constitute the single largest expense for the Company. The mix of
energy supply is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the
availability and cost of generation units.

The amount and sources of generation, the average cost of fuel per net KWH generated, and the
amount and average cost of purchased power were as follows:

generation in 2004. The average cost of fuel per net KWH generated increased for coal and oil and
decreased for gas in 2004. In 2003, fuel expense increased 0.6 percent due to a slight increase in
generation offset somewhat by a lower cost of coal. In 2002, fuel expense increased 8.2 percent
due to increased gas usage and a higher cost of coal.

Purchased power expense increased $36.2 million, or 40.4 percent, in 2004 due to increased
energy demands and higher energy costs. In 2003, purchased power expense increased $13.9 million,
or 18.4 percent, due to increased energy demands and a purchased power agreement (PPA) between the
Company and Southern Power for energy and capacity from Plant Wansley Units 6 and 7 which began in
June 2002. Purchased power from non-affiliates decreased 72.5 percent and from affiliates
increased 38.6 percent in 2002 due principally to the Plant Wansley PPA discussed above. Purchased
power from affiliates also included energy purchases which will vary depending on demand and cost
of generation resources at each company. These energy costs are recovered through the fuel cost
recovery clause and have no significant impact on earnings.

A significant upward trend in the cost of coal and natural gas has emerged since 2003, and
volatility in these markets is expected to continue. Increased coal prices have been influenced by
a worldwide increase in demand as a result of rapid economic growth in China as well as by
increases in mining costs. Higher natural gas prices in the United States are the result of
slightly lower gas supplies despite increased drilling activity. Natural gas supply interruptions,
such as those caused by the 2004 hurricanes, result in an immediate market response, however, the
impact of this price volatility may be reduced by imports of natural gas and liquefied natural gas.
Fuel expenses generally do not affect net income, since they are offset by fuel revenues under the
Company’s fuel cost recovery provisions.

Other Operating Expenses

Other operation and maintenance expenses increased $2.3 million, or 2.8 percent, in 2004 as a
result of a $2.8 million increase in administrative and general expenses primarily relating to accounting and
auditing services and employee benefits expense, and a $0.6 million increase in distribution expenses partially offset by
a decrease of $1.4 million in maintenance expense due mainly to a scheduled turbine maintenance outage at Plant Kraft in
2003.

In 2003, other operation and maintenance expenses increased $2.6 million, or 3.2 percent.
Administrative and general expenses increased by $1.0 million primarily due to increases in
accounting and auditing services, insurance reserves, and employee benefits expense, somewhat
offset by the annual true-up in billings to Georgia Power for charges associated with the jointly
owned combustion turbines at the Company’s Plant McIntosh. Maintenance expense increased $1.5
million primarily due to a scheduled turbine maintenance outage at Plant Kraft and higher
transmission and distribution maintenance expenses.

In 2002, other operation and maintenance expenses increased $10.5 million, or 14.9 percent.
Increased other operation expense reflected increased distribution expenses of $0.6 million,
increased administrative and general costs of $3.7 million, and $0.5 million associated with new
marketing programs. Distribution costs increased to support improved customer reliability.
Administrative and general costs were higher primarily due to increases in security, legal,
accounting and auditing services, regulatory activities, and employee benefits expenses.
Administrative and general expenses were also higher reflecting the annual true-up in billings to
Georgia Power for charges associated with the jointly owned combustion turbines at the Company’s
Plant McIntosh. Maintenance expense in 2002 increased $5.4 million over 2001 primarily as a result
of scheduled maintenance outages at Plant Kraft and amortization of expenses for a major
maintenance project on the combustion turbines at Plant McIntosh.

In 2004, depreciation and amortization increased $0.8 million, or 3.7 percent, due to an
increase in depreciable property. Depreciation and amortization decreased $2.2 million, or 9.7
percent, in 2003 and $3.2 million, or 12.5 percent, in 2002 primarily as a result of discontinuing
accelerated depreciation and beginning amortization of the related regulatory liability in June
2002, in accordance with the 2002 Georgia PSC rate order. See Note 3 to the financial statements
under “Retail Regulatory Matters” for additional information.

Non-Operating Expenses

Interest expense and preferred dividends increased $4.0 million, or 41.3 percent, in 2004 primarily
related to an increase in senior notes and preferred stock outstanding.

II-273


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2004 Annual Report

These increases were partially offset by a decrease in distributions on mandatorily redeemable
preferred securities due to the retirement of $40 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred
securities. Interest expense decreased $2.0 million, or 17.4 percent, in 2003 primarily as a
result of a lower principal amount of debt outstanding during the year. In 2002, interest expense
decreased $0.9 million, or 7.3 percent. Lower interest rates in 2003 and 2002 contributed to lower
expenses in those years. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY –
“Financing Activities” herein for
additional information.

Effects of Inflation

The Company is subject to rate regulation that is based on the recovery of historical costs. In
addition, the income tax laws are based on historical costs. Therefore, inflation creates an
economic loss because the Company is recovering its costs of investments in dollars that have less
purchasing power. While the inflation rate has been relatively low in recent years, it continues
to have an adverse effect on the Company because of the large investment in utility plant with long
economic lives. Conventional accounting for historical cost does not recognize this economic loss
nor the partially offsetting gain that arises through financing facilities with fixed-money
obligations such as long-term debt and preferred securities. Any recognition of inflation by
regulatory authorities is reflected in the rate of return allowed in the Company’s approved
electric rates.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL

General

The Company operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electricity to retail customers
within the traditional service area of southeastern Georgia. Prices for electricity provided by
the Company to retail customers are set by the Georgia PSC under cost-based regulatory principles.
Prices for electricity relating to jointly owned generating facilities, interconnecting
transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power are set by the FERC. Retail rates and
earnings are reviewed and adjusted periodically within certain limitations based on ROE. See
ACCOUNTING POLICIES – “Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Electric Utility
Regulation” herein and Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information about these
and other regulatory matters.

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of future
earnings potential. The level of the Company’s future earnings depends on numerous factors that
affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Company’s primary business of selling
electricity. These factors include the Company’s ability to maintain a stable regulatory
environment, to achieve energy sales growth while containing costs, and to recover costs related to
growing demand and increasingly more stringent environmental standards. Future earnings in the
near term will depend, in part, upon growth in energy sales, which is subject to a number of
factors. These factors include weather, competition, energy conservation practiced by customers,
the price of electricity, the price elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic growth in the
Company’s service area.

Since 2001, merchant energy companies and traditional electric utilities with significant
energy marketing and trading activities have come under severe financial pressures. Many of these
companies have completely exited or drastically reduced all energy marketing and trading activities
and sold foreign and domestic electric infrastructure assets. The Company has not experienced any
material adverse financial impact regarding its limited energy trading operations through Southern
Company Services (SCS).

Environmental Matters

New Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil action in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against Alabama Power and Georgia Power. The
EPA later amended its complaints to add the Company as a defendant alleging violations of the New
Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act and related state laws with respect to the
Company’s Plant Kraft. The civil actions request penalties and injunctive relief, including an
order requiring the installation of the best available control technology at the affected units.
The actions against Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and the Company were effectively stayed in the
spring of 2001 pending the appeal of a similar NSR action against the Tennessee Valley Authority
before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. In June 2004, following the final

II-274


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2004 Annual Report

resolution of the appeal, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama lifted the
stay in the action against Alabama Power, placing the case back onto the court’s active docket. At
this time, no party to the case against Georgia Power and the Company has sought to reopen
that case, which remains administratively closed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
Georgia. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “New Source Review Actions” for additional
information.

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA’s regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act
authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $32,500 per day, per violation at each generating
unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in this matter could
require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly
require payment of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of operations, cash
flows, and possibly financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

In December 2002 and October 2003, the EPA issued final revisions to its NSR regulations under
the Clean Air Act. The December 2002 revisions included changes to the regulatory exclusions and
the methods of calculating emissions increases. The October 2003 regulations clarified the scope
of the existing Routine Maintenance, Repair, and Replacement (RMRR) exclusion. A coalition of
states and environmental organizations has filed petitions for review of these revisions with the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The October 2003 RMRR rules have been
stayed by the court of appeals pending its review of the rules. In any event, the final
regulations must also be adopted by the State of Georgia in order to apply to the Company’s
facilities. The effect of these final regulations, related legal challenges, and potential state
rulemakings cannot be determined at this time.

Carbon Dioxide Litigation

On July 21, 2004, attorneys general from eight states, each outside of Southern Company’s service
territory, and the corporation counsel for New York City filed a complaint in the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York against Southern Company and four other electric power
companies. A nearly identical complaint was filed by three environmental groups in the same court.
The complaints allege that the companies’ emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas,
contribute to global warming, which the plaintiffs assert is a public nuisance. Under common law
public and private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs seek a judicial order (1) holding each
defendant jointly and severally liable for creating, contributing to, and/or maintaining global
warming and (2) requiring each of the defendants to cap its emissions of carbon dioxide and then
reduce those emissions by a specified percentage each year for at least a decade. Plaintiffs have
not, however, requested that damages be awarded in connection with their claims. Southern Company
believes these claims are without merit and notes that the complaint cites no statutory or
regulatory basis for the claims. Southern Company and the other defendants have filed motions to
dismiss both lawsuits. Southern Company intends to vigorously defend against these claims. While
the outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time, an adverse judgment in either of
these actions could result in substantial capital expenditures.

Environmental Statutes and Regulations

The Company’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by state and federal environmental
agencies under a variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental media, including air,
water, and land resources. Compliance with these environmental requirements involves significant
capital and operating costs, a major portion of which is expected to be recovered through existing
ratemaking provisions. Environmental costs that are known and estimable at this time are included
in capital expenditures discussed under FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY — “Capital Requirements
and Contractual Obligations” herein. There is no assurance, however, that all such costs will, in
fact, be recovered.

Compliance with the Clean Air Act and resulting regulations has been and will continue to be a
significant focus for the Company. The Title IV acid rain provisions of the Clean Air Act, for
example, required significant reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions and
resulted in total construction expenditures of approximately $2 million through 2000.

To help attain the one-hour ozone standard, the EPA

II-275


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2004 Annual Report

issued regional nitrogen oxide reduction rules in 1998. Those rules required 21 states,
including Georgia, to reduce and cap nitrogen oxide emissions from power plants and other large
industrial sources. As a result of litigation challenging the rule, the courts required the EPA to
complete a separate rulemaking before the requirements could be
applied in Georgia. In April 2004, the EPA published final regional nitrogen oxide reduction rules applicable to Georgia,
specifying a May 1, 2007 compliance date. However, in October 2004, the EPA announced that it
would stay implementation of the rule as it relates to Georgia, while it initiates rulemakings to
address issues raised in a petition for reconsideration filed by a coalition of Georgia industries.
The impact of the nitrogen oxide reduction rules on the Company will depend on the outcome of the
petition for reconsideration and/or any subsequent development and approval of Georgia’s state
implementation plan and cannot be determined at this time.

In January 2004, the EPA issued a proposed Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) to address
interstate transport of ozone and fine particles. This proposed rule would require additional
year-round sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission reductions from power plants in the eastern
United States in two phases – in 2010 and 2015. The EPA currently plans to finalize this rule in
2005. If finalized, the rule could modify or supplant other state requirements for attainment of
the fine particulate matter standard and the eight-hour ozone
standard, as well as other air quality regulations. The impact of this rule on
the Company will depend upon the specific requirements of the final rule and cannot be determined
at this time.

The Company has developed and maintains an environmental compliance strategy for the
installation of additional control technologies and the purchase of emission allowances to assure
continued compliance with current sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission regulations.
Additional expenses associated with these regulations are anticipated to be incurred each year to
maintain current and future compliance. Because the Company’s compliance strategy is impacted by
factors such as changes to existing environmental laws and regulations, increases in the costs of
emissions allowances, and any changes in the Company’s fuel mix, future environmental compliance
costs cannot be determined at this time.

Further reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides could also be required under the
EPA’s Regional Haze rules. The Regional Haze rules require states to establish Best Available
Retrofit Technology (BART) standards for certain sources that contribute to regional haze and to
implement emission reduction requirements that make progress toward remedying current visibility
impairment in certain natural areas. The Company has two plants that could be subject to these
rules. The EPA’s Regional Haze program calls for states to submit implementation plans in 2008
that contain emission reduction strategies for implementing BART and for achieving sufficient
progress toward the Clean Air Act’s visibility improvement goal. In response to litigation, the
EPA proposed revised rules in May 2004, which it plans to finalize in April 2005. The impact of
these regulations will depend on the promulgation of final rules and implementation of those rules
by the states and, therefore, it is not possible to determine the effect of these rules on the
Company at this time.

In January 2004, the EPA issued proposed rules regulating mercury emissions from electric
utility boilers. The proposal solicits comments on two possible approaches for the new regulations
– a Maximum Achievable Control Technology approach and a cap-and-trade approach. Either approach
would require significant reductions in mercury emissions from company facilities. The regulations
are scheduled to be finalized by March 2005, and compliance could be required as early as 2008.
Because the regulations have not been finalized, the impact on the Company cannot be determined at
this time.

Major bills to amend the Clean Air Act to impose more stringent emissions limitations on power
plants, including the Bush Administration’s Clear Skies Act,
have been re-proposed in 2005. The Clear
Skies Act is expected to further limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and
mercury and to supplement the proposed CAIR and mercury regulatory programs. Other proposals to
limit emissions of carbon dioxide have also been introduced. The cost impacts of such legislation
would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined at this time.

Under the Clean Water Act, the EPA has been developing new rules aimed at reducing impingement
and entrainment of fish and fish larvae at power plants’ cooling water intake structures. In July
2004, the EPA published final rules that will require biological studies and, perhaps,
retrofits to some intake structures at existing power plants. The impact of these new rules will

II-276


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2004 Annual Report

depend on the results of studies and analyses performed as part of the rules’ implementation and
actual limits established by the regulatory agencies.

Several major pieces of environmental legislation are periodically considered for
reauthorization or amendment by Congress. These include: the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act;
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Emergency Planning & Community
Right-to-Know Act; and the Endangered Species Act. Compliance with possible additional federal or
state legislation or regulations related to global climate change, or other environmental and
health concerns could also significantly affect the Company. The impact of any new legislation,
changes to existing legislation, or environmental regulations could affect many areas of the
Company’s operations. The full impact of any such changes cannot, however, be determined at this
time.

Global Climate Issues

Domestic efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions have been spurred by international discussions
surrounding the Framework Convention on Climate Change — and specifically the Kyoto Protocol —
which proposes constraints on the emissions of greenhouse gases for a group of industrialized
countries. The Bush Administration has not supported U.S. ratification of the Kyoto Protocol or
other mandatory carbon dioxide reduction legislation and, in 2002, announced a goal to reduce the
greenhouse gas intensity of the U.S. — the ratio of greenhouse gas emissions to the value of U.S.
economic output — by 18 percent by 2012. A year later, the Department of Energy (DOE) announced
the Climate VISION program to support this goal. Energy-intensive industries, including
electricity generation are the initial focus of this program. Southern Company is leading the
development of a voluntary electric utility sector climate change initiative in partnership with
the government. The utility sector has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions rate by 3 to
5 percent over the next decade and, on December 13, 2004, signed a memorandum of understanding with
the DOE initiating this program under Climate VISION. Because efforts under this voluntary program
are just beginning, the impact of this program on the Company cannot be determined at this time.

Environmental Remediation Reserves

The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling and
disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations,
the Company could incur substantial costs to clean up properties. The Company conducts studies to
determine the extent of any required cleanup and has recognized in its financial statements the
costs to clean up known sites. Amounts for cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs were not material
for any year presented. The Company may be liable for some or all required cleanup costs for
additional sites that may require environmental remediation. The Company has not incurred any
significant cleanup costs to date.

FERC and Georgia PSC Matters

Transmission

In December 1999, the
FERC issued its final rule on Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs).
Since that time, there have been a number of additional proceedings at the FERC designed to
encourage further voluntary formation of RTOs or to mandate their formation. However, at the
current time, there are no active proceedings that would require the Company to participate in an
RTO. Current FERC efforts that may potentially change the regulatory and/or operational structure
of transmission include rules related to the standardization of generation interconnection, as well
as an inquiry into, among other things, market power by vertically integrated utilities. See
“Generation Interconnection Agreements” and “Market-Based Rate Authority” below for additional
information. The final outcome of these proceedings cannot now be determined. However, the
Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by
future changes in the federal regulatory or operational structure of
transmission.

Generation Interconnection Agreements

In July 2003, the FERC issued its final rule on the standardization of generation interconnection
agreements and procedures (Order 2003). Order 2003 shifts much of the financial burden of new
transmission investment from the generator to the transmission provider. The FERC has indicated
that Order 2003, which was effective

II-277


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2004 Annual Report

January 20, 2004, is to be applied prospectively to interconnection agreements. The impact of
Order 2003 and its subsequent rehearings on the Company and the final results of these matters
cannot be determined at this time.

Market-Based Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates at market-based prices.
Through SCS as agent, the Company also has FERC authority to make short-term opportunity sales at
market rates. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a market-based contract with
an affiliate. In November 2001, the FERC modified the test it uses to consider utilities’
applications to charge market-based rates and adopted a new test called the Supply Margin
Assessment (SMA). The FERC applied the SMA to several utilities,
including Southern Company, the retail operating companies, and
Southern Power, and found Southern Company and others to be “pivotal suppliers” in their
retail service territories and ordered the implementation of several mitigation measures. Southern
Company and others sought rehearing of the FERC order, and the FERC delayed the implementation of certain
mitigation measures. In April 2004, the FERC issued an order that abandoned the SMA test and
adopted a new interim analysis for measuring generation market power. This new interim approach
requires utilities to submit a pivotal supplier screen and a wholesale market share screen. If the
applicant does not pass both screens, there will be a rebuttable presumption regarding generation
market power. The FERC’s order also sets forth procedures for rebutting these presumptions and
addresses mitigation measures for those entities that are found to have market power. In the
absence of specific mitigation measures, the order includes several cost-based mitigation measures
that would apply by default. The FERC also initiated a new rulemaking proceeding that, among other
things, will adopt a final methodology for assessing generation market power.

In July 2004, the FERC denied Southern Company’s request for rehearing, along with a number
of others, and reaffirmed the interim tests that it adopted in April 2004. In August 2004, Southern
Company submitted a filing to the FERC that included results showing that Southern Company
passed the pivotal supplier screen for all markets and the wholesale market share screen for all
markets except the Southern Company retail service territory. Southern Company also submitted
other analyses to demonstrate that it lacks generation market power. On December 17, 2004, the
FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation dominance within its retail
service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other markets is not at issue.
As directed by this order, on February 15, 2005, Southern Company submitted additional
information related to generation dominance in the Southern Company retail service territory.
Any new market-based rate transactions in the Southern Company retail service territory entered
into after February 27, 2005 will be subject to refund to the level of the default cost-based
rates, pending the outcome of the proceeding. Southern Company, along with other utilities, has
also filed an appeal of the FERC’s April and July 2004 orders with the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit. The FERC has asked the court to dismiss the appeal on the
grounds that it is premature.

In the event that the FERC’s default mitigation measures are ultimately applied, the
Company may be required to charge cost-based rates for certain wholesale sales in the Southern
Company retail service territory, which may be lower than negotiated market-based rates. The
final outcome of this matter will depend on the form in which the final methodology for
assessing generation market power and mitigation rules may be ultimately adopted and cannot be
determined at this time.

Retail Rate Case Filing

On November 30, 2004, the Company filed a traditional one-year rate case with the Georgia PSC
requesting a $23.2 million, or 6.7 percent, increase in retail revenues, effective January 1, 2005.
The requested increase is based on a future test year ending December 31, 2005 and a proposed
retail return on common equity of 12.5 percent. As an alternative, the Company has also included
in its request a three-year rate plan that is based on the same test year and proposed retail
return on common equity. The Company expects the Georgia PSC to issue a final order in this matter
during May 2005. The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

The increase in retail revenues is being requested to cover the Company’s investment in the
new Plant McIntosh Combined Cycle Units 10 and 11; increasing operating and maintenance expenses;
and continued investment in generation, transmission, and distribution facilities to support growth
and ensure reliability. The increase also includes recognition on an annual basis of

II-278


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2004 Annual Report

the $3.8 million of Plant Wansley purchased power expenses which were excluded by the Georgia PSC
in the Company’s last rate case and subsequently were subject to deferral through a Georgia PSC
accounting order issued in December 2002.

Under the terms of that order, two-thirds of any earnings of the Company in a calendar year
above a 12 percent return on common equity are used to amortize the deferred amounts to expense.
The remaining one-third of any such earnings can be retained by the Company. The accounting order
provided the Company with discretionary authority to amortize up to an additional $1.5 million
annually. In January 2003, the Company began deferring the costs under the terms of the accounting
order. Through December 2004, the Company had amortized all of the deferred purchased power costs.
For additional information, see Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory
Matters.”

Plant McIntosh Construction Project

In December 2002 after a competitive bidding process, the Georgia PSC certified PPAs between
Southern Power and Georgia Power and the Company for capacity from Plant McIntosh Combined Cycle
Units 10 and 11, construction of which is scheduled to be completed in June 2005. In April
2003, Southern Power applied for FERC approval of these PPAs. In July 2003, the FERC accepted
the PPAs to become effective June 1, 2005, subject to refund, and ordered that hearings be held.
Intervenors opposed the FERC’s acceptance of the PPAs, alleging that they did not meet
applicable standards for market-based rates between affiliates. To ensure the timely completion
of the Plant McIntosh construction project and the availability of the units in the summer of
2005 for their retail customers, the Company and Georgia Power in May 2004 requested the Georgia
PSC to direct them to acquire the Plant McIntosh construction project. The Georgia PSC issued
such an order and the transfer occurred on May 24, 2004 at a total cost of approximately $415
million, including $14 million of transmission interconnection facilities. Subsequently,
Southern Power filed a request to withdraw the PPAs and to terminate the ongoing FERC
proceedings. In August 2004, the FERC issued a notice accepting the request to withdraw the
PPAs and permitting such request to become effective by operation of law. However, the FERC
made no determination on what additional steps may need to be taken with respect to testimony
provided in the proceedings. The ultimate outcome of any additional FERC action cannot now be
determined.

As directed by the Georgia PSC order, Georgia Power and the Company in June 2004 filed an
application to amend the resource certificate granted by the Georgia PSC in 2002. In
connection with the Georgia Power 2004 retail rate case, the Georgia PSC approved the transfer
of the Plant McIntosh construction project, at a total fair market value of approximately $385
million. This value reflects an approximate $16 million
disallowance. The Company owns
16.129 percent of the project; thus, this disallowance amounted to approximately $3 million and
reduced the Company’s 2004 net income by approximately $1.5 million. The Georgia PSC also
certified a total completion cost of $547 million for the project. The amount of the
disallowance will be adjusted accordingly based on the actual completion cost of the project.
The Georgia PSC will determine the rate treatment of Plant McIntosh in connection with its
decision on the Company’s 2004 retail rate case filing in May 2005. See Note 3 under “Plant
McIntosh Construction Project.”

Retail Fuel Cost Recovery

On October 25, 2004, the Georgia PSC approved the Company’s request for a fuel cost recovery rate
increase with no significant modifications. The approved fuel rate increase also includes the
recovery of approximately $3.5 million in costs associated with a coal transloader to be amortized
over a 21-month period. The transloader allows foreign coal to be off-loaded from ships at the
Company’s Plant Kraft dock and then transferred by rail to Plant McIntosh. The new rates became
effective in November 2004. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory
Matters – Fuel Cost Recovery” for further information.

II-279


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2004 Annual Report

Income Tax Matters

American Jobs Creation Act of 2004

On October 22, 2004, President Bush signed the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Jobs Act)
into law. The Jobs Act includes a provision that allows a generation tax deduction for
utilities. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the Jobs Act, including this
deduction, as well as the related regulatory treatment, on its taxable income. However, the
Company currently does not expect the Jobs Act to have a material impact on its financial
statements.

Other Matters

In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 87, Employers’
Accounting for Pensions, the Company recorded non-cash pension costs of approximately $5.3 million,
$4.3 million, and $4.4 million pre-tax in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Future pension costs
are dependent on several factors including trust earnings and changes
to the pension plans and are
expected to continue to increase. Postretirement benefit costs for the Company were approximately
$2.8 million in 2004, $2.7 million in 2003, and $2.6 million in 2002 and are expected to continue
to trend upward. A portion of pension and postretirement benefit costs is capitalized based on
construction-related labor charges. For more information regarding pension and postretirement
benefits, see Note 2 to the financial statements.

Effective September 30, 2004, the Company retired Units 4 and 5 at Plant Riverside. The
remaining units at the plant will be retired on May 31, 2005. These retirements will have no
material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

The Company is involved in various other matters being litigated and regulatory matters that
could affect future earnings. See Note 3 to the financial statements for information regarding
material issues.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may
have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations and related disclosures. Different
assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those
recorded in the financial statements. Southern Company senior management has discussed the
development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates described below with
the Audit Committee of Southern Company’s Board of Directors.

Electric Utility Regulation

The Company is subject to retail regulation by the Georgia PSC and wholesale regulation by the
FERC. These regulatory agencies set the rates the Company is permitted to charge customers based
on allowable costs. As a result, the Company applies FASB Statement No. 71, Accounting for the
Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, which requires the financial statements to reflect the
effects of rate regulation. Through the ratemaking process, the regulators may require the
inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when they would be recognized by a
non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of expenses and the recording of
related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery through rates or the deferral of
gains or creation of liabilities and the recording of related regulatory liabilities. The
application of Statement No. 71 has a further effect on the Company’s financial statements as a
result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the ratemaking process. These estimates may
differ from those actually incurred by the Company; therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in
specific costs such as depreciation and pension and postretirement benefits have less of a direct
impact on the Company’s results of operations than they would on a non-regulated company.

As reflected in Note 1 to the financial statements, significant regulatory assets and
liabilities have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of these regulatory
assets and liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines. However, adverse legislative,
judicial, or regulatory actions could materially impact the amounts of such regulatory assets and
liabilities and could adversely impact the Company’s financial statements.

II-280


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2004 Annual Report

Contingent Obligations

The Company is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other
factors and conditions that potentially subject it to environmental, litigation, income tax, and
other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Note 3 to the financial statements for
more information regarding certain of these contingencies. The Company periodically evaluates its
exposure to such risks and records reserves for those matters where a loss is considered probable
and reasonably estimable in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The adequacy
of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or conditions that can be
unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially affect the Company’s
financial statements. These events or conditions include the following:

•

Changes in existing state or federal regulation by governmental
authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality,
control of toxic substances, hazardous and solid wastes, and other
environmental matters.

•

Changes in existing income tax regulations or changes in Internal
Revenue Service interpretations of existing regulations.

•

Identification of additional sites that require environmental
remediation or the filing of other complaints in which the Company may
be asserted to be a potentially responsible party.

•

Identification and evaluation of other potential lawsuits or complaints
in which the Company may be named as a defendant.

•

Resolution or progression of existing matters through the legislative
process, the court systems, or the EPA.

Unbilled Revenues

Revenues related to the sale of electricity are recorded when electricity is delivered to
customers. However, the determination of kilowatt-hour sales to individual customers is based on
the reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis
throughout the month. At the
end of each month, amounts of electricity delivered to customers, but not yet metered and billed,
are estimated. Components of the unbilled revenue estimates include total kilowatt-hour
territorial supply, total kilowatt-hour billed, estimated total electricity lost in delivery, and
customer usage. These components can fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including
weather, generation patterns, and power delivery volume and other operational constraints. These
factors can be unpredictable and can vary from historical trends. As a result, the overall
estimate of unbilled revenues could be significantly affected. See Note 9 to the financial
statements for information on the restatement of the Company’s financial statements which resulted
from errors in the calculations of unbilled revenues.

New Accounting Standards

On March 31, 2004, the Company prospectively adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46R, “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities,” which requires the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity
to consolidate the related assets and liabilities. In January 2004, the Company redeemed all $40
million of its outstanding mandatorily redeemable preferred securities; thus the adoption of
Interpretation No. 46R did not have any impact on the Company’s financial statements.

In the third quarter 2004, the Company prospectively adopted FASB Staff Position (FSP)
106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act). The Medicare Act provides a 28
percent prescription drug subsidy for Medicare eligible retirees. FSP 106-2 requires
recognition of the impacts of the Medicare Act in the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation (APBO) and future cost of service for postretirement medical plans. The effect of
the subsidy reduced the Company’s expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2004 by
approximately $0.2 million and is expected to have a similar
impact on future years. The
subsidy’s impact on the postretirement medical plan APBO was a reduction of approximately $3.5
million. However, the ultimate impact on future periods is subject to final interpretation of
the federal regulations which were published on January 21, 2005. See Note 2 to the financial
statements under “Postretirement Benefits” for additional information.

FASB Statement No. 123R, Share-Based Payment was issued in December 2004. This statement
requires that compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions be recognized in
financial statements. That cost will be measured based on the grant date fair

II-281


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2004 Annual Report

value of the equity or liability instruments issued. For the Company, this statement is
effective beginning on July 1, 2005. Although the compensation expense required under the
revised statement differs slightly, the impacts on the Company’s financial statements are
expected to be similar to the pro forma disclosures included in Note 1 to the financial
statements under “Stock Options”.

See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “Income Tax Matters — American Jobs Creation Act of 2004”
herein for information regarding the adoption of new tax legislation. In December 2004, the FASB
issued FSP 109-1, Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax
Deduction on Qualified Production Activities provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004,
which requires that the generation deduction be accounted for as a special tax deduction rather
than as a tax rate reduction. The Company is currently assessing the Jobs Act and this
pronouncement, as well as the related regulatory treatment, but currently does not expect a
material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

As of December 31, 2004, the Company’s capital structure consisted of 45.2 percent common
stockholder’s equity, 8.6 percent preferred stock, and 46.2 percent long-term debt, excluding
amounts due within one year.

The principal change in the Company’s financial condition in 2004 was the addition of $126.1
million to utility plant, the majority of which was related to the purchase of the Plant McIntosh
Combined Cycle Units 10 and 11 construction project. The funds needed for gross property additions
are currently provided from operating activities, the issuance of securities, capital contributions
from Southern Company, and short-term debt. Net cash flow from operating activities decreased in
2004 primarily as a result of higher fuel costs. Those costs are recoverable in future periods and
are reflected in the balance sheets as under recovered regulatory clause revenues. See statements
of cash flows for additional information.

Sources of Capital

It is anticipated that the funds required for construction and other purposes, including compliance
with environmental regulations, will be derived from sources similar to those used in the past
including both internal and external funds. Historically, external funding came from the issuance
of debt, preferred securities, and capital contributions from Southern Company. Recently, the
Company’s debt financings have consisted of unsecured debt. The Company is required to meet
certain earnings coverage requirements specified in its mortgage indenture and corporate charter to
issue new first mortgage bonds and preferred stock. The Company’s coverage ratios are sufficiently
high to permit, at present interest rate levels, any foreseeable security sales. There are no
restrictions on the amount of unsecured indebtedness allowed. The amount of securities which the
Company will be permitted to issue in the future will depend upon market conditions and other
factors prevailing at that time. The issuance of securities by the Company is subject to
regulatory approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended (PUHCA), and the Georgia PSC. Additionally,
with respect to the public offering of securities, the Company must file registration statements
with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933 (the 1933 Act). The amounts of securities authorized
by the appropriate regulatory authorities, as well as the amounts registered under the 1933 Act,
are continuously monitored and appropriate filings are made to ensure flexibility in the capital
markets.

At the beginning of 2005, the Company had $80 million of unused short-term and revolving
credit arrangements with banks to meet its short-term cash needs and to provide additional
interim funding for the Company’s construction program. Of this amount, $70 million will expire
at various times in 2005 and $10 million will expire in 2007.
The Company expects to renew, as needed, its credit arrangements
prior to expiration. The Company also has adequate cash flow from
operating activities and access to the capital markets to meet liquidity needs. See Note 6 to
the financial statements under “Bank Credit Arrangements” for additional information.

The Company may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company subsidiary
organized to issue and sell commercial paper and extendible commercial notes at the request and for
the benefit of the Company and the other Southern Company retail operating companies. Proceeds
from such issuances for the benefit of the Company are loaned directly to the Company and are not
commingled with proceeds from

II-282


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2004 Annual Report

such issuances for the benefit of any other operating company. The obligations of each company
under these arrangements are several; there is no cross affiliate credit support. At December 31,
2004, the Company had outstanding $12.6 million in commercial paper and $8.0 million in extendible
commercial notes.

The Company’s committed credit arrangements provide liquidity support to the Company’s
variable rate obligations and to its commercial paper program. At December 31, 2004, the amount of
variable rate obligations outstanding requiring liquidity support was $7.2 million.

The Company obtains financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. The
Southern Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of
the Company are not commingled with funds of any other company. In accordance with the PUHCA, most
loans between affiliated companies must be approved in advance by the SEC.

Financing Activities

Maturities and redemptions of long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable preferred securities were
$70.0 million in 2004, $39.4 million in 2003, and $53.6 million in 2002.

In January 2004, the Company redeemed its $40 million Savannah Electric Capital Trust I 6.85%
Trust Preferred Securities. The Company issued, in June 2004, $45 million of 6.00% Series
Preferred Stock. In December 2004, the Company issued $35 million of Series G 5.75% Senior Notes
maturing in 2044. The Company received $31 million in May 2004 and $15 million in December 2004 in
capital contributions from Southern Company. The Company used the proceeds from the preferred
stock and senior notes sales and capital contributions to repay a portion of its outstanding
short-term indebtedness and to finance the purchase of the Plant McIntosh Combined Cycle
construction project.

Subsequent to December 31, 2004, the Company entered into a cash flow hedge with a notional
amount of $30 million, a fixed rate of 4.69 percent, and a final
maturity of 2016 for an anticipated security issuance in 2006.

Credit Rating Risk

The Company does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment
schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. The Company is party to
certain derivative agreements that could require collateral and/or accelerated payment in the event
of a credit rating change to below investment grade. These agreements are primarily for natural
gas price risk management activities. At December 31, 2004, the Company’s exposure related to
these agreements was not material.

Market Price Risk

Due to cost-based rate regulation, the Company has limited exposure to market volatility in
interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity. To manage the volatility
attributable to these exposures, the Company nets the exposures to take advantage of natural
offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to the
Company’s policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and risk management practices. Company
policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and mandates strict
adherence to all applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are monitored using
techniques including but not limited to market valuation, value at risk, stress testing, and
sensitivity analysis.

To mitigate exposure to interest rates, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps that
have been designated as cash flow hedges. The weighted average rate on variable rate long-term
debt outstanding that has not been hedged at January 1, 2005 was 2.31 percent. If the Company
sustained a 100 basis point change in interest rates for all unhedged variable rate long-term debt,
at January 1, 2005, the change would not materially affect annualized interest expense. The
Company continues to evaluate its options related to these securities, and may or may not enter
into additional hedging transactions in 2005. See Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements under
“Financial Instruments” for additional information.

To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the Company enters
into fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale
electricity market. In addition, the

II-283


Company has implemented a natural gas/oil hedging program ordered by the Georgia PSC. The program
has negative financial hedge limits. In terms of dollar amounts, negative financial hedging
positions, recoverable through the fuel clause, are limited to an above market cap equal to 10
percent of the Company’s annual natural gas/oil budget. These hedging position limits were $2.4
million for 2002, $1.1 million for 2003, and $2.7 million for 2004 and will be $5.1 million for
2005. The program has operated within the defined hedging position limits set for each year.

Unrealized gains and losses from mark to market adjustments on derivative contracts related to
the Company’s fuel hedging program are recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities. Realized
gains and losses from this program are included in fuel expense and recovered through the Company’s
FCR clause. Of the net gains, the Company is allowed to retain 25 percent in earnings. Gains and
losses on derivative contracts that are not designated as hedges are recognized in the statements
of income as incurred. These amounts were not material in any year presented. At December 31,

The Company is exposed to market price risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties
to the derivative energy contracts. The Company’s policy is to enter into agreements with
counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s or with
counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. Therefore, the
Company does not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the counterparties. See
Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements under “Financial Instruments” for additional information.

Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations

The Company’s construction program is currently estimated to be $52.4 million in 2005, $39.2
million in 2006, and $33.7 million in 2007. Environmental expenditures included in these amounts
are $1.4 million, $1.2 million, and $0.2 million for 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively. Actual
construction costs may vary from this estimate because of changes in such factors as: business
conditions; environmental regulations; FERC rules and transmission regulations; load projections;
the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; and the cost of capital.
In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully
recovered. The Company has new generating capacity scheduled to be placed in service in June 2005.
Construction of new transmission and distribution facilities and capital improvements for
generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, including those needed to meet the
environmental standards previously discussed, will be ongoing.

As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company provides postretirement
benefits to substantially all employees and funds trusts to the extent required by the Georgia PSC.

(a)

All amounts are reflected based on final maturity dates. The Company plans to continue to
retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market
conditions permit. Variable rate interest obligations are estimated based on rates as of
January 1, 2005, as reflected in the statements of capitalization.

(b)

Preferred stock does not mature; therefore, amounts are provided for the next five years
only.

(c)

The Company generally does not enter into non-cancelable commitments for other operation and
maintenance expenditures. Total other operation and maintenance expenses for the last three
years were $86.0 million, $83.6 million, and $81.0 million, respectively.

(d)

The Company forecasts capital expenditures over a three-year period. Amounts represent
current estimates of total expenditures. At December 31, 2004, significant purchase
commitments were outstanding in connection with the construction program.

(e)

Natural gas purchase commitments contain fixed volumes with prices based on various indices
at the time of delivery. Amounts reflected have been estimated based on the New York
Mercantile Exchange future prices at December 31, 2004.

(f)

The Company forecasts postretirement trust contributions over a three-year period. No
contributions related to the Company’s pension trust are currently expected during this
period. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information related to the
pension and postretirement plans, including estimated benefit payments. Certain benefit
payments will be made through the related trusts. Other benefit payments will be made from
the Company’s corporate assets.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information

The Company’s 2004
Annual Report contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking
statements include, among other things, statements concerning retail sales growth, environmental
regulations and expenditures, completion of construction projects, estimated construction and
other expenditures, and the Company’s projections for postretirement benefit trust
contributions. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such
as “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,”
“projects,” “predicts,” “potential,” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other
similar terminology. There are various factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements; accordingly, there can be no
assurance that such indicated results will be realized. These factors include:

The Company expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2004 Annual Report

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General

Savannah Electric and Power Company (the Company) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company,
which is the parent company of five retail operating companies, Southern Power Company (Southern
Power), Southern Company Services (SCS), Southern Communications Services (SouthernLINC Wireless),
Southern Company Gas (Southern Company GAS), Southern Company Holdings (Southern Holdings),
Southern Nuclear Operating Company (Southern Nuclear), Southern Telecom, and other direct and
indirect subsidiaries. The retail operating companies — Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power,
Mississippi Power, and the Company — provide electric service in four Southeastern states. The
Company operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electricity to retail customers
within its traditional service area of southeastern Georgia. Southern Power constructs, owns, and
manages Southern Company’s competitive generation assets and sells electricity at market-based
rates in the wholesale market. Contracts among the retail operating companies and Southern
Power—related to jointly owned generating facilities, interconnecting transmission lines, or the
exchange of electric power—are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and/or
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost,
specialized services to Southern Company and the subsidiary companies. SouthernLINC Wireless
provides digital wireless communications services to the retail operating companies and also
markets these services to the public within the Southeast. Southern Telecom provides fiber cable
services within the Southeast. Southern Company GAS is a competitive retail natural gas marketer
serving customers in Georgia. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding subsidiary for Southern
Company’s investments in synthetic fuels and leveraged leases and various other energy-related
businesses. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to Southern Company’s nuclear power
plants.

Southern Company is registered as a holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, as amended (PUHCA). Both Southern Company and its subsidiaries, including the
Company, are subject to the regulatory provisions of the PUHCA. The Company also is subject to
regulation by the FERC and the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC). The Company follows accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States and complies with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by
its regulatory commissions. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires the use of estimates, and the actual
results may differ from those estimates.

Certain prior years’ data presented in the financial statements has been reclassified to
conform with the current year presentation.

Affiliate Transactions

The Company has an agreement with SCS under which the following services are rendered to the
Company at direct or allocated cost: general and design engineering, purchasing, accounting and
statistical analysis, finance and treasury, tax, information resources, marketing, auditing,
insurance and employee benefits, human resources, systems and procedures, and other administrative
services with respect to business and operations and power pool operations. Costs for these
services amounted to $17.4 million, $16.3 million, and $15.6 million during 2004, 2003, and 2002,
respectively. Cost allocation methodologies used by SCS are approved by the SEC and management
believes they are reasonable.

The Company has entered into a purchased power agreement (PPA) with Southern Power for 200
megawatts of capacity from Plant Wansley Units 6 and 7 which began operation in June 2002.
Purchased power capacity and energy costs in 2004 amounted to $31.5 million. At December 31, 2004,
approximately $1.2 million in prepaid capacity expense related to this PPA was recorded in other
deferred charges and other assets in the balance sheets.

The Company operates an eight-unit combustion turbine site at its Plant McIntosh. Two of the
units are owned by the Company, and six of the units are owned by Georgia Power. Georgia Power
reimburses the Company for its proportionate share of the related expenses, which were $3.3 million
in 2004, $3.6 million in 2003, and $1.8 million in 2002. See Note 4 for additional information.

The Company and Georgia Power acquired, in 2004,

II-293


NOTES (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2004 Annual Report

the Plant McIntosh Combined Cycle Units 10
and 11 construction project. The units, scheduled to begin operation in June 2005, will be jointly
owned by the Company and Georgia Power. See Note 3 under “Plant
McIntosh Construction Project” and Notes 4 and 5 for
additional information.

Also, see Note 5 for information on certain deferred tax liabilities due to affiliates.

The retail operating companies, including the Company, Southern Power, and Southern Company
GAS may jointly enter into various types of wholesale energy, natural gas, and certain other
contracts, either directly or through SCS as agent. Each participating company may be jointly and
severally liable for the obligations incurred under these agreements. See Note 7 under “Fuel
Commitments” and “Purchased Power Commitments” for additional information.

Revenues

Revenues are recognized as services are rendered. Unbilled revenues are accrued at the end of each
fiscal period. Electric rates for the Company include provisions to adjust billings for
fluctuations in fuel costs, fuel hedging, the energy component of purchased power costs, and
certain other costs. Revenues are adjusted for differences between the actual recoverable costs
and amounts billed in current regulated rates.

The Company has a diversified base of customers. No single customer or industry comprises 10
percent or more of revenues. For all periods presented, uncollectible accounts averaged less than
1 percent of revenues.

Fuel Costs

Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is used. Fuel expense generally includes the cost of purchased
emission allowances as they are used.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

The Company is subject to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement
No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. Regulatory assets represent
probable future revenues to the Company associated with certain costs that are expected to be
recovered from customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent probable
future reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be credited to customers through
the ratemaking process.

Regulatory assets and (liabilities) reflected in the balance sheets at December 31 and the

Note: The recovery and amortization periods for these regulatory assets and (liabilities) are
as follows:

In the event that a portion of the Company’s operations is no longer subject to the
provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, the Company would be required to

II-294


NOTES (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2004 Annual Report

write off related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable through
regulated rates. In addition, the Company would be required to determine if any impairment to
other assets exists, including plant, and write down the assets, if impaired, to their fair value.
All regulatory assets and liabilities are currently reflected in rates.

Income Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provides deferred
income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences. Federal investment tax credits
utilized are deferred and amortized to income over the average life of the related property.

Manufacturer’s Tax Credits

The State of Georgia provides a tax credit for qualified investment property to manufacturing
companies that construct new facilities. The credit ranges from 1 percent to 5 percent of
construction expenditures depending upon the county in which the new facility is located. The
Company’s policy is to recognize these credits when the tax return is filed. Manufacturer’s tax
credits recorded on the Company’s books were $0.2 million in 2004, $0.1 million in 2003, and $0.3
million in 2002.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation of the original cost of plant in service is provided primarily by using composite
straight-line rates, which approximated 2.8 percent in 2004, 2.9 percent in 2003, and 2.9 percent
in 2002. When property subject to depreciation is retired or otherwise disposed of in the normal
course of business, its cost—together with the cost of removal, less salvage—is charged to
accumulated depreciation. Minor items of property included in the original cost of the plant are
retired when the related property unit is retired. Depreciation expense includes an amount for the
expected cost of removal of certain facilities.

In 2002, the Company recorded accelerated depreciation of $1.0 million, in accordance with a
1998 Georgia PSC accounting order. In the 2002 rate order, the Georgia PSC ordered the Company to
amortize the balance of accelerated cost recovery as a credit to depreciation expense over a three
year period beginning June 2002. Accordingly, in 2004, 2003, and 2002, the Company amortized $3.0
million, $3.0 million, and $1.8 million, respectively. See Note 3 under “Retail Regulatory Matters
– 2002 Retail Rate Case Orders” for additional information.

Asset Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of Removal

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations. Statement No. 143 established new accounting and reporting standards for
legal obligations associated with the ultimate costs of retiring long-lived assets. The present
value of the ultimate costs for an asset’s future retirement is recorded in the period in which the
liability is incurred. The costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and
depreciated over the asset’s useful life. Although Statement No. 143 does not permit the continued
accrual of future retirement costs for long-lived assets that the Company does not have a legal
obligation to retire, the Company has received guidance from the Georgia PSC allowing such
treatment. Accordingly, the accumulated removal costs for other obligations previously accrued
will continue to be reflected on the balance sheets as a regulatory liability. Therefore, the
Company had no cumulative effect to net income resulting from the adoption of Statement No. 143.

The Company has retirement obligations related to various landfill sites, ash ponds, a
rail line, and underground storage tanks. The Company has also identified retirement obligations
related to certain transmission and distribution facilities. However, liabilities for the removal
of these transmission and distribution assets have not been recorded because no reasonable estimate
can be made regarding the timing of the obligations. The Company will continue to recognize in
statements of income allowed removal costs in accordance with its regulatory treatment. Any
difference between costs recognized under Statement No. 143 and those reflected in rates are
recognized as either a regulatory asset or liability and are reflected in the balance sheets.

Allowance for Funds
Used During Construction (AFUDC)

In accordance with regulatory treatment, the Company records AFUDC. AFUDC represents the estimated
debt and equity costs of capital funds that are necessary to finance the construction of new
regulated facilities. While cash is not realized currently from such allowance, it increases the
revenue requirement over the service life of the plant through a higher rate base and higher
depreciation expense. The average rates used by the Company to calculate AFUDC were 6.11 percent
in 2004, 4.22 percent in 2003, and 2.82 percent in 2002. AFUDC as a percent of net income was 13.5
percent in 2004, 1.4 percent in 2003, and 0.5 percent in 2002.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost less regulatory disallowances and
impairments. Original cost includes: materials; labor; minor items of property; appropriate
administrative and general costs; payroll-related costs such as taxes, pensions, and other
benefits, and AFUDC. The cost of replacements of property — exclusive of minor items of property
— is capitalized. The cost of maintenance, repairs, and replacement of minor items of property is
charged to maintenance expense. In accordance with the 2002 rate order, the Company is
deferring the costs of certain significant inspection costs for the combustion turbines at Plant
McIntosh and amortizing such costs over 10 years, which approximates the expected maintenance
cycle.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles

The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of
whether an impairment has occurred is based on either a specific regulatory disallowance or an
estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared with the
carrying value of the assets. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment
recognized is determined by either the amount of regulatory disallowance or by estimating the fair
value of the assets and recording a provision for loss if the carrying value is greater than the
fair value. For assets identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the
estimated fair value less the cost to sell in order to determine if an impairment provision is
required. Until the assets are disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when
circumstances or events change. See Note 3 under “Plant McIntosh Construction Project” for
information on a regulatory disallowance by the Georgia PSC in December 2004.

Storm Damage Reserve

The Company maintains a storm damage reserve for property damage to cover the cost of uninsured
damages from major storms to transmission and distribution lines and other property. Under the
2002 rate order, the Company’s annual storm damage accrual level was set at $1.5 million.

Environmental Cost Recovery

The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling
and disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and
regulations, the Company may also incur substantial costs to clean up properties. The Company
currently recovers environmental costs through its base rates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are considered cash
equivalents. Temporary cash investments are securities with original maturities of 90 days or
less.

Materials and Supplies

Generally, materials and
supplies include the average costs of transmission, distribution, and
generating plant materials. Materials are charged to inventory when purchased and then expensed or
capitalized to plant, as
appropriate, when installed.

Stock Options

Southern Company provides non-qualified stock options to a large segment of the Company’s employees
ranging from line management to executives. The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation
plans in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25. Accordingly, no compensation
expense has been recognized because the exercise price of all options granted equaled the
fair-market value of Southern Company stock on the date of grant. When options are exercised the Company receives a capital
contribution from Southern Company equivalent to the related income tax benefit.

Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to fluctuations in interest
rates, the prices of certain fuel purchases, and electricity purchases and sales. All derivative
financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair
value. Substantially all of the Company’s bulk energy purchases and sales contracts that meet the
definition of a derivative are exempt from fair value accounting requirements and are accounted for
under the accrual method. Other derivative contracts qualify as cash flow hedges of anticipated
transactions. This results in the deferral of related gains and losses in other comprehensive
income or regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate until the hedged transactions occur. Any
ineffectiveness is recognized currently in net income. Other derivative contracts are marked to
market through current period income and are recorded on a net basis in the statements of income.

The Company is exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of
counterparties’ nonperformance. The Company has established controls to determine and monitor the
creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate the Company’s exposure to counterparty
credit risk.

The Company has implemented a natural gas/oil hedging program as ordered by the Georgia PSC.
The program has negative financial hedge limits. In terms of dollar amounts, negative financial
hedging positions, recoverable through the fuel clause, are limited to an above market cap equal to
10 percent of the Company’s annual natural gas/oil budget. These hedging position limits were $2.4
million for 2002, $1.1 million for 2003, and $2.7 million for 2004 and will be $5.1 million for
2005. The program has operated within the defined hedging position limits set for each year.

The Company’s other financial instruments for which the carrying amount does not equal fair
value at December 31 were as follows:

Comprehensive Income

The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of all changes in common stock equity
of an enterprise that result from transactions and other economic events of the period other than
transactions

II-297


NOTES (continued)

with owners. Comprehensive income consists of net income, changes in the fair value of qualifying
cash flow hedges and marketable securities, and changes in additional minimum pension liability,
net of income taxes.

2. RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company has a defined
benefit, trusteed pension plan covering substantially all employees.
The plan is funded in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), requirements. No contributions to the plan are expected
for the year ending December 31, 2005. The Company also provides certain non-qualified benefit
plans for a selected group of management and highly compensated employees and directors. Benefits
under these non-qualified plans are funded on a cash basis. In addition, the Company has a
supplemental retirement plan for certain executive employees. The plan is unfunded and payable
from the general funds of the Company. The Company has purchased life insurance on participating
executives and plans to use these policies to satisfy this obligation. Also, the Company provides
certain medical care and life insurance benefits for retired employees. The Company funds trusts
to the extent required by the Georgia PSC and the FERC. For the year ended December 31, 2005,
postretirement trust contributions are expected to total approximately $1.2 million.

The measurement date for plan assets and obligations is September 30 for each year.

Pension Plans

The accumulated benefit obligation for the pension plans was $95.5 million in 2004 and $87.2
million in 2003. Changes during the year in the projected benefit obligations, accumulated benefit
obligations, and fair value of plan assets were as follows:

Pension plan assets are managed and invested in accordance with all applicable requirements,
including ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Internal Revenue Code). The
Company’s investment policy covers a diversified mix of assets, including equity and fixed income
securities, real estate, and private equity, as described in the table below. Derivative
instruments are used primarily as hedging tools but may also be used to gain efficient exposure to
the various asset classes. The Company primarily minimizes the risk of large losses through
diversification but also monitors and manages other aspects of risk.

In the third quarter 2004, the Company prospectively adopted FASB Staff Position (FSP) 106-2,
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and
Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act). The Medicare Act provides a 28 percent prescription drug
subsidy for Medicare eligible retirees. FSP 106-2 requires recognition of the impacts of the
Medicare Act in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) and future cost of service
for postretirement medical plans. The effect of the subsidy reduced the Company’s expenses for the
six months ended December 31, 2004 by approximately $0.2 million and is expected to have a similar
impact on future expenses. The subsidy’s impact on the postretirement medical plan APBO was a
reduction of approximately $3.5 million.

Future benefit payments, including prescription drug benefits, reflect expected future service
and are estimated based on assumptions used to measure the accumulated benefit obligation for the
postretirement plans. Estimated benefit payments are reduced by drug subsidy receipts expected as
a result of the Medicare Act as follows:

An additional assumption used in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation
was a weighted average medical care cost trend rate of 11.00 percent for 2004, decreasing gradually
to 5.00 percent through the year 2012, and remaining at that level thereafter.

The Company provides a 75 percent matching contribution up to 6 percent of an employee’s base
salary. Total matching contributions made to the plan for 2004, 2003, and 2002 were $1.1 million,
$1.1 million, and $1.0 million, respectively.

3. CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY MATTERS

General Litigation Matters

The Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of
business. In addition, the Company’s business activities are subject to extensive governmental
regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation over environmental issues and
claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, and citizen enforcement of
environmental requirements, has increased generally throughout the United States. In particular,
personal injury claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become
more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such litigation against the Company cannot be predicted at
this time; however, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such
current proceedings would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements.

New Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil action in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against Alabama Power and Georgia Power,
alleging violations of the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act and related
state laws at five coal-fired generating facilities. The EPA concurrently issued a notice of
violation to the Company’s Plant Kraft. In early 2000, the EPA filed a motion to amend its
complaint to add the Company as a defendant.

The
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia subsequently granted Alabama Power’s motion to dismiss and
denied the EPA’s motion to add Gulf Power and Mississippi Power for lack of jurisdiction in
Georgia. In March 2001, the court granted the EPA’s motion to add the Company as a defendant. As
directed by the court, the EPA refiled its amended complaint limiting claims to those brought
against Georgia Power and the Company. In addition, the EPA refiled its claims against Alabama
Power in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. These civil complaints
allege violations with respect to eight coal-fired generating facilities in Alabama and Georgia,
and they request penalties and injunctive relief, including an order requiring the installation of
the best available control technology at the affected units. The EPA has not refiled against Gulf
Power or Mississippi Power.

The actions against Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and the Company were effectively stayed in
the spring of 2001 during the appeal of a similar NSR enforcement action against the Tennessee
Valley Authority (TVA) before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. In June 2003,
the Court of Appeals issued its ruling in the TVA case, dismissing the appeal for reasons unrelated
to the issues in the cases pending against Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and the Company. In May
2004, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the EPA’s petition for
review of the case. In June 2004, the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama lifted the stay in the action against
Alabama Power, placing the case back onto the court’s active docket. At this time, no party to the
case against Georgia Power and the Company has sought to reopen that case, which remains
administratively closed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.

Since the inception of the NSR proceedings against Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and the
Company, the EPA has also been proceeding with similar NSR enforcement actions against other
utilities, involving many of the same legal issues. In each case, the EPA alleged that the
utilities failed to comply with the NSR permitting requirements when performing maintenance and
construction activities at coal-burning plants, which

II-301


NOTES (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2004 Annual Report

activities the utilities considered to be routine or otherwise not subject to NSR. District courts
addressing these cases have, to date, issued opinions that reached conflicting conclusions.

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA’s regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act
authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $32,500 per day, per violation at each generating
unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in this matter could
require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly
require payment of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of operations, cash
flows, and possibly financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

In December 2002 and October 2003, the EPA issued final revisions to its NSR regulations under
the Clean Air Act. The December 2002 revisions included changes to the regulatory exclusions and
the methods of calculating emissions increases. The October 2003 regulations clarified the scope
of the existing Routine Maintenance, Repair, and Replacement (RMRR) exclusion. A coalition of
states and environmental organizations has filed petitions for review of these revisions with the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The October 2003 RMRR rules have been
stayed by the Court of Appeals pending its review of the rules. In any event, the final
regulations must be adopted by the State of Georgia in order to apply to the Company’s facilities.
The effect of these final regulations, related legal challenges and potential state rulemakings
cannot be determined at this time.

Generation Interconnection Agreements

In July 2003, the FERC issued its final rule on the standardization of generation interconnection
agreements and procedures (Order 2003). Order 2003 shifts much of the financial burden of new
transmission investment from the generator to the transmission provider. The FERC has indicated
that Order 2003, which was effective January 20, 2004, is to be applied prospectively to
interconnection agreements. The impact of Order 2003 and its subsequent rehearings on the Company
and the final results of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Market-Based Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates at market-based prices.
Through SCS as agent, the Company also has FERC authority to make short-term opportunity sales at
market rates. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a market-based contract with
an affiliate. In November 2001, the FERC modified the test it uses to consider utilities’
applications to charge market-based rates and adopted a new test called the Supply Margin
Assessment (SMA). The FERC applied the SMA to several utilities,
including Southern Company, the retail operating companies, and
Southern Power, and found Southern Company and others to be “pivotal suppliers” in their
retail service territories and ordered the implementation of several mitigation measures. Southern
Company and others sought rehearing of the FERC order, and the FERC delayed the implementation of certain
mitigation measures. In April 2004, the FERC issued an order that abandoned the SMA test and
adopted a new interim analysis for measuring generation market power. This new interim approach
requires utilities to submit a pivotal supplier screen and a wholesale market share screen. If the
applicant does not pass both screens, there will be a rebuttable presumption regarding generation
market power. The FERC’s order also sets forth procedures for rebutting these presumptions and
addresses mitigation measures for those entities that are found to have market power. In the
absence of specific mitigation measures, the order includes several cost-based mitigation measures
that would apply by default. The FERC also initiated a new rulemaking proceeding that, among other
things, will adopt a final methodology for assessing generation market power.

In July 2004, the FERC denied Southern Company’s request for rehearing, along with a number
of others, and reaffirmed the interim tests that it adopted in April 2004. In August 2004, Southern
Company submitted a filing to the FERC that included results showing that Southern Company
passed the pivotal supplier screen for all markets and the wholesale market share screen for all
markets except the Southern Company retail service territory. Southern Company also submitted
other analyses to demonstrate that it lacks generation market power. On December 17, 2004, the
FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation dominance within its retail
service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other markets is not at issue.
As directed by this order, Southern Company submitted additional information on February 15,
2005 related to generation

dominance in the Southern Company retail service territory. Any new market based rate
transactions in the Southern Company retail service territory entered into after February 27,
2005 will be subject to refund to the level of the default cost-based rates, pending the outcome
of the proceeding. Southern Company, along with other utilities, has also filed an appeal of
the FERC’s April and July 2004 orders with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit. The FERC has asked the court to dismiss the appeal on the grounds that it is
premature.

In the event that the FERC’s default mitigation measures are ultimately applied, the
Company may be required to charge cost-based rates for certain
wholesale sales in the Southern Company retail service
territory, which may be lower than negotiated market-based rates. The final outcome of this
matter will depend on the form in which the final methodology for assessing generation market
power and mitigation rules may be ultimately adopted and cannot be determined at this time.

Right of Way Litigation

In late 2001, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company, including Alabama Power, Georgia Power,
Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, the Company, and Southern Telecom,
were named as defendants in a lawsuit brought by a telecommunications company that uses certain
of the defendants’ rights of way. This lawsuit alleges, among other things, that the defendants
are contractually obligated to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the telecommunications
company from any liability that may be assessed against it in pending and future right of way
litigation. The Company believes that the plaintiff’s claims are without merit. In the fall
of 2004, the trial court stayed the case until resolution of an underlying landowner litigation
involving Southern Company and certain of its subsidiaries. On January 12, 2005, the Georgia
Court of Appeals dismissed the telecommunications company’s appeal of the trial court’s order
for lack of jurisdiction. An adverse outcome in this case could result in a substantial
judgment; however, the final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Retail Regulatory Matters

Fuel Cost Recovery

On October 25, 2004, the Georgia PSC approved the Company’s request for a fuel cost recovery rate
increase. The approved increase will allow for the recovery of approximately $161 million in fuel
costs, which includes an estimate of future fuel costs over the next 12 months and recovery of the
existing under recovered fuel balance, over the next 24 months. The approved fuel rate increase
also includes the recovery of approximately $3.5 million in costs associated with a coal
transloader to be amortized over a 21-month period, which the Georgia PSC had denied in June 2004.
The transloader allows foreign coal to be off-loaded from ships at the Company’s Plant Kraft dock
and then transferred by rail to Plant McIntosh. The new rates became effective in November 2004.
At December
31, 2004, the Company had $23.8 million included in under recovered regulatory clause revenues on
the balance sheet.

2004 Retail Rate Case Filing

On November 30, 2004, the Company filed a traditional one-year rate case with the Georgia PSC
requesting a $23.2 million, or 6.7 percent, increase in retail revenues, effective January 1, 2005.
The requested increase is based on a future test year ending December 31, 2005 and a proposed
retail return on common equity of 12.5 percent. As an alternative, the Company has also included
in its request a three-year rate plan that is based on the same test year and proposed retail
return on common equity.

The increase in retail revenues is being requested to cover the Company’s investment in the
new Plant McIntosh Combined Cycle Units 10 and 11; increasing operating and maintenance expenses;
and continued investment in generation, transmission, and distribution facilities to support growth
and ensure reliability. The increase also includes recognition on an annual basis of the $3.8
million of Plant Wansley purchased power expenses which were excluded by the Georgia PSC from the
Company’s last rate case and subsequently were subject to deferral through a Georgia PSC accounting
order issued in December 2002.

The Company expects the Georgia PSC to issue a final order in this matter during May 2005.
The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

II-303


NOTES (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2004 Annual Report

2002 Retail Rate Case Orders

In May 2002, the Georgia PSC approved a $7.8 million base rate increase and an authorized return on
equity of 12 percent as a result of the Company’s request to recover significant new expenses
related to the Plant Wansley PPA which began in June 2002, as well as other operation and
maintenance expense changes. In December 2002, at the Company’s request, the Georgia PSC issued an
accounting order authorizing the Company to defer until May 2005 approximately $3.8 million
annually in Plant Wansley purchased power costs that the Georgia PSC had ruled to be outside the
test period for the base rate order. Under the terms of the order, two-thirds of any earnings of
the Company in a calendar year above a 12 percent return on common equity will be used to amortize
the deferred amounts to purchase power expense. The remaining one-third of any such earnings can
be retained by the Company. The Company also has the discretionary authority to amortize up to an
additional $1.5 million annually. In January 2003, the Company began deferring the costs under the
terms of the accounting order. Through December 2004, the Company had amortized all of the
deferred purchased power costs.

Under the 2002 rate order, the Georgia PSC also ordered the Company to amortize approximately
$9 million of accelerated depreciation and amortization previously recorded equally over three
years as a credit to expense beginning June 1, 2002.

Plant McIntosh Construction Project

In December 2002, after a competitive bidding process, the Georgia PSC certified PPAs between
Southern Power and Georgia Power and the Company for capacity from Plant McIntosh Combined Cycle
Units 10 and 11, construction of which is scheduled to be completed in June 2005. In April
2003, Southern Power applied for FERC approval of these PPAs. In July 2003, the FERC accepted
the PPAs to become effective June 1, 2005, subject to refund, and ordered that hearings be held.
Intervenors opposed the FERC’s acceptance of the PPAs, alleging that they did not meet
applicable standards for market-based rates between affiliates. To ensure the timely completion
of the Plant McIntosh construction project and the availability of the units in the summer of
2005 for their retail customers, the Company and Georgia Power in May 2004 requested the Georgia
PSC to direct them to acquire the Plant McIntosh construction project. The Georgia PSC issued
such an order and the transfer occurred on May 24, 2004 at a total cost of approximately $415
million, including $14 million of transmission interconnection facilities. Subsequently,
Southern Power filed a request to withdraw the PPAs and to terminate the ongoing FERC
proceedings. In August 2004, the FERC issued a notice accepting the request to withdraw the
PPAs and permitting such request to become effective by operation of law. However, the FERC
made no determination on what additional steps may need to be taken with respect to testimony
provided in the proceedings. The ultimate outcome of any additional FERC action cannot now be
determined.

As directed by the Georgia PSC order, Georgia Power and the Company in June 2004 filed an
application to amend the resource certificate granted by the Georgia PSC in 2002. In connection
with the Georgia Power 2004 retail rate case, the Georgia PSC approved the transfer of the Plant
McIntosh construction project, at a total fair market value of approximately $385 million. This
value reflects an approximate $16 million disallowance. Savannah Electric owns 16.129 percent
of the project; thus, this disallowance amounted to approximately $3 million and reduced the
Company’s net income by approximately $1.5 million. The Georgia PSC also certified a total
completion cost of $547 million for the project. The amount of the disallowance will be
adjusted accordingly based on the actual completion cost of the project. The Georgia PSC will
determine the rate treatment of Plant McIntosh in connection with its decision on the Company’s
2004 retail rate case filing discussed above. The final outcome of
this matter cannot now be determined.

4. JOINT OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS

The Company operates and jointly owns its Plant McIntosh combustion turbines with Georgia Power.
Two of the eight units, totaling 160 megawatts of capacity, are owned by the Company, and six
units, totaling 480 megawatts of capacity, are owned by Georgia Power. The Company’s amount of
investment in Plant McIntosh combustion turbines and related accumulated depreciation at December
31, 2004 were $52 million and $13 million, respectively. The Company’s proportionate share of its
combustion turbine plant operating expenses is included in the corresponding operating expenses in
the statements of income.

II-304


NOTES (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2004 Annual Report

In addition, the Company and Georgia Power acquired the Plant McIntosh Combined Cycle Units 10
and 11 construction project in 2004. The units, which will have a total capacity of 1,240
megawatts, scheduled to begin operation in June 2005, will be jointly owned by the Company and
Georgia Power. The Company’s investment in Plant McIntosh Units 10 and 11 at December 31, 2004 was
$78.4 million.

5. INCOME TAXES

Southern Company and its
subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return and a combined State of Georgia
income tax return. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement, as required by the
PUHCA, each subsidiary’s current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis and no
subsidiary is allocated more expense than would be paid if they filed a separate tax return. In
accordance with Internal Revenue Service regulations, each company is jointly and severally
liable for the tax liability.

In 2004, in order to avoid the loss of certain federal income tax credits related to the
production of synthetic fuel, Southern Company chose to defer certain deductions otherwise
available to the subsidiaries. The cash flow benefit associated with the utilization of the tax
credits was allocated to the subsidiary that otherwise would have claimed the available deductions
on a separate company basis without the deferral. This allocation concurrently reduced the tax
benefit of the credits allocated to those subsidiaries that generated the credits. As the deferred
expenses are deducted, the benefit of the tax credits will be repaid to the subsidiaries that
generated the tax credits. The Company has recorded $1.5 million payable to these subsidiaries in
“Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes” on the accompanying December 31, 2004 balance sheet.

The transfer of the Plant McIntosh construction project from Southern Power to the Company
resulted in a deferred gain to Southern Power for federal income tax purposes. The Company will
reimburse Southern Power for $1.0 million of this deferred tax liability as it is reflected in
Southern Power’s future taxable income. The payable to Southern Power is included in Other Deferred
Credits on the Company’s balance sheet at December 31, 2004.

At December 31, 2004, tax-related regulatory assets and liabilities were $10.6 million and
$8.7 million, respectively. These assets are attributable to tax benefits flowed through to
customers in prior years and to taxes applicable to capitalized interest. These liabilities are
attributable to deferred taxes previously recognized at rates higher than the current enacted tax
law and to unamortized investment tax credits.

Long-Term Debt and Capital Leases

The Company’s indenture related to its first mortgage bonds is unlimited as to the authorized
amount of bonds which may be issued, provided that required property additions, earnings, and other
provisions of such indenture are met.

Assets acquired under capital leases are recorded as utility plant in service, and the related
obligation is classified as other long-term debt. Leases are capitalized at the net present value
of the future lease payments. However, for ratemaking purposes, these obligations are treated as
operating leases and, as such, lease payments are charged to expense as incurred.

Long-Term Debt Due Within One Year

The first mortgage bond improvement (sinking) fund requirements amount to 1 percent of
each outstanding series of bonds authenticated under the first mortgage bond indenture prior to
January 1 of each year, other than those issued to collateralize pollution control and other
obligations. The requirements may be satisfied by depositing cash or reacquiring bonds, or by
pledging additional property equal to 1 2/3 times the requirements.

The sinking fund requirements of first mortgage bonds were satisfied by certifying property
additions in 2003 and 2004. The 2005 requirement will be satisfied by certifying property
additions. Sinking fund requirements and/or maturities through 2009 applicable to long-term debt
are as follows: $1.0 million in 2005; $21.0 million in 2006; $0.9 million in 2007; $46.0 million
in 2008; and $0.8 million in 2009.

Assets Subject to Lien

As amended and supplemented, the Company’s first mortgage bond indenture, which secures the first
mortgage bonds issued by the Company, constitutes a direct first lien on substantially all of the
Company’s fixed property and franchises.

Bank Credit Arrangements

At the beginning of 2005, credit arrangements with banks totaled $80 million, of which $70 million
expires at various times in 2005 and the remaining $10 million expires in 2007. Of the facilities that expire in
2005, $40 million contain two-year term out provisions and the $10 million facility that expires
in 2007 contains a three-year term out provision. In September 2002, the Company borrowed $25
million under a $30 million variable rate revolving credit agreement that terminates in 2005. Of
this amount, $5 million was repaid in December 2003, $10 million was borrowed under the agreement
in May 2004, and the full $30 million was repaid in December 2004.

In connection with these credit arrangements, the Company agrees to pay commitment fees based
on the unused portions of the commitments. Commitment fees are less than one-eighth of 1 percent
for the Company.

The credit arrangements contain covenants that limit the level of indebtedness to
capitalization to 65 percent, as defined in the arrangements. Exceeding these debt levels would
result in a default under the credit arrangements. In addition, the credit arrangements contain
cross default provisions that would be triggered if the Company defaulted on indebtedness over a
specified threshold. The cross default provisions are restricted only to indebtedness of the
Company. The Company is currently

II-306


NOTES (continued)

Savannah Electric and Power Company 2004 Annual Report

in compliance with all such covenants. Borrowings under unused credit arrangements totaling $30
million would be prohibited if the Company experiences a material adverse change (as defined in
such arrangements).

The Company may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company subsidiary
organized to issue and sell commercial paper and extendible commercial notes at the request and for
the benefit of the Company and the other Southern Company retail operating companies. Proceeds
from such issuances for the benefit of the Company are loaned directly to the Company and are not
commingled with proceeds from such issuances for the benefit of any other retail operating company.
The obligations of each company under these arrangements are several; there is no cross affiliate
credit support. At December 31, 2004, the Company had $12.6 million in commercial paper and $8.0
million in extendible commercial notes outstanding. During 2004, the peak amount of commercial
paper outstanding was $29.1 million and the average amount outstanding was $8.4 million. The
average annual interest rate on commercial paper was 1.51 percent.

The Company’s committed credit arrangements provide liquidity support to the Company’s
variable rate obligations and to its commercial paper program. At December 31, 2004, the amount of
variable rate obligations outstanding requiring liquidity support was $7.2 million.

Financial Instruments

The Company enters into energy related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, gas, and
other fuel price changes. However, due to cost-based rate regulations, the Company has limited
exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity. The Company has
implemented fuel-hedging programs at the direction of the Georgia PSC. The Company also enters
into hedges of forward electricity sales. There was no material ineffectiveness recorded in
earnings in 2004 and 2003.

At December 31, 2004, the fair value of derivative energy contracts was reflected in the
financial statements as follows:

The fair value gains or losses for cash flow hedges that are recoverable through the
regulatory fuel clauses are recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities and are recognized in

in place up to and including 2007.

The Company enters into derivatives to hedge exposure to interest rate changes. Derivatives
related to variable rate securities or forecasted transactions are accounted for as cash flow
hedges. The derivatives are generally structured to match the critical terms of the hedged debt
instruments; therefore, no material ineffectiveness has been recorded in earnings.

At December 31, 2004, the Company had $14.0 million notional amount of interest rate swaps
outstanding with net fair value gains of $0.1 million as follows:

2004, approximately $0.1 million of pre-tax losses were reclassified from other comprehensive
income to interest expense. For 2003, the amount reclassified was not material. For 2005, pre-tax
losses of approximately $0.1 million are expected to be reclassified from other comprehensive
income to interest

expense. The Company has interest-related hedges in
place up to and including 2007, and additionally has losses that are being amortized up to and
including 2014.

Common Stock Dividend Restrictions

The Company’s first mortgage bond indenture contains certain limitations on the payment of cash
dividends on common stock. At December 31, 2004, approximately $68 million of retained earnings
was restricted against the payment of cash dividends on common stock under the terms of the
Indenture.

In accordance with the PUHCA, the Company is restricted from paying common dividends from
paid-in capital without SEC approval.

7. COMMITMENTS

Construction Program

The Company is engaged in a continuous construction program, currently estimated to total $52.4
million in 2005, $39.2 million in 2006, and $33.7 million in 2007. The construction program is
subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from the above
estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions;
acquisition of additional generating assets; revised load growth estimates; changes in
environmental regulations; changes in FERC rules and transmission regulations; increasing costs of
labor, equipment, and materials; and cost of capital. Units 10 and 11 at Plant McIntosh, being
constructed and to be owned jointly with Georgia Power, are scheduled to be placed in service in
June 2005. Construction related to new transmission and distribution facilities and capital
improvements to existing generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, including those
necessary to meet environmental standards, will continue. At December 31, 2004, significant
purchase commitments were outstanding in connection with the construction program.

Long-Term Service Agreement

The Company and Georgia Power have entered into a Long-Term Service Agreement (LTSA) with General
Electric (GE) for the purpose of securing maintenance support for the combustion turbines at the
Plant McIntosh combined cycle facility. In summary, the LTSA stipulates that GE will perform all
planned inspections on the covered equipment, which includes the cost of all labor and materials.
GE is also obligated to cover the costs of unplanned maintenance on the covered equipment subject
to a limit specified in the contract.

In general this LTSA is in effect through two major inspection cycles per unit. Scheduled
payments to GE are made at various intervals based on actual operating hours of the respective
units. Total payments by the Company to GE under this agreement are currently estimated at $35
million over the remaining life of the agreement, which may range up to 30 years. However, the
LTSA contains various cancellation provisions at the option of the Company and Georgia Power.

Fuel Commitments

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of its generating plants, the Company has entered into
long-term commitments for the procurement of fuel. In most cases, these contracts contain
provisions for price escalations, minimum purchase levels, and other financial commitments. Coal
commitments include forward contract purchases for nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emission
allowances. In addition, SCS acts as agent for the Company, the other retail operating companies,
Southern Power, and Southern Company GAS with regard to natural gas purchases. Natural gas
purchase commitments contain given volumes with prices based on various indices at the time of
delivery. Amounts included in the chart below represent estimates based on New York Mercantile
Exchange future prices at December 31, 2004.

Power, and Southern Company GAS. Under these agreements, each of the retail operating companies,
Southern Power, and Southern Company GAS may be jointly and severally liable. The creditworthiness
of Southern Power and Southern Company GAS is currently inferior to the creditworthiness of the
retail operating companies. Accordingly, Southern Company has entered into keep-well agreements
with the Company and each of the retail operating companies to insure they will not subsidize or be
responsible for any costs, losses, liabilities, or damages resulting from the inclusion of Southern
Power or Southern Company GAS as a contracting party under these agreements.

Southern Company provides non-qualified stock options to a large segment of the Company’s
employees ranging from line management to executives. As of December 31, 2004, 93 current and
former employees of the Company participated in the stock option plan. The maximum number of
shares of Southern Company common stock that may be issued under this plan may not exceed 55
million. The prices of options granted to date have been at the fair market value of the shares on

9. RESTATEMENT

These financial statements have been restated to reflect adjustments to the Company’s financial
information previously reported on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. The
restatement also affects periods prior to 2002. The restatements arose as a result of
errors in the Company’s estimates of unbilled revenues in these prior periods. Unbilled
revenues represent an estimate of the kilowatt-hour (KWH) sales of electricity delivered to customers, but not yet
billed. Components of the unbilled revenue estimates include total KWH territorial supply, total
KWH billed, total electricity lost in delivery (line losses), and customer usage. These components
are affected by a number of factors including weather, generation patterns, power
delivery volume, and other operational constraints.

The errors in the Company’s estimates were identified through comparisons of the Company’s
unbilled revenue account balance at December 31, 2004 to the
billed KWH sales recorded in
January 2005 made in connection with the Company’s 2004 audit. The Company analyzed the unbilled
revenue calculations for the years 1999 through 2004 to determine the timing and source of the
errors, which primarily related to the estimates of line losses. For years through 2002, line
losses were understated and total unbilled revenues were overstated. However, in 2003, the Company
revised its methodology of estimating line losses, which had the effect of overstating the line
losses, and, thus, understating total unbilled revenues during 2003. Since the Company’s
calculation of unbilled revenues utilized a net change methodology, the cumulative effect of each
of these errors was carried forward. The effect of these errors increased (reduced) the Company’s
earnings before income taxes by $1.1 million ($0.7 million after tax) and ($2.5) million (($1.6)
million after tax) for the years ended December 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively. The cumulative impact related to years
prior to 2002 was a decrease in retained earnings of $2.3 million at January 1, 2002.

Management and the Company’s external auditors discussed these adjustments with the Audit
Committee of Southern Company’s Board of Directors on February 24, 2005. The restated financial
statements have been prepared by management and reflect all related adjustments known to management.
Management has also revised its process of estimating unbilled revenues to utilize a gross
change methodology that reverses each period’s estimate in total
in the following period.

These restatement adjustments affect the Company’s previously issued statements of income,
comprehensive income, and common stockholder’s equity for the years ended December 31, 2003 and
2002 and the Company’s balance sheet at December 31, 2003.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Southern Power Company:

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Southern Power Company (a wholly owned
subsidiary of Southern Company) as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related statements of
income, comprehensive income, common stockholder’s equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2004. These financial statements are the responsibility of
Southern Power Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a
basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements (pages II-330 to II-343) present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Southern Power Company at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Southern Power Company 2004 Annual Report

OVERVIEW

Business Activities

Southern Power Company (Company) constructs, owns and manages Southern Company’s competitive
generation assets and sells electricity at market-based rates in the Super-Southeast wholesale
market. The Company focused on executing its regional strategy in 2004 by signing several
wholesale contracts with major utilities, as well as electric cooperatives and municipal
suppliers, in the Southeast. The Company’s typical wholesale contract is now more than 11 years
in duration, which reduces remarketing risk until the middle of the next decade. However, the
Company continues to face challenges related to market power issues at the federal regulatory
level, specifically the ability to charge market-based rates.

Key Performance Indicators

To evaluate operating results and to ensure the Company’s ability to meet its contractual
commitments to customers, the Company focuses on two key performance indicators. These
indicators consist of plant availability and peak season equivalent forced outage rate (EFOR).
Plant availability shows the percentage of time during the year that the Company’s generating
units are available to be called upon to generate (the higher the better), where as the EFOR
more narrowly defines the hours during peak demand times when the Company’s generating units are
not available due to forced outages (the lower the better). The Company’s actual performance in
2004 significantly surpassed targets in these key performance areas.

Earnings

The Company’s 2004 earnings were $112 million, a $44 million decrease over 2003. The 2004 decrease
is primarily attributed to a one-time $50 million gain recognized in May 2003 upon the termination
of Dynegy, Inc.’s (Dynegy) obligations under power purchase agreements (PPAs). This one-time item
was partially offset by the effect of a full year’s operation of Plant Stanton A, which went into
service in October 2003, and Plant Harris Units 1 and 2 and Plant Franklin Unit 2, which all went
into service in June 2003. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had approximately 4,775 megawatts
in commercial operation.

The Company’s 2003 earnings were $155 million, a $101 million increase over 2002. The 2003
increase is attributed to new wholesale capacity and energy contracts, primarily PPAs relating to
units placed in service during 2003 (Plant Franklin Unit 2, Plant Harris Units 1 and 2 and Plant
Stanton A), and to the Dynegy PPA termination gain of $50 million.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company 2004 Annual Report

Revenues

Operating revenues in 2004 were $701.3 million, a $19.5 million (2.9%) increase from 2003. The
increase was primarily due to new PPAs with non-affiliates as result of a full year’s operation
of Plant Stanton A (placed in service October 2003) and PPAs with affiliates as a result of a
full year’s operation of Plant Harris Units 1 and 2 and Plant Franklin 2, each placed in service
in June 2003.

Operating revenues in 2003 were $681.8 million, a $383.0 million (128.2%) increase from 2002.
In 2003, operating revenues were positively impacted by new wholesale capacity and energy from the
four units placed in service during 2003. Included in this increase was a $9.9 million increase in
service and fee revenues from various electric membership cooperative (EMC) contracts.

Operating revenues in 2002 were $298.8 million, a $269.5 million (919.7%) increase from 2001.
In 2002, operating revenues increased due to commercial operation of Plant Wansley Units 6 and 7
and Plant Franklin Unit 1 in June 2002, PPAs with Georgia Power and Savannah Electric, requirements
agreements with 11 EMCs in June 2002, and a full year of revenue related to the PPA from Plant

Dahlberg which the Company acquired in August 2001.

Capacity revenues for 2004 were $322.8 million, or 46% of total revenues. Capacity revenues
for 2003 were $201.6 million, or 33.4% of total revenues, excluding $80 million related to the
Dynegy PPA termination. Capacity revenues for 2002 were $123.9 million, or 41.5% of total
revenues. Capacity revenues are an integral component of the PPAs with both affiliate and
non-affiliate customers and represent the greatest contribution to net income. Energy revenues
under PPAs are generally sold at variable cost and do not have a material impact on net income.

Revenues from sales to affiliated companies that are not covered by PPAs are made in
accordance with the affiliated interchange agreement, as approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC), and will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating
resources at each company that participates in the centralized operation and dispatch of the
Southern Company fleet of generating plants (Southern Pool). These transactions do not have a
significant impact on earnings since the energy is generally sold at variable cost.

Expenses

The increase in fuel expense in 2004 of $11.8 million or 10.3% is primarily due to increased gas
transportation expenses associated with Plant Harris Unit 2 prior to its commitment with Georgia
Power. In 2004, although the volume of gas purchased decreased, fuel expense increased as a result
of plants placed in service in 2003, where prior to completion, fuel expense was capitalized during
unit testing. In addition, the average cost of natural gas per decatherm increased 8.3% from 2003
to 2004. The volumes of gas purchased in 2004 decreased as a result of lower generation
requirements generally due to milder weather.

In 2003, fuel expense increased $17.3 million or 17.7% primarily due to the operation of Plant
Wansley Units 6 and 7 and Plant Franklin Unit 1 for a full year, as well as the June 2003
commercial operation of Plant Franklin Unit 2 and Plant Harris Units 1 and 2. Opportunity sales
made from Plant Franklin Unit 2 and Plant Harris Unit 2 prior to their commitment under
affiliate PPAs also contributed to the increase in fuel expense. In addition, the average cost of
natural gas per decatherm increased 24% from 2002 to 2003. The increase in fuel expense in 2002 of
$94.2 million was primarily due to the June 2002 commercial operation of Plant Wansley Units 6 and
7 and Plant Franklin Unit 1 and a full year of operation for Plant Dahlberg. In addition, the
average cost of natural gas per decatherm increased 33% from 2001 to 2002.

The significant upward trend in the cost of natural gas and volatility in these markets is
expected to continue. Higher natural gas prices in the United States are the result of slightly
lower gas supplies despite increased drilling activity. Natural gas supply interruptions, such
as those caused by the 2004 hurricanes, resulted in an immediate market response; however, the
impact of this price volatility may be reduced by imports of natural gas and liquefied natural
gas. Fuel expenses incurred under the Company’s PPAs are generally the responsibility of the
counterparties, and do not significantly affect net income. Under the PPAs, either the Company
incurs the fuel expense and concurrently recovers the cost through energy revenues or the
counterparty purchases the fuel directly.

Purchased power increased $3.2 million in 2004, consisting of a $15.4 million increase for
non-affiliates and a $12.2 million decrease for affiliates. Purchased

II-319


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company 2004 Annual Report

power from non-affiliates and affiliates increased by $26.7 million and $104.9 million,
respectively, in 2003 and by $33.3 million and $15.6 million, respectively, in 2002. All
year-over-year variances in total purchased power expenses were to meet the Company’s contractual
sales commitments. The allocation of purchased power expenses between affiliate and non-affiliate
will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources available
throughout the Southern Company electric system. Load requirements are submitted to the Southern
Pool on an hourly basis and are fulfilled with the lowest cost alternative, whether that is
Southern Power-owned generation, affiliate-owned generation, or external purchases. During 2004,
non-affiliated purchased power increased and affiliated purchased power decreased as a result of
the availability of lower cost energy from contracts with Georgia EMCs and North Carolina
municipalities in addition to other market sources. During 2003, purchased power from affiliates
increased as a result of the availability of lower cost generating capacity primarily due to the
mild summer weather in Southern Company’s retail service territory.

Other operations and maintenance, depreciation and amortization expenses and taxes other than
income taxes all increased significantly during the period from 2002 through 2004. All of these
year-to-year increases are a result of new generating units going into service in 2002 (Plant
Wansley Units 6 and 7 and Plant Franklin Unit 1) and in 2003 (Plant Franklin Unit 2, Plant Harris
Units 1 and 2, and Plant Stanton A).

Interest expense increased by $34.4 million in 2004 due to a lower percentage of interest
costs being capitalized as projects reached completion. Plant McIntosh Units 10 and 11 were
transferred to Georgia Power and Savannah Electric during 2004 and construction was suspended on
Plant Franklin Unit 3, effectively ceasing all capitalized interest. For additional information
see FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “FERC Matters – Plant McIntosh Construction Project” herein and
Note 2 to the Financial Statements under “Plant Franklin Unit 3 Construction Project” and “Plant
McIntosh Construction Project.” Interest expense in 2003 increased by $22.8 million from the
amount recorded in 2002. This increase is primarily attributed to a lower amount of interest costs
being capitalized as construction projects reached completion and an increase in the amount of
long-term debt outstanding. Interest expense in 2002 increased $8.4 million over 2001 primarily
attributed to increased debt associated with the Company’s ongoing construction program.

Changes in other income, net in 2004, 2003, and 2002 resulted primarily from unrealized gains
and losses on derivative energy contracts. See FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND LIQUIDITY– “Market Price
Risk” herein and Notes 1 and 5 to the financial statements under “Financial Instruments.”

Effects of Inflation

The Company is subject to long-term contracts and income tax laws that are based on the recovery of
historical costs. While the inflation rate has been relatively low in recent years, it continues
to have an adverse effect on the Company because of the large investment in generating facilities
with long economic lives. Conventional accounting for historical cost does not recognize this
economic loss nor the partially offsetting gain that arises through financing facilities with
fixed-money obligations such as long-term debt.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL

General

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of future
earnings potential. Several factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the
Company’s competitive wholesale energy business. These factors include the ability to achieve
sales growth while containing costs. Another major factor is federal regulatory policy, which may
impact the Company’s level of participation in this market. The level of future earnings depends
on numerous factors, especially regulatory matters, including those related to affiliate contracts,
sales, creditworthiness of customers, total generating capacity available in the Southeast and the
successful remarketing of capacity as current contracts expire.

Since 2001, merchant energy companies and traditional electric utilities with significant
energy marketing and trading activities have come under severe financial pressures. Many of these
companies have completely exited or drastically reduced all energy marketing and trading activities
and sold foreign and domestic electric infrastructure assets. The Company has not experienced any
material adverse financial impact regarding its limited energy trading operations through Southern
Company Services, Inc. (SCS).

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company 2004 Annual Report

Power Sales Agreements

The Company is working to
maintain and expand its share of the wholesale market in the Southeastern
power markets. Although there is currently an oversupply situation in the Southeast relative to
generating capacity, there are still short term opportunities and requests for proposals in
certain areas.

On August 12, 2004, the Company entered into two PPAs with Florida Power & Light (FP&L).
Under the agreements, the Company will provide FP&L with a total of 790 megawatts of capacity
annually from Plant Harris Unit 1 and Plant Franklin Unit 1 for the period from June 2010 through
December 2015. Additionally, FP&L will make payments for firm gas transportation. The Florida
Public Service Commission (PSC) approved these contracts on January 24, 2005; however, they
are still contingent upon certain events. A similar agreement with Progress Energy Florida was
signed on November 29, 2004 for 350 megawatts from Franklin Unit 1 for the period June 2010 through
December 2015. Progress Energy Florida has transmission responsibility. The Progress Energy
Florida PPA is contingent upon certain events including approval of the Florida PSC. The final
outcome of this matter cannot be determined. These PPAs provide for fixed capacity payments and
variable energy payments based on actual energy delivered.

Also in 2004, the Company executed multiple agreements expanding its relationship
with an existing requirements customer. For the years 2005-2009, the Company will sell
approximately 130 megawatts of additional wholesale capacity from existing resources to Flint
Energies, a cooperative located in Reynolds, Georgia.

In June 2003, the Company placed Plant Franklin Unit 2 and Plant Harris Units 1 and 2
into commercial operation. In October 2003, the Company placed Plant Stanton A into commercial
operation. In June 2004, sales under PPAs with Georgia Power for the remaining 200 megawatts of
uncontracted capacity at Plant Franklin Unit 2 and for Plant Harris Unit 2 began. Sales under PPAs
for the other units became effective upon commercial operation. As a result, non-affiliate sales
from un-contracted capacity has declined.

At December 31, 2004, the Company has entered into long-term power sales agreements for a
portion of its generating capacity as follows:

FP&L new PPA

Although under some of the Company’s PPAs, capacity and energy is sold to the Southern
Company’s five retail operating companies, the Company’s generating facilities are not in the
retail operating companies’ regulated rate bases, and the Company is not able to seek recovery from
their ratepayers for construction, repair, environmental or maintenance costs. It is expected that
the capacity payments in the PPAs will produce sufficient cash flow to meet these costs, pay debt
service and provide an equity return. However, the Company’s overall profit will depend on
numerous factors, including efficient operation of its generating facilities.

As a general matter, existing PPAs provide that the purchasers are responsible for
substantially all of the cost of fuel relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. To the
extent a particular generating facility does not meet the operational requirements contemplated in
most PPAs, the Company may be responsible for excess fuel costs. With respect to fuel
transportation risk, most of the Company’s PPAs provide that the counterparties are responsible for
procuring and transporting the fuel to the particular generating facility.

The Company’s PPAs with non-affiliated counterparties have provisions that require the posting
of collateral or an acceptable substitute guarantee in the

II-321

Southern Power Company 2004 Annual Report

event that Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s downgrades the credit ratings of such counterparty to below
investment grade or the counterparty is not rated or fails to maintain a minimum coverage ratio.
The PPAs are expected to provide the Company with a stable source of revenue during their
respective terms.

Fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs will be recovered through capacity charges
based on dollars per kilowatt year or dollars per megawatt hour. The Company has also entered into
long-term service contracts with General Electric (GE) to reduce its exposure to certain operation
and maintenance costs relating to GE equipment. See Note 6 to the financial statements under
“Long-Term Service Agreements” for additional information.

FERC Matters

Market-Based Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to nonaffiliates at market-based
prices. Southern Power also has FERC authority to make short-term opportunity sales at market
rates. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a market-based contract with an
affiliate. In November 2001, the FERC modified the test it uses to consider utilities’
applications to charge market-based rates and adopted a new test called the Supply Margin
Assessment (SMA). The FERC applied the SMA to several utilities, including Southern Company,
the retail operating companies, and Southern Power, and found Southern Company and others to be
“pivotal suppliers” in their retail service territories and ordered the implementation of
several mitigation measures. Southern Company and others sought rehearing of the FERC order,
and the FERC delayed the implementation of certain mitigation measures. In April 2004, the FERC
issued an order that abandoned the SMA test and adopted a new interim analysis for measuring
generation market power. This new interim approach requires utilities to submit a pivotal
supplier screen and a wholesale market share screen. If the applicant does not pass both
screens, there will be a rebuttable presumption regarding generation market power. The FERC’s
order also sets forth procedures for rebutting these presumptions and addresses mitigation
measures for those entities that are found to have market power. In the absence of specific
mitigation measures, the order includes several cost-based mitigation measures that would apply
by default. The FERC also initiated a new rulemaking proceeding that, among other things, will
adopt a final methodology for assessing generation market power.

In July 2004, the FERC denied Southern Company’s request for rehearing, along with a number of
others, and reaffirmed the interim tests that it adopted in April 2004. In August 2004, Southern
Company passed the pivotal supplier screen for all markets and the wholesale market share screen
for all markets except the Southern Company retail service territory. Southern Company also
submitted other analyses to demonstrate that it lacks generation market power. On December 17,
2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation dominance within its
retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other markets is not at
issue. As directed by the FERC order, on February 15, 2005 Southern Company submitted additional
information related to generation dominance in the Southern Company retail service territory. As a
result of the proceeding, any new market-based rate transactions in the Southern Company retail
service territory entered into after February 27, 2005 will be subject to refund to the level of
the default cost-based rates, pending the outcome of the proceeding. Southern Company, along with
other utilities, has also filed an appeal of the FERC’s April 2004 and July 2004 orders with the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The FERC has asked the court to dismiss the
appeal on the grounds that it is premature.

In the event that the FERC’s default mitigation measures are ultimately applied, the Company
may be required to charge cost-based rates for certain wholesale sales within the Southern Company
retail service territory, which may be lower than negotiated market-based rates. The final outcome
of this matter will depend on the form in which the final methodology for assessing generation
market power and mitigation rules may be ultimately adopted and cannot be determined at this time.

Plant McIntosh Construction Project

In December 2002 after a competitive bidding process, the Georgia PSC certified PPAs between the Company and Georgia Power and Savannah Electric for capacity from
Plant McIntosh Units 10 and 11, construction of which is scheduled to be completed in June 2005.
In April 2003, Southern Power applied for FERC approval of these PPAs. In July 2003, the FERC
accepted the PPAs to become effective June 1, 2005, subject to refund, and ordered that hearings
be held. Intervenors opposed the FERC’s acceptance of the PPAs, alleging that they did not meet
the applicable standards for market-based rates between affiliates. To ensure the timely
completion of the Plant McIntosh construction project and the availability of the units in the
summer of 2005 for their retail

II-322


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company 2004 Annual Report

customers, in May 2004, Savannah Electric and Georgia Power requested the Georgia PSC to direct
them to acquire the Plant McIntosh construction project. The Georgia PSC issued such an order
and the transfer occurred on May 24, 2004 at a total cost of approximately $415 million,
including $14 million of transmission interconnection facilities. Subsequently, Southern Power
filed a request to withdraw the PPAs and to terminate the ongoing FERC proceedings. In August
2004, the FERC issued a notice accepting the request to withdraw the PPAs and permitting such
request to become effective by operation of law. However, the FERC made no determination on
what additional steps may need to be taken with respect to testimony provided in the
proceedings. The ultimate outcome of any additional FERC action cannot now be determined.

Environmental Matters

The Company’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by state and federal environmental
agencies under a variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental media, including air,
water and land resources. Because each of the Company’s units are newer gas-fired generating
facilities, costs associated with environmental compliance for these facilities have been less
significant than for similarly situated coal-fired generating facilities or older gas-fired
generating facilities. Environmental, natural resource and land use concerns, including the
applicability of air quality limitations, the availability of water withdrawal rights,
uncertainties regarding aesthetic impacts such as increased light or noise, and concerns about
potential adverse health impacts, can, however, increase the cost of siting and operating any type
of future electric generating facility. The impact of such statutes and regulations on the Company
as a result of generating facilities that may be acquired or constructed in the future cannot be
predicted at this time.

Federal and state environmental regulatory agencies are actively considering and developing
additional control strategies for emission of air pollution from industrial sources, including
electric generating facilities, and regulation of other environmental media. Among the various
environmental matters being planned or considered for regulation by the federal Environmental
Protection Agency and/or relevant state agencies are: additional regulation of areas designated as
non-attainment for ozone and particulate matter under applicable federal air quality standards
(including areas in Georgia and Alabama where the Company has facilities); the reduction of
nitrogen oxide and particulate matter emissions to reduce regional haze and visibility impairment
in sensitive areas; reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions to reduce interstate
transport of such pollutants; the reduction of so-called “greenhouse gases” (such as carbon
dioxide) to address concerns over global climate change; hazardous waste disposal requirements and
requirements for cooling water intake structures. The impact of any new standards or requirements
will depend on the development and/or implementation of applicable regulations, and cannot be
determined at this time.

Several major pieces of environmental legislation are periodically considered for
reauthorization or amendment by Congress. These include: the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act;
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Emergency Planning & Community
Right-to-Know Act; and the Endangered Species Act. Major bills to amend the Clean Air Act to
impose more stringent emissions limitations have also been proposed to further limit power plant
emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, and, in some cases, carbon dioxide. The
cost impacts of such legislation would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be
determined at this time.

Compliance with possible additional federal or state legislation or regulations related to
environmental and health concerns could also significantly affect the Company and many areas of its
operations. While all of the Company’s PPAs generally contain provisions that permit charging the
counterparty with some of the new costs incurred as a result of changes in environmental laws and
regulations, the full impact of any such regulatory or legislative changes cannot be determined at
this time.

Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage,
personal injury and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements, has increased generally
throughout the United States. In particular, personal injury claims for damages caused by alleged
exposure to hazardous materials have become more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such litigation
against the Company cannot be predicted at this time.

II-323


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company 2004 Annual Report

Construction Projects

In October 2004, a partnership between Southern Company and the Orlando Utilities Commission (OUC)
was selected by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to build and operate a 285 megawatt
coal-gasification facility. The facility will be located at OUC’s Stanton Energy Center near
Orlando, Florida, site of the existing gas-fired 630 megawatt Plant Stanton A, which is co-owned by
the Company, OUC, and others. The Company will own the Southern Company portion of the project.
The project will demonstrate a coal gasification technology that has been under development, in
partnership with the DOE, by Southern Company. The project is scheduled to begin commercial
operation in 2011, with a projected total cost of $557 million. The DOE is expected to contribute
approximately $235 million of the cost.

In August 2004, the Company completed limited construction activities on Plant Franklin
Unit 3 to preserve the long-term viability of the project and suspended further construction.
Final completion is not anticipated until the 2008-2011 period. See Note 2 to the financial
statements under “Plant Franklin Unit 3 Construction Project” for more information. The final
outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.

Other Matters

On October 22, 2004, President Bush signed the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Jobs Act) into
law. The Jobs Act includes a provision that allows a generation tax deduction for utilities. The
Company is currently assessing the impact of the Jobs Act on its taxable income. However, the
Company currently does not expect the Jobs Act to have a material impact on its financial
statements.

From time to time, the Company is involved in various other matters being litigated and
regulatory matters that could affect future earnings. See Note 2 to the financial statements for
information regarding material issues.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may
have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations and related disclosures.
Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different
from those recorded in the financial statements. Southern Company senior management has
discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates
described below with the Audit Committee of Southern Company’s Board of Directors.

Revenue Recognition

The Company’s revenue recognition depends on appropriate classification and documentation of
transactions in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended and interpreted. In
general, the Company’s power sale transactions can be classified in one of four categories:
non-derivatives, normal sales, cash flow hedges, and mark to market. For more information on
derivative transactions, see FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY –
“Market Price Risk” herein and
Notes 1 and 5 to the financial statements under “Financial Instruments.” The Company’s revenues
are dependent upon significant judgments used to determine the appropriate transaction
classification, which must be documented upon the inception of each contract. Factors that must be
considered in making these determinations include:

•

Assessing whether a sales contract meets the definition of a lease

•

Assessing whether a sales contract meets the definition of a derivative

•

Assessing whether a sales contract meets the definition of a capacity
contract

•

Assessing the probability at inception and throughout the term of the
individual contract that the contract will result in physical delivery

•

Ensuring that the contract quantities do not exceed available
generating capacity

•

Identifying the hedging instrument, the hedged transaction, and the
nature of the risk being hedged

•

Assessing hedge effectiveness at inception and throughout the contract
term.

Normal Sale and Non-Derivative Transactions

The Company considers derivative contracts, including capacity contracts, that provide for the sale
of electricity to be physically delivered in quantities less than the

II-324


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company 2004 Annual Report

Company’s available generating capacity to be normal sales. In accordance with Statement No. 133,
such transactions are accounted for as executory contracts and are not subject to mark to market
accounting. Therefore, the related revenue is recognized, in accordance with Emerging Issues Task
Force (EITF) No. 91-6, Revenue Recognition of Long-Term Power Sales Contracts, on an accrual basis
in amounts equal to the lesser of the levelized amount or the amount billable under the contract,
over the respective contract periods. Revenues from transactions that do not meet the definition
of a derivative are also recorded in this manner. Contracts recorded on the accrual basis
represented the majority of the Company’s operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Cash Flow Hedge Transactions

The Company has designated other derivative contracts for sales of electricity as cash flow hedges
of anticipated sale transactions. These contracts are marked to market through Other Comprehensive
Income over the life of the contract. Realized gains and losses are then recognized in revenues as
incurred. At December 31, 2004, there were no unrealized gains (losses) deferred in other
comprehensive income.

Mark to Market Transactions

Contracts for sales of electricity that are not normal sales and are not designated as cash flow
hedges are marked to market and recorded directly through net income. Net unrealized gains on such
contracts totaled approximately $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Asset Impairments

The Company’s investments in long-lived assets are primarily generation assets, whether in service
or under construction. The Company evaluates the carrying value of these assets under FASB
Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets, whenever
indicators of potential impairment exist. Examples of impairment indicators could include
significant changes in construction schedules, current period losses combined with a history of
losses, or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in market prices. If an
indicator exists, the asset is tested for recoverability by comparing the asset carrying value to
the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows directly attributable to the asset. A high
degree of judgment is required in developing estimates related to these evaluations, which are
based on projections of various factors, including the following:

•

Future demand for electricity based on projections of economic growth
and estimates of available generating capacity

•

Future power and natural gas prices, which have been quite volatile in
recent years

•

Future operating costs.

To date, the Company’s evaluations of its assets have not required any impairment to be
recorded. See Note 2 to the financial statements under “Plant Franklin Unit 3 Construction
Project” for additional information.

New Accounting Standards

Prior to January 2003, the Company accrued for the ultimate cost of retiring most long-lived
assets over the life of the related asset through depreciation expense. FASB Statement No. 143,
Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations established new accounting and reporting standards
for legal obligations associated with the ultimate cost of retiring long-lived assets. The
present value of the ultimate costs for an asset’s future retirement is recorded in the period
in which the liability is incurred. The costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived
asset and depreciated over the asset’s useful life. Additionally, non-regulated companies are
no longer permitted to continue accruing future retirement costs for long-lived assets that they
do not have a legal obligation to retire.

The Company has no liability for asset retirement obligations. In January 2003, the
Company recorded a reduction to the accumulated reserve for depreciation and a cumulative effect
of change in accounting principle of $0.6 million ($0.4 million after-tax). This represents
removal costs accrued prior to the implementation of Statement No. 143.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

The major change in the Company’s financial condition during 2004 was the sale of the Plant
McIntosh Units 10 and 11 combined cycle construction project to Georgia Power and Savannah Electric
at a final book cost of $415 million, including $14 million in transmission interconnection costs.
See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL - “FERC Matters - Plant McIntosh Construction Project” herein for
additional information

.

As a result of the sale, the Company repaid its note payable to Southern
Company of $89 million, returned

II-325


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company 2004 Annual Report

$225 million to Southern Company ($113 million from capital surplus and $112 million from retained
earnings) and repaid $114 million in commercial paper borrowings. In September 2003, the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had approved, under the Public Utility Holding Company Act
of 1935, as amended (PUHCA), the Company’s payment of dividends in an amount up to $190 million
to Southern Company from capital surplus. The Company also declared and paid $95 million in
additional dividends to Southern Company.

Sources of Capital

The Company may use external funds, equity capital from Southern Company or internally generated
cash from operations to finance any new projects and ongoing capital requirements. The Company
expects to generate external funds from the issuance of unsecured senior debt and commercial
paper or utilization of credit arrangements from banks.

Currently, Southern Company provides limited credit support to the Company. See Note 5 to
the financial statements under “Bank Credit Arrangements” for additional information. The
Southern Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of
each company are not commingled with funds of any other company. In accordance with PUHCA, most
loans between affiliated companies must be approved in advance by the SEC.

At December 31, 2004, the Company had approximately $25.2 million of cash and cash equivalents
to meet short-term cash needs and contingencies. To meet liquidity and capital resource
requirements, the Company had at December 31, 2004, $325 million of unused committed credit
arrangements with banks. These credit arrangements are committed to provide liquidity support to
the Company’s commercial paper program. The commercial paper program is used to finance
acquisition and construction costs related to gas-fired electric generating facilities and for
general corporate purposes, subject to borrowing limitations for each generating facility. The
credit arrangements permit the Company to fund construction of future generating facilities upon
meeting certain requirements. At December 31, 2004, there was no commercial paper outstanding.
See Note 5 to the financial statements under “Commercial Paper” for additional information.

The issuance of securities by the Company is subject to regulatory approval by the SEC under
PUHCA. Additionally, with respect to the
public offering of securities, the Company must file registration statements with the SEC under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The amounts of securities authorized by the SEC
under the PUHCA are continuously monitored and appropriate filings are made to ensure flexibility
in the capital markets.

Financing Activities

During 2004, the Company issued no new long-term debt. The Company repurchased $50 million of its
4.875% Senior Notes due July 15, 2015 in December 2004. See the Statements of Cash Flows and Note
5 to the financial statements under “Long-Term Debt” for additional information.

Credit Rating Risk

The Company does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment
schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. There are certain contracts
that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating
change to BBB- or Baa3, or below. Generally, collateral may be provided with a Southern Company
guaranty, letter of credit or cash. These contracts are primarily for physical electricity
purchases and sales. At December 31, 2004, the maximum potential collateral requirements at a
BBB- or Baa3 rating were approximately $33 million. The maximum potential collateral
requirements at a rating below BBB- or Baa3 were approximately $77 million. The Company is also
party to certain derivative agreements that could require collateral and/or accelerated payment
in the event of a credit rating change to below investment grade. These agreements are
primarily for natural gas price and interest rate risk management activities. At December 31,
2004, the Company had no material exposure related to these agreements.

Market Price Risk

The Company is exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates, certain energy-related
commodity prices, and, occasionally, currency exchange rates. To manage the volatility
attributable to these exposures, the Company nets the exposures to take advantage of natural
offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures

II-326


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company 2004 Annual Report

pursuant to the Company’s policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and hedging practices.
Company policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes. Derivative
positions are monitored using techniques that include market valuation and sensitivity analysis.

Because energy from the Company’s facilities is primarily sold under long-term PPAs with
tolling agreements and provisions shifting substantially all of the responsibility for fuel cost to
the counterparties, the Company’s exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices
of electricity is limited. To mitigate residual risks in those areas, the Company enters into
fixed-price contracts for the sale of electricity.

The fair value of changes in derivative energy contracts and year-end valuations were as
follows at December 31:

Unrealized pre-tax gains and losses on electric contracts used to hedge anticipated sales,
and gas contracts used to hedge anticipated purchases and sales, are deferred in other
comprehensive income. Gains and losses on contracts that do not represent hedges are recognized
in the income statement as incurred. At December 31, 2004, the fair value of all derivative
energy contracts was included in income.

Approximately $0.3 million, $(1.9) million and $(4.9) million of unrealized pre-tax gains
(losses) were recognized in income in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. The Company is
exposed to market-price risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the derivative
energy contracts. The Company’s policy is to enter into agreements with counterparties that
have investment grade credit ratings by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s or with counterparties who
have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. Therefore, the Company does not
anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the counterparties. For additional
information, see Notes 1 and 5 to the financial statements under “Financial Instruments.”

At December 31, 2004, the Company had no variable long-term debt outstanding. Therefore,
there would be no effect on annualized interest expense related to long-term debt if the Company
sustained a 100 basis point change in interest rates. The Company is not aware of any facts or
circumstances that would significantly affect such exposures in the near term. See “Financing
Activities” herein and Notes 1 and 5 to the financial statements under the heading “Financial
Instruments” for additional information.

Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations

The construction program of the Company is currently estimated to be $57.0 million for 2005,
$147.2 million for 2006, and $718.2 million for 2007. These amounts include estimates for
potential plant acquisitions and/or new construction of $31.2 million for 2005, $108.2 million
for 2006, and $683.3 million for 2007. Currently, there are no plants under construction.
Actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because of changes in factors such as:
business conditions; environmental regulations; FERC rules and transmission regulations; load
projections; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials, and the
cost of capital.

Other funding requirements related to obligations associated with scheduled maturities of
long-term debt, as well as the related interest, leases, and other purchase commitments are as
follows. See Notes 1, 5, and 6 to the financial statements for additional information.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Southern Power Company 2004 Annual Report

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General

Southern Power Company (the Company) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company, which is
also the parent company of five retail operating companies, Southern Company Services (SCS),
Southern Communications Services (SouthernLINC Wireless), Southern Company Gas (Southern Company
GAS), Southern Company Holdings (Southern Holdings), Southern Nuclear Operating Company (Southern
Nuclear), Southern Telecom and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The retail operating
companies — Alabama Power Company, Georgia Power Company, Gulf Power Company, Mississippi Power
Company, and Savannah Electric and Power Company — provide electric service in four Southeastern
states. The Company constructs, owns and manages Southern Company’s competitive generation assets
and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Contracts among the retail
operating companies and the Company — related to jointly owned generating facilities,
interconnecting transmission lines or the exchange of electric power — are regulated by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and/or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and
subsidiary companies. SouthernLINC Wireless provides digital wireless communications services to
the retail operating companies and also markets these services to the public within the Southeast.
Southern Telecom provides fiber cable services within the Southeast. Southern Company GAS is a
competitive retail natural gas marketer serving customers in Georgia. Southern Holdings is an
intermediate holding subsidiary for Southern Company’s investments in synthetic fuels and leveraged
leases and energy related businesses. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to Southern
Company’s nuclear power plants.

Southern Company is registered as a holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935 (PUHCA). Both Southern Company and its subsidiaries are subject to the regulatory
provisions of the PUHCA. In addition, the retail operating companies and the Company are subject
to regulation by the FERC. The Company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may
differ from those estimates.

The financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Southern Company — Florida LLC (SCF) which was established to own, operate and maintain the
Company’s interest in Plant Stanton Unit A. See Note 3 for further information. All intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Affiliate Transactions

The Company has an agreement with SCS under which the following services are rendered to the
Company at direct or allocated cost: general and design engineering, purchasing, accounting and
statistical analysis, finance and treasury, tax, information resources, marketing, auditing,
insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures and other services
with respect to business and operations and power pool transactions. SCS also enters into fuel
purchase and transportation arrangements and contracts, financial instruments for purposes of
hedging and wholesale energy purchase and sale transactions for the benefit of the Company.
Because the Company has no employees, all employee related charges are rendered at cost under
agreements with SCS or the retail operating companies. Costs for these services from SCS amounted
to approximately $46.7 million in 2004, $47.5 million in 2003, and $29.5 million during 2002.
Approximately $40.3 million in 2004, $32.8 million in 2003, and $16.2 million in 2002, were
general, administrative, operation and maintenance expenses; the remainder was capitalized to
construction work in progress. Cost allocation methodologies used by SCS are approved by the SEC
and management believes they are reasonable.

The Company has agreements with Georgia Power and Alabama Power to provide operation and
maintenance services for Plants Dahlberg, Wansley, Franklin, and Harris. These services are billed
at cost on a monthly basis and are recorded as operations and maintenance expense in the
accompanying statements of income. For the periods ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, these
services totaled approximately $6.6 million, $6.3 million, and $5.3 million, respectively.

Effective June 2004, the Company began billing an additional 200 megawatts capacity for
Franklin Unit 2 and an additional 600 megawatts of capacity for Plant Harris

II-335


NOTES

(continued)

Southern Power Company 2004 Annual Report

Unit 2 under existing
PPAs with Georgia Power. Total billings for all PPAs in force with affiliates for 2004 totaled
$383.0 million, including $10.3 million in affiliated deferred capacity revenues recorded on the
balance sheets at December 31, 2004. Billings under these agreements totaled $282.2 million in
2003, including $28.4 million in affiliated deferred capacity recorded on the balance sheets at
December 31, 2003. For 2002, comparable billings under these agreements totaled $164 million,
including $13 million of affiliated deferred capacity revenues.

The retail operating companies, the Company, and Southern Company GAS may jointly enter into
various types of wholesale energy, natural gas, and certain other contracts, either directly or
through SCS as agent. Each participating company may be jointly and severally liable for the
obligations incurred under these agreements.

The Company and its affiliates generally settle amounts related to the above transactions on a
monthly basis in the month following the performance of such services or the purchase or sale of
electricity.

Also see Notes 3 and 5 for information related to various types of financing support provided
by Southern Company.

Revenues

Capacity is sold at rates specified under contractual terms and is recognized at the lesser of the
levelized amount or the amount billable under the contract over the respective contract periods.
Energy is generally sold at market-based rates and the associated revenue is recognized as the
energy is delivered. See “Financial Instruments” herein for additional information.

Significant portions of the Company’s revenues have been derived from certain customers. For
the year ended December 31, 2004, Georgia Power accounted for 40.25% of revenues, with Alabama
Power and Savannah Electric accounting for 8.4% and 4.5% of revenues, respectively. For the year
ended December 31, 2003, Georgia Power accounted for approximately 33.7% of revenues, excluding $80
million related to termination of contracts with Dynegy, Inc. (Dynegy), with Alabama Power and
Savannah Electric accounting for 5.5% and 5.0%, respectively. For the year ended December 31,
2002, Georgia Power, Savannah Electric, and LG&E Energy Marketing, Inc. accounted for approximately
33.5%, 17.2%, and 15.8% of revenues, respectively.

Fuel Costs

Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is consumed.

Income Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provides deferred
income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences.

Manufacturer’s Tax Credits

The State of Georgia provides a tax credit for qualified investment property to manufacturing
companies that construct new facilities. The credit ranges from 1% to 5% of construction
expenditures depending upon the county in which the new facility is located. The Company’s policy
is to recognize these credits when management believes they are more likely than not to be allowed
by the Georgia Department of Revenue. Manufacturer’s tax credits of $11.8 million and $5.8 million
were recorded in 2003 and 2002, respectively. There were no credits recorded in 2004.

Depreciation

Depreciation of the original cost of assets is computed under the straight-line method based on the
assets’ estimated useful lives determined by the Company. The primary assets in property, plant
and equipment are power plants, all of which have an estimated useful life of 35 years, except
Plant Dahlberg which has an estimated useful life of 40 years. These lives reflect a composite of
the significant components (called retirement units) that make up the plants. When property
subject to composite depreciation is retired or otherwise disposed of in the normal course of
business, its cost is charged to accumulated depreciation. For other property dispositions, the
applicable cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the accounts and a gain or loss is
recognized.

Asset Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of Removal

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement

II-336


NOTES

(continued)

Southern Power Company 2004 Annual Report

Obligations. Statement No. 143 establishes
new accounting and reporting standards for legal obligations associated with the ultimate costs
of retiring long-lived assets. The present value of the ultimate costs for an asset’s future
retirement is recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The costs are
capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset’s useful
life. Additionally, Statement No. 143 does not permit the continued accrual of future
retirement costs for long-lived assets that the Company does not have a legal obligation to
retire.

As of December 31, 2004, the Company has no liability for asset retirement obligations. In
January 2003, the Company recorded a reduction to the accumulated reserve for depreciation and a
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $0.6 million ($0.4 million after-tax).
This represents removal costs accrued prior to the implementation of Statement No. 143.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is stated at original cost. Original cost includes materials, direct
labor incurred by affiliated companies, minor items of property and interest capitalized. Interest
is capitalized on qualifying projects during the development and construction period. Interest of
approximately $17.4 million in 2004, $36.7 million in 2003, and $35.3 million in 2002 was
capitalized in connection with the development and construction of power plants. The cost to
replace significant items of property defined as retirement units is capitalized. The cost of
maintenance, repairs and replacement of minor items of property is charged to maintenance expense
as incurred.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles

The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of
whether an impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows
attributable to the assets, as compared with the carrying value of the assets. If an impairment
has occurred, the amount of the impairment loss recognized is determined by estimating the fair
value of the assets and recording a loss for the amount of the carrying value that is greater than
the fair value. For assets identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the
estimated fair value less the cost to sell in order to determine if an impairment loss is required.
Until the assets are disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or
events change.

Deferred Project Development Costs

The Company capitalizes project development costs once it is determined that it is probable that a
specific site will be acquired and a power plant constructed. These costs include professional
services, permits and other costs directly related to the construction of a new project. These
costs are generally transferred to construction work in progress upon commencement of construction.
The total deferred project development costs were $ 3.2 million at December 31, 2004 and $2.2
million at December 31, 2003.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are considered cash
equivalents. Temporary cash investments are securities with original maturities of 90 days or
less.

Materials and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include generating plant materials. Materials are charged to
inventory when purchased and then expensed or capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when installed.
Materials and supplies are recorded at average cost.

Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to fluctuations in interest
rates, the prices of certain fuel purchases and electricity purchases and sales. All derivative
financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair
value. Substantially all of the Company’s bulk energy purchases and sales contracts that meet the
definition of a derivative
are exempt from fair value accounting requirements and
are accounted for under the accrual method. Other derivative contracts qualify as cash flow
hedges of anticipated transactions. This results in the deferral of related gains and losses in
other comprehensive income until the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness is recognized
currently in net income. Other derivative contracts are marked to market through current period

II-337

income and are recorded on a net basis in the statements of income.

The Company is exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of
counterparties’ nonperformance. The Company has established controls to determine and monitor
the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate the Company’s exposure to
counterparty credit risk.

The Company’s financial instruments for which the carrying amounts did not equal fair value at
December 31, 2004 were as follows:

Carrying

At December 31, 2003

$

$

1,172

The fair values for securities were based on either closing market prices or closing prices of
comparable instruments.

Comprehensive Income

The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of all changes in common stock equity
of an enterprise that result from transactions and other economic events of the period other than
transactions with owners. Comprehensive income consists of net income and changes in the fair
value of qualifying cash flow hedges, less income taxes and reclassifications of amounts included
in net income.

2. CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY
MATTERS

General Litigation Matters

From time to time, the Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the
ordinary course of business. In addition, the Company’s business activities are subject to
extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation over
environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury and
citizen enforcement of environmental requirements, has increased generally throughout the United
States. In particular, personal injury claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous
materials have become more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such litigation against the Company
cannot be predicted at this time.

FERC Matters

Market-Based Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to sell power
to nonaffiliates at market-based prices. The Company also has FERC authority to make short-term
opportunity sales at market rates. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a
market-based contract with an affiliate. In November 2001, the FERC modified the test it uses
to consider utilities’ applications to charge market-based rates and adopted a new test called
the Supply Margin Assessment (SMA). The FERC applied the SMA to several utilities, including
Southern Company, the retail operating companies, and Southern Power, and found Southern Company
and others to be “pivotal suppliers” in their retail service territories and ordered the
implementation of several mitigation measures. Southern Company and others sought rehearing of
the FERC order, and the FERC delayed the implementation of certain mitigation measures. In
April 2004, the FERC issued an order that abandoned the SMA test and adopted a new interim
analysis for measuring generation market power. This new interim approach requires utilities to
submit a pivotal supplier screen and a wholesale market share screen. If the applicant does not
pass both screens, there will be a rebuttable presumption regarding generation market power.
The FERC’s order also sets forth procedures for rebutting these presumptions and addresses
mitigation measures for those entities that are found to have market power. In the absence of
specific mitigation measures, the order includes several cost-based mitigation measures that
would apply by default. The FERC also initiated a new rulemaking proceeding that, among other
things, will adopt a final methodology for assessing generation market power.

In July 2004, the FERC denied Southern Company’s request for rehearing, along with a number of
others, and reaffirmed the interim tests that it adopted in April 2004. In August 2004, Southern
Company submitted a filing to the FERC that included results showing that Southern Company passed
the pivotal supplier screen for all markets and the wholesale market share screen for all markets
except the Southern Company retail service territory. Southern Company also submitted other
analyses to demonstrate that it lacks generation market power. On December 17, 2004, the FERC
initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation dominance within its retail service
territory. The ability to

II-338


NOTES

(continued)

Southern Power Company 2004 Annual Report

charge market-based rates in other markets is not at issue. As
directed by the FERC order, on February 15, 2005 Southern Company submitted additional information
related to generation dominance in the Southern Company retail service territory. Any new market-based
rate transactions in the Southern Company retail service territory entered into after
February 27, 2005 will be subject to refund to the level of the default cost-based rates, pending
the outcome of the proceeding. Southern Company, along with other utilities, has also filed an
appeal of the FERC’s April and July 2004 orders with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit. The FERC has asked the court to dismiss the appeal on the grounds that it is
premature.

In the event that the FERC’s default mitigation measures are ultimately applied, the Company
may be required to charge cost-based rates for certain wholesale sales within the Southern Company
retail service territory, which may be lower than negotiated market-based rates. The final outcome
of this matter will depend on the form in which the final methodology for assessing generation
market power and mitigation rules may be ultimately adopted and cannot be determined at this time.

Plant Franklin Unit 3 Construction Project

In May 2003, the Company entered into an agreement with Dynegy to resolve all outstanding matters
related to capacity sales contracts with subsidiaries of Dynegy. Under the terms of the agreement,
Dynegy made a cash termination payment of $80 million to the Company. The termination payments
from Dynegy resulted in a one-time gain to the Company of approximately $50 million. As a result
of the contract termination, the Company has completed limited construction activities on Plant
Franklin Unit 3 to preserve the long-term viability of the project but has deferred final
completion until the 2008-2011 period. The length of the deferral period will depend on forecasted
capacity needs and other wholesale market opportunities. As of December 31, 2004, the Company’s
investment in Unit 3 of Plant Franklin was $171.6 million. The final outcome of this matter cannot
now be determined.

Plant McIntosh Construction Project

In December 2002 after a competitive bidding process, the Georgia Public Service Commission
(PSC) certified power purchase agreements (PPAs) between the Company and Georgia Power and
Savannah Electric for capacity from Plant McIntosh Units 10 and 11, construction of which is
scheduled to be completed in June 2005. In April 2003, the Company applied for FERC approval of
these PPAs. In July 2003, the FERC accepted the PPAs to become effective June 1, 2005, subject
to refund, and ordered that hearings be held. Intervenors opposed the FERC’s acceptance of the
PPAs, alleging that they did not meet the applicable standards for market-based rates between
affiliates. To ensure the timely completion of the Plant McIntosh construction project and the
availability of the units in the summer of 2005 for their retail customers, in May 2004,
Savannah Electric and Georgia Power requested the Georgia PSC to direct them to acquire the
Plant McIntosh construction project. The Georgia PSC issued such an order and the transfer
occurred on May 24, 2004 at a total cost of approximately $415 million, including $14 million in
transmission interconnection facilities. Subsequently, the Company filed a request to withdraw
the PPAs and to terminate the ongoing FERC proceedings. In August 2004, the FERC issued a
notice accepting the request to withdraw the PPAs and permitting such request to become
effective by operation of law. However, the FERC made no determination on what additional steps
may need to be taken with respect to testimony provided in the proceedings. The ultimate
outcome of any additional FERC action cannot now be determined.

3. JOINT OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS

The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary SCF, is a 65% owner of Plant Stanton A, a
combined-cycle project with 630 megawatts. The unit is co-owned by Orlando Utilities Commission
(28%), Florida Municipal Power Agency (3.5%), and Kissimmee Utility Authority (3.5%). The Company
has a services agreement with SCS whereby SCS is responsible for the operation and maintenance of
Plant Stanton A. As of December 31, 2004, $155.7 million was recorded in plant in service with
associated accumulated depreciation of $5.5 million. The Company’s proportionate share of Plant
Stanton A’s
operating expense is included in the corresponding operating expenses in the Statements of Income.

The Company has guaranteed the performance of its subsidiary, SCF, for SCF’s payment
obligations under the ownership agreement, PPAs and alternative power supply agreements associated
with Plant Stanton A. As of December 31, 2004, the Company’s current exposure under these
guarantees is $32.5 million under the PPAs and the ownership agreement and $9.4 million under
alternative power supply agreements.

4. INCOME TAXES

Southern Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return and a combined
State of Georgia income tax return. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement, as
required by the PUHCA, each subsidiary’s current and deferred tax expense is computed on a
stand-alone basis, and no subsidiary is allocated more expense than would be paid if they filed a
separate income tax return. In accordance with Internal Revenue Service regulations, each company
is jointly and severally liable for the tax liability.

and $5.8 million, respectively, under the flow-through method of accounting for the State of
Georgia manufacturer’s tax credits. There were no credits recorded in 2004.

The tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities in the financial

Deferred tax liabilities were primarily the result of property related timing differences and
derivative hedging instruments. The transfer of the Plant McIntosh construction project to Georgia
Power and Savannah Electric resulted in a deferred gain for federal income tax purposes. Georgia
Power and Savannah Electric will reimburse the Company for the related $6.4 million deferred tax
liability as it is reflected in the Company’s future taxable income. These receivables from
Georgia Power and Savannah Electric are included in Other Affiliated Deferred Debits on the balance
sheet at December 31, 2004. See Note 2 under “FERC Matters - Plant McIntosh Construction Project”
for further information.

Deferred tax assets consist primarily of timing differences related to the recognition of
capacity revenues, and the tax impact related to the deferred loss on interest rate swaps reflected
in Other Comprehensive Income. The transfer of Plants Dahlberg, Wansley, and Franklin to the
Company from Georgia Power in 2001 also resulted in a deferred gain for federal income tax
purposes. The Company will reimburse Georgia Power for the remaining balance of the related
deferred tax asset of $13.3 million as it is reflected in Georgia Power’s future taxable income.
This payable to Georgia Power is included in Other Affiliated Deferred Credits on the balance sheet
at December 31, 2004.

or contributions of equity interests, loans and guarantees issued in support of the Company’s
securities or obligations. At December 31, 2004, equity contributions from Southern Company to the
Company totaled $741 million.

Southern Company has committed to fund at least 35 percent of the Company’s construction
project financing and to pay for construction cost overruns to the extent that the Company’s own
cash flow is insufficient. Also, Southern Company will prepay any portion of revolving credit
arrangements used for the Company’s construction projects not completed within two years of the
proposed completion date. Currently, there are no borrowings related to the construction of Plant
Franklin Unit 3 outstanding under these credit arrangements.

Bank Credit Arrangements

The Company has a $325 million unsecured syndicated revolving credit facility (Facility) expiring
in April 2006. The purpose of the Facility is to finance the acquisition and construction costs
related to gas-fired electric generating facilities and general corporate expenditures (subject to
a $50 million limit), and to pay or support commercial paper used to fund construction of
facilities. At December 31, 2004, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Facility.
Borrowings under the Facility would bear interest at the Company’s option at a rate equal to either
the Eurodollar rate plus a specified margin ranging from 1.25% to 3.0%, depending on the Company’s
credit rating and the amount drawn down under the Facility, or a base rate plus a specified margin.
The Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the unused balance of the Facility. The
commitment fee ranges from 0.325% to 0.75%, depending on the Company’s credit rating. For the
periods ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, the Company paid approximately $2.1 million, $2.0
million, and $1.1 million in commitment fees, respectively.

The Facility contains certain financial covenants relating to the Company’s debt
capitalization which require that additional debt incurred by the Company must generally be
unsecured and the Company must have its ratings reaffirmed at investment grade including the new
debt. The Facility also contains restrictions related to the assumption of additional debt, which
require a maximum 65% debt ratio, as defined in the Facility, excluding intercompany loans. The
Company was in compliance with such covenants at December 31, 2004. Initial borrowings under the
Facility for new projects would be prohibited if the Company or Southern Company experiences a
material adverse change (as defined in the Facility). The Facility contains a cross default to
Southern Company’s indebtedness, which if triggered would require prepayment of debt related to
projects financed under the Facility that are not complete.

Long-Term Debt

In July 2003, the Company issued $575 million of 4.875% senior notes, due July 15, 2015 and in
December 2004, the Company repurchased $50 million of these notes. In June 2002, the Company
issued $575 million of 6.25% senior notes, due July 15, 2012.

Commercial Paper

The Company has the ability to borrow under a commercial paper program. During 2004, the peak
amount outstanding for commercial paper was $114.5 million and the average amount outstanding was
$49.6 million. The average annual interest rate on commercial paper was 1.14% in 2004. There was
no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2004.

The Company’s commercial paper program is supported by the Facility. The Facility was
structured to accommodate commercial paper, and the conditions that the Company must meet to
reserve against the Facility for

Southern Power Company 2004 Annual Report

a project-specific commercial paper issue are the same as those for a regular draw on the Facility.
These conditions do not contain any material adverse effect clauses or creditworthiness measures.

Financial Instruments

The Company enters into energy related derivatives to limit exposures to electricity, gas, and
other fuel price changes. The Company’s exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices
and prices of electricity is limited because its long-term sales contracts shift substantially
all fuel cost responsibility to the purchaser. The Company may enter into interest rate swaps
to limit exposure to interest rate changes. Swaps related to variable rate securities or
forecasted transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges. These swaps are generally
structured to mirror the terms of the hedged debt instruments; therefore, no material
ineffectiveness has been recorded in earnings. At December 31, 2004, the Company had no
interest derivatives outstanding.

In July 2003, the Company terminated $500 million notional amount of interest rates swaps
for losses of $93.3 million at the same time it issued senior notes. In June 2002, the Company
settled interest rates swaps associated with senior notes for losses of $16.9 million. These
losses have been deferred in other comprehensive income and will be amortized to interest
expense over the life of the senior notes.

For the years 2004, 2003, and 2002, approximately $10.4 million, $5.5 million, and $0.7
million, respectively, of pre-tax losses were reclassified from other comprehensive income to
interest expense. During 2005, approximately $11.2 million of pre-tax losses are expected to be
reclassified from other comprehensive income to interest expense. The Company has interest-related
hedges in place up to and including 2013.

For the years 2004, 2003 and 2002, approximately $0.3 million, $0.2 million and $(0.2)
million, respectively, of pre-tax gains (losses) were reclassified from other comprehensive income
to depreciation and amortization. Additionally for the year 2004, approximately $0.2 million of
pre-tax losses were reclassified to fuel expense. For 2005, approximately $0.3 million of pre-tax
gains are expected to be reclassified from other comprehensive income to earnings. The Company has
energy-related hedges in place through 2005. Additionally, there are deferred realized net hedging
gains relating to capitalized costs and revenues during the construction of specific plants that
will be reclassified from other comprehensive income to depreciation and amortization over the
remaining life of the respective plants, which is approximately 33 years.

6. COMMITMENTS

Construction Program

The Company currently estimates property additions to be $57.0 million, $147.2 million and $718.2
million in 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively. There are currently no plants actively under
construction. See Note 2 under “Plant Franklin Unit 3 Construction Project” for additional
information.

Long-Term Service Agreements

The Company has entered into several Long-Term Service Agreements (LTSAs) with General Electric
(GE) for the purpose of securing maintenance support for its combined cycle and combustion turbine
generating facilities. In summary, the LTSAs stipulate that GE will perform all planned
inspections on the covered equipment, which includes the cost of all labor and materials. GE is
also obligated to cover the costs of unplanned maintenance on the covered equipment subject to a
limit specified in each contract.

In general, except for Plant Dahlberg, these LTSAs are in effect through two major inspection
cycles per unit. The Dahlberg agreement is in effect through the first major inspection of each
unit. Scheduled payments to GE are made at various intervals based on actual operating hours of
the respective units. Total payments to GE under these agreements are $757.2 million over the
remaining term of the agreements, which may range up to 30 years per unit. However, the LTSAs
contain various cancellation provisions at the Company’s option.

Payments made to GE prior to the performance of any planned inspections are recorded as a long
term prepayment in Deferred Charges and Other Assets on the balance
sheets. Inspection costs are
capitalized or charged to expense based on the nature of the work performed.

Fuel Commitments

SCS, as agent for the retail operating companies and the Company, has entered into various fuel
transportation and procurement agreements to supply a portion of the fuel (primarily natural gas)
requirements for the operating facilities. In most cases, these contracts contain provisions for
firm transportation costs, storage costs, minimum purchase levels and other financial commitments.

Natural gas purchase commitments contain given volumes with prices based on various indices at
the actual time of delivery. Amounts included in the chart below represent estimates based on New
York Mercantile Exchange future prices at December 31, 2004.

Additional commitments for fuel will be required to supply the Company’s future needs.

Acting as an agent for all of Southern Company’s retail operating companies, the Company
and Southern Company GAS, SCS may enter into various types of wholesale energy and natural gas
contracts. Under these agreements, each of the retail operating companies, the Company and
Southern Company GAS may be jointly and severally liable. The creditworthiness of the Company
and Southern Company GAS is currently inferior to the creditworthiness of the retail operating
companies; therefore, Southern Company has entered into keep-well agreements with each of the
retail operating companies to insure they will not subsidize nor be responsible for any costs,
losses, liabilities or damages resulting from the inclusion of the Company and Southern Company
GAS as a contracting party under these agreements.

The amounts shown in the table were calculated according to the final average pay formula and are

Social Security offset that would apply in most cases.

In 1998, Savannah Electric merged its pension plan into the Southern Company Pension Plan.
Savannah Electric also has in effect a supplemental executive retirement plan for certain of its
executive employees. The plan is designed to provide participants with a supplemental retirement
benefit, which, in conjunction with Social Security and benefits under Southern Company’s qualified
pension plan, will equal 70 percent of the highest three of the final 10 years’ average annual
earnings (excluding incentive compensation).


The number of accredited years of service includes
seven years and six months and eight years credited to Mr. Greer under the
Southern Company Pension Plan and the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan,
respectively.


The number of accredited years of service includes five
years and five months granted to Mr. Willis for time served at a non-affiliated
electric utility.

Employment Contracts and Termination of Employment and Change in Control Arrangements.

Savannah Electric has adopted Southern Company’s Change in Control Program, which is applicable to
certain of its officers, and has entered into an individual change in control agreement with its
president and chief executive officer. If an executive is involuntarily terminated, other than for
cause, within two years following a change in control of Savannah Electric or Southern Company, the
program provides for:

A change in control of Southern Company is defined under the agreements as:

•

acquisition of at least 20 percent of the Southern Company’s stock,

•

a change in the majority of the members of the Southern Company’s board of directors,

•

a merger or other business combination that results in Southern Company’s shareholders immediately before
the merger owning less than 65 percent of the voting power after the merger or

•

a sale of substantially all the assets of Southern Company.

A change in control of Savannah Electric is defined under the agreements as:

•

acquisition of at least 50 percent of Savannah Electric’s stock,

•

a merger or other business combination unless Southern Company controls the surviving entity or

•

a sale of substantially all the assets of Savannah Electric.

Southern Company also has amended its short- and long-term incentive plan to provide for
pro-rata payments at not less than target-level performance if a change in control occurs and
the plan is not continued or replaced with comparable plans.

Mr. W. Miles Greer and Savannah Electric entered into agreements that will provide for a monthly
payment to Mr. Greer after his retirement equal to the difference between the amount he will
receive under the Southern Company Pension Plan and Savannah Electric Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan and the amount he would receive under those Plans had he been employed by Savannah
Electric an additional seven years and six months under the Pension Plan and an additional eight
years under the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan.
