                                     PART I

Item 1.  BUSINESS

    SOUTHERN was incorporated under the laws of Delaware on November 9, 1945.
SOUTHERN is domesticated under the laws of Georgia and is qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation under the laws of Alabama. SOUTHERN owns all
the outstanding common stock of ALABAMA, GEORGIA, GULF, MISSISSIPPI and
SAVANNAH, each of which is an operating public utility company. The operating
companies supply electric service in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida,
Mississippi and Georgia, respectively. More particular information relating to
each of the operating companies is as follows:

      ALABAMA is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Alabama
      on November 10, 1927, by the consolidation of a predecessor Alabama Power
      Company, Gulf Electric Company and Houston Power Company. The predecessor
      Alabama Power Company had had a continuous existence since its
      incorporation in 1906.

      GEORGIA was incorporated under the laws of the State of Georgia on June
      26, 1930, and admitted to do business in Alabama on September 15, 1948.

      GULF is a corporation which was organized under the laws of the State of
      Maine on November 2, 1925, and admitted to do business in Florida on
      January 15, 1926, in Mississippi on October 25, 1976, and in Georgia on
      November 20, 1984.

      MISSISSIPPI was incorporated under the laws of the State of Mississippi on
      July 12, 1972, was admitted to do business in Alabama on November 28,
      1972, and effective December 21, 1972, by the merger into it of the
      predecessor Mississippi Power Company, succeeded to the business and
      properties of the latter company. The predecessor Mississippi Power
      Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Maine on November
      24, 1924, and was admitted to do business in Mississippi on December 23,
      1924, and in Alabama on December 7, 1962.

      SAVANNAH is a corporation existing under the laws of the State of Georgia;
      its charter was granted by the Secretary of State on August 5, 1921.

    SOUTHERN also owns all the outstanding common stock of Southern LINC,
Southern Nuclear, SCS, Southern Management Development (formerly Energy
Solutions), Southern Telecom, Southern Power and other direct and indirect
subsidiaries. Southern LINC provides digital wireless communications services to
SOUTHERN's operating companies and also markets these services to the public
within the Southeast. Southern Nuclear provides services to ALABAMA's and
GEORGIA's nuclear plants. Southern Management Development focuses on new and
existing programs to enhance customer satisfaction, efficiency and stockholder
value. Southern Telecom provides wholesale fiber optic solutions to
telecommunication providers in the Southeastern United States.

    In January 2001, SOUTHERN formed a new subsidiary, Southern Power. This
subsidiary constructs, owns and manages wholesale generating assets in the
Southeast. Southern Power will be the primary growth engine for SOUTHERN's
competitive wholesale market-based energy business.

    ALABAMA and GEORGIA each own 50% of the outstanding common stock of SEGCO.
SEGCO owns electric generating units with an aggregate capacity of 1,019,680
kilowatts at Plant Gaston on the Coosa River near Wilsonville, Alabama, and
ALABAMA and GEORGIA are each entitled to one-half of SEGCO's capacity and
energy. ALABAMA acts as SEGCO's agent in the operation of SEGCO's units and
furnishes coal to SEGCO as fuel for its units. SEGCO also owns three 230,000
volt transmission lines extending from Plant Gaston to the Georgia state line at
which point connection is made with the GEORGIA transmission line system.

    Reference is made to Note 12 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN in Item
8 herein for additional information regarding SOUTHERN's segment and related
information.

Mirant Corporation

In April 2000, SOUTHERN announced an initial public offering of up to 19.9
percent of Mirant and its intentions to spin off the remaining ownership of
Mirant to SOUTHERN stockholders within 12 months of the initial stock offering.
On October 2, 2000, Mirant completed its initial public offering of 66.7 million

                                      I-1


shares of common stock priced at $22 per share. This represented 19.7 percent of
the 338.7 million shares outstanding. As a result of the stock offering,
SOUTHERN recorded a $560 million increase in paid-in capital with no gain or
loss being recognized.

   On February 19, 2001, SOUTHERN's board of directors approved the spin off of
its remaining ownership of 272 million Mirant shares. On April 2, 2001, the
tax-free distribution of Mirant shares was completed at a ratio of approximately
0.4 for every share of SOUTHERN common stock held at record date.

   The distribution resulted in charges of approximately $3.2 billion and $0.4
billion to SOUTHERN's paid-in capital and retained earnings, respectively.

   As a result of the spin off, SOUTHERN's financial statements reflect Mirant's
results of operations, balance sheets and cash flows as discontinued operations.

The SOUTHERN System

Operating Companies

The transmission facilities of each of the operating companies are connected to
the respective company's own generating plants and other sources of power and
are interconnected with the transmission facilities of the other operating
companies and SEGCO by means of heavy-duty high voltage lines. (In the case of
GEORGIA's integrated transmission system, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Territory
Served by the Operating Companies" herein.)

    Operating contracts covering arrangements in effect with principal
neighboring utility systems provide for capacity exchanges, capacity purchases
and sales, transfers of economy energy and other similar transactions.
Additionally, the operating companies have entered into voluntary reliability
agreements with the subsidiaries of Entergy Corporation, Florida Electric Power
Coordinating Group and TVA and with Carolina Power & Light Company, Duke Energy
Corporation, South Carolina Electric & Gas Company and Virginia Electric and
Power Company, each of which provides for the establishment and periodic review
of principles and procedures for planning and operation of generation and
transmission facilities, maintenance schedules, load retention programs,
emergency operations and other matters affecting the reliability of bulk power
supply. The operating companies have joined with other utilities in the
Southeast (including those referred to above) to form the SERC to augment
further the reliability and adequacy of bulk power supply. Through the SERC, the
operating companies are represented on the National Electric Reliability
Council.

    An intra-system interchange agreement provides for coordinating operations
of the power producing facilities of the operating companies and the capacities
available to such companies from non-affiliated sources and for the pooling of
surplus energy available for interchange. Coordinated operation of the entire
interconnected system is conducted through a central power supply coordination
office maintained by SCS. The available sources of energy are allocated to the
operating companies to provide the most economical sources of power consistent
with good operation. The resulting benefits and savings are apportioned among
the operating companies.

    SCS has contracted with SOUTHERN, each operating company, various of the
other subsidiaries, Southern Nuclear, Southern Power and SEGCO to furnish, at
cost and upon request, the following services: general executive and advisory
services, power pool operations, general and design engineering, purchasing,
accounting and statistical, finance and treasury, tax, information resources,
marketing, auditing, insurance and pensions, corporate, rates, budgeting, public
relations, human resources, systems and procedures and other services with
respect to business and operations and power pool operations. Southern
Management Development and Southern LINC have also secured from the operating
companies certain services which are furnished at cost.

    Southern Nuclear has contracts with ALABAMA to operate the Farley Nuclear
Plant, and with GEORGIA to operate Plants Hatch and Vogtle. See Item 1 -
BUSINESS - "Regulation - Atomic Energy Act of 1954" herein.

Southern Power

As stated above, Southern Power will be the primary growth engine for SOUTHERN's
competitive wholesale market-based energy business. Southern Power intends to
sell the output of its generating assets under long-term, market-based contracts

                                      I-2


both to unaffiliated wholesale purchasers as well as the operating companies
(under power purchase agreements approved by the respective public service
commissions). Southern Power's wholesale generating assets will not be placed in
the operating companies' rate bases, and Southern Power will only be able to
recover costs from the operating companies based on the terms of the
market-based contracts for its wholesale generating assets. The market-based
contracts typically pass the cost of fuel to the wholesale energy purchasers and
reduce Southern Power's business risks, but its overall profit will depend on
the parameters of the wholesale market and its efficient operation of its
wholesale generating assets. By the end of 2003, Southern Power plans to have
approximately 4,700 megawatts of generating capacity in commercial operation. At
December 31, 2001, 800 megawatts were in commercial operation and some 3,900
megawatts of capacity are under construction.

Other Business

In March 2001, Energy Solutions changed its name to Southern Management
Development. Southern Management Development then created a separate entity,
Southern Company Energy Solutions LLC (SCES LLC) for its energy business. SCES
LLC provides energy related services such as energy outsourcing, energy
conservation, facility maintenance, energy management and turnkey services for
industrial, commercial, and governmental customers. Southern Management
Development focuses on new and existing programs to enhance customer
satisfaction, efficiency and stockholder value. Examples are: Bill Payment
Protection, an insurance product that protects a residential customer by paying
the electric bill in the event the customer becomes involuntarily unemployed,
disabled or goes on unpaid leave; and Electric Vehicle Chargers, a program to
supply electric vehicle charging units to industrial customers.

     In 1996, Southern LINC began serving SOUTHERN's operating companies and
marketing its services to non-affiliates within the Southeast. Its system covers
approximately 127,000 square miles and combines the functions of two-way radio
dispatch, cellular phone, short text and numeric messaging and wireless data
transfer.

    These continuing efforts to invest in and develop new business opportunities
offer the potential of earning returns which may exceed those of rate-regulated
operations. However, these activities also involve a higher degree of risk.
SOUTHERN expects to make substantial investments over the period 2002-2004 in
these and other new businesses.

     In 1999, MESH, a subsidiary of SOUTHERN, filed a petition for Chapter 11
bankruptcy relief in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. On August 4, 2000, MESH filed a
proposed plan of reorganization with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. The proposed
plan of reorganization was most recently amended on October 15, 2001. SOUTHERN
expects that approval of a plan of reorganization would result in either a
termination of SOUTHERN's ownership interest in MESH or the exchange of all
assets of MESH for the cancellation of securities held by the bondholders, but
would not affect SOUTHERN's continuing guarantee obligations. Reference is made
to Item 3 - "Legal Proceedings" herein for additional information relating to
this matter.

Certain Factors Affecting the Industry

Various factors are currently affecting the electric utility industry in
general, including increasing competition and the regulatory changes related
thereto, costs required to comply with environmental regulations and the
potential for new business opportunities (with their associated risks) outside
of traditional rate-regulated operations. The effects of these and other factors
on the SOUTHERN system are described herein. Particular reference is made to
Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Other Business", "Competition" and "Environmental
Regulation." See also "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking
Information."

     In December 1999, the FERC issued its final rule on RTOs. The order
encouraged utilities owning transmission systems to form RTOs on a voluntary
basis. SOUTHERN has submitted a series of status reports informing the FERC of
progress toward the development of a Southeastern RTO. In these status reports,
SOUTHERN explained that it is developing a for-profit RTO known as SeTrans with
a number of non-jurisdictional cooperative and public power entities. Recently,
Entergy Corporation and Cleco Power joined the SeTrans development process. In
January 2002, the sponsors of SeTrans held a public meeting to form a

                                      I-3


Stakeholder Advisory Committee, which will participate in the development of the
RTO. SOUTHERN continues to work with the other sponsors to develop the SeTrans
RTO. The creation of SeTrans is not expected to have a material impact on
SOUTHERN's financial statements. The outcome of this matter cannot now be
determined.

Construction Programs

The subsidiary companies of SOUTHERN are engaged in continuous construction
programs to accommodate existing and estimated future loads on their respective
systems. Construction additions or acquisitions of property during 2002 through
2004 by the operating companies, SEGCO, SCS, Southern LINC, Southern Power and
other subsidiaries are estimated as follows: (in millions)

    * SCS, Southern LINC and other businesses plan capital additions to general
plant in 2002 of $27 million, $29 million and $29 million, respectively, while
SEGCO plans capital additions of $15 million to generating facilities. (See Item
1 - BUSINESS - "Other Business" herein.)

    The construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and
actual construction costs may vary from the above estimates because of numerous
factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions; acquisitions of
additional generating assets; revised load growth estimates; changes in
environmental regulations; changes in existing nuclear plants to meet new
regulatory requirements; increasing costs of labor, equipment and materials; and
cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to
capital expenditures will be fully recovered.

    SOUTHERN has approximately 4,500 megawatts of new generating capacity
scheduled to be placed in service by 2003. Approximately 3,900 megawatts of
additional new capacity will be dedicated to the wholesale market and owned by
Southern Power. Significant construction of transmission and distribution
facilities and upgrading of generating plants will be continuing.

    Under Georgia law, GEORGIA and SAVANNAH each are required to file an
Integrated Resource Plan for approval by the Georgia PSC. Under the plan rules,
the Georgia PSC must pre-certify the construction of new power plants and new
purchase power contracts. (See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Rate Matters - Integrated
Resource Planning" herein.)

    See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Regulation - Environmental Regulation" herein for
information with respect to certain existing and proposed environmental
requirements and Item 2 - PROPERTIES - "Jointly-Owned Facilities" herein for
additional information concerning ALABAMA's, GEORGIA's and Southern Power's
joint ownership of certain generating units and related facilities with certain
non-affiliated utilities.

Financing Programs

The amount and timing of additional equity capital to be raised in 2002, as well
as in subsequent years, will be contingent on SOUTHERN's investment
opportunities. Equity capital can be provided from any combination of public
offerings, private placements or SOUTHERN's stock plans.

    The operating companies plan to obtain the funds required for construction
and other purposes from sources similar to those used in the past, which were
primarily from internal sources and by the issuances of new debt and preferred
equity securities, term loans and short-term borrowings. However, the type and
timing of any financings -- if needed -- will depend on market conditions and
regulatory approval. In recent years, financings primarily have utilized
unsecured debt and trust preferred securities.

    Southern Power will use both external funds and equity capital from SOUTHERN
to finance its construction program. In addition, Southern Power has an $850
million revolving credit facility which extends through November 2004.

    Short-term debt is often utilized as appropriate at SOUTHERN, the operating
companies, SEGCO and Southern Power.

    The maximum amounts of short-term and term-loan indebtedness authorized by
the appropriate regulatory authorities are shown on the following table:

    The operating companies have long-term agreements in place from which they
expect to receive approximately 78% of their coal burn requirements in 2002.
These agreements cover remaining terms up to 9 years. In 2001, the weighted
average sulfur content of all coal burned by the operating companies was 0.76%
sulfur. This sulfur level, along with banked sulfur dioxide allowances, allowed
the operating companies to remain within limits as set forth by Phase II of the
Clear Air Act. As more and more strict environmental regulations are proposed
that impact the utilization of coal, the fuel mix will be monitored to insure
that sufficient quantities of the proper type of coal or natural gas are in
place to remain in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. See Item 1 -
BUSINESS - "Regulation - Environmental Regulation" herein.

    The operating companies and Southern Power also have long-term agreements in
place for their natural gas burn requirements. For 2002, the operating companies
and Southern Power have contracted for 163.6 billion cubic feet of natural gas
supply. These agreements cover remaining terms up to 5 years. In addition to gas
supply, the operating companies have contracts in place for both firm gas
transportation and firm gas storage. Management believes that these contracts
provide sufficient natural gas supplies, transportation and storage to ensure
normal operations of the SOUTHERN system's natural gas generating units.

    Changes in fuel prices are generally reflected in fuel adjustment clauses
contained in rate schedules. See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Rate Matters - Rate
Structure" herein.

    ALABAMA and GEORGIA have numerous contracts covering a portion of their
nuclear fuel needs for uranium, conversion services, enrichment services and
fuel fabrication. These contracts have varying expiration dates and most are
short to medium term (less than 10 years). Management believes that sufficient
capacity for nuclear fuel supplies and processing exists to preclude the
impairment of normal operations of the SOUTHERN system's nuclear generating
units.

    ALABAMA and GEORGIA have contracts with the DOE that provide for the
permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin disposing of
spent fuel in January 1998, as required by the contracts, and the companies are
pursuing legal remedies against the government for breach of contract.
Sufficient pool storage capacity is available at Plant Farley to maintain
full-core discharge capability until the refueling outages scheduled for 2006
and 2008 for units 1 & 2, respectively. Sufficient pool storage capacity
currently for spent fuel is available at Plant Vogtle to maintain full-core
discharge capability for both units into 2014. To maintain pool discharge
capability at Plant Hatch, effective June 2000, an on-site dry storage facility
became operational. Sufficient dry storage capacity is believed to be available
to continue dry storage operations at Plant Hatch through the life of the plant.
Procurement of on-site dry storage capacity at Plant Vogtle will begin in
sufficient time to maintain pool full-core discharge capability.

    The Energy Act required the establishment of a Uranium Enrichment
Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund, which is funded in part by a special
assessment on utilities with nuclear plants, including ALABAMA and GEORGIA. This
assessment is being paid over a 15-year period which began in 1993. This fund
will be used by the DOE for the decontamination and decommissioning of its
nuclear fuel enrichment facilities. The law provides that utilities will recover
these payments in the same manner as any other fuel expense.

Territory Served by the Operating Companies

The territory in which the operating companies provide electric service
comprises most of the states of Alabama and Georgia together with the
northwestern portion of Florida and southeastern Mississippi. In this territory
there are non-affiliated electric distribution systems which obtain some or all
of their power requirements either directly or indirectly from the operating
companies. The territory has an area of approximately 120,000 square miles and
an estimated population of approximately 11 million.

    ALABAMA is engaged, within the State of Alabama, in the generation and
purchase of electricity and the distribution and sale of such electricity at
retail in over 1,000 communities (including Anniston, Birmingham, Gadsden,
Mobile, Montgomery and Tuscaloosa) and at wholesale to 15 municipally-owned
electric distribution systems, 11 of which are served indirectly through sales
to AMEA, and two rural distributing cooperative associations. ALABAMA also

                                      I-8


supplies steam service in downtown Birmingham. ALABAMA also sells, and
cooperates with dealers in promoting the sale of, electric appliances.

    GEORGIA is engaged in the generation and purchase of electricity and the
distribution and sale of such electricity within the State of Georgia at retail
in over 600 communities, as well as in rural areas, and at wholesale currently
to OPC, MEAG, Dalton and the City of Hampton.

    GULF is engaged, within the northwestern portion of Florida, in the
generation and purchase of electricity and the distribution and sale of such
electricity at retail in 71 communities (including Pensacola, Panama City and
Fort Walton Beach), as well as in rural areas, and at wholesale to a
non-affiliated utility and a municipality.

    MISSISSIPPI is engaged in the generation and purchase of electricity and the
distribution and sale of such energy within the 23 counties of southeastern
Mississippi, at retail in 123 communities (including Biloxi, Gulfport,
Hattiesburg, Laurel, Meridian and Pascagoula), as well as in rural areas, and at
wholesale to one municipality, six rural electric distribution cooperative
associations and one generating and transmitting cooperative.

    SAVANNAH is engaged, within a five-county area in eastern Georgia, in the
generation and purchase of electricity and the distribution and sale of such
electricity at retail and, as a member of the SOUTHERN system power pool, the
transmission and sale of wholesale energy.

    For information relating to kilowatt-hour sales by classification for each
registrant, reference is made to "Management's Discussion and Analysis-Results
of Operations" in Item 7 herein. Also, for information relating to the sources
of revenues for the SOUTHERN system and each of the operating companies,
reference is made to Item 6 herein.

    A portion of the area served by the operating companies adjoins the area
served by TVA and its municipal and cooperative distributors. An Act of Congress
limits the distribution of TVA power, unless otherwise authorized by Congress,
to specified areas or customers which generally were those served on July 1,
1957.

    The RUS has authority to make loans to cooperative associations or
corporations to enable them to provide electric service to customers in rural
sections of the country. There are 71 electric cooperative organizations
operating in the territory in which the operating companies provide electric
service at retail or wholesale.

    One of these, AEC, is a generating and transmitting cooperative selling
power to several distributing cooperatives, municipal systems and other
customers in south Alabama and northwest Florida. AEC owns generating units with
approximately 840 megawatts of nameplate capacity, including an undivided
ownership interest in ALABAMA's Plant Miller Units 1 and 2. AEC's facilities
were financed with RUS loans secured by long-term contracts requiring
distributing cooperatives to take their requirements from AEC to the extent such
energy is available. Two of the 14 distributing cooperatives operating in
ALABAMA's service territory obtain a portion of their power requirements
directly from ALABAMA.

    Four electric cooperative associations, financed by the RUS, operate within
GULF's service area. These cooperatives purchase their full requirements from
AEC and SEPA (a federal power marketing agency). A non-affiliated utility also
operates within GULF's service area and purchases its full requirements from
GULF.

    ALABAMA and GULF have entered into separate agreements with AEC involving
interconnection between the respective systems. The delivery of capacity and
energy from AEC to certain distributing cooperatives in the service areas of
ALABAMA and GULF is governed by the SOUTHERN/AEC Network Transmission Service
Agreement. The rates for this service to AEC are based on the negotiated
agreement on file with the FERC. See Item 2 - PROPERTIES - "Jointly-Owned
Facilities" herein for details of ALABAMA's joint-ownership with AEC of a
portion of Plant Miller.

    MISSISSIPPI has an interchange agreement with SMEPA, a generating and
transmitting cooperative, pursuant to which various services are provided,
including the furnishing of protective capacity by MISSISSIPPI to SMEPA. SMEPA
has a generating capacity of 1,947 megawatts and a transmission system estimated
to be 1,549 miles in length.

                                      I-9


    There are 43 electric cooperative organizations operating in, or in areas
adjoining, territory in the State of Georgia in which GEORGIA provides electric
service at retail or wholesale. Three of these organizations obtain their power
from TVA and one from other sources. OPC has a wholesale power contract with the
remaining 39 of these cooperative organizations. OPC utilizes self-owned
generation acquired from GEORGIA, megawatt capacity purchases from GEORGIA under
power supply agreements, and other arrangements to meet its power supply
obligations. Pursuant to the latest agreement entered into in April 1999, OPC
will purchase 250 megawatts of steam capacity through March 2006.

    There are 65 municipally-owned electric distribution systems operating in
the territory in which the operating companies provide electric service at
retail or wholesale.

    AMEA was organized under an act of the Alabama legislature and is comprised
of 11 municipalities. In 1986, ALABAMA entered into a firm power sales contract
with AMEA entitling AMEA to scheduled amounts of capacity (to a maximum of 100
megawatts) for a period of 15 years (1986 Contract). In October 1991, ALABAMA
entered into a second firm power purchase contract with AMEA entitling AMEA to
scheduled amounts of additional capacity (to a maximum 80 megawatts) for a
period of 15 years (1991 Contract). Under the terms of the contracts, ALABAMA
received payments from AMEA representing the net present value of the revenues
associated with the respective capacity entitlements. The 1986 Contract expired
in July 2001, however, the payments for the 1991 Contract will continue as
scheduled capacity is made available over the terms of the 1991 Contract. See
Note 6 to ALABAMA's financial statements in Item 8 herein for further
information on these contracts.

    Forty-eight municipally-owned electric distribution systems and one
county-owned system receive their requirements through MEAG, which was
established by a state statute in 1975. MEAG serves these requirements from
self-owned generation facilities acquired from GEORGIA, power purchased from
GEORGIA and purchases from other resources. In August 1997, a pseudo scheduling
and services agreement was implemented between GEORGIA and MEAG that replaced
the partial requirements tariff pursuant to which GEORGIA previously sold
wholesale energy to MEAG. Since 1977, Dalton has filled its requirements from
self-owned generation facilities acquired from GEORGIA and through purchases
from GEORGIA pursuant to their partial requirements tariff. One
municipally-owned electric distribution system's full requirements are served
under a market-based contract by GEORGIA. (See Item 2 - PROPERTIES -
"Jointly-Owned Facilities" herein.)

     GEORGIA has entered into substantially similar agreements with Georgia
Transmission Corporation (formerly OPC's transmission division), MEAG and Dalton
providing for the establishment of an integrated transmission system to carry
the power and energy of each. The agreements require an investment by each party
in the integrated transmission system in proportion to its respective share of
the aggregate system load. (See Item 2 - PROPERTIES - "Jointly-Owned Facilities"
herein.)

     SCS, acting on behalf of ALABAMA, GEORGIA, GULF, MISSISSIPPI and SAVANNAH,
also has a contract with SEPA providing for the use of those companies'
facilities at government expense to deliver to certain cooperatives and
municipalities, entitled by federal statute to preference in the purchase of
power from SEPA, quantities of power equivalent to the amounts of power
allocated to them by SEPA from certain United States government hydroelectric
projects.

    The retail service rights of all electric suppliers in the State of Georgia
are regulated by the 1973 State Territorial Electric Service Act. Pursuant to
the provisions of this Act, all areas within existing municipal limits were
assigned to the primary electric supplier therein on March 29, 1973 (451
municipalities, including Atlanta, Columbus, Macon, Augusta, Athens, Rome and
Valdosta, to GEORGIA; 115 to electric cooperatives; and 50 to publicly-owned
systems). Areas outside of such municipal limits were either to be assigned or
to be declared open for customer choice of supplier by action of the Georgia PSC
pursuant to standards set forth in the Act. Consistent with such standards, the
Georgia PSC has assigned substantially all of the land area in the state to a
supplier. Notwithstanding such assignments, the Act provides that any new
customer locating outside of 1973 municipal limits and having a connected load
of at least 900 kilowatts may receive electric service from the supplier of its
choice. (See also Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" herein.)

                                      I-10


     Under and subject to the provisions of its franchises and concessions and
the 1973 State Territorial Electric Service Act, SAVANNAH has the full but
nonexclusive right to serve the City of Savannah, the Towns of Bloomingdale,
Pooler, Garden City, Guyton, Newington, Oliver, Port Wentworth, Rincon, Tybee
Island, Springfield, Thunderbolt and Vernonburg, and in conjunction with a
secondary supplier, the Town of Richmond Hill. In addition, SAVANNAH has been
assigned certain unincorporated areas in Chatham, Effingham, Bryan, Bulloch and
Screven Counties by the Georgia PSC. (See also Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition"
herein.)

     Pursuant to the 1956 Utility Act, the Mississippi PSC issued "Grandfather
Certificates" of public convenience and necessity to MISSISSIPPI and to six
distribution rural cooperatives operating in southeastern Mississippi, then
served in whole or in part by MISSISSIPPI, authorizing them to distribute
electricity in certain specified geographically described areas of the state.
The six cooperatives serve approximately 300,000 retail customers in a
certificated area of approximately 10,300 square miles. In areas included in a
"Grandfather Certificate," the utility holding such certificate may, without
further certification, extend its lines up to five miles; other extensions
within that area by such utility, or by other utilities, may not be made except
upon a showing of, and a grant of a certificate of, public convenience and
necessity. Areas included in such a certificate which are subsequently annexed
to municipalities may continue to be served by the holder of the certificate,
irrespective of whether it has a franchise in the annexing municipality. On the
other hand, the holder of the municipal franchise may not extend service into
such newly annexed area without authorization by the Mississippi PSC.

Long-Term Power Sales and Lease Agreements

The operating companies have long-term contractual agreements for the sale and
lease of capacity to certain non-affiliated utilities located outside the
SOUTHERN system service area. These agreements are firm and related to specific
generating units. Because the energy is generally provided at cost under these
agreements, profitability is primarily affected by capacity revenues.

    Unit power from specific generating plants is currently being sold to FP&L,
FPC and JEA. Under these agreements, approximately 1,500 megawatts of capacity
is scheduled to be sold annually unless reduced by FP&L, FPC and JEA for the
periods after 2001 with a minimum of three years notice, until the expiration of
the contracts in 2010.

    Southern Power and MISSISSIPPI have operating leases for portions of their
generating unit capacity.

    Reference is made to Note 5 to the financial statements for SOUTHERN; Note 6
to the financial statements for ALABAMA, GULF and MISSISSIPPI and Note 7 to the
financial statements for GEORGIA in Item 8 herein for additional information
regarding contracts for the sales and lease of capacity and energy to
non-territorial customers.

Competition

The electric utility industry in the United States is continuing to evolve as a
result of regulatory and competitive factors. Among the primary agents of change
has been the Energy Act. The Energy Act allows IPPs to access a utility's
transmission network in order to sell electricity to other utilities. This
enhances the incentive for IPPs to build cogeneration plants for a utility's
large industrial and commercial customers and sell energy generation to other
utilities. Also, electricity sales for resale rates are affected by wholesale
transmission access and numerous potential new energy suppliers, including power
marketers and brokers.

     Although the Energy Act does not permit retail customer access, it has been
a major catalyst for the recent restructuring and consolidations taking place
within the utility industry. Numerous federal and state initiatives are in
varying stages that promote wholesale and retail competition. Among other
things, these initiatives allow customers to choose their electricity provider.
Some states have approved initiatives that result in a separation of the
ownership and/or operation of generating facilities from the ownership and/or
operation of transmission and distribution facilities. While various
restructuring and competition initiatives have been discussed in Alabama,
Florida, Georgia and Mississippi, none have been enacted. Enactment would
require numerous issues to be resolved, including significant ones relating to
recovery of any stranded investments, full cost recovery of energy produced and

                                      I-11


other issues related to the energy crisis that occurred in California. As a
result of that crisis, many states have either discontinued or delayed
implementation of initiatives involving retail deregulation.

     Reference is made to Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Certain Factors Affecting the
Industry" herein for information relating to SOUTHERN's RTO filing with the
FERC.

     Continuing to be a low-cost producer could provide opportunities to
increase market share and profitability in markets that evolve with changing
regulation. Conversely, if SOUTHERN's electric utilities do not remain low-cost
producers and provide quality service, then energy sales growth could be
limited, and this could significantly erode earnings. Reference is made to
ALABAMA, GEORGIA, GULF, MISSISSIPPI and SAVANNAH, "Management's Discussion and
Analysis - Future Earnings Potential" in Item 7 herein for further discussion of
rate matters.

     To adapt to a less regulated, more competitive environment, SOUTHERN
continues to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential business
strategies. These strategies may include business combinations, acquisitions
involving other utility or non-utility businesses or properties, internal
restructuring, disposition of certain assets or some combination thereof.
Furthermore, SOUTHERN may engage in new business ventures that arise from
competitive and regulatory changes in the utility industry. Pursuit of any of
the above strategies, or any combination thereof, may significantly affect the
business operations and financial condition of SOUTHERN. (See Item 1 - BUSINESS
- - "Southern Power" and "Other Business" herein.)

     As a result of the foregoing factors, SOUTHERN has experienced increasing
competition for available off-system sales of capacity and energy from
neighboring utilities and alternative sources of energy. Additionally, the
future effect of cogeneration and small-power production facilities on the
SOUTHERN system cannot currently be determined but may be adverse.

     SOUTHERN is working to maintain and expand its share of wholesale energy
sales in the Southeastern power markets. In January 2001, SOUTHERN formed a new
subsidiary - Southern Power. This subsidiary constructs, owns and manages
wholesale generating assets in the Southeast. Southern Power will be the primary
growth engine for SOUTHERN's competitive wholesale market-based energy business.
By the end of 2003, Southern Power plans to have approximately 4,700 megawatts
of generating capacity in commercial operation. At December 31, 2001, 800
megawatts were in commercial operation and some 3,900 megawatts of capacity are
under construction.

     ALABAMA currently has cogeneration contracts in effect with 10 industrial
customers. Under the terms of these contracts, ALABAMA purchases excess
generation of such companies. During 2001, ALABAMA purchased approximately 154
million kilowatt-hours from such companies at a cost of $5.5 million.

     GEORGIA currently has contracts in effect with nine small power producers
whereby GEORGIA purchases their excess generation. During 2001, GEORGIA
purchased 13.6 million kilowatt-hours from such companies at a cost of $355,000.
GEORGIA has purchased power agreements for electricity with two cogeneration
facilities. Payments are subject to reductions for failure to meet minimum
capacity output. During 2001, GEORGIA purchased 621.7 million kilowatt-hours at
a cost of $52.3 million from these facilities. Reference is made to Note 4 to
the financial statements for GEORGIA in Item 8 herein for information regarding
purchased power commitments.

     GULF currently has agreements in effect with four industrial customers
pursuant to which GULF purchases "as available" energy from customer-owned
generation. During 2001, GULF purchased 114 million kilowatt-hours from such
companies for $3.4 million.

     SAVANNAH currently has cogeneration contracts in effect with four large
customers. Under the terms of these contracts, SAVANNAH purchases excess
generation of such companies. During 2001, SAVANNAH purchased 41.2 million
kilowatt-hours from such companies at a cost of $1.4 million.

     The competition for retail energy sales among competing suppliers of energy
is influenced by various factors, including price, availability, technological
advancements and reliability. These factors are, in turn, affected by, among
other influences, regulatory, political and environmental considerations,
taxation and supply.


                                      I-12


     The operating companies have experienced, and expect to continue to
experience, competition in their respective retail service territories in
varying degrees as the result of self-generation (as described above) and fuel
switching by customers and other factors. (See also Item 1 - BUSINESS -
"Territory Served by the Operating Companies" herein for information concerning
suppliers of electricity operating within or near the areas served at retail by
the operating companies.)

Regulation

State Commissions

The operating companies are subject to the jurisdiction of their respective
state regulatory commissions, which have broad powers of supervision and
regulation over public utilities operating in the respective states, including
their rates, service regulations, sales of securities (except for the
Mississippi PSC) and, in the cases of the Georgia PSC and Mississippi PSC, in
part, retail service territories. (See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Rate Matters" and
"Territory Served by the Operating Companies" herein.)

Holding Company Act

SOUTHERN is registered as a holding company under the Holding Company Act, and
it and its subsidiary companies are subject to the regulatory provisions of said
Act, including provisions relating to the issuance of securities, sales and
acquisitions of securities and utility assets, services performed by SCS and
Southern Nuclear and the activities of certain of SOUTHERN's other subsidiaries.

     While various proposals have been introduced in Congress regarding the
Holding Company Act, the prospects for legislative reform or repeal are
uncertain at this time.

Federal Power Act

The Federal Power Act subjects the operating companies, Southern Power and SEGCO
to regulation by the FERC as companies engaged in the transmission or sale at
wholesale of electric energy in interstate commerce, including regulation of
accounting policies and practices.

     ALABAMA and GEORGIA are also subject to the provisions of the Federal Power
Act or the earlier Federal Water Power Act applicable to licensees with respect
to their hydroelectric developments. Among the hydroelectric projects subject to
licensing by the FERC are 14 existing ALABAMA generating stations having an
aggregate installed capacity of 1,593,600 kilowatts and 18 existing GEORGIA
generating stations having an aggregate installed capacity of 1,074,696
kilowatts.

     GEORGIA started the relicensing process for the Middle Chattahoochee
Project in 1998. This project consists of the Goat Rock, Oliver and North
Highlands facilities.

     GEORGIA and OPC also have a license, expiring in 2027, for the Rocky
Mountain Plant, a pure pumped storage facility of 847,800 kilowatt capacity
which began commercial operation in 1995. (See Item 2 - PROPERTIES -
"Jointly-Owned Facilities" herein.)

     Licenses for all projects, excluding those discussed above, expire in the
period 2007-2033 in the case of ALABAMA's projects and in the period 2005-2039
in the case of GEORGIA's projects.

     Upon or after the expiration of each license, the United States Government,
by act of Congress, may take over the project or the FERC may relicense the
project either to the original licensee or to a new licensee. In the event of
takeover or relicensing to another, the original licensee is to be compensated
in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Power Act, such compensation to
reflect the net investment of the licensee in the project, not in excess of the
fair value of the property taken, plus reasonable damages to other property of
the licensee resulting from the severance therefrom of the property taken.

Atomic Energy Act of 1954

ALABAMA, GEORGIA and Southern Nuclear are subject to the provisions of the
Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, which vests jurisdiction in the NRC over
the construction and operation of nuclear reactors, particularly with regard to
certain public health and safety and antitrust matters. The National
Environmental Policy Act has been construed to expand the jurisdiction of the
NRC to consider the environmental impact of a facility licensed under the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended.


                                      I-13


     NRC operating licenses currently expire in June 2017 and March 2021 for
Plant Farley units 1 and 2, respectively, and in January 2027 and February 2029
for Plant Vogtle units 1 and 2, respectively. In January 2002, the NRC granted
GEORGIA a 20-year extension of the licenses for both units at Plant Hatch which
permits the operation of units 1 and 2 until 2034 and 2038, respectively.

     Reference is made to Notes 1 and 10 to
SOUTHERN's financial statements, Notes 1 and 9 to ALABAMA's financial statements
and Notes 1 and 5 to GEORGIA's financial statements in Item 8 herein for
information on nuclear decommissioning costs and nuclear insurance.
Additionally, Note 3 to GEORGIA's financial statements contains information
regarding nuclear performance standards imposed by the Georgia PSC that may
impact retail rates.

Environmental Regulation

The operating companies' and SEGCO's operations are subject to federal, state
and local environmental requirements which, among other things, control
emissions of particulates, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the air; the
use, transportation, storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic waste; and
discharges of pollutants, including thermal discharges, into waters of the
United States. The operating companies and SEGCO expect to comply with such
requirements, which generally are becoming increasingly stringent, through
technical improvements, the use of appropriate combinations of low-sulfur fuel
and chemicals, addition of environmental control facilities, changes in control
techniques and reduction of the operating levels of generating facilities.
Failure to comply with such requirements could result in the complete shutdown
of individual facilities not in compliance as well as the imposition of civil
and criminal penalties.

     In November 1990, the Clean Air Act was signed into law. Title IV of the
Clean Air Act - the acid rain compliance provision of the law - significantly
affected SOUTHERN. Reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions
from fossil-fired generating plants were required in two phases. Phase I
compliance began in 1995. SOUTHERN achieved Phase I compliance at its affected
plants by primarily switching to low-sulfur coal and with some equipment
upgrades. Construction expenditures for Phase I nitrogen oxide and sulfur
dioxide emissions compliance totaled approximately $300 million. Phase II sulfur
dioxide compliance was required in 2000. SOUTHERN used emission allowances and
fuel switching to comply with Phase II requirements. Also, equipment to control
nitrogen oxide emissions was installed on additional system fossil-fired units
as necessary to meet Phase II limits and ozone non-attainment requirements for
metropolitan Atlanta through 2000. Compliance for Phase II and initial ozone
non-attainment requirements increased total construction expenditures through
2000 by approximately $100 million.

     Respective state plans to address the one-hour ozone non-attainment
standards for the Atlanta and Birmingham areas have been established and must be
implemented in May 2003. Seven generating plants in the Atlanta area and two
plants in the Birmingham area will be affected. Construction expenditures for
compliance with these new rules are currently estimated at approximately $940
million, of which $520 million remains to be spent.

     A significant portion of costs related to the acid rain and ozone
non-attainment provisions of the Clean Air Act is expected to be recovered
through existing ratemaking provision. However, there can be no assurance that
all Clean Air Act costs will be recovered.

     In July 1997, the EPA revised the national ambient air quality standards
for ozone and particulate matter. This revision made the standards significantly
more stringent. In the subsequent litigation of these standards, the U.S.
Supreme Court found the EPA's implementation program for the new ozone standard
unlawful and remanded it to the EPA. In addition, the Federal District of
Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals is considering other legal challenges to these
standards. A court decision is expected in the spring of 2002. If the standards
are eventually upheld, implementation could be required by 2007 to 2010.

     In September 1998, the EPA issued regional nitrogen oxide reduction rules
to the states for implementation. The final rule affects 21 states, including
Alabama and Georgia. Compliance is required by May 31, 2004, for most states,
including Alabama. For Georgia, further rulemaking was required, and proposed

                                      I-14




compliance was delayed until May 1, 2005. Additional construction expenditures
for compliance with these new rules are currently estimated at approximately
$190 million.

     In December 2000, having completed its utility studies for mercury and
other hazardous air pollutants (HAPS), the EPA issued a determination that an
emission control program for mercury and, perhaps, other HAPS is warranted. The
program is being developed under the Maximum Achievable Control Technology
provisions of the Clear Air Act, and the regulations are scheduled to be
finalized by the end of 2004 with implementation to take place around 2007. In
January 2001, the EPA proposed guidance for the determination of Best Available
Retrofit Technology (BART) emission controls under the Regional Haze
Regulations. Installation of BART controls is expected to take place around
2010. Litigation of the Regional Haze Regulations, including the BART
provisions, is ongoing in the Federal District of Columbia Circuit Court of
Appeals. A court decision is expected in mid-2002.

     Implementation of the final state rules for these initiatives could require
substantial further reduction in nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide and
reductions in mercury and other HAPS emission from fossil-fired generating
facilities and other industries in these states. Additional compliance costs and
capital expenditures resulting from the implementation of these rules and
standards cannot be determined until the results of legal challenges are known,
and the states have adopted their final rules.

     In October 1997, the EPA issued regulations setting forth requirements for
Compliance Assurance Monitoring in its state and federal operating permit
programs. These regulations were amended by the EPA in March 2001 in response to
a court order resolving challenges to the rules brought by environmental groups
and the utility industry. Generally, this rule affects the operation and
maintenance of electrostatic precipitators and could involve significant
additional ongoing expense.

     The EPA and state environmental regulatory agencies are reviewing and
evaluating various other matters including: control strategies to reduce
regional haze; limits on pollutant discharges to impaired waters; cooling water
intake restrictions; and hazardous waste disposal requirements. The impact of
any new standards will depend on the development and implementation of
applicable regulations.

     SOUTHERN must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that
cover the handling and disposal of hazardous waste. Under these various laws and
regulations, the subsidiaries could incur substantial costs to clean up
properties. The subsidiaries conduct studies to determine the extent of any
required cleanup and have recognized in their respective financial statements
costs to clean up known sites. These costs for SOUTHERN amounted to $1 million
in 2001 and $4 million in both 2000 and 1999. Additional sites may require
environmental remediation for which the subsidiaries may be liable for a portion
or all required cleanup costs.

     Several major pieces of environmental legislation are periodically
considered for reauthorization or amendment by Congress. These include : the
Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the
Toxic Substances Control Act; and the Endangered Species Act. Changes to these
laws could affect many areas of SOUTHERN's operations. The full impact of any
such changes cannot be determined at this time.

     Compliance with possible additional legislation related to global climate
change, electromagnetic fields, and other environmental and health concerns
could significantly affect SOUTHERN. The impact of new legislation - if any -
will depend on the subsequent development and implementation of applicable
regulations. In addition, the potential exists for liability as a result of
lawsuits alleging damages caused by electromagnetic fields.

     Reference is made to each registrant's "Management's Discussion and
Analysis" in Item 7 herein for a discussion of the Clean Air Act and other
environmental legislation and proceedings. Also see Item 3 - "Legal
Proceedings", herein for information about a lawsuit brought on behalf of the
EPA.

     * Amounts are less than $1 million.

     The foregoing estimates are included in the current construction programs.
(See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Construction Programs" herein.)

     Additionally, each operating company and SEGCO has incurred costs for
environmental remediation of various sites. Reference is made to each
registrant's "Management's Discussion and Analysis" in Item 7 herein for
information regarding the registrants' environmental remediation efforts. Also,
see Note 3 to SOUTHERN's and GEORGIA's financial statements in Item 8 herein for
information regarding the identification of sites that may require environmental
remediation by GEORGIA.

     The operating companies and SEGCO are unable to predict at this time what
additional steps they may be required to take as a result of the implementation
of existing or future quality control requirements for air, water and hazardous
or toxic materials, but such steps could adversely affect system operations and
result in substantial additional costs.

     The outcome of the matters mentioned above under "Regulation" cannot now be
determined, except that these developments may result in delays in obtaining
appropriate licenses for generating facilities, increased construction and
operating costs, or reduced generation, the nature and extent of which, while
not determinable at this time, could be substantial.

Rate Matters

Rate Structure

The rates and service regulations of the operating companies are uniform for
each class of service throughout their respective service areas. Rates for
residential electric service are generally of the block type based upon
kilowatt-hours used and include minimum charges.

     Residential and other rates contain separate customer charges. Rates for
commercial service are presently of the block type and, for large customers, the
billing demand is generally used to determine capacity and minimum bill charges.
These large customers' rates are generally based upon usage by the customer
including those with special features to encourage off-peak usage. Additionally,
the operating companies are allowed by their respective PSCs to negotiate the
terms and compensation of service to large customers. Such terms and
compensation of service, however, are subject to final PSC approval. ALABAMA,
GEORGIA and SAVANNAH are allowed by state law to recover fuel and net purchased
energy costs through fuel cost recovery provisions which are adjusted to reflect
increases or decreases in such costs. GULF recovers from retail customers costs
of fuel, net purchased power, energy conservation and environmental compliance
through provisions which are adjusted to reflect increases or decreases in such
costs. GULF's recovery of these costs is based upon an annual projection - any
over/under recovery during such period is reflected in a subsequent annual
period with interest. With respect to MISSISSIPPI's retail rates, fuel and
purchased power costs are billed to such customers under the fuel adjustment
clause and energy costs management clause. The adjustment factors for
MISSISSIPPI's retail and wholesale rates are generally levelized based on the
estimated energy cost for the year, adjusted for any actual over/under
collection from the previous year. Revenues are adjusted for differences between
recoverable fuel costs and amounts actually recovered in current rates.

Rate Proceedings

Reference is made to MISSISSIPPI's "Management's Discussion and Analysis" in
Item 7 and to Note 3 to each registrant's financial statements in Item 8 herein
for a discussion of rate matters.

                                      I-16


     In February 2002, MISSISSIPPI reached an agreement with certain of its
wholesale customers to increase its wholesale tariff rates effective June 2002.
MISSISSIPPI filed the settlement agreement with the FERC on March 5, 2002. The
FERC has 60 days to either set the issue for hearing with the proposed rates
subject to refund or let the new rates go into effect as filed. The agreement
results in an annual increase of approximately $10.5 million and the adoption of
an Energy Cost Management Clause similar to the one approved by MISSISSIPPI's
retail jurisdiction (see Note 1 to MISSISSIPPI's financial statements in Item 8
herein). In addition, MISSISSIPPI and its customers agreed that neither party
would seek a unilateral change to the new rates prior to December 31, 2003,
except for changes due to the operation of the fuel adjustment and energy cost
management clauses. Though the FERC has accepted settlement agreements as filed
in the past, the ultimate outcome of this matter before the FERC cannot now be
determined.

     On March 5, 2002, the Alabama PSC approved a revision to ALABAMA's rates
that provide for periodic adjustments based upon ALABAMA's earned return on
end-of-period retail common equity. This revision provides for an annual, rather
than quarterly, adjustment and imposes a 3 percent limit on any such annual
adjustment. A 2 percent increase in retail rates will become effective in April
2002 in accordance with the Rate Stabilization Equalization Plan. The return on
common equity range of 13.0 to 14.5 percent remains unchanged. The Alabama PSC
also accepted ALABAMA's proposal to lower the energy cost recovery factor for
the billing months April 2002 through December 2002.

Integrated Resource Planning

In July 2001, the Georgia PSC approved the GEORGIA and SAVANNAH 2001 Integrated
Resource Plan, which was filed on January 31, 2001. The plans specify how
GEORGIA and SAVANNAH each intends to meet the future electrical needs of its
customers through a combination of demand-side and supply-side resources. The
Georgia PSC must pre-certify these new resources. Once certified, all prudently
incurred construction costs and purchase power costs will be recoverable through
rates.

     In July 2001, the Georgia PSC approved GEORGIA's 2003/04 certification
request, which was filed December 15, 2000, for approximately 1,800 megawatts of
purchased power and 12 megawatts of upgraded hydro generation. This
certification request included a seven-year PPA with Southern Power for two
gas-fired combined cycle units that will be constructed at Plant Goat Rock. The
first unit is designed to produce approximately 570 megawatts starting in 2003,
with approximately 370 megawatts being available by June 2002. The second unit
is designed to produce approximately 610 megawatts starting in 2004, with
approximately 400 megawatts being available by June 2003. Also, a capacity
upgrade of 12 megawatts was approved for the existing Goat Rock hydro units 1
and 2. In addition, this certification request included a seven-year PPA with
Southern Power for a gas fired combined cycle generating unit to be constructed
at Plant Autaugaville in Alabama. The unit is designed to produce approximately
610 megawatts starting in 2004. Based on an agreement with the Georgia PSC, the
seven-year term of the PPA was modified to be 15 years.

     In April 2001, GEORGIA and SAVANNAH issued an RFP for their 2005/06
resource needs of approximately 2,500 megawatts. At the request of the Georgia
PSC, this RFP requested all types of generation resources including coal and
nuclear. The bids received from this RFP totaled more than 25,000 megawatts
including over 1,800 megawatts of coal offers. As required by the Georgia PSC's
2001 IRP order, GEORGIA developed a self-build coal offer to be compared to the
bid received through the RFP. In conjunction with the Georgia PSC, an economic
analysis of the coal proposals was completed and the results indicated that the
coal resources were not economical as compared to gas-fired generation at this
point in time. Therefore, the Georgia PSC relieved GEORGIA of its obligation to
continue to develop a coal self-build proposal. At the present time, the bids
from this RFP are being analyzed and the best-cost projects will be selected.
Once the PPAs have been completed for the selected projects, GEORGIA and
SAVANNAH will file for certification of these PPAs by summer of 2002.
GEORGIA and SAVANNAH expect the Georgia PSC to approve the certification request
in the fall of 2002.

                                      I-17



Environmental Cost Recovery Plans

In 1993, the Florida Legislature adopted legislation for an Environmental Cost
Recovery Clause (ECRC), which allows a utility, including GULF, to petition the
Florida PSC for recovery of prudent environmental compliance costs that are not
being recovered through base rates or any other recovery mechanism. Such
environmental costs include operation and maintenance expense, emission
allowance expense, depreciation and a return on invested capital.

     In 1992, the Mississippi PSC approved MISSISSIPPI's Environmental
Compliance Overview Plan (ECO Plan). The ECO Plan establishes procedures to
facilitate the Mississippi PSC's overview of MISSISSIPPI's environmental
strategy and provides for recovery of costs (including costs of capital
associated with environmental projects approved by the Mississippi PSC). Under
the ECO Plan, any increase in the annual revenue requirement is limited to 2
percent of retail revenues. However, the ECO Plan also provides for carryover of
any amount over the 2 percent limit into the next year's revenue requirement.
MISSISSIPPI conducts studies, when possible, to determine the extent of any
required environmental remediation. Should such remediation be determined to be
probable, reasonable estimates of costs to clean up such sites are developed and
recognized in the financial statements. MISSISSIPPI recovers such costs under
the ECO Plan as they are incurred, as provided for in MISSISSIPPI's 1995 ECO
Plan order. MISSISSIPPI filed its 2002 ECO Plan in January 2002, which, if
approved as filed, will result in a slight increase in customer prices.

Employee Relations

The SOUTHERN system had a total of 26,122 employees on its payroll at December
31, 2001.

     The operating companies have separate agreements with local unions of the
IBEW generally covering wages, working conditions and procedures for handling
grievances and arbitration. These agreements apply with certain exceptions to
operating, maintenance and construction employees.

     ALABAMA has agreements with the IBEW on a three-year contract extending to
August 14, 2005. Upon notice given at least 60 days prior to that date,
negotiations may be initiated with respect to agreement terms to be effective
after such date.

     GEORGIA has an agreement with the IBEW covering wages and working
conditions, which is in effect through June 30, 2002.

     GULF has an agreement with the IBEW on a three-year contract extending to
August 15, 2005.

    MISSISSIPPI has an agreement with the IBEW on a four-year contract extending
to August 16, 2002.

     SAVANNAH has four-year labor agreements with the IBEW and the Office and
Professional Employees International Union that expire April 15, 2003 and
December 1, 2003, respectively.

     Southern Nuclear has agreements with the IBEW on a five-year contract
extending to August 15, 2006 for Plant Farley and a three-year contract
extending to June 30, 2002 for Plants Hatch and Vogtle. Upon notice given at

                                      I-18


least 60 days prior to these dates, negotiations may be initiated with respect
to agreement terms to be effective after such dates.

    Southern Nuclear is currently in negotiations with the Security, Police and
Fire Professionals of America (formerly the United Plant Guard Workers of
America) at Plant Hatch. The prior contract with the United Plant Guard Workers
of America which extended to September 30, 2001 was not terminated, so the terms
of the existing agreement have continued as negotiations of the new agreement
continues. The parties will have the opportunity to terminate the agreement 60
days prior to October 1, 2002 if no agreement is reached prior to that time.

    The agreements also subject the terms of the pension plans for the companies
discussed above to collective bargaining with the unions at five-year intervals.

Notes:
    (1)  For additional information regarding facilities jointly-owned with
         non-affiliated parties, see Item 2 - PROPERTIES - "Jointly-Owned
         Facilities" herein.
    (2)  Owned by ALABAMA and MISSISSIPPI as
         tenants in common in the proportions of 60% and 40%, respectively.
    (3)  Excludes the capacity owned by AEC.
    (4)  Capacity shown for GEORGIA is 8.4% of Units 1 and 2 and 75% of Unit 3.
         Capacity shown for GULF is 25% of Unit 3.
    (5)  Capacity shown is GEORGIA's portion (53.5%) of total plant capacity.
    (6)  Represents 50% of the plant which is owned as tenants in common by
         GULF and MISSISSIPPI.
    (7)  SEGCO is jointly-owned by ALABAMA and GEORGIA.  (See Item 1 - BUSINESS
         herein.)
    (8)  Capacity shown is GEORGIA's portion (50.1%) of total plant capacity.
    (9)  Capacity shown is GEORGIA's portion (45.7%) of total plant capacity.
   (10)  Capacity shown represents 33-1/3% of total plant capacity. GEORGIA owns
         a 1/3 interest in the unit with 100% use of the unit from June through
         September. FPC operates the unit.
   (11)  Generation is dedicated to a single industrial customer.

         OPC operates the plant.
                                      I-21




     Except as discussed below under "Titles to Property," the principal plants
and other important units of the operating companies, Southern Power and SEGCO
are owned in fee by the respective companies. It is the opinion of management of
each such company that its operating properties are adequately maintained and
are substantially in good operating condition.

     MISSISSIPPI owns a 79-mile length of 500-kilovolt transmission line which
is leased to Entergy Gulf States. The line, completed in 1984, extends from
Plant Daniel to the Louisiana state line. Entergy Gulf States is paying a use
fee over a forty-year period covering all expenses and the amortization of the
original $57 million cost of the line. At December 31, 2001, the unamortized
portion of this cost was approximately $33.3 million.

     The all-time maximum demand on the operating companies and SEGCO was
31,359,000 kilowatts and occurred in August 2000. This amount excludes demand
served by capacity retained by MEAG and Dalton and excludes demand associated
with power purchased from OPC and SEPA by its preference customers. The reserve
margin for the operating companies and SEGCO at that time was 8.1%. For
additional information on peak demands, reference is made to Item 6 - SELECTED
FINANCIAL DATA herein.

    ALABAMA and GEORGIA will incur significant costs in decommissioning their
nuclear units at the end of their useful lives. (See Item 1 - BUSINESS -
"Regulation - Atomic Energy Act of 1954" and Note 1 to SOUTHERN's, ALABAMA's and
GEORGIA's financial statements in Item 8 herein.)

Jointly-Owned Facilities

ALABAMA and GEORGIA have sold and GEORGIA has purchased undivided interests in
certain generating plants and other related facilities to or from non-affiliated
parties. The percentages of ownership resulting from these transactions are as
follows:



     ALABAMA and GEORGIA have contracted to operate and maintain the respective
units in which each has an interest (other than Rocky Mountain and Intercession
City, as described below) as agent for the joint owners.

     In addition, GEORGIA has commitments regarding a portion of a 5 percent
interest in Plant Vogtle owned by MEAG that are in effect until the later of
retirement of the plant or the latest stated maturity date of MEAG's bonds
issued to finance such ownership interest. The payments for capacity are
required whether any capacity is available. The energy cost is a function of
each unit's variable operating costs. Except for the portion of the capacity
payments related to the 1987 and 1990 write-offs of Plant Vogtle costs, the
cost of such capacity and energy is included in purchased power from
non-affiliates in GEORGIA's Statements of Income in Item 8 herein.

                                      I-22



    Additional jointly-owned facilities also include Southern Power's 65%
undivided interest in Stanton Unit A and related facilities jointly owned with
the Orlando Utilities Commission, the Kissimmee Utility Authority and the
Florida Municipal Power Agency. Currently under construction near Orlando,
Florida, this project will be a 610 megawatt combined cycle unit and is
scheduled for commerical operation in October 2003.

Titles to Property

The operating companies', Southern Power's and SEGCO's interests in the
principal plants (other than certain pollution control facilities, one small
hydroelectric generating station leased by GEORGIA, MISSISSIPPI's combined cycle
units at Plant Daniel and the land on which five combustion turbine generators
of MISSISSIPPI are located, which is held by easement) and other important units
of the respective companies are owned in fee by such companies, subject only to
the liens of applicable mortgage indentures of ALABAMA, GULF, MISSISSIPPI and
SAVANNAH and to excepted encumbrances as defined therein. The operating
companies own the fee interests in certain of their principal plants as tenants
in common. (See Item 2 - PROPERTIES - "Jointly-Owned Facilities" herein.)
Properties such as electric transmission and distribution lines and steam
heating mains are constructed principally on rights-of-way which are maintained
under franchise or are held by easement only. A substantial portion of lands
submerged by reservoirs is held under flood right easements. In substantially
all of its coal reserve lands, SEGCO owns or will own the coal only, with
adequate rights for the mining and removal thereof.

Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

(1)    United States of America v. ALABAMA
       (United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama)

       On November 3, 1999, the EPA brought a civil action in the U.S. District
       Court in Georgia against ALABAMA. The complaint alleges violations of the
       New Source Review provisions of the Clean Air Act with respect to
       coal-fired generating facilities at ALABAMA's Plants Miller, Barry and
       Gorgas. The civil action requests penalties and injunctive relief,
       including an order requiring the installation of the best available
       control technology at the affected units. The Clean Air Act authorizes
       civil penalties of up to $27,500 per day, per violation at each
       generating unit. Prior to January 30, 1997, the penalty was $25,000 per
       day. The EPA concurrently issued a notice of violation relating to these
       specific facilities, as well as Plants Greene County and Gaston. On
       August 1, 2000, the U.S. District Court granted ALABAMA's motion to
       dismiss for lack of jurisdiction in Georgia. On January 12, 2001, the EPA
       re-filed its claims against ALABAMA in federal district court in
       Birmingham, Alabama. ALABAMA's case has been stayed since the spring of
       2001, pending a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
       Circuit in the appeal of a very similar New Source Review enforcement
       action against the TVA. The TVA case involves many of the same legal
       issues raised by the actions against ALABAMA. Because the outcome of the
       TVA case could have a significant adverse impact on ALABAMA, ALABAMA is
       party to that case as well.

       ALABAMA believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA's
       regulations and interpretations in effect at the time the work in
       question took place. An adverse outcome of this matter could require
       substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time
       and possibly require payment of substantial penalties.

(2)    United States of America v. GEORGIA and SAVANNAH
       (United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia)

       On November 3, 1999, the EPA brought a civil action in the U.S. District
       Court in Georgia against GEORGIA. The complaint alleges violation of the
       New Source Review provisions of the Clean Air Act with respect to
       coal-fired generating facilities at GEORGIA's Plants Bowen and Scherer.
       The civil action requests penalties and injunctive relief, including an
       order requiring the installation of the best available control technology
       at the affected units. The Clean Air Act authorizes civil penalties of up
       to $27,500 per day, per violation at each generating unit. Prior to
       January 30, 1997, the penalty was $25,000 per day. On March 27, 2001, the
       U.S. District Court granted the EPA's motion to amend its complaint to
       add the alleged violations at SAVANNAH's Plant Kraft and to add SAVANNAH
       as a defendant. The EPA concurrently issued a notice of violation
       relating to these two GEORGIA plants and SAVANNAH's Plant Kraft.

       The case has been stayed since the spring of 2001, pending a ruling by
       the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in the appeal of a
       very similar New Source Review enforcement action against the TVA. The
       TVA case involves many of the same legal issues raised by the actions
       against GEORGIA and SAVANNAH. Because the outcome of the TVA case could
       have a significant adverse impact on GEORGIA and SAVANNAH, both GEORGIA
       and SAVANNAH are party to that case as well.

       GEORGIA and SAVANNAH believe that they complied with applicable laws and
       the EPA's regulations and interpretations in effect at the time the work
       in question took place. An adverse outcome of this matter could require
       substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time
       and possibly require payment of substantial penalties.

                                      I-24



Item 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS (continued)

(3)    Cooper et al. v. GEORGIA, SOUTHERN, SCS and Energy Solutions
       (Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia)

       On July 28, 2000, a lawsuit alleging race discrimination was filed by
       three GEORGIA employees against GEORGIA, SOUTHERN, and SCS in the
       Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia. Shortly thereafter, the lawsuit
       was removed to the United States District Court for the Northern District
       of Georgia. The lawsuit also raised claims on behalf of a purported
       class. The plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages in an
       unspecified amount, as well as injunctive relief. On August 14, 2000, the
       lawsuit was amended to add four more plaintiffs. Also, an additional
       subsidiary of SOUTHERN, Energy Solutions (now Southern Management
       Development), was named a defendant.

       On October 11, 2001, the district court denied the plaintiffs' motion for
       class certification. The plaintiffs filed a motion to reconsider the
       order denying class certification, and the court denied the plaintiffs'
       motion to reconsider. On December 28, 2001, the plaintiffs filed a
       petition in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit
       seeking permission to file an appeal of the October 11 decision. On March
       15, 2002, the Eleventh Circuit denied the plaintiffs' petition; thus, the
       plaintiffs may not appeal the October 11 decision until the seven
       individual cases are resolved in the district court. Discovery on the
       seven named plaintiffs' individual claims that remain in the case is
       ongoing. The final outcome of the case cannot now be determined.

(4)    GEORGIA has been designated as a potentially responsible party at sites
       governed by the Georgia Hazardous Site Response Act and/or by the federal
       Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act.

       In addition, in 1995 the EPA designated GEORGIA and four other unrelated
       entities as potentially responsible parties at a site in Brunswick,
       Georgia that is listed on the federal National Priorities List. GEORGIA
       has contributed to the removal and remedial investigation and feasibility
       study costs for the site. Additional claims for recovery of natural
       resource damages at the site are anticipated.

       The final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.

       Reference is made to Note 3 to SOUTHERN's and GEORGIA's financial
       statements in Item 8 herein under the captions "Georgia Power Potentially
       Responsible Party Status" and "Other Environmental Contingencies,"
       respectively.

(5)    In re: Mobile Energy Services Company, LLC; In re: Mobile Energy
       Services Holdings, Inc.
       (U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Alabama).

       On August 4, 2000, MESH filed a proposed plan of reorganization with the
       U.S. Bankruptcy Court. The proposed plan of reorganization was most
       recently amended on October 15, 2001. SOUTHERN expects that approval of a
       plan of reorganization would result in either a termination of SOUTHERN's
       ownership interest in MESH or the exchange of all assets of MESH for the
       cancellation of securities held by the bondholders, but would not affect
       SOUTHERN's continuing guarantee obligations. The final outcome of this
       matter cannot now be determined.

       Reference is made to Note 3 to SOUTHERN's financial statements in Item 8
       herein under the caption "Mobile Energy Services' Petition for
       Bankruptcy."

                                      I-25



Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS (continued)

(6)    Gordon v. SOUTHERN et al.
       (United States District Court for the Southern District of California)
                            and
(7)    Pier 23 Restaurant v. SOUTHERN et al.
       (United States District Court for the Northern District of California)

       Prior to the spin off of Mirant, SOUTHERN was named as a defendant in two
       lawsuits filed in the superior courts of California alleging that certain
       owners of electric generation facilities in California, including
       SOUTHERN, engaged in various unlawful and anticompetitive acts that
       served to manipulate wholesale power markets and inflate wholesale
       electricity prices in California. One lawsuit naming SOUTHERN, Mirant and
       other generators as defendants alleged that, as a result of the
       defendants' conduct, customers paid approximately $4 billion more for
       electricity that they otherwise would have and sought an award of treble
       damages, as well as other injunctive and equitable relief. The other suit
       likewise sought treble damages and equitable relief. The allegations in
       the two lawsuits in which SOUTHERN was named seemed to be directed to
       activities of subsidiaries of Mirant. On September 28 and November 6,
       2001, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed SOUTHERN without prejudice
       from the two lawsuits in which it had been named as a defendant. Prior to
       being dismissed, SOUTHERN had notified Mirant of its claim for
       indemnification for costs associated with the lawsuits under the terms of
       the master separation agreement that governs the spin off of Mirant.
       Mirant had undertaken the defense of the lawsuits. Plaintiffs would not
       be barred by their own dismissal from naming SOUTHERN in some future
       lawsuit, but management believes that the likelihood of SOUTHERN having
       to pay damages in any such lawsuit is remote.


     See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Construction Programs," "Fuel Supply," "Regulation
- - Federal Power Act" and "Rate Matters" as well as Note 3 to each registrant's
financial statements in Item 8 herein for a description of certain other
administrative and legal proceedings discussed therein.

     Additionally, each of the operating companies, SCS, Southern Nuclear,
Southern Power, Energy Solutions and Southern LINC are, in the normal course of
business, engaged in litigation or administrative proceedings that include, but
are not limited to, acquisition of property, injuries and damages claims, and
complaints by present and former employees.

Item 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

           ALABAMA

           ALABAMA held a special meeting of shareholders on November 21, 2001

           the Auction Procedures for ALABAMA's 1988 Auction Series Class A

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2001 Annual Report


The management of Southern Company has prepared -- and is responsible for -- the
consolidated financial statements and related information included in this
report. These statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States and necessarily include amounts that are
based on the best estimates and judgments of management. Financial information
throughout this annual report is consistent with the financial statements.

   The company maintains a system of internal accounting controls to provide
reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that the accounting records
reflect only authorized transactions of the company. Limitations exist in any
system of internal controls, however, based on a recognition that the cost of
the system should not exceed its benefits. The company believes its system of
internal accounting controls maintains an appropriate cost/benefit relationship.

   The company's system of internal accounting controls is evaluated on an
ongoing basis by the company's internal audit staff. The company's independent
public accountants also consider certain elements of the internal control system
in order to determine their auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the financial statements.

   The audit committee of the board of directors, composed of four independent
directors, provides a broad overview of management's financial reporting and
control functions. Periodically, this committee meets with management, the
internal auditors, and the independent public accountants to ensure that these
groups are fulfilling their obligations and to discuss auditing, internal
controls, and financial reporting matters. The internal auditors and independent
public accountants have access to the members of the audit committee at any
time.

   Management believes that its policies and procedures provide reasonable
assurance that the company's operations are conducted according to a high
standard of business ethics.

   In management's opinion, the consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, results of operations,
and cash flows of Southern Company and its subsidiary companies in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


To Southern Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consolidated
statements of capitalization of Southern Company (a Delaware corporation) and
subsidiary companies as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2001. These financial statements are the responsibility of the company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

   We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements (pages II-19 through
II-42) referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Southern Company and subsidiary companies as of December 31, 2001
and 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

   As explained in Note 1 to the financial statements, effective January 1,
2001, Southern Company changed its method of accounting for derivative
instruments and hedging activities.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2001 Annual Report


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
- ---------------------

OVERVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS AND DIVIDENDS

Earnings

Southern Company's basic earnings per share from continuing operations increased
6.6 percent in 2001. This increase was achieved by cost containment and lower
interest rates despite the mild temperatures and the economic downturn. Basic
earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.62 in 2001 compared with
$1.52 in 2000. Dilution -- which factors in additional shares related to stock
options -- decreased earnings per share by 1 cent in 2001 and had no impact in
2000.

   In April 2000, Southern Company announced an initial public offering of up to
19.9 percent of Mirant Corporation -- formerly Southern Energy, Inc. -- and
intentions to spin off its remaining ownership of 272 million Mirant shares. On
April 2, 2001, the tax-free distribution of Mirant shares was completed at a
ratio of approximately 0.4 for every share of Southern Company common stock.

   As a result of the spin off, Southern Company's financial statements and
related information reflect Mirant as discontinued operations. Therefore, the
focus of Management's Discussion and Analysis is on Southern Company's
continuing operations. The following chart shows earnings from continuing and

Dividends

Southern Company has paid dividends on its common stock since 1948. Dividends
paid on common stock in 2001 and 2000 were $1.34 per share or 331/2 cents per
quarter. In January 2002, Southern Company declared a quarterly dividend of
331/2 cents per share. This is the 217th consecutive quarter that Southern
Company has paid a dividend equal to or higher than the previous quarter. Our
dividend payout ratio goal is 75 percent.

SOUTHERN COMPANY BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

Discussion of the results of continuing operations is focused on Southern
Company's primary business of electricity sales by the operating companies --
Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, and Savannah
Electric -- and Southern Power. Southern Power is a new electric wholesale
generation subsidiary with market-based rates. The remaining portion of Southern
Company's other business activities include telecommunications, energy products
and services, leveraged leasing activities, and as the parent holding
company. The net impact of these other business activities on the consolidated
results of operations is not significant. See Note 12 to the financial
statements for additional information.

Electricity Business

Southern Company's electric utilities generate and sell electricity to retail
and wholesale customers in the Southeast. A condensed income statement for these
six companies is as follows:

Revenues

Operating revenues for the core business of selling electricity in 2001 and the
amount of change from the prior year are as follows:

                                           Increase (Decrease)

Percent change                                  0.5%       8.1%
- ----------------------------------------------------------------

   Base revenues declined by $93 million in 2001 because of mild temperatures
and the economic downturn. Total base revenues of $6.0 billion in 2000 increased
as a result of continued customer growth in the service area and the positive
impact of weather on energy sales.

   Electric rates -- for the operating companies -- include provisions to adjust
billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, the energy component of purchased power
costs, and certain other costs. Under these fuel cost recovery provisions, fuel
revenues generally equal fuel expenses -- including the fuel component of
purchased energy -- and do not affect net income. However, cash flow is affected
by the economic loss from untimely recovery of these receivables.

   Sales for resale revenues within the service area were $338 million in 2001,
down 10.2 percent from the prior year. This sharp decline resulted primarily
from the mild weather experienced in the Southeast during 2001, which
significantly reduced energy requirements from these customers. Sales for resale
within the service area for 2000 were up from the prior year as a result of
additional demand for electricity during the hot summer.

   Revenues from energy sales for resale outside the service area have increased
sharply the past two years with a 39 percent and 27 percent increase in 2001 and
2000, respectively. This growth was primarily driven by new contracts. As
Southern Company increases its competitive wholesale generation business, sales
for resale outside the service area should reflect steady increases over the
near term. Recent wholesale contracts have shorter contract periods, and many
are market priced compared with the traditional cost-based contracts entered
into in the 1980s. Those long-term cost-based contracts are principally unit
power sales to Florida utilities. Revenues from long-term unit power contracts
have both capacity and energy components. Capacity revenues reflect the
recovery of fixed costs and a return on investment under the contracts. Energy
is generally sold at variable cost. The capacity and energy components of the
unit power contracts were as follows:

                                    2001       2000       1999
- --------------------------------------------------------------
                                          (in millions)
Capacity                            $170       $177       $174
Energy                               201        178        157
- --------------------------------------------------------------
Total                               $371       $355       $331
==============================================================

   Capacity revenues in 2001 and 2000 varied slightly compared with the prior
year as a result of adjustments and true-ups related to contractual pricing. No
significant declines in the amount of capacity are scheduled until the
termination of the contracts in 2010.

Energy Sales

Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the amount of energy sold each
year. Kilowatt-hour sales for 2001 and the percent change by year were as
follows:

                        Amount            Percent Change
(billions of          --------      --------------------------

                                       II-9

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2001 Annual Report


   Although the number of residential customers increased 43,000 in 2001, retail
energy sales registered a 3.2 percent decline. This is the first decrease since
1982. Reduced retail sales in 2001 were driven by extremely mild weather and the
sluggish economy, which severely impacted industrial sales. In 2000, the rate of
growth in total retail energy sales was very strong. Residential energy sales
reflected a substantial increase as a result of the hotter-than-normal summer
weather and the increase in customers served. Also in 2000, commercial sales
continued to reflect the strong economy in the Southeast. Energy sales to retail
customers are projected to increase at an average annual rate of 1.8 percent
during the period 2002 through 2012.

   Sales to customers outside the service area under long-term contracts for
unit power sales increased 2.7 percent in 2001 and increased 21 percent in 2000.
These changes in sales were influenced by weather -- discussed earlier -- and
fluctuations in prices for oil and natural gas. These are the primary fuel
sources for utilities with which the company has long-term contracts. However,
these fluctuations in energy sales under long-term contracts have minimal
effects on earnings because the energy is generally sold at variable cost.

Expenses

In 2001, operating expenses of $7.5 billion increased only $83 million compared
with the prior year. The moderate increase reflected flat energy sales and
tighter cost containment measures. The costs to produce electricity for the core
business in 2001 increased $96 million. However, non-production operation and
maintenance declined by $23 million.

   In 2000, operating expenses of $7.4 billion increased $644 million compared
with the prior year. The costs to produce electricity in 2000 increased by $498
million to meet higher energy requirements. Non-production operation and
maintenance expenses increased $46 million in 2000. Depreciation and
amortization expenses in 2000 increased $89 million, of which $50 million
resulted from additional accelerated amortization by Georgia Power.

   Fuel costs constitute the single largest expense for the six electric
utilities. The mix of fuel sources for generation of electricity is determined
primarily by system load, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the availability
of hydro and nuclear generating units. The amount and sources of generation and
the average cost of fuel per net kilowatt-hour generated -- within the service
area -- were as follows:

                                    2001       2000       1999

    (cents) --                      1.56       1.51       1.45
- ---------------------------------------------------------------

   In 2001, fuel and purchased power costs of $3.3 billion increased $54
million. Continued efforts to control energy costs combined with additional
efficient gas-fired generating units helped to hold the increase in fuel expense
to $13 million in 2001.

   Total fuel and purchased power costs increased $504 million in 2000 as a
result of 10.6 billion more kilowatt-hours being sold than in 1999. Demand was
met with some 2.5 billion additional kilowatt-hours being purchased and using
generation with higher unit fuel cost than in 1999.

   Total interest charges and other financing costs in 2001 decreased $25
million from amounts reported in the previous year. The decline reflected
substantially lower short-term interest rates that offset new financing costs.
Total interest charges and other financing costs in 2000 increased $29 million
reflecting some additional external financing for new generating units.

Effects of Inflation

The operating companies are subject to rate regulation and income tax laws that
are based on the recovery of historical costs. Therefore, inflation creates an
economic loss because the company is recovering its costs of investments in
dollars that have less purchasing power. While the inflation rate has been
relatively low in recent years, it continues to have an adverse effect on
Southern Company because of the large investment in utility plant with long
economic lives. Conventional accounting for historical cost does not recognize
this economic loss nor the partially offsetting gain that arises through


                                    II-10


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2001 Annual Report


financing facilities with fixed-money obligations such as long-term debt and
preferred securities. Any recognition of inflation by regulatory authorities is
reflected in the rate of return allowed.

Future Earnings Potential

General

The results of continuing operations for the past three years are not
necessarily indicative of future earnings potential. The level of Southern
Company's future earnings depends on numerous factors. The two major factors are
the ability of the operating companies to achieve energy sales growth while
containing cost in a more competitive environment and the profitability of the
new competitive market-based wholesale generating facilities being added.

   Future earnings for the electricity business in the near term will depend
upon growth in energy sales, which is subject to a number of factors. These
factors include weather, competition, new short and long-term contracts with
neighboring utilities, energy conservation practiced by customers, the
elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic growth in the service area.

   The operating companies operate as vertically integrated companies providing
electricity to customers within the service area of the southeastern United
States. Prices for electricity provided to retail customers are set by state
public service commissions under cost-based regulatory principles. Retail rates
and earnings are reviewed and adjusted periodically within certain limitations
based on earned return on equity. See Note 3 to the financial statements for
additional information about these and other regulatory matters.

   In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No.
87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions, Southern Company recorded non-cash
income of approximately $124 million in 2001. Future pension income is dependent
on several factors including trust earnings and changes to the plan. For the
operating companies, pension income is a component of the regulated rates and
does not have a significant effect on net income. For more information, see Note
2 to the financial statements.

   Southern Company currently receives tax benefits related to investments in
alternative fuel partnerships and leveraged lease agreements for energy
generation, distribution, and transportation assets that contribute
significantly to the economic results for these projects. Changes in Internal
Revenue Service interpretations of existing regulations or challenges to the
company's positions could result in reduced availability or changes in the
timing of such tax benefits. The net income impact of these investments totaled
$52 million, $28 million, and $11 million in 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.
See Note 1 to the financial statements under "Leveraged Leases" and Note 6 for
additional information and related income taxes.

   Southern Company is involved in various matters being litigated. See Note 3
to the financial statements for information regarding material issues that could
possibly affect future earnings.

   Compliance costs related to current and future environmental laws and
regulations could affect earnings if such costs are not fully recovered. The
Clean Air Act and other important environmental items are discussed later under
"Environmental Matters."

Industry Restructuring

The electric utility industry in the United States is continuing to evolve as a
result of regulatory and competitive factors. Among the primary agents of change
has been the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Energy Act). The Energy Act allows
independent power producers (IPPs) to access a utility's transmission network in
order to sell electricity to other utilities. This enhances the incentive for
IPPs to build cogeneration plants for a utility's large industrial and
commercial customers and sell energy generation to other utilities. Also,
electricity sales for resale rates are affected by wholesale transmission access
and numerous potential new energy suppliers, including power marketers and
brokers.

   Although the Energy Act does not permit retail customer access, it has been a
major catalyst for recent restructuring and consolidations taking place within
the utility industry. Numerous federal and state initiatives are in varying
stages that promote wholesale and retail competition. Among other things, these
initiatives allow customers to choose their electricity provider. Some states
have approved initiatives that result in a separation of the ownership and/or
operation of generating facilities from the ownership and/or operation of
transmission and distribution facilities. While various restructuring and
competition initiatives have been discussed in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and
Mississippi, none have been enacted. Enactment would require numerous issues to
be resolved, including significant ones relating to recovery of any stranded
investments, full cost recovery of energy produced, and other issues related to
the energy crisis that occurred in California. As a result of that crisis, many
states have either discontinued or delayed implementation of initiatives
involving retail deregulation.



                                      II-11



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2001 Annual Report


   Continuing to be a low-cost producer could provide opportunities to increase
market share and profitability in markets that evolve with changing regulation.
Conversely, if Southern Company's electric utilities do not remain low-cost
producers and provide quality service, then energy sales growth could be
limited, and this could significantly erode earnings.

   To adapt to a less regulated, more competitive environment, Southern Company
continues to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential business
strategies. These strategies may include business combinations, acquisitions
involving other utility or non-utility businesses or properties, internal
restructuring, disposition of certain assets, or some combination thereof.
Furthermore, Southern Company may engage in new business ventures that arise
from competitive and regulatory changes in the utility industry. Pursuit of any
of the above strategies, or any combination thereof, may significantly affect
the business operations and financial condition of Southern Company.

   The Energy Act amended the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA)
to allow holding companies to form exempt wholesale generators and foreign
utilities to sell power largely free from regulation under PUHCA. These entities
are able to own and operate power generating facilities and sell power to
affiliates -- under certain restrictions.

   Southern Company is working to maintain and expand its share of wholesale
energy sales in the Southeastern power markets. In January 2001, Southern
Company formed a new subsidiary -- Southern Power Company. This subsidiary
constructs, owns, and manages wholesale generating assets in the Southeast.
Southern Power will be the primary growth engine for Southern Company's
competitive wholesale market-based energy business. By the end of 2003, Southern
Power plans to have approximately 4,700 megawatts of generating capacity in
commercial operation. At December 31, 2001, 800 megawatts are in commercial
operation and some 3,900 megawatts of capacity are under construction.

   In December 1999, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued its
final rule on Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs). The order encouraged
utilities owning transmission systems to form RTOs on a voluntary basis.
Southern Company has submitted a series of status reports informing the FERC of
progress toward the development of a Southeastern RTO. In these status reports,
Southern Company explained that it is developing a for-profit RTO known as
SeTrans with a number of non-jurisdictional cooperative and public power
entities. Recently, Entergy Corporation and Cleco Power joined the SeTrans
development process. In January 2002, the sponsors of SeTrans held a public
meeting to form a Stakeholder Advisory Committee, which will participate in the
development of the RTO. Southern Company continues to work with the other
sponsors to develop the SeTrans RTO. The creation of SeTrans is not expected to
have a material impact on Southern Company's financial statements. The outcome
of this matter cannot now be determined.

Accounting Policies

Critical Policy

Southern Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to
the financial statements. The company's most critical accounting policy involves
rate regulation. The operating companies are subject to the provisions of FASB
Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. In
the event that a portion of a company's operations is no longer subject to these
provisions, the company would be required to write off related regulatory assets
and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable and determine if any
other assets have been impaired. See Note 1 to the financial statements under
"Regulatory Assets and Liabilities" for additional information.

New Accounting Standards

Effective January 2001, Southern Company adopted FASB Statement No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended.
Statement No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments and for hedging activities. This statement requires that certain
derivative instruments be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or
liability measured at fair value and that changes in the fair value be
recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are
met. See Note 1 to the financial statements under "Financial Instruments" for
additional information. The impact on net income in 2001 was not material. An
additional interpretation of Statement No. 133 will result in a change --
effective April 1, 2002 -- in accounting for certain contracts related to fuel
supplies that contain quantity options. These contracts will be accounted for as
derivatives and marked to market. However, due to the existence of specific




                                     II-12


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2001 Annual Report


cost-based fuel recovery clauses for the operating companies, this change is not
expected to have a material impact on net income.

   In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for
acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 17. Statement No. 142 addresses how intangible
assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets -- but not
those acquired in a business combination -- should be accounted for upon
acquisition and on an ongoing basis. Goodwill and intangible assets that have
indefinite useful lives will not be amortized but rather will be tested at least
annually for impairment. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives will
continue to be amortized over their useful lives, which are no longer limited to
40 years. Southern Company adopted Statement No. 142 in January 2002 with no
material impact on the financial statements.

   Also in June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143, Asset Retirement
Obligations, which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal
obligations associated with retiring assets, including decommissioning of
nuclear plants. The liability for an asset's future retirement must be recorded
in the period in which the liability is incurred. The cost must be capitalized
as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful
life. Changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time will be
recognized as operating expenses. Statement No. 143 must be adopted by January
1, 2003. Southern Company has not yet quantified the impact of adopting
Statement No. 143 on its financial statements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION
- ------------------

Overview

Southern Company's financial condition continues to remain strong. In 2001, most
of the operating companies' earnings were at the high end of their respective
allowed range of return on equity. Also, earnings from new business activities
made a solid contribution. These factors drove consolidated net income from
continuing operations to a record $1.12 billion in 2001. The quarterly dividend
declared in January 2002 was 331/2 cents per share, or $1.34 on an annual basis.
Southern Company is committed to a goal of increasing the dividend over time
consistent with growth in earnings. Southern Company's target is to grow
earnings per share at an average annual rate of 5 percent or more. The dividend
payout ratio goal is 75 percent.

   Gross property additions to utility plant from continuing operations were
$2.6 billion in 2001. The majority of funds needed for gross property additions
since 1998 has been provided from operating activities. The Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows provide additional details.

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements

At December 31, 2001, Southern Company utilized two separate financing
arrangements that are not required to be recorded on the balance sheet. In May
2001, Mississippi Power began the initial 10-year term of an operating lease
agreement signed in 1999 with Escatawpa Funding, Limited Partnership, a special
purpose entity, to use a combined-cycle generating facility located at
Mississippi Power's Plant Daniel. The facility cost approximately $370 million.
The lease provides for a residual value guarantee -- approximately 71 percent of
the completion cost -- by Mississippi Power that is due upon termination of the
lease in certain circumstances. See Note 9 to the financial statements under
"Operating Leases" for additional information regarding this lease.

   Southern Power in 2001 entered into a financial arrangement with Westdeutsche
Landesbank Girozentrale (WestLB) that is in effect until September 2002. Under
this agreement, Southern Power may assign up to $125 million in vendor contracts
for equipment to WestLB. For accounting purposes, WestLB is the owner of the
contracts. Southern Power acts as an agent for WestLB and instructs WestLB when
to make payments to the vendors. At December 31, 2001, approximately $47 million
of such vendor equipment contracts had been assigned to WestLB. Southern Power
currently anticipates terminating this arrangement and reacquiring these assets
in the first quarter of 2002.

Credit Rating Risk

Southern Company and its subsidiaries do not have any credit agreements that
would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result
of a credit rating downgrade. There are contracts that could require collateral
- -- but not accelerated payment -- in the event of a credit rating change to
below investment grade. These contracts are primarily for physical electricity
sales, fixed-price physical gas purchases, and agreements covering interest rate
swaps and currency swaps. At December 31, 2001, the maximum potential collateral
requirements under the electricity sale contracts were approximately $230
million. Generally, collateral may be provided for by a Southern Company
guaranty, a letter of credit, or cash. At December 31, 2001, there were no

material collateral requirements for the gas purchase contracts or other
financial instrument agreements.

Market Price Risk

Southern Company is exposed to market risks, including changes in interest
rates, currency exchange rates, and certain commodity prices. To manage the
volatility attributable to these exposures, the company nets the exposures to
take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various derivative
transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to the company's policies in
areas such as counterparty exposure and hedging practices. Company policy is
that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes. Derivative
positions are monitored using techniques that include market valuation and
sensitivity analysis.

   The company's market risk exposures relative to interest rate changes have
not changed materially compared with the previous reporting period. In addition,
the company is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly
affect such exposures in the near term.

   If the company sustained a 100 basis point change in interest rates for all
variable rate long-term debt, the change would affect annualized interest
expense by approximately $22 million at December 31, 2001. Based on the
company's overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2001, including
derivative and other interest rate sensitive instruments, a near-term 100 basis
point change in interest rates would not materially affect the consolidated
financial statements.

   Due to cost-based rate regulations, the operating companies have limited
exposure to market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and
prices of electricity. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in
electricity prices for the operating companies, they and Southern Power enter
into fixed price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the
wholesale electricity market and to a lesser extent similar contracts for gas
purchases. Also, some of the operating companies have implemented fuel-hedging
programs at the instruction of their respective public service commissions.
Realized gains and losses are recognized in the income statement as incurred. At
December 31, 2001, exposure from these activities was not material to the
consolidated financial statements. Fair value of changes in energy trading
contracts and year-end valuations are as follows:

Capital Structure

During 2001, the operating companies issued $1.2 billion of senior notes. The
majority of these proceeds was used to retire long-term debt. The companies
continued to reduce financing costs by retiring higher-cost securities.
Retirements of bonds and senior notes, including maturities, totaled $1.2
billion in 2001, $298 million during 2000, and $1.2 billion during 1999.

   Southern Company issued through the company's stock plans 17 million treasury
shares of common stock in 2001. Proceeds were $395 million and were primarily
used to reduce short-term debt. At December 31, 2001, approximately 2 million
treasury shares remain unissued.

   At the close of 2001, the company's common stock market value was $25.35 per
share, compared with book value of $11.44 per share. The market-to-book value
ratio was 222 percent at the end of 2001, compared with 212 percent at year-end
2000.

Capital Requirements for Construction

The construction program of Southern Company is budgeted at $2.8 billion for
2002, $2.1 billion for 2003, and $2.3 billion for 2004. Actual construction
costs may vary from this estimate because of changes in such factors as:
business conditions; environmental regulations; nuclear plant regulations; load
projections; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and
materials; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that
costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered.

   Southern Company has approximately 4,500 megawatts of new generating capacity
scheduled to be placed in service by 2003. Approximately 3,900 megawatts of
additional new capacity will be dedicated to the wholesale market and owned by
Southern Power. Significant construction of transmission and distribution
facilities and upgrading of generating plants will be continuing.

Other Capital Requirements

In addition to the funds needed for the construction program, approximately $2.4
billion will be required by the end of 2004 for present improvement fund
requirements and maturities of long-term debt. Also, the subsidiaries will
continue to retire higher-cost debt and preferred stock and replace these
obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit.

   These capital requirements, lease obligations, and purchase commitments --
discussed in Notes 8 and 9 to the financial statements -- are as follows:

Environmental Matters

On November 3, 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil
action in the U.S. District Court in Georgia against Alabama Power, Georgia
Power, and the system service company. The complaint alleges violations of the
New Source Review provisions of the Clean Air Act with respect to five
coal-fired generating facilities in Alabama and Georgia. The civil action
requests penalties and injunctive relief, including an order requiring the
installation of the best available control technology at the affected units. The
EPA concurrently issued to the operating companies a notice of violation related
to 10 generating facilities, which includes the five facilities mentioned
previously. In early 2000, the EPA filed a motion to amend its complaint to add
the violations alleged in its notice of violation and to add Gulf Power,
Mississippi Power, and Savannah Electric as defendants. The complaint and notice
of violation are similar to those brought against and issued to several other
electric utilities. These complaints and notices of violation allege that the
utilities failed to secure necessary permits or install additional pollution
control equipment when performing maintenance and construction at coal burning-
plants constructed or under construction prior to 1978. The U.S. District Court
in Georgia granted Alabama Power's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction in
Georgia and granted the system service company's motion to dismiss on the
grounds that it neither owned nor operated the generating units involved in the
proceedings. The court granted the EPA's motion to add Savannah Electric as a
defendant, but it denied the motion to add Gulf Power and Mississippi Power
based on lack of jurisdiction over those companies. The court directed the EPA
to refile its amended complaint limiting claims to those brought against
Georgia Power and Savannah Electric. The EPA refiled those claims as directed
by the court. Also, the EPA refiled its claims against Alabama Power in U.S.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2001 Annual Report


District Court in Alabama. It has not refiled against Gulf Power, Mississippi
Power, or the system service company. The Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and
Savannah Electric cases have been stayed since the spring of 2001, pending a
ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in the appeal of a
very similar New Source Review enforcement action against the Tennessee Valley
Authority (TVA). The TVA case involves many of the same legal issues raised by
the actions against Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Savannah Electric. Because
the outcome of the TVA case could have a significant adverse impact on Alabama
Power and Georgia Power, both companies are parties to that case as well. The
U.S. District Court in Alabama has indicated that it will revisit the issue of a
continued stay in April 2002. The U.S. District Court in Georgia is currently
considering a motion by the EPA to reopen the Georgia case. Georgia Power and
Savannah Electric have opposed that motion.

   Southern Company believes that its operating companies complied with
applicable laws and the EPA's regulations and interpretations in effect at the
time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act authorizes civil
penalties of up to $27,500 per day per violation at each generating unit. Prior
to January 30, 1997, the penalty was $25,000 per day. An adverse outcome in any
one of these cases could require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be
determined at this time and could possibly require payment of substantial
penalties. This could affect future results of operations, cash flows, and
possibly financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated
rates.

   In November 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (Clean Air Act) were
signed into law. Title IV of the Clean Air Act -- the acid rain compliance
provision of the law -- significantly affected Southern Company. Reductions in
sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from fossil-fired generating plants
were required in two phases. Phase I compliance began in 1995. Southern Company
achieved Phase I compliance at its affected plants by primarily switching to
low-sulfur coal and with some equipment upgrades. Construction expenditures for
Phase I nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions compliance totaled
approximately $300 million. Phase II sulfur dioxide compliance was required in
2000. Southern Company used emission allowances and fuel switching to comply
with Phase II requirements. Also, equipment to control nitrogen oxide emissions
was installed on additional system fossil-fired units as necessary to meet Phase
II limits and ozone non-attainment requirements for metropolitan Atlanta through
2000. Compliance for Phase II and initial ozone non-attainment requirements
increased total construction expenditures through 2000 by approximately $100
million.

   Respective state plans to address the one-hour ozone non-attainment standards
for the Atlanta and Birmingham areas have been established and must be
implemented in May 2003. Seven generating plants in the Atlanta area and two
plants in the Birmingham area will be affected. Construction expenditures for
compliance with these new rules are currently estimated at approximately $940
million, of which $520 million remains to be spent.

   A significant portion of costs related to the acid rain and ozone
non-attainment provisions of the Clean Air Act is expected to be recovered
through existing ratemaking provisions. However, there can be no assurance that
all Clean Air Act costs will be recovered.

   In July 1997, the EPA revised the national ambient air quality standards for
ozone and particulate matter. This revision made the standards significantly
more stringent. In the subsequent litigation of these standards, the U.S.
Supreme Court found the EPA's implementation program for the new ozone standard
unlawful and remanded it to the EPA. In addition, the Federal District of
Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals is considering other legal challenges to these
standards. A court decision is expected in the spring of 2002. If the standards
are eventually upheld, implementation could be required by 2007 to 2010.

   In September 1998, the EPA issued regional nitrogen oxide reduction rules to
the states for implementation. The final rule affects 21 states, including
Alabama and Georgia. Compliance is required by May 31, 2004, for most states,
including Alabama. For Georgia, further rulemaking was required, and proposed
compliance was delayed until May 1, 2005. Additional construction expenditures
for compliance with these new rules are currently estimated at approximately
$190 million.

   In December 2000, having completed its utility studies for mercury and other
hazardous air pollutants (HAPS), the EPA issued a determination that an emission
control program for mercury and, perhaps, other HAPS is warranted. The program
is being developed under the Maximum Achievable Control Technology provisions of
the Clean Air Act, and the regulations are scheduled to be finalized by the end
of 2004 with implementation to take place around 2007. In January 2001, the EPA





                                       II-16



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2001 Annual Report


proposed guidance for the determination of Best Available Retrofit Technology
(BART) emission controls under the Regional Haze Regulations. Installation of
BART controls is expected to take place around 2010. Litigation of the Regional
Haze Regulations, including the BART provisions, is ongoing in the Federal
District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals. A court decision is expected in
mid-2002.

   Implementation of the final state rules for these initiatives could require
substantial further reductions in nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide and
reductions in mercury and other HAPS emissions from fossil-fired generating
facilities and other industries in these states. Additional compliance costs and
capital expenditures resulting from the implementation of these rules and
standards cannot be determined until the results of legal challenges are known,
and the states have adopted their final rules.

   In October 1997, the EPA issued regulations setting forth requirements for
Compliance Assurance Monitoring in its state and federal operating permit
programs. These regulations were amended by the EPA in March 2001 in response to
a court order resolving challenges to the rules brought by environmental groups
and the utility industry. Generally, this rule affects the operation and
maintenance of electrostatic precipitators and could involve significant
additional ongoing expense.

   The EPA and state environmental regulatory agencies are reviewing and
evaluating various other matters including: control strategies to reduce
regional haze; limits on pollutant discharges to impaired waters; cooling water
intake restrictions; and hazardous waste disposal requirements. The impact of
any new standards will depend on the development and implementation of
applicable regulations.

   Southern Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations
that cover the handling and disposal of hazardous waste. Under these various
laws and regulations, the subsidiaries could incur substantial costs to clean up
properties. The subsidiaries conduct studies to determine the extent of any
required cleanup and have recognized in their respective financial statements
costs to clean up known sites. These costs for Southern Company amounted to $1
million in 2001 and $4 million in both 2000 and 1999. Additional sites may
require environmental remediation for which the subsidiaries may be liable for a
portion or all required cleanup costs. See Note 3 to the financial statements
for information regarding Georgia Power's potentially responsible party status
at sites in Georgia.

   Several major pieces of environmental legislation are periodically considered
for reauthorization or amendment by Congress. These include: the Clean Air Act;
the Clean Water Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances
Control Act; and the Endangered Species Act. Changes to these laws could affect
many areas of Southern Company's operations. The full impact of any such changes
cannot be determined at this time.

   Compliance with possible additional legislation related to global climate
change, electromagnetic fields, and other environmental and health concerns
could significantly affect Southern Company. The impact of new legislation -- if
any -- will depend on the subsequent development and implementation of
applicable regulations. In addition, the potential exists for liability as the
result of lawsuits alleging damages caused by electromagnetic fields.

Sources of Capital

The amount and timing of additional equity capital to be raised in 2002 -- as
well as in subsequent years -- will be contingent on Southern Company's
investment opportunities. Equity capital can be provided from any combination of
public offerings, private placements, or the company's stock plans.

   The operating companies plan to obtain the funds required for construction
and other purposes from sources similar to those used in the past, which were
primarily from internal sources. However, the type and timing of any financings
- -- if needed -- will depend on market conditions and regulatory approval. In
recent years, financings primarily have utilized unsecured debt and trust
preferred securities.

   Southern Power will use both external funds and equity capital from Southern
Company to finance its construction program.

   To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, Southern Company had at the
beginning of 2002 approximately $354 million of cash and cash equivalents and
$5.1 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2001 Annual Report


1. Summary of Significant Accounting
   Policies

General

Southern Company is the parent company of five operating companies, a system
service company, Southern Communications Services (Southern LINC), Southern
Nuclear Operating Company (Southern Nuclear), Southern Power Company (Southern
Power), and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The operating companies --
Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, and Savannah
Electric -- provide electric service in four Southeastern states. Contracts
among the operating companies -- related to jointly owned generating facilities,
interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power -- are
regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and/or the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The system service company provides, at
cost, specialized services to Southern Company and subsidiary companies.
Southern LINC provides digital wireless communications services to the operating
companies and also markets these services to the public within the Southeast.
Southern Nuclear provides services to Southern Company's nuclear power plants.
Southern Power was established in 2001 to construct, own, and manage Southern
Company's competitive generation assets and sell electricity at market-based
rates in the wholesale market.

   On April 2, 2001, the spin off of Mirant Corporation (Mirant) was completed.
As a result of the spin off, Southern Company's financial statements and related
information reflect Mirant as discontinued operations. For additional
information, see Note 11.

   The financial statements reflect Southern Company's investments in the
subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. All material intercompany items have been
eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior years' data presented in the
consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the
current year presentation.

   Southern Company is registered as a holding company under the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA). Both the company and its subsidiaries are
subject to the regulatory provisions of the PUHCA. The operating companies also
are subject to regulation by the FERC and their respective state public service
commissions. The companies follow accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States and comply with the accounting policies and practices
prescribed by their respective commissions. The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
U.S. requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those
estimates.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

The operating companies are subject to the provisions of Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain
Types of Regulation. Regulatory assets represent probable future revenues
associated with certain costs that are expected to be recovered from customers
through the ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future
reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be credited
to customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory assets and (liabilities)
reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31 relate to the
following:

===============================================================

   In the event that a portion of a company's operations is no longer subject to
the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, the company would be required to write
off related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically
recoverable through regulated rates. In addition, the company would be required
to determine if any impairment to other assets exists, including plant, and
write down the assets, if impaired, to their fair value.

Revenues and Fuel Costs

Revenues are recognized as services are rendered. Unbilled revenues are accrued
at the end of each fiscal period. Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is used.
Electric rates for the operating companies include provisions to adjust billings
for fluctuations in fuel costs, the energy component of purchased power costs,
and certain other costs. Revenues are adjusted for differences between


                                       II-26

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2001 Annual Report


recoverable fuel costs and amounts actually recovered in current regulated
rates.

   Southern Company has a diversified base of customers. No single customer or
industry comprises 10 percent or more of revenues. For all periods presented,
uncollectible accounts continued to average less than 1 percent of revenues.

   Fuel expense includes the amortization of the cost of nuclear fuel and a
charge, based on nuclear generation, for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear
fuel. Total charges for nuclear fuel included in fuel expense amounted to $133
million in 2001, $136 million in 2000, and $137 million in 1999. Alabama Power
and Georgia Power have contracts with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) that
provide for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to
begin disposing of spent nuclear fuel in January 1998 as required by the
contracts, and the companies are pursuing legal remedies against the government
for breach of contract. Sufficient pool storage capacity for spent fuel is
available at Plant Farley to maintain full-core discharge capability until the
refueling outages scheduled for 2006 and 2008 for units 1 and 2, respectively.
Sufficient pool storage capacity for spent fuel is available at Plant Vogtle to
maintain full-core discharge capability for both units into 2014. At Plant
Hatch, an on-site dry storage facility became operational in 2000. Sufficient
dry storage capacity is believed to be available to continue dry storage
operations at Plant Hatch through the life of the plant. Procurement of on-site
dry storage capacity at Plant Farley is in progress, with the intent to place
the capacity in operation in 2005. Procurement of on-site dry storage capacity
at Plant Vogtle will begin in sufficient time to maintain pool full-core
discharge capability.

   Also, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 required the establishment of a Uranium
Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund, which is funded in part by
a special assessment on utilities with nuclear plants. This assessment is being
paid over a 15-year period, which began in 1993. This fund will be used by the
DOE for the decontamination and decommissioning of its nuclear fuel enrichment
facilities. The law provides that utilities will recover these payments in the
same manner as any other fuel expense. Alabama Power and Georgia Power -- based
on its ownership interests -- estimate their respective remaining liability at
December 31, 2001, under this law to be approximately $21 million and $16
million. These obligations are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Depreciation and Nuclear Decommissioning

Depreciation of the original cost of plant in service is provided primarily by
using composite straight-line rates, which approximated 3.4 percent a year in
2001, 2000, and 1999. When property subject to depreciation is retired or
otherwise disposed of in the normal course of business, its original cost --
together with the cost of removal, less salvage -- is charged to accumulated
depreciation. Minor items of property included in the original cost of the plant
are retired when the related property unit is retired. Depreciation expense
includes an amount for the expected costs of decommissioning nuclear facilities
and removal of other facilities.

   Georgia Power recorded accelerated amortization and depreciation amounting to
$91 million in 2001, $135 million in 2000, and $85 million in 1999. See Note 3
under "Georgia Power Retail Rate Orders" for additional information.

   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requires all licensees operating
commercial nuclear power reactors to establish a plan for providing, with
reasonable assurance, funds for decommissioning. Alabama Power and Georgia Power
have external trust funds to comply with the NRC's regulations. Amounts
previously recorded in internal reserves are being transferred into the external
trust funds over periods approved by the respective state public service
commissions. The NRC's minimum external funding requirements are based on a
generic estimate of the cost to decommission the radioactive portions of a
nuclear unit based on the size and type of reactor. Alabama Power and Georgia
Power have filed plans with the NRC to ensure that -- over time -- the deposits
and earnings of the external trust funds will provide the minimum funding
amounts prescribed by the NRC.

   Site study cost is the estimate to decommission a specific facility as of the
site study year, and ultimate cost is the estimate to decommission a specific
facility as of its retirement date. The estimated costs of decommissioning --
both site study costs and ultimate costs -- based on the most current study as

   The decommissioning cost estimates are based on prompt dismantlement and
removal of the plant from service. The actual decommissioning costs may vary
from the above estimates because of changes in the assumed date of
decommissioning, changes in NRC requirements, or changes in the assumptions used
in making these estimates.

   Annual provisions for nuclear decommissioning are based on an annuity method
as approved by the respective state public service commissions. The amount
expensed in 2001 and fund balances were as follows:

=================================================================

   Alabama Power's decommissioning costs for ratemaking are based on the site
study. Effective January 1, 2002, the Georgia Public Service Commission (GPSC)
decreased Georgia Power's annual provision for decommissioning expenses to $8
million. This amount is based on the NRC generic estimate to decommission the
radioactive portion of the facilities as of 2000. The estimates are $383 million
and $282 million for plants Hatch and Vogtle, respectively. The ultimate costs
associated with the 2000 NRC minimum funding requirements are $823 million and
$1.03 billion for plants Hatch and Vogtle, respectively. Alabama Power and
Georgia Power expect their respective state public service commissions to
periodically review and adjust, if necessary, the amounts collected in rates for
the anticipated cost of decommissioning.

   In January 2002, Georgia Power received NRC approval for a 20-year extension
of the license at Plant Hatch, which would permit the operation of units 1 and 2
until 2034 and 2038, respectively. The decommissioning costs disclosed above do
not reflect this extension.

Income Taxes

Southern Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income
taxes and provides deferred income taxes for all significant income tax
temporary differences. Investment tax credits utilized are deferred and
amortized to income over the average lives of the related property.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost less regulatory
disallowances and impairments. Original cost includes: materials; labor; minor
items of property; appropriate administrative and general costs; payroll-related
costs such as taxes, pensions, and other benefits; and the estimated cost of
funds used during construction. The cost of funds capitalized was $67 million in
2001, $71 million in 2000, and $36 million in 1999. The cost of maintenance,
repairs, and replacement of minor items of property is charged to maintenance
expense as incurred or performed. The cost of replacements of property --
exclusive of minor items of property -- is capitalized.

Leveraged Leases

Southern Company has several leveraged lease agreements -- ranging up to 30
years -- that relate to international energy generation, distribution, and
transportation assets. Southern Company receives federal income tax deductions
for depreciation and amortization and for interest on long-term debt related to
these investments.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles

Southern Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not
be recoverable. The determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based
on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as
compared with the carrying value of the assets. If an impairment has occurred,
the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair
value of the assets and recording a provision for loss if the carrying value is
greater than the fair value. For assets identified as held for sale, the
carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value less the cost to sell in
order to determine if an impairment provision is required. Until the assets are
disposed of, their estimated fair value is reevaluated when circumstances or
events change.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the consolidated financial statements, temporary cash
investments are considered cash equivalents. Temporary cash investments are
securities with original maturities of 90 days or less.

Materials and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include the costs of transmission,
distribution, and generating plant materials. Materials are charged to inventory
when purchased and then expensed or capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when
installed.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income -- consisting of net income and changes in the fair value
of marketable securities and qualifying cash flow hedges, net of income taxes --
is presented in the consolidated financial statements. Also, comprehensive
income from discontinued operations includes foreign currency translation
adjustments, net of income taxes. The objective of comprehensive income is to
report a measure of all changes in common stock equity of an enterprise that
result from transactions and other economic events of the period other than
transactions with owners.

Financial Instruments

Effective January 2001, Southern Company adopted FASB Statement No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. The
impact on net income was immaterial.

   Southern Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to
fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and certain
commodity prices. Gains and losses on qualifying hedges are deferred and
recognized either in income or as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the
hedged item when the transaction occurs. At December 31, 2001, Southern Company
had $450 million notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding with
deferred gains of $12 million.

   Southern Company is exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the
event of counterparties' nonperformance. The company has established controls to
determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to
mitigate the company's exposure to counterparty credit risk.

   The operating companies and Southern Power enter into commodity related
forward and option contracts to limit exposure to changing prices on certain
fuel purchases and electricity purchases and sales. Substantially all of
Southern Company's bulk energy purchases and sales contracts meet the definition
of a derivative under FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. In many cases, these fuel and electricity
contracts qualify for normal purchase and sale exceptions under Statement No.
133 and are accounted for under the accrual method. Other contracts qualify as
cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions, resulting in the deferral of
related gains and losses, and are recorded in other comprehensive income until
the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness is recognized currently in

net income. Contracts that do not qualify for the normal purchase and sale
exception and that do not meet the hedge requirements are marked to market
through current period income.

   Southern Company has firm purchase commitments for equipment that require
payment in euros. As a hedge against fluctuations in the exchange rate for
euros, the company entered into forward currency swaps. The total notional
amount is 48 million euros maturing in 2002 and 2003. At December 31, 2001, the
gain on these swaps was less than $1 million.

   Other Southern Company financial instruments for which the carrying amount
did not equal fair value at December 31 were as follows:

2. RETIREMENT BENEFITS

Southern Company has a defined benefit, trusteed, pension plan that covers
substantially all employees. Also, Southern Company provides certain medical
care and life insurance benefits for retired employees. The operating companies
fund trusts to the extent required by their respective regulatory commissions.
In late 2000, Southern Company adopted several pension and postretirement
benefit plan changes that had the effect of increasing benefits to both current
and future retirees.

   The measurement date for plan assets and obligations is September 30 for each
year. The following disclosures exclude discontinued operations.

Employee Savings Plan

Southern Company also sponsors a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering
substantially all employees. The company provides a 75 percent matching
contribution up to 6 percent of an employee's base salary. Total matching
contributions made to the plan for the years 2001, 2000, and 1999 were $51
million, $49 million, and $46 million, respectively.

3. CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY
   MATTERS

General

Southern Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the
ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, after consultation
with legal counsel, the ultimate disposition of these matters is not expected to
have a material adverse effect on Southern Company's financial condition.

Georgia Power Potentially Responsible Party Status

Georgia Power has been designated as a potentially responsible party at sites
governed by the Georgia Hazardous Site Response Act and/or by the federal
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. Georgia


                                       II-31

NOTES (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2001 Annual Report


Power has recognized $33 million in cumulative expenses through December 31,
2001 for the assessment and anticipated cleanup of sites on the Georgia
Hazardous Sites Inventory. In addition, in 1995 the EPA designated Georgia Power
and four other unrelated entities as potentially responsible parties at a site
in Brunswick, Georgia, that is listed on the federal National Priorities List.
Georgia Power has contributed to the removal and remedial investigation and
feasibility study costs for the site. Additional claims for recovery of natural
resource damages at the site are anticipated. As of December 31, 2001, Georgia
Power had recorded approximately $6 million in cumulative expenses associated
with Georgia Power's agreed-upon share of the removal and remedial investigation
and feasibility study costs for the Brunswick site.

   The final outcome of each of these matters cannot now be determined. However,
based on the currently known conditions at these sites and the nature and extent
of Georgia Power's activities relating to these sites, management does not
believe that the company's cumulative liability at these sites would be material
to the financial statements.

Environmental Litigation

On November 3, 1999, the EPA brought a civil action in U.S. District Court in
Georgia against Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and the system service company.
The complaint alleges violations of the New Source Review provisions of the
Clean Air Act with respect to five coal-fired generating facilities in Alabama
and Georgia. The civil action requests penalties and injunctive relief,
including an order requiring the installation of the best available control
technology at the affected units. The Clean Air Act authorizes civil penalties
of up to $27,500 per day, per violation at each generating unit. Prior to
January 30, 1997, the penalty was $25,000 per day.

   The EPA concurrently issued to the operating companies a notice of violation
related to 10 generating facilities, which includes the five facilities
mentioned previously. In early 2000, the EPA filed a motion to amend its
complaint to add the violations alleged in its notice of violation and to add
Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, and Savannah Electric as defendants. The
complaint and notice of violation are similar to those brought against and
issued to several other electric utilities. These complaints and notices of
violation allege that the utilities had failed to secure necessary permits or
install additional pollution control equipment when performing maintenance and
construction at coal-burning plants constructed or under construction prior to
1978. The U.S. District Court in Georgia granted Alabama Power's motion to
dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and granted the system service company's motion
to dismiss on the grounds that it neither owned nor operated the generating
units involved in the proceedings. The court granted the EPA's motion to add
Savannah Electric as a defendant, but it denied the motion to add Gulf Power and
Mississippi Power based on lack of jurisdiction over those companies. The court
directed the EPA to refile its amended complaint limiting claims to those
brought against Georgia Power and Savannah Electric. The EPA refiled those
claims as directed by the court. Also, the EPA refiled its claims against
Alabama Power in U.S. District Court in Alabama. It has not refiled against
Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, or the system service company.

   The Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Savannah Electric cases have been
stayed since the spring of 2001, pending a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Eleventh Circuit in the appeal of a very similar New Source Review
enforcement action against the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). The TVA case
involves many of the same legal issues raised by the actions against Alabama
Power, Georgia Power, and Savannah Electric. Because the outcome of the TVA case
could have a significant adverse impact on Alabama Power and Georgia Power, both
companies are parties to that case as well. The U.S. District Court in Alabama
has indicated that it will revisit the issue of a continued stay in April 2002.
The U.S. District Court in Georgia is currently considering a motion by the EPA
to reopen the Georgia case. Georgia Power and Savannah Electric have opposed
that motion.

   Southern Company believes that its operating companies complied with
applicable laws and the EPA's regulations and interpretations in effect at the
time the work in question took place. An adverse outcome in any one of these
cases could require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined
at this time and could possibly require payment of substantial penalties. This
could affect future results of operations, cash flows, and possibly financial
condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

Mobile Energy Services' Petition for Bankruptcy

Mobile Energy Services Holdings (MESH), a subsidiary of Southern Company, is the
owner and operator of a facility that generates electricity, produces steam, and
processes black liquor as part of a pulp and paper complex in Mobile, Alabama.
On January 14, 1999, MESH filed a petition for Chapter 11 bankruptcy relief in
the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. This action was in response to Kimberly-Clark Tissue


                                       II-32

NOTES (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2001 Annual Report


Company's (Kimberly-Clark) announcement in May 1998 of plans to close its pulp
mill, effective September 1, 1999. The pulp mill had historically provided 50
percent of MESH's revenues.

   As a result of settlement discussions with Kimberly-Clark and MESH's
bondholders, Southern Company recorded in 1999 a $69 million after-tax write
down of its investment in MESH. Southern Company recorded an additional $10
million after-tax write down in 2000. At December 31, 2001, MESH had total
assets of $359 million and senior debt outstanding of $190 million of first
mortgage bonds and $72 million related to tax-exempt bonds. In connection with
the bond financings, Southern Company provided certain limited guarantees, in
lieu of funding debt service and maintenance reserve accounts with cash. As of
December 31, 2001, Southern Company had paid the full $41 million pursuant to
the guarantees. Southern Company continues to have guarantees outstanding of
certain potential environmental and other obligations of MESH that represent a
maximum contingent liability of $19 million at December 31, 2001. Mirant has
agreed to indemnify Southern Company for any future obligations incurred under
such guarantees.

   On August 4, 2000, MESH filed a proposed plan of reorganization with the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court. The proposed plan of reorganization was most recently amended
on October 15, 2001. Southern Company expects that approval of a plan of
reorganization would result in either a termination of Southern Company's
ownership interest in MESH or the exchange of all assets of MESH for the
cancellation of securities held by the bondholders but would not affect
Southern Company's continuing guarantee obligations discussed earlier. The final
outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

California Electricity Markets Litigation

Prior to the spin off of Mirant, Southern Company was named as a defendant in
two lawsuits filed in the superior courts of California alleging that certain
owners of electric generation facilities in California, including Southern
Company, engaged in various unlawful and anticompetitive acts that served to
manipulate wholesale power markets and inflate wholesale electricity prices in
California. One lawsuit naming Southern Company, Mirant, and other generators as
defendants alleged that, as a result of the defendants' conduct, customers paid
approximately $4 billion more for electricity than they otherwise would have and
sought an award of treble damages, as well as other injunctive and equitable
relief. The other suit likewise sought treble damages and equitable relief. The
allegations in the two lawsuits in which Southern Company was named seemed to be
directed to activities of subsidiaries of Mirant. On September 28 and November
6, 2001, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed Southern Company without prejudice
from the two lawsuits in which it had been named as a defendant. Prior to being
dismissed, Southern Company had notified Mirant of its claim for indemnification
for costs associated with the lawsuits under the terms of the master separation
agreement that governs the spin off of Mirant. Mirant had undertaken the defense
of the lawsuits. Plaintiffs would not be barred by their own dismissal from
naming Southern Company in some future lawsuit, but management believes that the
likelihood of Southern Company having to pay damages in any such lawsuit is
remote.

Race Discrimination Litigation

On July 28, 2000, a lawsuit alleging race discrimination was filed by three
Georgia Power employees against Georgia Power, Southern Company, and the system
service company in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia. Shortly
thereafter, the lawsuit was removed to the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Georgia. The lawsuit also raised claims on behalf of a
purported class. The plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages in an
unspecified amount, as well as injunctive relief. On August 14, 2000, the
lawsuit was amended to add four more plaintiffs. Also, an additional subsidiary
of Southern Company, Southern Company Energy Solutions, Inc., was named a
defendant.

   On October 11, 2001, the district court denied the plaintiffs' motion for
class certification. The plaintiffs filed a motion to reconsider the order
denying class certification, and the court denied the plaintiffs' motion to
reconsider. On December 28, 2001, the plaintiffs filed a petition in the United
States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit seeking permission to file an
appeal of the October 11 decision. The defendants filed a brief in opposition of
the petition on January 18, 2002. Discovery of the seven named plaintiffs'
individual claims that remain in the case is ongoing. The final outcome of the
case cannot now be determined.

Alabama Power Rate Adjustment Procedures

In November 1982, the Alabama Public Service Commission (APSC) adopted rates
that provide for periodic adjustments based upon Alabama Power's earned return
on end-of-period retail common equity. The rates also provide for adjustments to
recognize the placing of new generating facilities in retail service. Both
increases and decreases have been placed into effect since the adoption of these
rates. Most recently, a 2 percent increase in retail rates was effective in


                                       II-33

NOTES (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2001 Annual Report

October 2001, in accordance with the Rate Stabilization Equalization plan. The
rate adjustment procedures allow a return on common equity range of 13 percent
to 14.5 percent and limit increases or decreases in rates to 4 percent in any
calendar year and prohibits two consecutive quarterly adjustments in the same
direction.

   In December 1995, the APSC issued an order authorizing Alabama Power to
reduce balance sheet items -- such as plant and deferred charges -- at any time
the company's actual base rate revenues exceed the budgeted revenues. During the
years 2001, 2000, and 1999, Alabama Power did not record any such reductions.

   The ratemaking procedures will remain in effect until the APSC votes to
modify or discontinue them.

Georgia Power Retail Rate Orders

On December 20, 2001, the GPSC approved a three-year retail rate order for
Georgia Power ending December 31, 2004. Under the terms of the order, earnings
will be evaluated against a retail return on common equity range of 10 percent
to 12.95 percent. Two-thirds of any earnings above the 12.95 percent return will
be applied to rate refunds, with the remaining one-third retained by Georgia
Power. Retail rates were decreased by $118 million effective January 1, 2002.

   Under a previous three-year order ending December 2001, Georgia Power's
earnings were evaluated against a retail return on common equity range of 10
percent to 12.5 percent. The order further provided for $85 million in each
year, plus up to $50 million of any earnings above the 12.5 percent return
during the second and third years, to be applied to accelerated amortization or
depreciation of assets. Two-thirds of additional earnings above the 12.5 percent
return were applied to rate refunds, with the remaining one-third retained by
Georgia Power. Pursuant to the order, Georgia Power recorded $336 million of
accelerated amortization and interest thereon, which has been credited to a
regulatory liability account as mandated by the GPSC.

   Under the new rate order, the accelerated amortization and the interest will
be amortized equally over three years as a credit to expense beginning in 2002.
Effective January 1, 2002, Georgia Power discontinued recording accelerated
depreciation and amortization. Georgia Power will not file for a general base
rate increase unless its projected retail return on common equity falls below 10
percent. Georgia Power is required to file a general rate case on July 1, 2004,
in response to which the GPSC would be expected to determine whether the rate
order should be continued, modified, or discontinued.

   In 2000 and 1999, Georgia Power recorded $44 million and $79 million,
respectively, of revenue subject to refund for estimated earnings above 12.5
percent retail return on common equity. Refunds applicable to 2000 and 1999 were
made to customers in 2001 and 2000, respectively.

4. JOINT OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS

Alabama Power owns an undivided interest in units 1 and 2 of Plant Miller and
related facilities jointly with Alabama Electric Cooperative, Inc.

   Georgia Power owns undivided interests in plants Vogtle, Hatch, Scherer, and
Wansley in varying amounts jointly with Oglethorpe Power Corporation (OPC), the
Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia, the city of Dalton, Georgia, Florida
Power &Light Company (FP&L), and Jacksonville Electric Authority (JEA). In
addition, Georgia Power has joint ownership agreements with OPC for the Rocky
Mountain facilities and with Florida Power Corporation (FPC) for a combustion
turbine unit at Intercession City, Florida. Southern Power owns an undivided
interest in Stanton Unit A and related facilities jointly with the Orlando
Utilities Commission, Kissimmee Utility Authority, and Florida Municipal Power
Agency. The unit is scheduled to go into commercial operation in October 2003.

   At December 31, 2001, Alabama Power's and Georgia Power's ownership and
investment (exclusive of nuclear fuel) in jointly owned facilities with the
above entities were as follows:

NOTES (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2001 Annual Report


   Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Southern Power have contracted to operate
and maintain the jointly owned facilities -- except for the Rocky Mountain
project and Intercession City -- as agents for their respective co-owners. The
companies' proportionate share of their plant operating expenses is included in
the corresponding operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

5. LONG-TERM POWER SALES AND LEASE
   AGREEMENTS

The operating companies have long-term contractual agreements for the sale and
lease of capacity to certain non-affiliated utilities located outside the
system's service area. These agreements are firm and are related to specific
generating units. Because the energy is generally provided at cost under these
agreements, profitability is primarily affected by capacity revenues.

   Unit power from specific generating plants is currently being sold to FP&L,
FPC, and JEA. Under these agreements, approximately 1,500 megawatts of capacity
is scheduled to be sold annually unless reduced by FP&L, FPC, and JEA for the
periods after 2001 with a minimum of three years notice -- until the expiration
of the contracts in 2010. Capacity revenues from unit power sales amounted to
$170 million in 2001, $177 million in 2000, and $174 million in 1999.

   Southern Power and Mississippi Power have operating leases for portions of
their generating unit capacity. Capacity revenues from these operating leases
amounted to $53 million in 2001 and $20 million in 2000. These amounts are
included in the financial statements as sales for resale. Minimum future
capacity receipts from noncancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2001,
are as follows:

6. INCOME TAXES

At December 31, 2001, the tax-related regulatory assets and liabilities were
$924 million and $500 million, respectively. These assets are attributable to
tax benefits flowed through to customers in prior years and to taxes applicable
to capitalized interest. These liabilities are attributable to deferred taxes
previously recognized at rates higher than current enacted tax law and to
unamortized investment tax credits. The following tables and disclosures exclude
discontinued operations.

   Details of income tax provisions are as follows:

   In accordance with regulatory requirements, deferred investment tax credits
are amortized over the lives of the related property with such amortization
normally applied as a credit to reduce depreciation in the Consolidated
Statements of Income. Credits amortized in this manner amounted to $30 million a
year in 2001, 2000, and 1999. At December 31, 2001, all investment tax credits
available to reduce federal income taxes payable had been utilized.

   Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return. Under a
joint consolidated income tax agreement, each subsidiary's current and deferred
tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis. In accordance with Internal
Revenue Service regulations, each company is jointly and severally liable for
the tax liability.

   Mirant was included in the consolidated federal tax return through April 2,
2001. Under the terms of the separation agreement, Mirant will indemnify
Southern Company for subsequent assessment of any additional taxes related to
its transactions prior to the spin off.

7. COMMON STOCK

Stock Issued and Repurchased

Southern Company issued 17 million and 5 million treasury shares of common stock
in 2001 and 2000, respectively, through various company stock plans. Proceeds
were $395 million in 2001 and $140 million in 2000. The shares were issued
through various company stock plans. At December 31, 2001, approximately 2
million treasury shares remain unissued.

   In December 2000, Southern Company issued 28 million treasury shares of
common stock through a public offering. The offering, which included an
overallotment of 3 million shares, raised some $800 million and was priced at
$28.50 per share. The proceeds were used to repay short-term commercial paper.

   In April 1999, Southern Company's Board of Directors approved the repurchase
of up to 50 million shares of Southern Company's common stock over a two-year
period through open market or privately negotiated transactions. Under this
program, 50 million shares were repurchased by February 2000 at an average price
of $25.53 per share.

Shares Reserved

At December 31, 2001, a total of 76 million shares was reserved for issuance
pursuant to the Southern Investment Plan, the Employee Savings Plan, the Outside
Directors Stock Plan, and the Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (stock option
plan).

Stock Option Plan

Southern Company provides non-qualified stock options to a large segment of its
employees ranging from line management to executives. As of December 31, 2001,
5,622 current and former employees participated in the stock option plan. The
maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued under this plan may
not exceed 55 million. The prices of options granted to date have been at the
fair market value of the shares on the dates of grant. Options granted to date
become exercisable pro rata over a maximum period of three years from the date
of grant. Options outstanding will expire no later than 10 years after the date
of grant, unless terminated earlier by the Southern Company Board of Directors
in accordance with the plan. Stock option data for the plan has been adjusted to
reflect the Mirant spin off. Activity in 2000 and 2001 for the plan is

Common Stock Dividend Restrictions

The income of Southern Company is derived primarily from equity in earnings of
its subsidiaries. At December 31, 2001, consolidated retained earnings included
$3.4 billion of undistributed retained earnings of the subsidiaries. Of this
amount, $2.1 billion was restricted against the payment by the subsidiary
companies of cash dividends on common stock under terms of bond indentures.
However, Georgia Power expects to discharge its first mortgage bond indenture in
early 2002 and to be released from all indenture requirements. The $2.1 billion
restriction includes $1.0 billion for Georgia Power under the current indenture
requirements.

8. FINANCING

Capital and Preferred Securities

Company or subsidiary obligated mandatorily redeemable capital and preferred
securities have been issued by special purpose financing entities of Southern
Company and its subsidiaries. Substantially all the assets of these special
financing entities are junior subordinated notes issued by the related company
seeking financing. Each of these companies considers that the mechanisms and
obligations relating to the capital or preferred securities issued for its
benefit, taken together, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by it of
the respective special financing entities' payment obligations with respect to
the capital or preferred securities. At December 31, 2001, capital securities of
$950 million and preferred securities of $1.3 billion were outstanding and
recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Southern Company guarantees the
notes related to $950 million of capital or preferred securities issued on its
behalf.

Total                                          $429        $67
=================================================================

   The first mortgage bond improvement fund requirements amount to 1 percent of
each outstanding series of bonds authenticated under the indentures prior to
January 1 of each year, other than those issued to collateralize pollution
control revenue bonds and other obligations. The requirements may be satisfied
by depositing cash or reacquiring bonds, or by pledging additional property
equal to 1662/3 percent of such requirements.

   With respect to the collateralized pollution control revenue bonds, the
operating companies have authenticated and delivered to trustees a like
principal amount of first mortgage bonds as security for obligations under
installment sale or loan agreements. The principal and interest on the first
mortgage bonds will be payable only in the event of default under the
agreements.

   Improvement fund requirements and/or serial maturities through 2006
applicable to total long-term debt are as follows: $429 million in 2002; $1.1
billion in 2003; $894 million in 2004; $399 million in 2005; and $226 million in
2006.

Assets Subject to Lien

Each of Southern Company's subsidiaries is organized as a legal entity, separate
and apart from Southern Company and its other subsidiaries. The subsidiary
companies' mortgages, which secure the first mortgage bonds issued by the
companies, constitute a direct first lien on substantially all of the companies'
respective fixed property and franchises. Georgia Power expects to discharge its
mortgage in early 2002 and that the lien will be removed. There are no
agreements or other arrangements among the subsidiary companies under which the
assets of one company have been pledged or otherwise made available to satisfy
obligations of Southern Company or any of its other subsidiaries.

Bank Credit Arrangements

At the beginning of 2002, unused credit arrangements with banks totaled $5.1
billion, of which $3.7 billion expires during 2002, $500 million expires during
2003, and $900 million expires during 2004. The following table outlines the
credit arrangements by company:

   Approximately $2.9 billion of the credit facilities expiring in 2002 allows
for term loans ranging from one to three years. Most of the agreements include
stated borrowing rates but also allow for competitive bid loans.

   All of the credit arrangements require payment of commitment fees based on
the unused portion of the commitments or the maintenance of compensating
balances with the banks. These balances are not legally restricted from
withdrawal. Included in the $5.1 billion of unused credit arrangements is $4.8
billion of syndicated credit arrangements that require the payment of agent
fees.

   A portion of the $5.1 billion unused credit with banks is allocated to
provide liquidity support to the companies' variable rate pollution control
bonds. The amount of variable rate pollution control bonds requiring liquidity
support as of December 31, 2001 was $1.6 billion.

   Southern Company and the operating companies borrow through commercial paper
programs that have the liquidity support of committed bank credit arrangements.
In addition, the companies from time to time borrow under uncommitted lines of
credit with banks. The amount of commercial paper outstanding at December 31,
2001 was $1.8 billion.

9. COMMITMENTS

Construction Program

Southern Company is engaged in continuous construction programs, currently
estimated to total $2.8 billion in 2002, $2.1 billion in 2003, and $2.3 billion
in 2004. The construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision,
and actual construction costs may vary from the above estimates because of
numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions;
acquisition of additional generating assets; revised load growth estimates;
changes in environmental regulations; changes in existing nuclear plants to meet
new regulatory requirements; increasing costs of labor, equipment, and
materials; and cost of capital. At December 31, 2001, significant purchase
commitments were outstanding in connection with the construction program.
Southern Company has approximately 4,500 megawatts of additional generating
capacity scheduled to be placed in service by 2003, of which 3,900 megawatts
will be competitive generation assets.

   See Management's Discussion and Analysis under "Environmental Matters" for
information on the impact of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and other
environmental matters.

Fuel and Purchased Power Commitments

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of the generating plants, Southern
Company has entered into various long-term commitments for the procurement of
fossil and nuclear fuel. In most cases, these contracts contain provisions for
price escalations, minimum purchase levels, and other financial commitments.
Natural gas purchases are based on various indices at the time of delivery;
therefore, only the volume commitments are firm and disclosed in the following
chart. Also, Southern Company has entered into various long-term commitments for
the purchase of electricity. Total estimated minimum long-term obligations at
December 31, 2001, were as follows:

                           Natural

Operating Leases

In May 2001, Mississippi Power began the initial 10-year term of a lease
agreement signed in 1999 for a combined cycle generating facility built at Plant
Daniel. The facility cost approximately $370 million. The lease provides for a
residual value guarantee -- approximately 71 percent of the completion cost --
by Mississippi Power that is due upon termination of the lease in certain
circumstances. The lease also includes purchase and renewal options. Upon
termination of the lease, Mississippi Power may either exercise its purchase
option of the facility or allow it to be sold to a third party. Mississippi
Power expects the fair market value of the leased facility to substantially
reduce or eliminate its payment under the residual value guarantee. The amount
of future minimum operating lease payments exclusive of any payment related to
this guarantee will be approximately $25 million annually during the initial
term.

   Southern Company has other operating lease agreements with various terms and
expiration dates. Total operating lease expenses were $64 million, $42 million,
and $35 million for 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. At December 31, 2001,
estimated minimum rental commitments for noncancelable operating leases were as
follows:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------
Total minimum payments                                    $656
===============================================================

   In addition to the above rental commitments, Alabama Power and Georgia Power
have obligations upon expiration of certain rail car leases with respect to the
residual value of the leased property. These leases expire in 2004, 2006, and
2010, and the maximum obligations are $39 million, $66 million, and $40 million,
respectively. At the termination of the leases, the lessee may either exercise
its purchase option or the property can be sold to a third party. Alabama Power
and Georgia Power expect that the fair market value of the leased property would
substantially reduce or eliminate the payments under the residual value
obligations.

Guarantees

Southern Company has made separate guarantees to certain counterparties
regarding performance of contractual commitments by Mirant's trading and
marketing subsidiaries. At December 31, 2001, the total original notional amount
of guarantees was $53 million, all of which will expire by 2007. Estimated fair
value of these net contractual commitments outstanding was approximately $25
million. Under the terms of the separation agreement, Mirant may not enter into
any new commitments under these guarantees after the spin off date. Based upon a
statistical analysis of credit risk, Southern Company's potential exposure under
these contractual commitments would not materially differ from the estimated
fair value.

   Mirant will pay Southern Company a fee of 1 percent annually on the average
aggregate maximum principal amount of all guarantees outstanding until they are
replaced or expire. Mirant must use reasonable efforts to release Southern
Company from all such support arrangements and will indemnify Southern Company
for any obligations incurred.

10. NUCLEAR INSURANCE

Under the Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 1988, Alabama Power and Georgia Power
maintain agreements of indemnity with the NRC that, together with private
insurance, cover third-party liability arising from any nuclear incident
occurring at the companies' nuclear power plants. The act provides funds up to
$9.5 billion for public liability claims that could arise from a single nuclear
incident. Each nuclear plant is insured against this liability to a maximum of
$200 million by American Nuclear Insurers (ANI), with the remaining coverage
provided by a mandatory program of deferred premiums that could be assessed,
after a nuclear incident, against all owners of nuclear reactors. A company
could be assessed up to $88 million per incident for each licensed reactor it
operates, but not more than an aggregate of $10 million per incident to be paid
in a calendar year for each reactor. Such maximum assessment, excluding any
applicable state premium taxes, for Alabama Power and Georgia Power -- based on
its ownership and buyback interests -- is $176 million and $178 million,
respectively, per incident, but not more than an aggregate of $20 million per
company to be paid for each incident in any one year.

   Alabama Power and Georgia Power are members of Nuclear Electric Insurance
Limited (NEIL), a mutual insurer established to provide property damage
insurance in an amount up to $500 million for members' nuclear generating
facilities.

   Additionally, both companies have policies that currently provide
decontamination, excess property insurance, and premature decommissioning
coverage up to $2.25 billion for losses in excess of the $500 million primary
coverage. This excess insurance is also provided by NEIL.

   NEIL also covers the additional costs that would be incurred in obtaining
replacement power during a prolonged accidental outage at a member's nuclear
plant. Members can purchase this coverage, subject to a deductible waiting
period of between 8 to 26 weeks, with a maximum per occurrence per unit limit of
$490 million. After this deductible period, weekly indemnity payments would be
received until either the unit is operational or until the limit is exhausted in
approximately three years.

   Under each of the NEIL policies, members are subject to assessments if losses
each year exceed the accumulated funds available to the insurer under that
policy. The current maximum annual assessments for Alabama Power and Georgia
Power under the three NEIL policies would be $35 million and $39 million,
respectively.

   Following the terrorist attacks of September 2001, both ANI and NEIL
confirmed that terrorist acts against commercial nuclear power plants would be
covered under their insurance. However, both companies revised their policy
terms on a prospective basis to include an industry aggregate for all terrorist
acts. The NEIL aggregate, which applies to all claims stemming from terrorism
within a 12-month duration, is $3.24 billion plus any amounts that would be
available through reinsurance or indemnity from an outside source. The ANI cap
is $200 million in a policy year.

   For all on-site property damage insurance policies for commercial nuclear
power plants, the NRC requires that the proceeds of such policies shall be
dedicated first for the sole purpose of placing the reactor in a safe and stable
condition after an accident. Any remaining proceeds are to be applied next
toward the costs of decontamination and debris removal operations ordered by the
NRC, and any further remaining proceeds are to be paid either to the company or
to its bond trustees as may be appropriate under the policies and applicable
trust indentures.

   All retrospective assessments -- whether generated for liability, property,
or replacement power -- may be subject to applicable state premium taxes.

11. DISCOUNTINUED OPERATIONS

In April 2000, Southern Company announced an initial public offering of up to
19.9 percent of Mirant and its intentions to spin off the remaining ownership of
Mirant to Southern Company stockholders within 12 months of the initial stock
offering. On October 2, 2000, Mirant completed its initial public offering of
66.7 million shares of common stock priced at $22 per share. This represented
19.7 percent of the 338.7 million shares outstanding. As a result of the stock
offering, Southern Company recorded a $560 million increase in paid-in capital
with no gain or loss being recognized.

   On February 19, 2001, the Southern Company Board of Directors approved the
spin off of its remaining ownership of 272 million Mirant shares. On April 2,
2001, the tax-free distribution of Mirant shares was completed at a ratio of
approximately 0.4 for every share of Southern Company common stock held at
record date.

   The distribution resulted in charges of approximately $3.2 billion and $0.4
billion to Southern Company's paid-in capital and retained earnings,
respectively. The distribution was treated as a non-cash transaction for
purposes of the statement of cash flows.

   As a result of the spin off, Southern Company's financial statements reflect
Mirant's results of operations, balance sheets, and cash flows as discontinued
operations. Certain amounts in the cash flows related to intercompany
eliminations for 2000 and 1999 have been reclassified from cash provided from
operating activities to cash used for discontinued operations.

   Summarized financial information for the discontinued operations is as
follows at December 31:

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT
Alabama Power Company 2001 Annual Report


The management of Alabama Power Company has prepared -- and is responsible for
- -- the financial statements and related information included in this report.
These statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States and necessarily include amounts that are
based on the best estimates and judgments of management. Financial information
throughout this annual report is consistent with the financial statements.

    The Company maintains a system of internal accounting controls to provide
reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that the accounting records
reflect only authorized transactions of the Company. Limitations exist in any
system of internal controls, however, based on a recognition that the cost of
the system should not exceed its benefits. The Company believes its system of
internal accounting controls maintains an appropriate cost/benefit relationship.

    The Company's system of internal accounting controls is evaluated on an
ongoing basis by the Company's internal audit staff. The Company's independent
public accountants also consider certain elements of the internal control system
in order to determine their auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the financial statements.

    The audit committee of the board of directors, composed of four independent
directors, provides a broad overview of management's financial reporting and
control functions. Periodically, this committee meets with management, the
internal auditors and the independent public accountants to ensure that these
groups are fulfilling their obligations and to discuss auditing, internal
controls, and financial reporting matters. The internal auditors and independent
public accountants have access to the members of the audit committee at any
time.

    Management believes that its policies and procedures provide reasonable
assurance that the Company's operations are conducted according to a high
standard of business ethics.

    In management's opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows
of Alabama Power Company in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


To Alabama Power Company:


We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements of capitalization
of Alabama Power Company (an Alabama corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary
of Southern Company) as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related
statements of income, common stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

    We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

    In our opinion, the financial statements (pages II-58 through II-76)
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Alabama Power Company as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.

   As explained in Note 1 to the financial statements, effective January 1,
2001, Alabama Power Company changed its method of accounting for derivative
instruments and hedging activities.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION
Alabama Power Company 2001 Annual Report


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

Alabama Power Company's 2001 net income after dividends on preferred stock was
$387 million, representing a $33 million (7.9 percent) decrease from the prior
year. This decline is primarily attributable to a decrease in territorial energy
sales as a result of an economic downturn and milder temperatures.

    In 2000 earnings were $420 million, representing a 5 percent increase from
the prior year. This improvement was primarily attributable to an increase in
territorial sales partially offset by increased non-fuel operating expenses.

    The return on average common equity for 2001 was 11.89 percent compared to
13.58 percent in 2000 and 13.85 percent in 1999.


Revenues

Operating revenues for 2001 were $3.6 billion, reflecting a decrease from 2000.
The following table summarizes the principal factors that have affected
operating revenues for the past two years:

                                           Increase (Decrease)

    Retail revenues of $2.7 billion in 2001 decreased
$205 million (6.9 percent) from the prior year, compared with an increase of
$142 million (5 percent) in 2000. The primary contributors to the decrease in
revenues in 2001 were the negative impact of milder temperatures on energy
sales, an economic downturn in the Company's service territory, and a decrease
in fuel revenues. Fuel revenues have no effect on net income because they
represent the recording of revenues to offset fuel expenses. Fuel rates billed
to customers are designed to fully recover fluctuating fuel costs over a period
of time. Lower natural gas prices, an increased fuel rate, and increased hydro
production combined with decreased costs of purchased power have resulted in a
$154 million (65 percent) reduction in under-recovered fuel costs at December
31, 2001 compared with the prior year. The Company expects to continue to reduce
the balance of $83 million during 2002.


                                      II-48

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Alabama Power Company 2001 Annual Report


    Other operating revenues in 2001 increased $21 million (23.9 percent) over
2000. This increase is primarily attributed to increased steam sales in
conjunction with the operation of the Company's co-generation facilities, fuel
sales, and rent from electric property. Since co-generation steam revenues are
generally offset by fuel expenses, these revenues did not have a significant
impact on earnings.

    The $20 million (30.5 percent) increase in other operating revenues in 2000
as compared to 1999 was due primarily to an increase in steam sales in
conjunction with the operation of the Company's co-generation facilities.

    Energy sales for resale outside the service area are predominantly unit
power sales under long-term contracts to Florida utilities. Economy energy and
energy sold under short-term contracts are also sold for resale outside the
service area. Revenues from long-term power contracts have both a capacity and
energy component. Capacity revenues reflect the recovery of fixed costs and a
return on investment under the contracts. Energy is generally sold at variable
cost. These capacity and energy components of the unit power contracts were as
follows:

                           2001           2000          1999

 Total                     $259           $255          $234
 ============================================================

    Capacity revenues from non-affiliates were relatively unchanged in 2001
compared to the prior two years. There are no scheduled declines in capacity
until the termination of the contracts in 2010.

    Revenues from sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric
system, as well as purchases of energy, will vary from year to year depending on
demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company.
These transactions did not have a significant impact on earnings.

    Kilowatt-hour (KWH) sales for 2001 and the percent change by year were as
follows:

    Retail energy sales in 2001 decreased by 5.2 percent due to milder
temperatures and an economic downturn in the Company's service area. This was
offset by an increase in sales for resale to affiliates. Increased operation of
the Company's combined cycle facilities due to lower natural gas prices and an
increase in the Company's combined cycle capacity contributed to the increase in
sales for resale.

    The increase in 2000 retail energy sales was primarily due to the strength
of business and economic conditions in the Company's service area. Residential
energy sales experienced a 6.8 percent increase over the prior year primarily as
a result of warmer summer temperatures and cold winter weather conditions
compared to 1999.

Expenses

In 2001 total operating expenses of $2.7 billion were down $50 million or 1.8
percent compared with 2000. This decline is mainly due to an $18 million net
decrease in fuel and purchased power costs and a $56 million decrease in
non-production operation and maintenance expenses, offset by a $19 million
increase in depreciation. Fuel expenses, including purchased power, are offset
by fuel revenues and have no effect on net income.

    In 2000 total operating expenses of $2.7 billion were up $235 million or 9.4
percent compared with the prior year. This increase was mainly due to a $183
million increase in fuel and purchased power costs, accompanied by a $23 million
increase in maintenance expenses.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Alabama Power Company 2001 Annual Report


    Fuel costs constitute the single largest expense for the Company. The mix of
fuel sources for generation of electricity is determined primarily by system
load, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the availability of hydro and nuclear
generating units. The amount and sources of generation and the average cost of
fuel per net KWH generated were as follows:

                                    --------------------------
                                      2001     2000     1999

==============================================================

    In 2001, total fuel and purchased power costs of $1.3 billion decreased $18
million (1.4 percent), while total energy sales increased 1,174 million kilowatt
hours (1.6 percent) compared with the amounts recorded in 2000. Fuel and
purchased power costs in 2000 increased $183 million (16 percent) compared to
1999.

    Purchased power consists of purchases from affiliates in the Southern
electric system and non-affiliated companies. Purchased power transactions among
the Company and its affiliates will vary from period to period depending on
demand, the availability, and the variable production cost of generating
resources at each company. During 2001 purchased power transactions from
non-affiliates decreased $20 million (12 percent) due to the addition in May
2001 of a combined cycle unit and an 82 percent increase in hydro generation
compared to the previous year. The hydro generation increase occurred from
greater stream flows in 2001 compared to the previous year.

    The 6 percent decrease in other operation expense in 2001 as compared to
2000 is primarily due to a decrease in administrative and general expenses,
which can be mainly attributed to insurance refunds.

    The 8.5 percent decrease in maintenance expense in 2001 as compared to 2000
is primarily due to a decrease in power production expense as a result of timing
of maintenance for steam power generation facilities. The 8.4 percent increase
in maintenance expense in 2000 as compared to 1999 is primarily attributable to
an increase in the maintenance of overhead distribution lines and additional
accruals to partially replenish the natural disaster reserve.

    Depreciation and amortization expense increased 5.2 percent in 2001 and 4.9
percent in 2000. These increases reflect additions to property, plant, and
equipment.

      Total net interest and other charges increased $10 million (4.0 percent)
in 2001. The increase reflected a decrease in Allowance for Funds Used During
Construction (AFUDC) resulting in a smaller credit to interest expense than was
recorded in 2000. Total net interest and other charges increased $19 million
(7.9 percent) in 2000 primarily from an increase in interest on long-term debt
offset by an increase in AFUDC, which resulted in a larger credit to interest
expense.

Effects of Inflation

The Company is subject to rate regulation and income tax laws that are based on
the recovery of historical costs. Therefore, inflation creates an economic loss
because the Company is recovering its costs of investments in dollars that have
less purchasing power. While the inflation rate has been relatively low in
recent years, it continues to have an adverse effect on the Company because of
the large investment in utility plant with long economic lives. Conventional
accounting for historical cost does not recognize this economic loss nor the
partially offsetting gain that arises through financing facilities with
fixed-money obligations, such as long-term debt and preferred securities. Any
recognition of inflation by regulatory authorities is reflected in the rate of
return allowed.

Future Earnings Potential

General

The results of continuing operations for the past three years are not
necessarily indicative of future earnings potential. The level of future
earnings depends on numerous factors. The major factor is the ability of the
Company to achieve energy sales growth while containing cost in a more
competitive environment. Growth in energy sales is subject to a number of
factors. These factors include weather, competition, new short- and long-term


                                       II-50

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Alabama Power Company 2001 Annual Report


contracts with neighboring utilities, energy conservation practiced by
customers, the elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic growth in the
Company's service area.

    Assuming normal weather, sales to retail customers are projected to grow
approximately 2.4 percent annually on average during 2002 through 2006.

    The Company currently operates as a vertically integrated utility providing
electricity to customers within its traditional service area located in the
state of Alabama. Prices for electricity provided by the Company to retail
customers are set by the Alabama Public Service Commission (APSC) under
cost-based regulatory principles.

    Rates to retail customers served by the Company are regulated by the APSC.
Rates for the Company can be adjusted periodically within certain limitations
based on earned retail rate of return compared with an allowed return. The rates
also provide for adjustments to recognize the placing of new generating
facilities into retail service under Rate CNP (Certificated New Plant).
Effective July 2001, the Company's retail rates were adjusted by 0.6 percent
under Rate CNP to recover costs for Plant Barry Unit 7, which was placed into
commercial operation on May 1, 2001. Most recently, a 2 percent increase in
retail rates was effective in October 2001, in accordance with the Rate
Stabilization Equalization plan. See Note 3 to the financial statements under
"Retail Rate Adjustment Procedures" for additional information.

    In December 1995, the APSC issued an order authorizing the Company to reduce
balance sheet items-- such as plant and deferred charges -- at any time the
Company's actual base rate revenues exceed the budgeted revenues.

    In April 2000, the APSC approved an amendment to the Company's existing rate
structure to provide for the recovery of retail costs associated with certified
purchased power agreements. In November 2000 the APSC certified a seven-year
purchased power agreement pertaining to 615 megawatts of the wholesale
generating facilities, which were sold to Southern Power in June 2001 and are
under construction in Autaugaville, Alabama. All of the 615 megawatts will be
delivered beginning in 2003. In addition the APSC certified a seven-year
purchased power agreement with a third party for approximately 630 megawatts;
one half of the power will be delivered beginning in 2003 while the remaining
half is scheduled for delivery beginning in 2004. Rate CNP will adjust retail
rates when the contracted capacity delivery begins.

    In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No.
87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions, the Company recorded non-cash income of
approximately $57 million in 2001. Future pension income is dependent on several
factors including trust earnings and changes to the plan. For the Company,
pension income is a component of the regulated rates and does not have a
significant effect on net income. For more information see Note 2 to the
financial statements.

    The Company is involved in various matters being litigated. See Note 3 to
the financial statements for information regarding material issues that could
possibly affect future earnings.

    Compliance costs related to current and future environmental laws,
regulations, and litigation could affect earnings if such costs are not fully
recovered. The Clean Air Act and other important environmental items are
discussed later under "Environmental Matters."

Industry Restructuring

    The electric utility industry in the United States is continuing to evolve
as a result of regulatory and competitive factors. Among the primary agents of
change has been the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Energy Act). The Energy Act
allows independent power producers (IPPs) to access a utility's transmission
network in order to sell electricity to other utilities. This enhances the
incentive for IPPs to build cogeneration plants for a utility's large industrial
and/or commercial customers and sell excess energy generation to other
utilities. Also, electricity sales for resale rates are affected by wholesale
transmission access and numerous potential new energy suppliers, including power
marketers and brokers.

   Although the Energy Act does not permit retail customer access, it was a
major catalyst for the recent restructuring and consolidation taking place
within the utility industry. Numerous federal and state initiatives are in
varying stages to promote wholesale and retail competition. Among other things
these initiatives allow customers to choose their electricity provider. Some
states have approved initiatives that result in a separation of the ownership
and/or operation of generating facilities from the ownership and/or operation of
transmission and distribution facilities. While various restructuring and


                                       II-51

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Alabama Power Company 2001 Annual Report


competition initiatives have been discussed in Alabama, none have been enacted.
In October 2000 the APSC completed a two-year study of electric industry
restructuring, concluding that (i) restructuring of the electric utility
industry in Alabama was not in the public interest and (ii) the APSC itself
would not mandate retail competition or electric industry restructuring without
enabling state legislation. Electric utility restructuring would require
numerous issues to be resolved, including significant ones relating to recovery
of any stranded investments, full cost recovery of energy produced, and other
issues related to the energy crisis that occurred in California. As a result of
that crisis, many states have either discontinued or delayed implementation of
initiatives involving retail deregulation.

   Continuing to be a low-cost producer could provide opportunities to increase
market share and profitability in markets that evolve with changing regulation.
Conversely, if the Company does not remain a low-cost producer and provide
quality service, then energy sales growth could be limited, and this could
significantly erode earnings.

   The Company had 1,230 megawatts of wholesale generating facilities under
construction in 2001 at Autaugaville, Alabama. In June 2001 the Company sold
this project to Southern Power Company, a new Southern Company subsidiary formed
in 2001 to construct, own, and manage wholesale generating assets in the
Southeast. The Company has entered into a purchased power agreement with
Southern Power, through May 2010, for half of the capacity of these generating
facilities.

    In December 1999, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued its
final ruling on Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs). The order encouraged
utilities owning transmission systems to form RTOs on a voluntary basis.
Southern Company and its operating companies, including the Company, have
submitted a series of status reports informing the FERC of progress toward the
development of a Southeastern RTO. In these status reports, Southern Company
explained that it is developing a for-profit RTO known as SeTrans with a number
of non-jurisdictional cooperative and public power entities. Recently, Entergy
Corporation and Cleco Power joined the SeTrans development process. In January
2002 the sponsors of SeTrans held a public meeting to form a Stakeholder
Advisory Committee, which will participate in the development of the RTO.
Southern Company continues to work with the other sponsors to develop the
SeTrans RTO. The creation of SeTrans is not expected to have a material impact
on the Company's financial statements. The outcome of this matter cannot now be
determined.

Accounting Standards

Critical Policy

The Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements. The Company's most critical accounting policy involves
rate regulation. The Company is subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No.
71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. In the event that
a portion of the Company's operation is no longer subject to these provisions,
the Company would be required to write off related regulatory assets and
liabilities that are not specifically recoverable and determine if any other
assets have been impaired. See Note 1 to the financial statements under
"Regulatory Assets and Liabilities" for additional information.

New Accounting Standards

Effective January 2001, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. Statement No. 133
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and
for hedging activities. This statement requires that certain derivative
instruments be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability
measured at fair value, and that changes in the fair value be recognized
currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. See
Note 1 to the financial statements under "Financial Instruments" for additional
information. The impact on net income in 2001 was not material. An additional
interpretation of Statement No. 133 will result in a change - effective April 1,
2002 - in accounting for certain contracts related to fuel supplies that contain
quantity options. These contracts will be accounted for as derivatives and
marked to market. However, due to the existence of the Company's cost-based fuel
recovery clause, this change is not expected to have a material impact on net
income.

   In June 2001 the FASB issued Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets, which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for acquired
goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 17. Statement No. 142 addresses how intangible assets that are

                                       II-52

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Alabama Power Company 2001 Annual Report


acquired individually or with a group of other assets (but not those acquired in
a business combination) should be accounted for upon acquisition and on an
ongoing basis. Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives
will not be amortized but rather will be tested at least annually for
impairment. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives will continue to be
amortized over their useful lives, which are no longer limited to 40 years. The
Company adopted Statement No.142 in January 2002 with no material impact on the
financial statements.

   Also in June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143, Asset Retirement
Obligations, which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal
obligations associated with retiring assets, including decommissioning of
nuclear plants. The liability for an asset's future retirement must be recorded
in the period in which the liability is incurred. The cost must be capitalized
as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful
life. Changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time will be
recognized as operating expenses. Statement No. 143 must be adopted by January
1, 2003. The Company has not yet quantified the impact of adopting Statement No.
143 on its financial statements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

In 2001, despite significant cost control measures, the Company's earnings were
adversely impacted by an economic downturn and milder temperatures. However,
over the last several years the Company's financial condition has remained
stable as a result of growth in retail energy sales and cost control measures
combined with significant lowering of the cost of capital, achieved through the
refinancing and/or redemption of higher-cost long-term debt and preferred stock.

    The Company had gross property additions of $636 million in 2001. The
majority of funds needed for gross property additions for the last several years
have been provided from operating activities, principally from earnings and
non-cash charges to income such as depreciation and deferred income taxes. The
Statements of Cash Flows provide additional details.

Credit Rating Risk

The Company does not have any credit agreements that would require material
changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating
downgrade.

Exposure to Market Risk

Due to cost-based rate regulation, the Company has limited exposure to market
volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity.
To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the
Company enters into fixed price contracts for the purchase and sale of
electricity through the wholesale electricity market. Realized gains and losses
are recognized in the income statement as incurred. At December 31, 2001,
exposure from these activities was not material to the Company's financial
position, results of operations, or cash flows. Fair value of changes in energy
trading contracts and year-end valuations are as follows:

    Also, based on the Company's overall variable rate long-term debt exposure
at December 31, 2001, a near-term 100 basis point change in interest rates would
not materially affect the financial statements.

    For additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements under
"Financial Instruments."

    In October 2001, the APSC approved a revision to the Company's Rate ECR
(Energy Cost Recovery) allowing the recovery of specific costs associated with


                                       II-53

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Alabama Power Company 2001 Annual Report


the sales of natural gas that become necessary due to operating considerations
at its electric generating facilities. This revision also includes the cost of
financial tools used for hedging market price risk up to 75 percent of the
budgeted annual amount of natural gas purchases. The Company may not engage in
natural gas hedging activities that extend beyond a rolling 42-month window.


Capital Structure

The Company's ratio of common equity to total capitalization -- including
short-term debt -- was 42.8 percent in 2001, 42.2 percent in 2000, and 42.4
percent in 1999.

    In August 2001, the Company issued $442 million of senior notes, the
proceeds of which were used to redeem the $131.5 million outstanding principal
of its First Mortgage Bonds, 9% Series due December 1, 2004 and for other
corporate purposes, including the repayment of a portion of its short-term
indebtedness.

Capital Requirements

Capital expenditures are estimated to be $671 million for 2002, $592 million for
2003, and $673 million for 2004. See Note 4 to the financial statements for
additional details.

    Actual construction costs may vary from estimates because of changes in such
factors as: business conditions; environmental regulations; nuclear plant
regulations; load projections; the cost and efficiency of construction labor,
equipment, and materials; and the cost of capital. In addition there can be no
assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered.

Other Capital Requirements

In addition to the funds required for the Company's construction program,
approximately $1.1 billion will be required by the end of 2004 for present
sinking fund requirements and maturities of long-term debt. The Company plans to
continue, when economically feasible, to retire higher cost debt and preferred
stock and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions
permit.

    These capital requirements, lease obligations, and purchase commitments -
discussed in notes 4 and 8 to the financial statements - are as follows:

Environmental Matters

In November 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (Clean Air Act) were
signed into law. Title IV of the Clean Air Act -- the acid rain compliance
provision of the law -- significantly affected Southern Company. Reductions in
sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from fossil-fired generating plants
were required in two phases. Phase I compliance began in 1995.

    Southern Company achieved Phase I compliance at its affected plants by
primarily switching to low-sulfur coal and with some equipment upgrades.
Construction expenditures for Phase I nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide
emissions compliance totaled approximately $25 million for the Company.

    Phase II sulfur dioxide compliance was required in 2000. The Company used
emission allowances and fuel switching to comply with Phase II requirements.
Also, equipment to control nitrogen oxide emissions was installed on additional
system fossil-fired units as necessary to meet Phase II limits. Compliance with
Phase II increased the Company's total construction expenditures through 2000 by
$63 million.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Alabama Power Company 2001 Annual Report


    In December 2000, the Alabama Department of Environmental Management adopted
revisions to the State Implementation Plan for meeting the one-hour ozone
standard. New emission limits to comply with these requirements must be
implemented in May 2003. Two generating plants will be affected in the
Birmingham area. Capital expenditures for compliance with these new rules are
currently estimated at approximately $240 million, of which $170 million remains
to be spent.

    In July 1997, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) revised the national
ambient air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter. This revision
made the standards significantly more stringent. In the subsequent litigation of
these standards, the U. S. Supreme Court found the EPA's implementation program
for the new ozone standard unlawful and remanded it to the EPA. In addition, the
Federal District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals is considering other legal
challenges to these standards. A court decision is expected in the spring of
2002. If the standards are eventually upheld, implementation could be required
by 2007 to 2010.

    In September 1998, the EPA issued nitrogen oxide reduction rules to the
states for implementation. The final rule affects 21 states, including Alabama.
Compliance is required by May 31, 2004 for most states including Alabama.
Capital expenditures for compliance with these new rules are currently estimated
at approximately $175 million.

    A significant portion of costs related to the acid rain and ozone
non-attainment provisions of the Clean Air Act is expected to be recovered
through existing ratemaking provisions. However, there can be no assurance that
all Clean Air Act costs will be recovered.

    On November 3, 1999, the EPA brought a civil action against the Company in
the U.S. District Court in Atlanta, Georgia. The complaint alleges violations of
the New Source Review provisions of the Clean Air Act with respect to coal-fired
generating facilities at the Company's Plants Miller, Barry, and Gorgas. The
civil action requests penalties and injunctive relief, including an order
requiring the installation of the best available control technology at the
affected units. The EPA concurrently issued to the Company a notice of violation
relating to these specific facilities, as well as Plants Greene County and
Gaston. In early 2000 the EPA filed a motion to amend its complaint to add the
violations alleged in its notice of violation. The complaint and notice of
violation are similar to those brought against and issued to several other
electric utilities. The complaint and notice of violation allege that the
Company had failed to secure necessary permits or install additional pollution
control equipment when performing maintenance and construction at coal burning
plants constructed or under construction prior to 1978. In August 2000, the U.S.
District Court in Georgia granted the Company's motion to dismiss for lack of
jurisdiction in Georgia. On January 12, 2001, the EPA re-filed its claims
against the Company in federal district court in Birmingham, Alabama. The case
has been stayed since the spring of 2001, pending a ruling by the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in the appeal of a very similar New Source
Review enforcement action against the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). The TVA
case involves many of the same legal issues raised by the actions against the
Company. Because the outcome of the TVA case could have a significant adverse
impact on the Company, it is party to that case as well. The U.S. District Court
in Alabama has indicated that it will revisit the issue of a continued stay in
April 2002.

     The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA's
regulations and interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took
place. However, an adverse outcome in this matter could require substantial
capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and possibly require
payment of substantial penalties. The Clean Air Act authorizes civil penalties
of up to $27,500 per day per violation at each generating unit. Prior to January
30, 1997, the penalty was $25,000 per day. This could affect future results of
operations, cash flows, and possibly financial condition unless such costs can
be recovered through regulated rates.

    In December 2000, having completed its utility studies for mercury and other
hazardous air pollutants (HAPS), the EPA issued a determination that an emission
control program for mercury, and perhaps other HAPS is warranted. The program is
being developed under the Maximum Achievable Control Technology provisions of
the Clean Air Act, and the regulations are scheduled to be finalized by the end
of 2004 with implementation to take place around 2007. In January 2001, the EPA
proposed guidance for the determination of Best Available Retrofit Technology
(BART) emission controls under the Regional Haze Regulations. Installation of
BART controls is expected to take place around 2010. Litigation of the Regional


                                       II-55

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Alabama Power Company 2001 Annual Report


Haze Regulations, including the BART provisions, is ongoing in the Federal
District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals. A court decision is expected in
mid-2002.

    Implementation of the final state rules for these initiatives could require
substantial further reductions in nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide and
reductions in mercury and other HAPS emissions from fossil-fired generating
facilities and other industries in these states. Additional compliance costs and
capital expenditures resulting from the implementation of these rules and
standards cannot be determined until the results of legal challenges are known,
and the states have adopted their final rules.

   In October 1997, the EPA issued regulations setting forth requirements for
Compliance Assurance Monitoring (CAM) in its state and federal operating permit
programs. These regulations were amended by the EPA in March 2001 in response to
a court order resolving challenges to the rules brought by environmental groups
and industry. Generally, this rule affects the operation and maintenance of
electrostatic precipitators and could involve significant additional ongoing
expense.

   The EPA and state environmental regulatory agencies are reviewing and
evaluating various other matters including: control strategies to reduce
regional haze; limits on pollutant discharges to impaired waters; cooling water
intake restrictions; and hazardous waste disposal requirements. The impact of
any new standards will depend on the development and implementation of
applicable regulations.

    The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that
cover the handling and disposal of hazardous waste. Under these various laws and
regulations, the Company could incur substantial costs to clean up properties.
The Company conducts studies to determine the extent of any required cleanup and
will recognize in the financial statements costs to clean up known sites. The
Company has not incurred any significant cleanup costs to date.

   Several major pieces of environmental legislation are being considered for
reauthorization or amendment by Congress. These include: the Clean Air Act; the
Clean Water Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances
Control Act; and the Endangered Species Act. Changes to these laws could affect
many areas of the Company's operations. The full impact of any such changes
cannot be determined at this time.

   Compliance with possible additional legislation related to global climate
change, and other environmental and health concerns could significantly affect
the Company. The impact of new legislation -- if any -- will depend on the
subsequent development and implementation of applicable regulations.

Sources of Capital

The Company plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other
purposes from sources similar to those used in the past, which were primarily
from internal sources. However, the type and timing of any financings - if
needed - will depend on market conditions and regulatory approval. In recent
years financings primarily have utilized unsecured debt and trust preferred
securities.

    The Company may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company
subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper at the request and for
the benefit of the Company and the other Southern Company operating companies.
At December 31, 2001, the Company had outstanding $10 million of commercial
paper.

    As required by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and as ordered by the APSC,
the Company has established external trust funds for nuclear decommissioning
costs. In 1994 the Company also established an external trust fund for
postretirement benefits as ordered by the APSC. The cumulative effect of funding
these items over a long period will diminish internally funded capital and may
require capital from other sources. For additional information concerning
nuclear decommissioning costs, see Note 1 to the financial statements under
"Depreciation and Nuclear Decommissioning."

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Alabama Power Company 2001 Annual Report


1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
     POLICIES

General

Alabama Power Company (the Company) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern
Company, which is the parent company of five operating companies, a system
service company, Southern Communications Services (Southern LINC), Southern
Nuclear Operating Company (Southern Nuclear), Southern Power Company (Southern
Power), and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The operating companies --
Alabama Power Company, Georgia Power Company, Gulf Power Company, Mississippi
Power Company, and Savannah Electric and Power Company -- provide electric
service in four southeastern states. Contracts among the operating companies -
related to jointly-owned generating facilities, interconnecting transmission
lines, and the exchange of electric power -- are regulated by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) and/or the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC). The system service company provides, at cost, specialized services to
Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern LINC provides digital
wireless communications services to the operating companies and also markets
these services to the public within the Southeast. Southern Nuclear provides
services to Southern Company's nuclear power plants. Southern Power was
established in 2001 to construct, own, and manage Southern Company's competitive
generation assets and sell electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale
market.

    Southern Company is registered as a holding company under the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA). Both Southern Company and its subsidiaries
are subject to the regulatory provisions of the PUHCA. The Company is also
subject to regulation by the FERC and the Alabama Public Service Commission
(APSC). The Company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States and complies with the accounting policies and practices prescribed
by its respective regulatory commissions. The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ
from those estimates.

   Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been
reclassified to conform with current year presentation.

Affiliate Transactions

The Company has an agreement with the system service company under which the
following services are rendered to the Company at cost: general and design
engineering, purchasing, accounting and statistical, finance and treasury, tax,
information resources, marketing, auditing, insurance and pension
administration, human resources, systems and procedures, and other services with
respect to business and operations and power pool transactions. Costs for these
services amounted to $183 million, $187 million, and $218 million during 2001,
2000, and 1999, respectively.

   The Company also has an agreement with Southern Nuclear to operate Plant
Farley and provide the following nuclear-related services at cost: general
executive and advisory services; general operations, management and technical
services; administrative services including procurement, accounting,
statistical, and employee relations; and other services with respect to business
and operations. Costs for these services amounted to $160 million, $148 million,
and $135 million during 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.

   In 2001, the Company had under construction a 1,230 megawatt combined cycle
facility in Autaugaville, Alabama. In June 2001, the Company sold this project
to Southern Power Company, a new Southern Company affiliate formed in 2001 to
construct, own, and manage wholesale generating assets in the Southeast.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

The Company is subject to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
Regulation. Regulatory assets represent probable future revenues associated with
certain costs that are expected to be recovered from customers through the
ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions
in revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be credited to
customers through the ratemaking process.

   Regulatory assets and (liabilities) reflected in the Balance Sheets at
December 31 relate to the following:

                                             2001        2000
                                         -----------------------

Total                                      $  307      $  269
================================================================

    In the event that a portion of the Company's operations is no longer subject
to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, the Company would be required to
write off related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically
recoverable through regulated rates. In addition the Company would be required
to determine if any impairment to other assets exists, including plant, and
write down the assets, if impaired, to their fair values.

Revenues and Fuel Costs

The Company currently operates as a vertically integrated utility providing
electricity to retail customers within its traditional service area located
within the state of Alabama and to wholesale customers in the southeast.
Revenues are recognized as services are rendered. Unbilled revenues are accrued
at the end of each fiscal period. Fuel revenues have no effect on net income
because they represent the recording of revenues to offset fuel expenses,
including the fuel component of purchased energy. Fuel rates billed to customers
are designed to fully recover fluctuating fuel costs over a period of time.

    The Company has a diversified base of customers. No single customer or
industry comprises 10 percent or more of revenues. For all periods presented,
uncollectible accounts continue to average less than 1 percent of revenues.

    Fuel expense includes the amortization of the cost of nuclear fuel and a
charge based on nuclear generation for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear
fuel. Total charges for nuclear fuel included in fuel expense amounted to $58
million in 2001, $61 million in 2000, and $63 million in 1999.

    The Company has a contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) that
provides for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to
begin disposing of spent fuel in January 1998 as required by the contract, and
the Company is pursuing legal remedies against the government for breach of
contract. Sufficient fuel storage capacity is available at Plant Farley to
maintain full-core discharge capability until the refueling outage scheduled in
2006 for Farley Unit 1 and the refueling outage scheduled in 2008 for Farley
Unit 2. Procurement of on-site dry spent fuel storage capacity at Plant Farley
is in progress, with the intent to place the capacity in operation as early as
2005.

    Also, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 required the establishment of a Uranium
Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund, which is funded in part by
a special assessment on utilities with nuclear plants. This assessment is being
paid over a 15-year period, which began in 1993. This fund will be used by the
DOE for the decontamination and decommissioning of its nuclear fuel enrichment
facilities. The law provides that utilities will recover these payments in the
same manner as any other fuel expense. The Company estimates its remaining
liability under this law to be approximately $21 million at December 31, 2001.
This obligation is recognized in the accompanying Balance Sheets.

Depreciation and Nuclear Decommissioning

Depreciation of the original cost of depreciable utility plant in service is
provided primarily by using composite straight-line rates, which approximated
3.2 percent in 2001, 2000, and 1999. When property subject to depreciation is
retired or otherwise disposed of in the normal course of business, its cost --
together with the cost of removal, less salvage -- is charged to accumulated
provision for depreciation. Minor items of property included in the original
cost of the plant are retired when the related property unit is retired.
Depreciation expense includes an amount for the expected cost of decommissioning
nuclear facilities and removal of other facilities.

    The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requires all licensees operating
commercial nuclear power reactors to establish a plan for providing with
reasonable assurance funds for decommissioning. The Company has established
external trust funds to comply with the NRC's regulations. Amounts previously
recorded in internal reserves are being transferred into the external trust
funds over periods approved by the APSC. The NRC's minimum external funding
requirements are based on a generic estimate of the cost to decommission the
radioactive portions of a nuclear unit based on the size and type of reactor.


                                      II-66

NOTES (continued)
Alabama Power Company 2001 Annual Report


The Company has filed plans with the NRC to ensure that -- over time -- the
deposits and earnings of the external trust funds will provide the minimum
funding amounts prescribed by the NRC.

    Site study cost is the estimate to decommission the facility as of the site
study year, and ultimate cost is the estimate to decommission the facility as of
retirement date. The estimated costs of decommissioning -- both site study costs
and ultimate costs - based on the most current study for Plant Farley were as
follows:


  Site study basis (year)                           1998

  Decommissioning periods:
      Beginning year                                2017
      Completion year                               2031
  ------------------------------------------------------------
                                                (in millions)
  Site study costs:
      Radiated structures                           $629
      Non-radiated structures                         60
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  Total                                             $689
  ============================================================
                                                (in millions)
  Ultimate costs:
      Radiated structures                         $1,868
      Non-radiated structures                        178
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  Total                                           $2,046
  ============================================================

    The decommissioning cost estimates are based on prompt dismantlement and
removal of the plant from service. The actual decommissioning costs may vary
from the above estimates because of changes in the assumed date of
decommissioning, changes in NRC requirements, or changes in the assumptions used
in making estimates.

    Annual provisions for nuclear decommissioning are based on an annuity method
as approved by the APSC. The amount expensed in 2001 and fund balances as of
December 31, 2001 were:

                                                 (in millions)
  Amount expensed in 2001                            $ 18
  -------------------------------------------------------------

  Accumulated provisions:
      External trust funds, at fair value            $318
      Internal reserves                                36
  -------------------------------------------------------------
  Total                                              $354
  =============================================================

    All of the Company's decommissioning costs are approved for recovery by the
APSC through the ratemaking process. Significant assumptions include an
estimated inflation rate of 4.5 percent and an estimated trust earnings rate of
7.0 percent. The Company expects the APSC to periodically review and adjust, if
necessary, the amounts collected in rates for the anticipated cost of
decommissioning.

Income Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes
and provides deferred income taxes for all significant income tax temporary
differences. Investment tax credits utilized are deferred and amortized to
income over the average lives of the related property.

Allowance For Funds Used During Construction
(AFUDC)

AFUDC represents the estimated debt and equity costs of capital funds that are
necessary to finance the construction of new facilities. While cash is not
realized currently from such allowance, it increases the revenue requirement
over the service life of the plant through a higher rate base and higher
depreciation expense. The amount of AFUDC capitalized was $19 million in 2001,
$43 million in 2000, and $23 million in 1999. The composite rate used to
determine the amount of allowance was 7.7 percent in 2001, 9.6 percent in 2000,
and 8.8 percent in 1999. AFUDC, net of income tax, as a percent of net income
after dividends on preferred stock was 3.3 percent in 2001, 8.4 percent in 2000,
and 4.7 percent in 1999.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost. Original cost
includes: materials; labor; minor items of property; appropriate administrative
and general costs; payroll-related costs such as taxes, pensions, and other
benefits; and the estimated cost of funds used during construction. The cost of
maintenance, repairs and replacement of minor items of property is charged to
maintenance expense. The cost of replacements of property--exclusive of minor
items of property--is capitalized.

Financial Instruments

Effective January 2001, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended.  The impact on
net income was immaterial.

    The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices.


                                       II-67

NOTES (continued)
Alabama Power Company 2001 Annual Report


Gains and losses on qualifying hedges are deferred and recognized either in
income or as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item when the
transaction occurs.

    The Company and its affiliates, through the system service company acting as
their agent, enters into commodity related forward and option contracts to limit
exposure to changing prices on certain fuel purchases and electricity purchases
and sales. Substantially all of the Company's bulk energy purchases and sales
contracts meet the definition of a derivative under FASB Statement No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. In many cases
these fuel and electricity contracts qualify for normal purchase and sale
exceptions under Statement No. 133 and are accounted for under the accrual
method. Other contracts qualify as cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions,
resulting in the deferral of related gains and losses and are recorded in other
comprehensive income until the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness is
recognized currently in net income. Contracts that do not qualify for the normal
purchase and sale exception and that do not meet the hedge requirements are
marked to market through current period income.

    In October 2001, the APSC approved a revision to the Company's Rate ECR
(Energy Cost Recovery) allowing the recovery of specific costs associated with
the sales of natural gas that become necessary due to operating considerations
at its electric generating facilities. This revision also includes the cost of
financial tools used for hedging market price risk up to 75 percent of the
budgeted annual amount of natural gas purchases. The Company may not engage in
natural gas hedging activities that extend beyond a rolling 42-month window.

    The Company is exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the
event of counterparties' nonperformance. The Company has established controls to
determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to
mitigate the Company's exposure to counterparty credit risk.

    Other Company financial instruments for which the carrying amount did not
equal fair value at December 31 are as follows:

                                        Carrying        Fair

   At December 31, 2000                     347           344
 --------------------------------------------------------------

   The fair value for long-term debt and preferred securities was based on
either closing market prices or closing prices of comparable instruments.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are
considered cash equivalents. Temporary cash investments are securities with
original maturities of 90 days or less.

Materials and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include the cost of transmission,
distribution, and generating plant materials. Materials are charged to inventory
when purchased and then expensed or capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when
installed.

Natural Disaster Reserve

In accordance with an APSC order, the Company has established a Natural Disaster
Reserve. The Company is allowed to accrue $250 thousand per month until the
maximum accumulated provision of $32 million is attained. Higher accruals to
restore the reserve to its authorized level are allowed whenever the balance in
the reserve declines below $22.4 million. At December 31, 2001, the reserve
balance was $12 million.

2.   RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company has a defined benefit, trusteed, pension plan that covers
substantially all employees. The Company provides certain medical care and life
insurance benefits for retired employees. Substantially all employees may become
eligible for such benefits when they retire. The Company funds trusts to the
extent deductible under federal income tax regulations or to the extent required
by the APSC and the FERC. In late 2000 the Company adopted several pension and
postretirement benefit plan changes that had the effect of increasing benefits
to both current and future retirees.

Employee Savings Plan

The Company also sponsors a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering
substantially all employees. The Company provides a 75 percent matching
contribution up to 6 percent of an employee's base salary. Total matching
contributions made to the plan for the years 2001, 2000, and 1999 were $12
million, $11 million, and $10 million, respectively.

Work Force Reduction Programs

The Company has incurred costs for work force reduction programs totaling $13.0
million, $2.6 million and $5.6 million for the years 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. These costs were deferred and are being amortized in accordance
with regulatory treatment. The unamortized balance of these costs was $11.9
million at December 31, 2001.

3.  CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY
    MATTERS

General

The Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the
ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management after consultation
with legal counsel, the ultimate disposition of these matters is not expected to
have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition.

Environmental Litigation

On November 3, 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil
action in U.S. District Court in Georgia against the Company. The complaint
alleges violations of the New Source Review provisions of the Clean Air Act with
respect to coal-fired generating facilities at the Company's Plants Miller,
Barry, and Gorgas. The civil action requests penalties and injunctive relief,
including an order requiring the installation of the best available control
technology at the affected units. The Clean Air Act authorizes civil penalties
of up to $27,500 per day, per violation at each generating unit. Prior to
January 30, 1997, the penalty was $25,000 per day.

   The EPA concurrently issued to the Company a notice of violation relating to
these specific facilities, as well as Plants Greene County and Gaston. In early
2000, the EPA filed a motion to amend its complaint to add the violations
alleged in its notice of violation. The complaint and the notice of violation
are similar to those brought against and issued to several other electric
utilities. The complaint and the notice of violation allege that the Company
failed to secure necessary permits or install additional pollution control
equipment when performing maintenance and construction at coal burning plants
constructed or under construction prior to 1978. On August 1, 2000, the U.S.
District Court granted the Company's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction
in Georgia. On January 12, 2001, the EPA re-filed its claims against the Company
in federal district court in Birmingham, Alabama.

   The Company's case has been stayed since the spring of 2001, pending a ruling
by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in the appeal of a very
similar New Source Review enforcement action against the Tennessee Valley
Authority (TVA). The TVA case involves many of the same legal issues raised by
the actions against the Company. Because the outcome of the TVA case could have


                                     II-70

NOTES (continued)
Alabama Power Company 2001 Annual Report


a significant adverse impact on the Company, it is a party to that case as well.
The U.S. District Court in Alabama has indicated that it will revisit the issue
of a continued stay in April 2002.

   The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA's
regulations and interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took
place. An adverse outcome of this matter could require substantial capital
expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and possibly require payment
of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of operations, cash
flows, and possibly financial condition if such costs are not recovered through
regulated rates.

Retail Rate Adjustment Procedures

The APSC has adopted rates that provide for periodic adjustments based upon the
Company's earned return on end-of-period retail common equity. The rates also
provide for adjustments to recognize the placing of new generating facilities
into retail service under Rate CNP (Certificated New Plant). Both increases and
decreases have been placed into effect since the adoption of these rates.
Effective July 2001, the Company's retail rates were adjusted by 0.6 percent
under Rate CNP to recover costs for Plant Barry Unit 7, which was placed into
commercial operation on May 1, 2001. Most recently, a 2 percent increase in
retail rates was effective in October 2001 in accordance with the Rate
Stabilization Equalization plan. The rate adjustment procedures allow a return
on common equity range of 13.0 percent to 14.5 percent and limit increases or
decreases in rates to 4 percent in any calendar year.

    In December 1995, the APSC issued an order authorizing the Company to reduce
balance sheet items -- such as plant and deferred charges -- at any time the
Company's actual base rate revenues exceed the budgeted revenues. During the
years 2001, 2000, and 1999, the Company did not record any such reductions.

    In April 2000, the APSC approved an amendment to the Company's existing rate
structure to provide for the recovery of retail costs associated with certified
purchased power agreements. In November 2000, the APSC certified a seven-year
purchased power agreement pertaining to 615 megawatts of the wholesale
generating facilities which were sold to Southern Power in June 2001 and are
under construction in Autaugaville, Alabama. All of the 615 megawatts will be
delivered beginning in 2003. In addition the APSC certified a seven-year
purchased power agreement with a third party for approximately 630 megawatts;
one half of the power will be delivered beginning in 2003 while the remaining
half is scheduled for delivery beginning in 2004. Rate CNP will adjust retail
rates when the contracted capacity delivery begins.

    In October 2001, the APSC approved a revision to the Company's Rate ECR
(Energy Cost Recovery) allowing the recovery of specific costs associated with
the sales of natural gas that become necessary due to operating considerations
at its electric generating facilities. This revision also includes the cost of
financial tools used for hedging market price risk up to 75 percent of the
budgeted annual amount of natural gas purchases. The Company may not engage in
natural gas hedging activities that extend beyond a rolling 42-month window.

    The Company's ratemaking procedures will remain in effect until the APSC
votes to modify or discontinue them.

4.   COMMITMENTS

Construction Program

During 2001, the Company completed the replacement of the steam generators
at Plant Farley, as well as the construction of new generating capacity at Plant
Barry. Significant construction will continue related to transmission and
distribution facilities and the upgrading of generating plants, including the
expenditures necessary to comply with environmental regulation.

    The Company currently estimates property additions to be $671 million in
2002, $592 million in 2003, and $673 million in 2004.

    In connection with the transfer of the Autaugaville construction project,
the Company has assigned $71 million in vendor equipment contracts to Southern
Power. While the Company could be obligated to assume responsibility for these
contracts if Southern Power fails to meet these commitments, Southern Company
has entered into limited keep-well arrangements whereby Southern Company would
contribute funds to Southern Power either through loans or capital contributions
in order to fund performance by Southern Power as equipment purchaser under
certain contingencies. Southern Company has also guaranteed Southern Power
obligations totaling $6.6 million for the Company's construction of transmission
interconnection facilities to the plant.

    The capital budget is subject to periodic review and revision, and actual
capital costs incurred may vary from estimates because of changes in such


                                      II-71

NOTES (continued)
Alabama Power Company 2001 Annual Report


factors as: business conditions; environmental regulations; nuclear plant
regulations; load projections; the cost and efficiency of construction labor,
equipment, and materials; and the cost of capital. In addition there can be no
assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered.

Purchased Power Commitments

The Company has entered into various long-term commitments for the purchase of
electricity. Estimated total long-term obligations at December 31, 2001 were as
follows:
                                        Commitments

Fuel Commitments

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of its generating plants, the
Company has entered into various long-term commitments for the procurement of
fossil and nuclear fuel. In most cases these contracts contain provisions for
price escalations, minimum purchase levels, and other financial commitments.
Total estimated long-term obligations at December 31, 2001, were as follows:

    In addition, the system service company acts as agent for the five operating
companies and Southern Power with regard to natural gas purchases. Natural gas
purchases (in dollars) are based on various indices at the actual time of
delivery; therefore, only the volume commitments are firm. The Company's
committed volumes allocated based on usage projections, as of December 31, 2001,
are as follows:

    Additional commitments for fuel will be required in the future to supply the
Company's fuel needs.

Operating Leases

The Company has entered into rental agreements for coal rail cars, vehicles, and
other equipment with various terms and expiration dates. These expenses totaled
$27.9 million in 2001, $20.9 million in 2000, and $17.8 million in 1999. At
December 31, 2001, estimated minimum rental commitments for noncancellable
operating leases were as follows:

Total minimum payments                            $ 154.0
==============================================================

     In addition to the rental commitments above, the Company has potential
obligations upon expiration of certain leases with respect to the residual value
of the leased property. These leases expire in 2004 and 2006, and the Company's
maximum obligations are $25.7 million and $66.0 million, respectively. At the
termination of the leases, at the Company's option, the Company may negotiate
an extension, exercise its purchase option, or the property can be sold to a
third party. The Company expects that the fair market value of the leased
property would substantially reduce or eliminate the Company's payments under
the residual value obligation.

5.   JOINT OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS

The Company and Georgia Power own equally all of the outstanding capital stock
of Southern Electric Generating Company (SEGCO), which owns electric generating
units with a total rated capacity of 1,020 megawatts, together with associated


                                     II-72

NOTES (continued)
Alabama Power Company 2001 Annual Report


transmission facilities. The capacity of these units is sold equally to the
Company and Georgia Power under a contract which, in substance, requires
payments sufficient to provide for the operating expenses, taxes, interest
expense and a return on equity, whether or not SEGCO has any capacity and energy
available. The term of the contract extends automatically for two-year periods,
subject to either party's right to cancel upon two year's notice. The Company's
share of expenses totaled $80 million in 2001, $85 million in 2000, and $92
million in 1999 and is included in "Purchased power from affiliates" in the
Statements of Income.

    In addition the Company has guaranteed unconditionally the obligation of
SEGCO under an installment sale agreement for the purchase of certain pollution
control facilities at SEGCO's generating units, pursuant to which $24.5 million
principal amount of pollution control revenue bonds are outstanding. Georgia
Power has agreed to reimburse the Company for the pro rata portion of such
obligation corresponding to its then proportionate ownership of stock of SEGCO
if the Company is called upon to make such payment under its guaranty.

    At December 31, 2001, the capitalization of SEGCO consisted of $58 million
of equity and $86 million of long-term debt on which the annual interest
requirement is $2.2 million. SEGCO paid dividends totaling $0.7 million in 2001,
$5.1 million in 2000, and $4.3 million in 1999 of which one-half of each was
paid to the Company. SEGCO's net income was $7.5 million, $5.9 million, and $5.4
million for 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.

    The Company's percentage ownership and investment in jointly-owned
generating plants at December 31, 2001, is as follows:

6.   LONG-TERM POWER SALES AGREEMENTS

General

The Company and the other operating companies of Southern Company have entered
into long-term contractual agreements for the sale and lease of capacity and
energy to certain non-affiliated utilities located outside the system's service
area. These agreements -- expiring at various dates discussed below -- are firm
and related to specific generating units. Because the energy is generally
provided at cost under these agreements, profitability is primarily affected by
capacity revenues.

    Unit power from Plant Miller is being sold to Florida Power Corporation
(FPC), Florida Power & Light Company (FP&L), and Jacksonville Electric Authority
(JEA). Under these agreements approximately 1,237 megawatts of capacity are
scheduled to be sold through 2010. The Company's capacity revenues amounted to
$125 million in 2001, $127 million in 2000, and $122 million in 1999.

Alabama Municipal Electric Authority (AMEA)
Capacity Contracts

In 1986 the Company entered into a firm power sales contract with AMEA entitling
AMEA to scheduled amounts of capacity (to a maximum 100 megawatts) for a period
of 15 years (1986 Contract). In October 1991 the Company entered into a second
firm power sales contract with AMEA entitling AMEA to scheduled amounts of
additional capacity (to a maximum 80 megawatts) for a period of 15 years (1991
Contract). Under the terms of the contracts, the Company received payments from
AMEA representing the net present value of the revenues associated with the
respective capacity entitlements, discounted at effective annual rates of 9.96
percent and 11.19 percent for the 1986 and 1991 contracts, respectively. The
1986 contract expired in July 2001, however, the payments for the 1991 contract
will continue to be recognized as operating revenues and the discounts will be
amortized to other interest expense as scheduled capacity is made available over
the terms of the contract.

     To secure AMEA's advance payments and the Company's performance obligation
under the contracts, the Company issued and delivered to an escrow agent first
mortgage bonds representing the maximum amount of liquidated damages payable by
the Company in the event of a default under the contracts. No principal or
interest is payable on such bonds unless and until a default by the Company


                                     II-73

NOTES (continued)
Alabama Power Company 2001 Annual Report


occurs. As the liquidated damages decline, a portion of the bond equal to the
decrease is returned to the Company. At December 31, 2001, $38.1 million of the
1991 bond was held by the escrow agent under the contract.

7.   INCOME TAXES

At December 31, 2001, the tax-related regulatory assets and liabilities were
$335 million and $203 million, respectively. These assets are attributable to
tax benefits flowed through to customers in prior years and to taxes applicable
to capitalized interest. These liabilities are attributable to deferred taxes
previously recognized at rates higher than current enacted tax law and to
unamortized investment tax credits.

    Details of the income tax provisions are as follows:

                                     2001       2000       1999

    The tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities in the financial statements and their respective tax
bases, which give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities, are as follows:

    Deferred investment tax credits are amortized over the lives of the related
property with such amortization normally applied as a credit to reduce
depreciation in the Statements of Income. Credits amortized in this manner
amounted to $11 million in 2001, 2000, and 1999. At December 31, 2001, all
investment tax credits available to reduce federal income taxes payable had been
utilized.

    A reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to the effective
income tax rate is as follows:

8.   CAPITALIZATION

Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities

Statutory business trusts formed by the Company, of which the Company owns all
the common securities, have issued mandatorily redeemable preferred securities
as follows:

              Date of                                 Maturity
               Issue    Amount      Rate     Notes      Date

Trust I       1/1996    $ 97      7.375%      $100       3/2026
Trust II      1/1997     200      7.60         206      12/2036
Trust III     2/1999      50      Auction       52       2/2029

    Substantially all of the assets of each trust are junior subordinated notes
issued by the Company in the respective approximate principal amounts set forth
above. The distribution rate of Trust III's auction rate securities was 3.60% at
January 1, 2002.

    The Company considers that the mechanisms and obligations relating to the
preferred securities, taken together, constitute a full and unconditional
guarantee by the Company of the Trusts' payment obligations with respect to the
preferred securities.

    The Trusts are subsidiaries of the Company and accordingly are consolidated
in the Company's financial statements.

Pollution Control Bonds

Pollution control obligations represent installment purchases of pollution
control facilities financed by funds derived from sales by public authorities of
revenue bonds. The Company is required to make payments sufficient for the
authorities to meet principal and interest requirements of such bonds. With
respect to $114.2 million of such pollution control obligations, the Company has
authenticated and delivered to the trustees a like principal amount of first
mortgage bonds as security for its obligations under the installment purchase
agreements. No principal or interest on these first mortgage bonds is payable
unless and until a default occurs on the installment purchase agreements.

   In 2001, the Company sold, through a public authority, $20 million of
pollution control bonds, the proceeds of which were used to pay certain costs
incurred in connection with the acquisition, construction, installation, and
equipping of certain local district heating facilities and sewage and solid
waste facilities at two of the Company's generation facilities.

Senior Notes

In August 2001 the Company issued $442 million of unsecured senior notes, the
proceeds of which were used to redeem the $131.5 million outstanding principal
of its First Mortgage Bonds, 9% Series due December 1, 2004 and for other
corporate purposes including the repayment of a portion of its short-term
indebtedness. All of the Company's senior notes are, in effect, subordinate to
all secured debt of the Company, including its first mortgage bonds.

Capitalized Leases

The estimated aggregate annual maturities of capitalized lease obligations
through 2006 are as follows: $0.9 million in 2002, $0.9 million in 2003, $1.0
million in 2004, $0.4 million in 2005, and $0.1 million in 2006.

Securities Due Within One Year

A summary of the improvement fund requirements and scheduled maturities and
redemptions of long-term debt due within one year at December 31 is as follows:

    The annual first mortgage bond improvement fund requirement is 1 percent of
the aggregate principal amount of bonds of each series authenticated, so long as
a portion of that series is outstanding, and may be satisfied by the deposit of
cash and/or reacquired bonds, the certification of unfunded property additions,
or a combination thereof.

Bank Credit Arrangements

The Company maintains committed lines of credit in the amount of $964 million
(including $454 million of such lines which are dedicated to funding purchase
obligations relating to variable rate pollution control bonds). Of these lines,
$574 million expire at various times during 2002 and $390 million expire in

2004. In certain cases, such lines require payment of a commitment fee based on
the unused portion of the commitment or the maintenance of compensating balances
with the banks. Because the arrangements are based on an average balance, the
Company does not consider any of its cash balances to be restricted as of any
specific date. Moreover, the Company borrows from time to time pursuant to
arrangements with banks for uncommitted lines of credit. The amount of
commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2001 was $10 million.

    At December 31, 2001, the Company had regulatory approval to have
outstanding up to $1 billion of short-term borrowings.

Assets Subject to Lien

The Company's mortgage, as amended and supplemented, securing the first mortgage
bonds issued by the Company, constitutes a direct lien on substantially all of
the Company's fixed property and franchises.

Dividend Restrictions

The Company's first mortgage bond indenture contains various common stock
dividend restrictions that remain in effect as long as the bonds are
outstanding. At December 31, 2001, retained earnings of $796 million were
restricted against the payment of cash dividends on common stock under terms of
the mortgage indenture.

9.    NUCLEAR INSURANCE

Under the Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 1988 (the Act), the Company maintains
agreements of indemnity with the NRC that, together with private insurance,
cover third-party liability arising from any nuclear incident occurring at Plant
Farley. The Act provides funds up to $9.5 billion for public liability claims
that could arise from a single nuclear incident. Plant Farley is insured against
this liability to a maximum of $200 million by American Nuclear Insurers (ANI),
with the remaining coverage provided by a mandatory program of deferred premiums
which could be assessed, after a nuclear incident, against all owners of nuclear
reactors. The Company could be assessed up to $88 million per incident for each
licensed reactor it operates but not more than an aggregate of $10 million per
incident to be paid in a calendar year for each reactor. Such maximum
assessment, excluding any applicable state premium taxes, for the Company is
$176 million per incident but not more than an aggregate of $20 million to be
paid for each incident in any one year.

    The Company is a member of Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), a
mutual insurer established to provide property damage insurance in an amount up
to $500 million for members' nuclear generating facilities.

    Additionally, the Company has policies that currently provide
decontamination, excess property insurance, and premature decommissioning
coverage up to $2.25 billion for losses in excess of the $500 million primary
coverage. This excess insurance is also provided by NEIL.

    NEIL also covers the additional cost that would be incurred in obtaining
replacement power during a prolonged accidental outage at a member's nuclear
plant. Members can purchase this coverage, subject to a deductible waiting
period of between 8 to 26 weeks, with a maximum per occurrence per unit limit of
$490 million. After this deductible period, weekly indemnity payments would be
received until either the unit is operational or until the limit is exhausted in
approximately three years.

    Under each of the NEIL policies, members are subject to assessments if
losses each year exceed the accumulated funds available to the insurer under
that policy. The current maximum annual assessments for the Company under the
three NEIL policies would be $35 million.

    Following the terrorist attacks of September 2001, both ANI and NEIL
confirmed that terrorist acts against commercial nuclear power stations would be
covered under their insurance. However, both companies revised their policy
terms on a prospective basis to include an industry aggregate for all terrorist
acts. The NEIL aggregate, which applies to all claims stemming from terrorism
within a 12 month duration, is $3.24 billion plus any amounts that would be
available through reinsurance or indemnity from an outside source. The ANI cap
is $200 million in a policy year.

    For all on-site property damage insurance policies for commercial nuclear
power plants, the NRC requires that the proceeds of such policies shall be
dedicated first for the sole purpose of placing the reactor in a safe and stable
condition after an accident. Any remaining proceeds are to be applied next
toward the costs of decontamination and debris removal operations ordered by the
NRC, and any further remaining proceeds are to be paid either to the Company or
to its bond trustees as may be appropriate under the policies and applicable
trust indentures.

    All retrospective assessments, whether generated for liability, property or
replacement power may be subject to applicable state premium taxes.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT
Georgia Power Company 2001 Annual Report


The management of Georgia Power Company has prepared this annual report and is
responsible for the financial statements and related information. These
statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States and necessarily include amounts that are based on
the best estimates and judgments of management. Financial information throughout
this annual report is consistent with the financial statements.

     The Company maintains a system of internal accounting controls to provide
reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that the accounting records
reflect only authorized transactions of the Company. Limitations exist in any
system of internal controls based upon the recognition that the cost of the
system should not exceed its benefits. The Company believes that its system of
internal accounting controls maintains an appropriate cost/benefit relationship.

     The Company's system of internal accounting controls is evaluated on an
ongoing basis by the Company's internal audit staff. The Company's independent
public accountants also consider certain elements of the internal control system
in order to determine their auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the financial statements.

     The audit committee of the board of directors, which is composed of three
independent directors, provides a broad overview of management's financial
reporting and control functions. At least three times a year this committee
meets with management, the internal auditors, and the independent public
accountants to ensure that these groups are fulfilling their obligations and to
discuss auditing, internal control and financial reporting matters. The internal
auditors and the independent public accountants have access to the members of
the audit committee at any time.

     Management believes that its policies and procedures provide reasonable
assurance that the Company's operations are conducted with a high standard of
business ethics.

     In management's opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows
of Georgia Power Company in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


To Georgia Power Company:


We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements of capitalization
of Georgia Power Company (a Georgia corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Southern Company) as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related statements
of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder's equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

      In our opinion, the financial statements (pages II-93 through II-113)
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Georgia Power Company as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.

      As explained in Note 1 to the financial statements, effective January 1,
2001, Georgia Power Company changed its method of accounting for derivative
instruments and hedging activities.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION
Georgia Power Company 2001 Annual Report


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

Georgia Power Company's 2001 earnings totaled $610 million, representing a $51
million (9.1 percent) increase over 2000. Although operating income is lower due
to the impact of mild weather on retail revenues, overall net income improved
due to lower financing costs and non-operating expenses and a lower effective
tax rate resulting from various factors including property donations and
positive resolution of outstanding tax issues. The Company's 2000 earnings
totaled $559 million, representing an $18 million (3.3 percent) increase over
1999. This earnings increase was primarily due to higher retail and wholesale
sales and continued control of operating expenses, partially offset by
additional accelerated amortization of regulatory assets allowed under the
second year of a Georgia Public Service Commission (GPSC) three-year retail rate
order.

Revenues

Operating revenues in 2001 and the amount of change from the prior year are as
follows:

                                                Increase

===================================================================
Percent change                                   2.0%         9.3%
- -------------------------------------------------------------------

     Retail base revenues of $3.1 billion in 2001 decreased $17 million (0.5
percent) from 2000 primarily due to a 2.5 percent decrease in retail sales from
the prior year. Milder-than-normal weather and a slowdown in the economy
contributed to the decline in such sales. Retail base revenues of $3.1 billion
in 2000 increased $84 million (2.8 percent) from 1999 primarily due to a 4.9
percent increase in sales. Under the prior GPSC retail rate order, the Company
recorded $44 million of revenue subject to refund for estimated earnings above
12.5 percent retail return on common equity in 2000. These refunds were made to
customers in 2001. See Note 3 to the financial statements under "Retail Rate
Orders" for additional information.

     Electric rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in
fuel costs, the energy component of purchased power costs, and certain other
costs. Under these fuel cost recovery provisions, fuel revenues generally equal
fuel expenses -- including the fuel component of purchased energy -- and do not
affect net income. However, cash flow is affected by the untimely recovery of
these receivables. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had $162 million in
underrecovered fuel costs. The Company is currently collecting these
underrecovered fuel costs under a GPSC rate order issued on May 24, 2001. The
fuel cost recovery rate was increased effective June 2001 to allow for a
24-month recovery of the deferred underrecovered fuel costs.

     Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliated utilities increased in 2001
and 2000 as follows:

                                  2001       2000      1999
                                -----------------------------

Long-term contracts               $ 61       $ 55      $ 55
Other sales                        305        243       155
- -------------------------------------------------------------
Total                             $366       $298      $210
=============================================================

     Revenues from long-term contracts increased slightly in 2001 due to
increased energy sales while remaining constant in 2000. See Note 7 to the
financial statements for further information regarding these sales. Revenues
from other non-affiliated sales increased $62 million (25.5 percent) primarily
due to increases in off-system sale transactions that were generally offset by
corresponding purchase transactions. These transactions had no significant
effect on income.

     Revenues from sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric
system, as well as purchases of energy, will vary from year to year depending on
demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company.
These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Other operating revenues in 2001 decreased $9 million (5.3 percent)
primarily due to lower gains on the sale of generating plant emission
allowances, partially offset by increased revenues from the transmission of
electricity and from the rental of electric equipment and property. Other

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Georgia Power Company 2001 Annual Report


operating revenues in 2000 increased $39 million (33 percent) primarily due to
increased revenues from the transmission of electricity and gains on the sale of
generating plant emission allowances. Under a GPSC order, $28 million of the
gains on emission allowance sales in 2000 were used to reduce recoverable fuel
costs and, as such, did not affect earnings.

     Kilowatt-hour (KWH) sales for 2001 and the percent change by year were as
follows:
                                         Percent Change

- ------------------------------------------------------------

     Residential sales decreased 2.8 percent due to milder-than-normal weather.
Commercial sales increased 3.4 percent due to a 2.8 percent increase in
customers, while industrial sales decreased 8.0 percent due to an economic
slowdown. Residential and commercial sales increased 6.6 percent and 8.1
percent, respectively, in 2000 due to warmer summer temperatures and colder
winter weather. Strong regional economic growth was also a factor in the
increase in commercial sales. Industrial sales remained fairly constant.

Expenses

Fuel costs constitute the single largest expense for the Company. The mix of
fuel sources for generation of electricity is determined primarily by system
load, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the availability of hydro and nuclear
generating units. The amount and sources of generation and the average cost of
fuel per net KWH generated were as follows:

                                      2001      2000     1999

     (cents) --                       1.38      1.39     1.34
- --------------------------------------------------------------

     Fuel expense decreased 7.7 percent due to a decrease in generation because
of lower energy demands and a slightly lower average cost of fuel. Fuel expense
increased 10.7 percent in 2000 due to an increase in generation to meet higher
energy demands, a decrease in generation from hydro plants, and a higher average
cost of fuel.

     Purchased power expense increased $175 million (29.4 percent) in 2001
primarily due to an increase in off-system purchases used to meet off-system
sales commitments. These transactions had no significant effect on earnings.
Purchased power expense in 2000 increased $206 million (53 percent) over the
prior year due to higher retail energy demands and off-system purchase
transactions used to meet off-system sales transactions.

     In 2001, other operation and maintenance expenses increased $41 million
(3.4%) due to additional severance costs, increased scheduled generating plant
maintenance, and higher uncollectible account expense. Other operation and
maintenance expenses in 2000 increased slightly over those in 1999. Increased
line maintenance, customer assistance and sales expense, and severance costs
were partially offset by decreased generating plant maintenance and decreased
employee benefit provisions.

     Depreciation and amortization decreased $19 million in 2001 primarily due
to lower accelerated amortization under the third year of a GPSC retail rate
order. Depreciation and amortization increased $66 million in 2000 primarily due
to $50 million of additional accelerated amortization of regulatory assets
required under the second year of the GPSC retail rate order and increased plant
in service.

     Other, net increased in 2001 due to gains realized on sales of assets and a
decrease in charitable contributions. Other, net decreased in 2000 due to an
increase in charitable contributions.

     Interest expense, net decreased in 2001 primarily due to lower interest
rates that offset new financing costs. Interest expense, net increased in 2000
due to the issuance of additional senior notes during 2000. The Company
refinanced or retired $775 million and $179 million of securities in 2001 and
2000, respectively. Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary
companies remained unchanged in 2001 and decreased $7 million in 2000 due to the
redemption of $100 million of preferred securities in December 1999.

Effects of Inflation

The Company is subject to rate regulation and income tax laws that are based on
the recovery of historical costs. Therefore, inflation creates an economic loss
because the Company is recovering its costs of investments in dollars that have
less purchasing power. While the inflation rate has been relatively low in
recent years, it continues to have an adverse effect on the Company because of
the large investment in utility plants with long economic lives. Conventional
accounting for historical cost does not recognize this economic loss nor the
partially offsetting gain that arises through financing facilities with
fixed-money obligations such as long-term debt and preferred securities. Any
recognition of inflation by regulatory authorities is reflected in the rate of
return allowed.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL

General

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily
indicative of future earnings. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including regulatory matters and energy sales.

     Growth in energy sales is subject to a number of factors which
traditionally have included changes in contracts with neighboring utilities,
energy conservation practiced by customers, the elasticity of demand, weather,
competition, initiatives to increase sales to existing customers, and the rate
of economic growth in the Company's service area.

     In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement
No. 87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions, the Company recorded non-cash income
of approximately $60 million in 2001. Future pension income is dependent on
several factors including trust earnings and changes to the plan. For the
Company, pension income is a component of the regulated rates and does not have
a significant effect on net income. For additional information, see Note 2 to
the financial statements.

     The Company currently operates as a vertically integrated utility providing
electricity to customers within its traditional service area located in the
State of Georgia. Prices for electricity provided by the Company to retail
customers are set by the GPSC under cost-based regulatory principles.

     On December 20, 2001, the GPSC approved a new three-year retail rate order
for the Company ending December 31, 2004. Under the terms of the order, earnings
will be evaluated annually against a retail return on common equity range of 10
percent to 12.95 percent. Two-thirds of any earnings above the 12.95 percent
return will be applied to rate refunds, with the remaining one-third retained by
the Company. Retail rates were decreased by $118 million effective January 1,
2002. Pursuant to a previous three-year accounting order, the Company recorded
$336 million of accelerated cost amortization and interest thereon which has
been credited to a regulatory liability account as mandated by the GPSC. Under
the new rate order, the accelerated amortization and the interest will be
amortized equally over three years as a credit to expense beginning in 2002. The
Company will not file for a general base rate increase unless its projected
retail return on common equity falls below 10 percent. Georgia Power is required
to file a general rate case on July 1, 2004, in response to which the GPSC would
be expected to determine whether the rate order should be continued, modified,
or discontinued. See Note 3 to the financial statements under "Retail Rate
Orders" for additional information.

     The Company has entered into power purchase agreements which will result in
higher capacity and operating and maintenance payments in future years. Under
the new retail rate order, these costs will be reflected in rates evenly over
the next three years. See Note 4 to the financial statements under "Purchased
Power Commitments" for additional information.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Georgia Power Company 2001 Annual Report


    Georgia Power had three new generation projects under construction during
2001. They included two units at Plant Dahlberg, a ten-unit, 800 megawatt
combustion turbine facility; two combined cycle units totaling 1,132 megawatts
at Plant Wansley; and Plant Goat Rock, a two-unit, 1,181 megawatt combined cycle
facility. All three of these projects have been transferred to Southern Power
Company, a new Southern Company subsidiary formed in 2001 to construct, own, and
manage wholesale generating assets in the Southeast. The ten Dahlberg units and
two Goat Rock units were transferred in 2001 and the transfer of the two Wansley
units was completed in January 2002.

     The Company is involved in various matters being litigated. See Note 3 to
the financial statements for information regarding material issues that could
possibly affect future earnings.

     Compliance costs related to current and future environmental laws,
regulations, and litigation could affect earnings if such costs are not fully
recovered. See "Environmental Issues" for further discussion of these matters.

Industry Restructuring

The electric utility industry in the United States is continuing to evolve as a
result of regulatory and competitive factors. Among the primary agents of change
has been the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Energy Act). The Energy Act allows
independent power producers (IPPs) to access a utility's transmission network in
order to sell electricity to other utilities. This enhances the incentive for
IPPs to build cogeneration plants for a utility's large industrial and
commercial customers and sell energy generation to other utilities. Also,
electricity sales for resale rates are affected by wholesale transmission access
and numerous potential new energy suppliers, including power marketers and
brokers.

     Although the Energy Act does not permit retail customer access, it has been
a major catalyst for recent restructuring and consolidations taking place within
the utility industry. Numerous federal and state initiatives are in varying
stages that promote wholesale and retail competition. Among other things, these
initiatives allow customers to choose their electricity provider. Some states
have approved initiatives that result in a separation of the ownership and/or
operation of generating facilities from the ownership and/or operation of
transmission and distribution facilities. While restructuring and competition
initiatives have been discussed in Georgia, none have been enacted. Enactment
would require numerous issues to be resolved, including significant ones
relating to recovery of any stranded investments, full cost recovery of energy
produced, and other issues related to the energy crisis that occurred in
California. As a result of that crisis, many states have either discontinued or
delayed implementation of initiatives involving retail deregulation. The Company
does compete with other electric suppliers within the state. In Georgia, most
new retail customers with at least 900 kilowatts of connected load may choose
their electricity supplier.

     In December 1999, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued
its final rule on Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs). The order
encouraged utilities owning transmission systems to form RTOs on a voluntary
basis. Southern Company has submitted a series of status reports informing the
FERC of progress toward the development of a Southeastern RTO. In these status
reports, Southern Company explained that it is developing an RTO known as
SeTrans with a number of non-jurisdictional cooperative and public power
entities. Recently, Entergy Corporation and Cleco Power joined the SeTrans
development process. In January 2002, the sponsors of SeTrans held a public
meeting to form a Stakeholder Advisory Committee, which will participate in the
development of the RTO. Southern Company continues to work with the other
sponsors to develop the SeTrans RTO. The creation of SeTrans is not expected to
have a material impact on Georgia Power's financial statements. The outcome of
this matter cannot now be determined.

Accounting Policies

Critical Policy

Georgia Power's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements. The Company's most critical accounting policy involves
rate regulation. The Company is subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No.
71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. In the event that
a portion of the Company's operations is no longer subject to these provisions,
the Company would be required to write off related regulatory assets and
liabilities that are not specifically recoverable, and determine if any other
assets, including plant, have been impaired. See Note 1 to the financial
statements under "Regulatory Assets and Liabilities" for additional information.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Georgia Power Company 2001 Annual Report


New Accounting Standards

Effective January 2001, Georgia Power adopted FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. Statement No. 133
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and
for hedging activities. This statement requires that certain derivative
instruments be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability
measured at fair value, and that changes in the fair value be recognized
currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. See
Note 1 to the financial statements under "Financial Instruments" for additional
information. The impact on net income in 2001 was not material. An additional
interpretation of Statement No. 133 will result in a change -- effective April
1, 2002 -- in accounting for certain contracts related to fuel supplies that
contain quantity options. These contracts will be accounted for as derivatives
and marked to market. However, due to the existence of specific cost-based fuel
recovery clauses for the Company, this change is not expected to have a material
impact on net income.

    In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for
acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 17. Statement No. 142 addresses how intangible
assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets (but not
those acquired in a business combination) should be accounted for upon
acquisition and on an ongoing basis. Goodwill and intangible assets that have
indefinite useful lives will not be amortized but rather will be tested at least
annually for impairment. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives will
continue to be amortized over their useful lives, which are no longer limited to
40 years. The Company adopted Statement No. 142 effective January 1, 2002 with
no material impact on the Company's financial statements.

   Also, in June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143, Asset Retirement
Obligations, which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal
obligations associated with retiring assets, including decommissioning nuclear
plants. The liability for an asset's future retirement must be recorded in the
period in which the liability is incurred. The cost must be capitalized as part
of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life.
Changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time will be recognized
as operating expenses. Statement No. 143 must be adopted by January 1, 2003. The
Company has not yet quantified the impact of adopting Statement No. 143 on its
financial statements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Plant Additions

In 2001, gross utility plant additions were $1.4 billion. These additions were
primarily related to transmission and distribution facilities, the purchase of
nuclear fuel, and the construction of additional combustion turbine and combined
cycle units. The funds needed for gross property additions are currently
provided from operations, short-term and long-term debt, and capital
contributions from Southern Company. The Statements of Cash Flows provide
additional details.

Credit Rating Risk

The Company does not have any credit agreements that would require material
changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating
downgrade. There are certain physical electricity sale contracts that could
require collateral -- but not termination -- in the event of a credit rating
change to below investment grade. At December 31, 2001, the maximum potential
collateral requirements were approximately $112 million.

Exposure to Market Risks

The Company is exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates,
currency exchange rates, and certain commodity prices. To manage the volatility
attributable to these exposures, the Company nets the exposures to take
advantage of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for
the remaining exposures pursuant to the Company's policies in areas such as
counterparty exposure and hedging practices. Company policy is that derivatives
are to be used primarily for hedging purposes. Derivative positions are
monitored using techniques that include market valuation and sensitivity
analysis.

     The Company's market risk exposures relative to interest rate changes have
not changed materially compared to the previous reporting period. In addition,
the Company is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly
affect such exposures in the near term.

                                       II-87

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Georgia Power Company 2001 Annual Report


     If the Company sustained a 100 basis point change in interest rates for all
variable rate long-term debt, the change would affect annualized interest
expense by approximately $13 million at December 31, 2001. Based on the
Company's overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2001, including
derivative and other interest rate sensitive instruments, a near-term 100 basis
point change in interest rates would not materially affect the Company's
financial statements.

     Due to cost-based rate regulations, the Company has limited exposure to
market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of
electricity. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity
prices, the Company entered into fixed price contracts for the purchase and sale
of electricity through the wholesale electricity market and to a lesser extent
similar contracts for gas purchases. Realized gains and losses are recognized in
the Statements of Income as incurred. At December 31, 2001, exposure from these
activities was not material to the Company's financial statements. Fair value of
changes in energy trading contracts and year-end valuations are as follows:

                             Changes During the Year
- ----------------------------------------------------
                                     Fair Value

- ----------------------------------------------------
Contracts end of year                   $0.4
===================================================

    All of these contracts are actively quoted and mature within one year. For
additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements under "Financial
Instruments."

Financing Activities

In 2001, the Company's financing costs decreased due to lower interest rates
despite the issuance of new debt during the year. New issues during 1999 through
2001 totaled $1.9 billion and retirement or repayment of higher-cost securities
totaled $1.7 billion.

     The proceeds from assets transferred to Southern Power were used to reduce
short-term debt and return capital to the Southern Company that was used during
the construction of these projects.

     Composite financing rates for long-term debt, preferred stock, and
preferred securities for the years 1999 through 2001, as of year-end, were as
follows:
                                   2001        2000       1999
                                --------------------------------
Composite interest rate

Composite preferred
   securities dividend rate        7.49        7.49       7.49
- ----------------------------------------------------------------

Liquidity and Capital Requirements

Cash provided from operations remained constant in 2001.

     The Company estimates that construction expenditures for the years 2002
through 2004 will total $1.0 billion, $0.8 billion, and $0.8 billion,
respectively. Investments primarily in additional transmission and distribution
facilities and equipment to comply with environmental requirements are planned.

     Cash requirements for redemptions announced and maturities of long-term
debt are expected to total $666 million during 2002 through 2004.

     As a result of requirements by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the
Company has established external trust funds for the purpose of funding nuclear
decommissioning costs. The amount to be funded under the new GPSC rate order is
$8.7 million each year in 2002, 2003, and 2004. For additional information
concerning nuclear decommissioning costs, see Note 1 to the financial statements
under "Depreciation and Nuclear Decommissioning."

Sources of Capital

The Company expects to meet future capital requirements primarily using funds
generated from operations and equity funds from Southern Company and by the
issuance of new debt and equity securities, term loans, and short-term
borrowings. The Company plans to request new financing authority from the GPSC
in early 2002 to allow for the issuance of new long-term securities. To meet
short-term cash needs and contingencies, the Company had approximately $1.8
billion of unused credit arrangements with banks at the beginning of 2002. See
Note 9 to the financial statements under "Bank Credit Arrangements" for
additional information.

                                     II-88

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Georgia Power Company 2001 Annual Report


     The Company may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company
subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper at the request and for
the benefit of the Company and the other Southern Company operating companies.
At December 31, 2001, the Company had outstanding $707.6 million of commercial
paper.

     Recently, the Company has relied on the issuance of unsecured debt and
trust preferred securities, in addition to unsecured pollution control bonds
issued for its benefit by public authorities, to meet its long-term external
financing requirements. In years past, the Company issued first mortgage bonds,
mortgage backed pollution control bonds and preferred stock to fund its external
requirements. The amount outstanding of these securities has been steadily
declining during the last four years.

Other Capital Requirements

In addition to the funds needed for the construction program, approximately $666
million will be required by the end of 2004 for maturities of long-term debt.
Also, the Company will continue to retire higher-cost debt and preferred
securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market
conditions permit.

   These capital requirements, lease obligations, and purchase commitments --
discussed in Notes 4 and 9 to the financial statements -- are as follows:

                                    2002      2003      2004

ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES

Clean Air Legislation

In November 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (Clean Air Act) were
signed into law. Title IV of the Clean Air Act -- the acid rain compliance
provision of the law -- significantly affected Southern Company's subsidiaries,
including the Company. Reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions
from fossil-fired generating plants were required in two phases. Phase I
compliance began in 1995.

     Southern Company's subsidiaries, including the Company, achieved Phase I
compliance at the affected units by primarily switching to low-sulfur coal and
with some equipment upgrades. Construction expenditures for the Company's Phase
I compliance totaled approximately $167 million.

     Phase II sulfur dioxide compliance was required in 2000. Southern Company's
subsidiaries, including the Company, used emission allowances and fuel switching
to comply with Phase II requirements. Also, equipment to control nitrogen oxide
emissions was installed on additional system fossil-fired units as necessary to
meet Phase II limits and ozone non-attainment requirements for metropolitan
Atlanta through 2000. Compliance for Phase II and initial ozone non-attainment
requirements increased total construction expenditures for the Company through
2000 by approximately $39 million.

     In 2000, the State of Georgia established new emission limits designed to
help bring the Atlanta area into compliance with the national one-hour standard
for ground-level ozone. The limits include new emission standards for seven of
the Company's generating stations and will go into effect in May 2003.
Construction expenditures for the Company's compliance with these new rules are
currently estimated at approximately $699 million with a total of $345 million
remaining to be spent.

                                     II-89

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Georgia Power Company 2001 Annual Report


     A significant portion of costs related to the acid rain and ozone
non-attainment provisions of the Clean Air Act is expected to be recovered
through existing ratemaking provisions. However, there can be no assurance that
all Clean Air Act costs will be recovered.

     In July 1997, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) revised the
national ambient air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter. This
revision made the standards significantly more stringent. In the subsequent
litigation of these standards, the U.S. Supreme Court found the EPA's
implementation program for the new ozone standard unlawful and remanded it to
the EPA. In addition, the Federal District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals
is considering other legal challenges to these standards. If the standards are
eventually upheld, implementation could be required by 2007 to 2010.

     In September 1998, the EPA issued regional nitrogen oxide reduction rules
to the states for implementation. The final rule affects 21 states including
Georgia. Compliance is required by May 31, 2004. The EPA proposed rules for
Georgia on February 13, 2002. The EPA's proposal includes a May 1, 2005
implementation date for Georgia. The Company plans to demonstrate compliance
based largely on NOx controls already installed to meet the Atlanta
non-attainment requirements, coupled with the purchase of NOx credits within a
NOx trading market.

     In December 2000, having completed its utility study for mercury and other
hazardous air pollutants (HAPS), the EPA issued a determination that an emission
control program for mercury and, perhaps, other HAPS is warranted. The program
is to be developed under the Maximum Achievable Control Technology provisions of
the Clean Air Act, and regulations are scheduled to be finalized by the end of
2004 with implementation to take place around 2007. In January 2001, the EPA
proposed guidance for the determination of Best Available Retrofit Technology
(BART) emission controls under the Regional Haze Regulations. Installation of
BART controls is expected to take place around 2010. Litigation of the Regional
Haze Regulations, including the BART provisions, is ongoing in the Federal
District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals. A court decision is expected in
mid-2002.

     Implementation of the final state rules for these initiatives could require
substantial further reductions in nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide and
reductions in mercury and other HAPS emissions from fossil-fired generating
facilities and other industries in these states. Additional compliance costs and
capital expenditures resulting from the implementation of these rules and
standards cannot be determined until the results of legal challenges are known,
and the states have adopted their final rules.

     In October 1997, the EPA issued regulations setting forth requirements for
Compliance Assurance Monitoring (CAM) in state and federal operating permit
programs. These regulations were amended by the EPA in March 2001 in response to
a court order resolving challenges to the rules brought by environmental groups
and industry. Generally, this rule affects the operation and maintenance of
electrostatic precipitators and could involve significant additional ongoing
expense.

     The EPA and state environmental regulatory agencies are reviewing and
evaluating various matters including: control strategies to reduce regional
haze; limits on pollutant discharges to impaired waters; cooling water intake
restrictions; and hazardous waste disposal requirements. The impact of any new
standards will depend on the development and implementation of applicable
regulations.

Environmental Protection Agency Litigation

On November 3, 1999, the EPA brought a civil action in the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of Georgia. The complaint alleges violations of the
prevention of significant deterioration and new source review provisions of the
Clean Air Act with respect to coal-fired generating facilities at the Company's
Bowen and Scherer plants. The civil action requests penalties and injunctive
relief, including an order requiring the installation of the best available
control technology at the affected units. The EPA concurrently issued a notice
of violation to the Company relating to these two plants. In early 2000, the EPA
filed a motion to amend its complaint to add the violations alleged in its
notice of violation. The complaint and the notice of violation are similar to
those brought against and issued to several other electric utilities. The
complaint and the notice of violation allege that the Company failed to secure
necessary permits or install additional pollution control equipment when
performing maintenance and construction at coal burning plants constructed or
under construction prior to 1978. The Company believes that it complied with
applicable laws and the EPA's regulations and interpretations in effect at the


                                     II-90

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Georgia Power Company 2001 Annual Report


time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act authorizes civil
penalties of up to $27,500 per day per violation at each generating unit. Prior
to January 30, 1997, the penalty was $25,000 per day.

    The case against the Company has been stayed since the spring of 2001
pending a ruling by the federal Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in the
appeal of a very similar Clean Air Act / New Source Review enforcement action
brought by EPA against the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). The TVA case
involves many of the same legal issues raised by the actions against the
Company. Because the outcome of the TVA case could have a significant adverse
impact on Georgia Power, the Company is a party to that case as well. The
federal court in Georgia is currently considering a motion by the EPA to reopen
the case. The Company has opposed that motion. An adverse outcome of this matter
could require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this
time and could possibly require payment of substantial penalties. This could
affect future results of operations, cash flows, and possibly financial
condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

Other Environmental Issues

The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that cover
the handling and disposal of hazardous waste. Under these various laws and
regulations, the Company could incur costs to clean up properties currently or
previously owned. The Company conducts studies to determine the extent of any
required clean-up and has recognized in the financial statements costs to clean
up known sites. These costs for the Company amounted to $0.6 million in 2001 and
$4 million in both 2000 and 1999. Additional sites may require environmental
remediation for which the Company may be liable for all or a portion of required
clean-up costs. See Note 3 to the financial statements under "Other
Environmental Contingencies" for information regarding the Company's potentially
responsible party status at sites in Georgia.

     Several major pieces of environmental legislation are periodically
considered for reauthorization or amendment by Congress. These include: the
Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the
Toxic Substances Control Act; and the Endangered Species Act. Changes to these
laws could affect many areas of the Company's operations. The full impact of any
such changes cannot be determined at this time.

     Compliance with possible additional legislation related to global climate
change, electromagnetic fields, and other environmental and health concerns
could significantly affect the Company. The impact of new legislation -- if any
- -- will depend on the subsequent development and implementation of applicable
regulations. In addition, the potential exists for liability as the result of
lawsuits alleging damages caused by electromagnetic fields.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Georgia Power Company 2001 Annual Report


1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES

General

The Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company, which is the
parent company of five operating companies, a system service company (SCS),
Southern Communications Services (Southern LINC), Southern Nuclear Operating
Company (Southern Nuclear), Southern Power Company (Southern Power), and other
direct and indirect subsidiaries. The operating companies --Alabama Power
Company, Georgia Power Company, Gulf Power Company, Mississippi Power Company,
and Savannah Electric and Power Company-- provide electric service in four
southeastern states. Contracts among the operating companies -- related to
jointly owned generating facilities, interconnecting transmission lines, and the
exchange of electric power -- are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) and/or the Securities and Exchange Commission. SCS provides,
at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and subsidiary companies.
Southern LINC provides digital wireless communications services to the operating
companies and also markets these services to the public within the Southeast.
Southern Nuclear provides services to Southern Company's nuclear power plants.
Southern Power was established in 2001 to construct, own, and manage Southern
Company's competitive generation assets and sell electricity at market-based
rates in the wholesale market.

     Southern Company is registered as a holding company under the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA). Both Southern Company and its
subsidiaries are subject to the regulatory provisions of the PUHCA. The Company
is also subject to regulation by the FERC and the Georgia Public Service
Commission (GPSC). The Company follows accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States and complies with the accounting policies and practices
prescribed by the respective regulatory commissions. The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may
differ from these estimates.

     Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been
reclassified to conform with current year presentation.

Affiliate Transactions

The Company has an agreement with SCS under which the following services are
rendered to the Company at cost: general and design engineering, purchasing,
accounting and statistical, finance and treasury, tax, information resources,
marketing, auditing, insurance and pension, human resources, systems and
procedures, and other services with respect to business and operations and power
pool operations. Costs for these services amounted to $285 million, $269
million, and $253 million during 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.

     The Company has an agreement with Southern Nuclear under which the
following nuclear-related services are rendered to the Company at cost: general
executive and advisory services; general operations, management and technical
services; administrative services including procurement, accounting and
statistical, employee relations, and systems and procedures services; strategic
planning and budgeting services; and other services with respect to business and
operations. Costs for these services amounted to $281 million in both 2001 and
2000 and $270 million in 1999.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

The Company is subject to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
Regulation. Regulatory assets represent probable future revenues associated with
certain costs that are expected to be recovered from customers through the
ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions
in revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be credited to
customers through the ratemaking process. See Note 3 under "Retail Rate Orders"
for additional information regarding the disposition of the regulatory liability
for the accelerated cost recovery recorded under the retail rate order that
ended December 31, 2001. Regulatory assets and (liabilities) reflected in the
Company's Balance Sheets at December 31 relate to the following:

===============================================================

     In the event that a portion of the Company's operations is no longer
subject to the provisions of Statement No. 71, the Company would be required to
write off related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically
recoverable through regulated rates. In addition, the Company would be required
to determine if any impairment to other assets exists, including plant, and
write down the assets, if impaired, to their fair value.

Revenues and Fuel Costs

The Company currently operates as a vertically integrated utility providing
electricity to retail customers within its traditional service area located
within the state of Georgia, and to wholesale customers in the Southeast.

     The Company has a diversified base of customers. No single customer or
industry comprises 10 percent or more of revenues. For all periods presented,
uncollectible accounts averaged less than 1 percent of revenues.

     Revenues are recognized as services are rendered. Unbilled revenues are
accrued at the end of each fiscal period. Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is
used. The Company's fuel cost recovery mechanism includes provisions to adjust
billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, the energy component of purchased power
costs, and certain other costs. Revenues are adjusted for differences between
recoverable fuel costs and amounts actually recovered in current rates.

     Fuel expense includes the amortization of the cost of nuclear fuel and a
charge, based on nuclear generation, for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear
fuel. Total charges for nuclear fuel included in fuel expense amounted to $75
million in each of 2001 and 2000 and $74 million in 1999. The Company has
contracts with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) that provide for the
permanent disposal of used nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin disposing of
used nuclear fuel in January 1998 as required by the contracts, and the Company
is pursuing legal remedies against the government for breach of contract.
Sufficient pool storage capacity is available at Plant Vogtle to maintain
full-core discharge capability for both units until the year 2014. To maintain
pool discharge capability at Plant Hatch, effective June 2000, an on-site dry
storage facility for Plant Hatch became operational. Sufficient dry storage
capacity is believed to be available to continue dry storage operations at Plant
Hatch through the life of the plant. Procurement of on-site dry storage capacity
at Plant Vogtle will commence in sufficient time to maintain pool full-core
discharge capability.

     Also, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 required the establishment of a Uranium
Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund, which is to be funded in
part by a special assessment on utilities with nuclear plants. The assessment
will be paid over a 15-year period, which began in 1993. This fund will be used
by the DOE for the decontamination and decommissioning of its nuclear fuel
enrichment facilities. The law provides that utilities will recover these
payments in the same manner as any other fuel expense. The Company -- based on
its ownership interests -- estimates its remaining liability under this law at
December 31, 2001 to be approximately $16 million. This obligation is recorded
in the accompanying Balance Sheets.

Depreciation and Nuclear Decommissioning

Depreciation of the original cost of depreciable utility plant in service is
provided primarily by using composite straight-line rates, which approximated
3.3 percent in 2001, 2000, and 1999. When property subject to depreciation is
retired or otherwise disposed of in the normal course of business, its original
cost -- together with the cost of removal, less salvage -- is charged to
accumulated depreciation. Minor items of property included in the original cost
of the plant are retired when the related property unit is retired. Depreciation
expense includes an amount for the expected costs of decommissioning nuclear
facilities and removal of other facilities.

     Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulations require all licensees
operating commercial power reactors to establish a plan for providing, with


                                      II-101

NOTES (continued)
Georgia Power Company 2001 Annual Report


reasonable assurance, funds for decommissioning. The Company has established
external trust funds to comply with the NRC's regulations. Earnings on the trust
funds are considered in determining decommissioning expense. The NRC's minimum
external funding requirements are based on a generic estimate of the cost to
decommission the radioactive portions of a nuclear unit based on the size and
type of reactor. The Company has filed plans with the NRC to ensure that -- over
time -- the deposits and earnings of the external trust funds will provide the
minimum funding amounts prescribed by the NRC.

     The Company periodically conducts site-specific studies to estimate the
actual cost of decommissioning its nuclear generating facilities. Site study
cost is the estimate to decommission the facility as of the site study year, and
ultimate cost is the estimate to decommission the facility as of its retirement
date. The estimated site study costs based on the most current study and
ultimate costs assuming an inflation rate of 4.7 percent for the Company's
ownership interests are as follows:

                                           Plant     Plant
                                           Hatch     Vogtle

=============================================================

     The decommissioning cost estimates are based on prompt dismantlement and
removal of the plant from service. The actual decommissioning costs may vary
from the above estimates because of changes in the assumed date of
decommissioning, changes in the NRC requirements, changes in the assumptions
used in making the estimates, changes in regulatory requirements, changes in
technology, and changes in costs of labor, materials, and equipment.

     Annual provisions for nuclear decommissioning expense are based on an
annuity method as approved by the GPSC. The amounts expensed in 2001 and fund
balances as of December 31, 2001 were:


                                              Plant      Plant
                                              Hatch      Vogtle

================================================================
                                              (in millions)
  Accumulated provisions:
   External trust funds, at fair value        $229       $135
   Internal reserves                            20         12
- ----------------------------------------------------------------
  Total                                       $249       $147
================================================================

     Effective January 1, 2002, the GPSC decreased the annual provision for
decommissioning expenses to $8 million. This amount is based on the NRC generic
estimate to decommission the radioactive portion of the facilities as of 2000
of $383 million and $282 million for Plants Hatch and Vogtle, respectively. The
ultimate costs associated with the 2000 NRC minimum funding requirements are
$823 million and $1.03 billion for Plants Hatch and Vogtle, respectively.
Significant assumptions include an estimated inflation rate of 4.7 percent and
an estimated trust earnings rate of 6.5 percent. The Company expects the GPSC
to periodically review and adjust, if necessary, the amounts collected in rates
for the anticipated cost of decommissioning.

    In January 2002, the NRC granted the Company a 20-year extension of the
licenses for both units at Plant Hatch which permits the operation of units 1
and 2 until 2034 and 2038, respectively. The decommissioning costs disclosed
above do not reflect this extension.

Income Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes
and provides deferred income taxes for all significant income tax temporary
differences. Investment tax credits utilized are deferred and amortized to
income over the average lives of the related property.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction
(AFUDC)

AFUDC represents the estimated debt and equity costs of capital funds that are
necessary to finance the construction of new regulated facilities. While cash is


                                     II-102

NOTES (continued)
Georgia Power Company 2001 Annual Report


not realized currently from such allowance, it increases the revenue requirement
over the service life of the plant through a higher rate base and higher
depreciation expense. For the years 2001, 2000, and 1999, the average AFUDC
rates were 6.33 percent, 6.74 percent, and 5.61 percent, respectively. AFUDC,
net of taxes, as a percentage of net income after dividends on preferred stock,
was less than 3.0 percent for 2001, 2000, and 1999.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost, less regulatory
disallowances and impairments. Original cost includes: materials; labor;
payroll-related costs such as taxes, pensions, and other benefits; and the cost
of funds used during construction. The cost of maintenance, repairs, and
replacement of minor items of property is charged to maintenance expense. The
cost of replacements of property (exclusive of minor items of property) is
capitalized.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are
considered cash equivalents. Temporary cash investments are securities with
original maturities of 90 days or less.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income -- consisting of net income and changes in the fair value
of qualifying cash flow hedges, net of income taxes -- is presented in the
financial statements. The objective of comprehensive income is to report a
measure of all changes in common stock equity of an enterprise that result from
transactions and other economic events of the period other than transactions
with owners.

Financial Instruments

Effective January 2001, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. The impact on net
income was immaterial.

   The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to
fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and certain
commodity prices. Gains and losses on qualifying hedges are deferred and
recognized either in income or as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the
hedged item when the transaction occurs.

     The Company is exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the
event of counterparties' nonperformance. The Company has established controls to
determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to
mitigate the Company's exposure to counterparty credit risk.

   The Company and its affiliates, through SCS acting as their agent, enter into
commodity related forward and option contracts to limit exposure to changing
prices on certain fuel purchases and electricity purchases and sales.
Substantially all of the Company's bulk energy purchases and sales contracts
meet the definition of a derivative under Statement No. 133. In many cases,
these fuel and electricity contracts qualify for normal purchase and sale
exceptions under Statement No. 133 and are accounted for under the accrual
method. Other contracts qualify as cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions,
resulting in the deferral of related gains and losses, and are recorded in other
comprehensive income until the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness is
recognized currently in net income. Contracts that do not qualify for the normal
purchase and sale exception and that do not meet the hedge requirements are
marked to market through current period income.

     The Company's financial instruments for which the carrying amounts did not
approximate fair value at December 31 were as follows:

                                        Carrying      Fair
                                         Amount       Value

  At December 31, 2001                      $789        $782
  At December 31, 2000                      $789        $761
- --------------------------------------------------- ----------

     The fair values for securities were based on either closing market prices
or closing prices of comparable instruments.

Materials and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include the cost of transmission,
distribution, and generating plant materials. Materials are charged to inventory

                                     II-103

when purchased and then expensed or capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when
installed.

2.  RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company has defined benefit, trusteed pension plans that cover substantially
all employees. The Company provides certain medical care and life insurance
benefits for retired employees. Substantially all these employees may become
eligible for such benefits when they retire. The Company funds postretirement
trusts to the extent required by the GPSC and the FERC. In late 2000, the
Company adopted several pension and postretirement benefits plan changes that
had the effect of increasing benefits to both current and future retirees. The
measurement date for plan assets and obligations is September 30 of each year.

     The weighted average rates assumed in the actuarial calculations for both
the pension and postretirement benefit plans were:

Employee Savings Plan

The Company sponsors a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering substantially
all employees. The Company provides a 75 percent matching contribution up to 6
percent of an employee's base salary. Total matching contributions made to the
plan for the years 2001, 2000, and 1999 were $16 million, $15 million, and $15
million, respectively.

3. CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY MATTERS

General

The Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the
ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, after consultation
with legal counsel, the ultimate disposition of these matters is not expected to
have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition.

Retail Rate Orders

On December 20, 2001, the GPSC approved a new three-year retail rate order for
the Company ending December 31, 2004. Under the terms of the order, earnings
will be evaluated against a retail return on common equity range of 10 percent
to 12.95 percent. Two-thirds of any earnings above the 12.95 percent return will
be applied to rate refunds, with the remaining one-third retained by the
Company. Retail rates were decreased by $118 million effective January 1, 2002.

    Under a previous three-year order ending December 2001, the Company's
earnings were evaluated against a retail return on common equity range of 10
percent to 12.5 percent. The order further provided for $85 million in each
year, plus up to $50 million of any earnings above the 12.5 percent return
during the second and third years, to be applied to accelerated amortization or
depreciation of assets. Two-thirds of any additional earnings above the 12.5
percent return were applied to rate refunds, with the remaining one-third
retained by the Company. Pursuant to the order, the Company recorded $336
million of accelerated amortization and interest thereon which has been credited
to a regulatory liability account as mandated by the GPSC.

    Under the new rate order, the accelerated amortization and the interest will
be amortized equally over three years as a credit to expense beginning in 2002.
Effective January 1, 2002, the Company discontinued recording accelerated


                                     II-105

NOTES (continued)
Georgia Power Company 2001 Annual Report


depreciation and amortization. The Company will not file for a general base rate
increase unless its projected retail return on common equity falls below 10
percent. Georgia Power is required to file a general rate case on July 1, 2004,
in response to which the GPSC would be expected to determine whether the rate
order should be continued, modified, or discontinued.

    In 2000 and 1999, the Company recorded $44 million and $79 million,
respectively, of revenue subject to refund for estimated earnings above 12.5
percent retail return on common equity. Refunds applicable to 2000 and 1999 were
made to customers in 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Litigation

On November 3, 1999, the EPA brought a civil action in the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of Georgia. The complaint alleges violations of the
prevention of significant deterioration and new source review provisions of the
Clean Air Act with respect to coal-fired generating facilities at the Company's
Bowen and Scherer plants. The civil action requests penalties and injunctive
relief, including an order requiring the installation of the best available
control technology at the affected units beginning at the point of the alleged
violations. The Clean Air Act authorizes civil penalties of up to $27,500 per
day, per violation at each generating unit. Prior to January 30, 1997, the
penalty was $25,000 per day.

     The EPA concurrently issued a notice of violation to the Company relating
to these two plants. In early 2000, the EPA filed a motion to amend its
complaint to add the violations alleged in its notice of violation. The
complaint and the notice of violation are similar to those brought against and
issued to several other electric utilities. The complaint and the notice of
violation allege that the Company failed to secure necessary permits or install
additional pollution control equipment when performing maintenance and
construction at coal burning plants constructed or under construction prior to
1978. The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA's
regulations and interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took
place.

     The case against the Company has been stayed since the spring of 2001
pending a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in the
appeal of a very similar Clean Air Act / New Source Review enforcement action
brought by EPA against the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). The TVA case
involves many of the same legal issues raised by the actions against the
Company. Because the outcome of the TVA case could have a significant adverse
impact on Georgia Power, the Company is a party to that case as well. The
federal court in Georgia is currently considering a motion by the EPA to reopen
the Georgia case. The Company has opposed that motion. An adverse outcome of
this matter could require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be
determined at this time and possibly require payment of substantial penalties.
This could affect future results of operations, cash flows, and possibly
financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

Other Environmental Contingencies

The Company has been designated as a potentially responsible party at sites
governed by the Georgia Hazardous Site Response Act and/or by the federal
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. Georgia
Power has recognized $33 million in cumulative expenses through December 31,
2001 for the assessment and anticipated cleanup of sites on the Georgia
Hazardous Sites Inventory. In addition, in 1995 the EPA designated Georgia Power
and four other unrelated entities as potentially responsible parties at a site
in Brunswick, Georgia that is listed on the federal National Priorities List.
Georgia Power has contributed to the removal and remedial investigation and
feasibility study costs for the site. Additional claims for recovery of natural
resource damages at the site are anticipated. As of December 31, 2001, Georgia
Power had recorded approximately $6 million in cumulative expenses associated
with Georgia Power's agreed-upon share of the removal and remedial investigation
and feasibility study costs for the Brunswick site.

   The final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined. However, based
on the currently known conditions at these sites and the nature and extent of
Georgia Power's activities relating to these sites, management does not believe
that the Company's cumulative liability at these sites would be material to the
financial statements.

Nuclear Performance Standards

The GPSC has adopted a nuclear performance standard for the Company's nuclear
generating units under which the performance of Plants Hatch and Vogtle is
evaluated every three years. The performance standard is based on each unit's
capacity factor as compared to the average of all comparable U.S. nuclear units
operating at a capacity factor of 50 percent or higher during the three-year
period of evaluation. Depending on the performance of the units, the Company
could receive a monetary award or penalty under the performance standards
criteria.

     The GPSC has approved performance awards of approximately $11.7 million and
$7.8 million for performance during the 1993-1995 period and the 1996-1998
period, respectively. These awards are collected through the retail fuel cost
recovery provision and recognized in income over 36-month periods that began in
January 1997 and 2000, respectively, as mandated by the GPSC.

Race Discrimination Litigation

On July 28, 2000, a lawsuit alleging race discrimination was filed by three
Georgia Power employees against the Company, Southern Company, and SCS in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The lawsuit
also raised claims on behalf of a purported class. The plaintiffs seek
compensatory and punitive damages in an unspecified amount, as well as
injunctive relief. On August 14, 2000, the lawsuit was amended to add four more
plaintiffs. Also, an additional subsidiary of Southern Company, Southern Company
Energy Solutions, Inc., was named a defendant.

    On October 11, 2001, the district court denied plaintiffs' motion for class
certification. The plaintiffs filed a motion to reconsider the order denying
class certification, and the court denied the plaintiffs' motion to reconsider.
On December 28, 2001, the plaintiffs filed a petition in the United States Court
of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit seeking permission to file an appeal of the
October 11 decision. The defendants filed a brief in opposition of the petition
on January 18, 2002. Discovery of the seven named plaintiffs' individual claims
that remain in the case is ongoing. The final outcome of the case cannot be
determined.

4.  COMMITMENTS

Construction Program

Georgia Power had three new generation projects under construction during 2001.
They included two units at Plant Dahlberg, a ten-unit, 800 megawatt combustion
turbine facility; two combined cycle units totaling 1,132 megawatts at Plant
Wansley; and Plant Goat Rock, a two-unit, 1,181 megawatt combined cycle
facility. All three of these projects have been transferred to Southern Power
Company, a new Southern Company affiliate formed in 2001 to construct, own, and
manage wholesale generating assets in the Southeast. The ten Dahlberg units and
two Goat Rock units were transferred in 2001 and the transfer of the two Wansley
units was completed in January 2002. Significant construction of transmission
and distribution facilities and projects to remain in compliance with
environmental requirements will continue. The Company currently estimates
property additions to be approximately $1.0 billion in 2002, $0.8 billion in
2003, and $0.8 billion in 2004.

    In connection with the transfer of Plants Dahlberg, Goat Rock, and Wansley,
the Company has assigned $61 million in vendor equipment contracts to Southern
Power. While the Company could be obligated to assume responsibility for these
contracts if Southern Power fails to meet these commitments, Southern Company
has entered into limited keep-well arrangements whereby Southern Company would
contribute funds to Southern Power either through loans or capital
contributions in order to fund performance by Southern Power as equipment
purchaser under certain contingencies.  Southern Company has also guaranteed
Southern Power obligations totaling $6.6 milion for the Company's construction
of transmission interconnection facilities to these plants.

     The construction program is subject to periodic review and revision, and
actual construction costs may vary from estimates because of numerous factors,
including, but not limited to, changes in business conditions, load growth
estimates, environmental regulations, and regulatory requirements.

Fuel Commitments

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of its generating plants, the
Company has entered into various long-term commitments for the procurement of
fossil and nuclear fuel. In most cases, these contracts contain provisions for
price escalations, minimum purchase levels, and other financial commitments.

     Additional commitments for coal and for nuclear fuel will be required in
the future to supply the Company's fuel needs.

     In addition, SCS acts as agent for the five operating companies and
Southern Power with regard to natural gas purchases. Natural gas purchases (in
dollars) are based on various indices at the actual time of delivery; therefore,
only the volume commitments are firm and disclosed in the following chart. The
committed volumes, as of December 31, 2001 are as follows:

Purchased Power Commitments

The Company and an affiliate, Alabama Power, own equally all of the outstanding
capital stock of Southern Electric Generating Company (SEGCO), which owns
electric generating units with a total rated capacity of 1,020 megawatts, as
well as associated transmission facilities. The capacity of the units has been
sold equally to the Company and Alabama Power under a contract which, in
substance, requires payments sufficient to provide for the operating expenses,
taxes, debt service, and return on investment, whether or not SEGCO has any
capacity and energy available. The term of the contract extends automatically
for two-year periods, subject to either party's right to cancel upon two year's
notice. The Company's share of expenses included in purchased power from
affiliates in the Statements of Income is as follows:

effect until the latter of the retirement of the plant or the latest stated
maturity date of MEAG's bonds issued to finance such ownership interest. The
payments for capacity are required whether or not any capacity is available. The
energy cost is a function of each unit's variable operating costs. Except as
noted below, the cost of such capacity and energy is included in purchased power
from non-affiliates in the Company's Statements of Income. Capacity payments
totaled $59 million, $58 million, and $57 million in 2001, 2000, and 1999,
respectively. The current projected Plant Vogtle capacity payments are:

Operating Leases

The Company has entered into coal rail car rental agreements with various terms
and expiration dates. These expenses totaled $14 million for 2001, $16 million
for 2000, and $11 million for 1999. At December 31, 2001, estimated minimum
rental commitments for these noncancelable operating leases were as follows:

==============================================================

   In addition to the rental commitments above, the Company has obligations upon
expiration of certain of the rail car leases with respect to the residual value
of the leased property. These leases expire in 2004 and 2010, and the Company's
maximum obligations are $13 million and $40 million, respectively. At the
termination of the leases, at the Company's option, the Company may either
exercise its purchase option or the property can be sold to a third party. The
Company expects that the fair market value of the leased property would
substantially reduce or eliminate the Company's payments under the residual
value obligation.

5.  NUCLEAR INSURANCE

Under the Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 1988, the Company maintains
agreements of indemnity with the NRC that, together with private insurance,
cover third-party liability arising from any nuclear incident occurring at the
Company's nuclear power plants. The Act provides funds up to $9.5 billion for
public liability claims that could arise from a single nuclear incident. Each
nuclear plant is insured against this liability to a maximum of $200 million by
American Nuclear Insurers (ANI), with the remaining coverage provided by a
mandatory program of deferred premiums that could be assessed, after a nuclear
incident, against all owners of nuclear reactors. The Company could be assessed
up to $88 million per incident for each licensed reactor it operates but not
more than an aggregate of $10 million per incident to be paid in a calendar year
for each reactor. Such maximum assessment for the Company, excluding any
applicable state premium taxes -- based on its ownership and buyback interests
- -- is $178 million per incident but not more than an aggregate of $20 million to
be paid for each incident in any one year.

     The Company is a member of Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), a
mutual insurer established to provide property damage insurance in an amount up
to $500 million for members' nuclear generating facilities.

     Additionally, the Company has policies that currently provide
decontamination, excess property insurance, and premature decommissioning
coverage up to $2.25 billion for losses in excess of the $500 million primary
coverage. This excess insurance is also provided by NEIL.

     NEIL also covers the additional costs that would be incurred in obtaining
replacement power during a prolonged accidental outage at a member's nuclear
plant. Members can purchase this coverage, subject to a deductible waiting
period of between 8 to 26 weeks, with a maximum per occurrence per unit limit of
$490 million. After this deductible period, weekly indemnity payments would be
received until either the unit is operational or until the limit is exhausted in
approximately three years.

     Under each of the NEIL policies, members are subject to assessments if
losses each year exceed the accumulated funds available to the insurer under
that policy. The current maximum annual assessments for the Company under the
three NEIL policies would be $39 million.


                                      II-109

NOTES (continued)
Georgia Power Company 2001 Annual Report


    Following the terrorist attacks of September 2001, both ANI and NEIL
confirmed that terrorist acts against commercial nuclear power stations would be
covered under their insurance. Both companies, however, revised their policy
terms on a prospective basis to include an industry aggregate for all terrorist
acts. The NEIL aggregate, which applies to all claims stemming from terrorism
within a 12 month duration, is $3.24 billion plus any amounts that would be
available through reinsurance or indemnity from an outside source. The ANI cap
is $200 million in a policy year.

     For all on-site property damage insurance policies for commercial nuclear
power plants, the NRC requires that the proceeds of such policies should be
dedicated first for the sole purpose of placing the reactor in a safe and stable
condition after an accident. Any remaining proceeds are to be applied next
toward the costs of decontamination and debris removal operations ordered by the
NRC, and any further remaining proceeds are to be paid either to the Company or
to its bond trustees as may be appropriate under the policies and applicable
trust indentures.

     All retrospective assessments, whether generated for liability, property,
or replacement power, may be subject to applicable state premium taxes.

6.  JOINT OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS

Except as otherwise noted, the Company has contracted to operate and maintain
all jointly owned generating facilities. The Company jointly owns the Rocky
Mountain pumped storage hydroelectric plant with Oglethorpe Power Company who is
the operator of the plant. The Company also jointly owns Plant McIntosh with
Savannah Electric and Power Company who operates the plant. The Company and
Florida Power Corporation (FPC) jointly own a combustion turbine unit
(Intercession City) operated by FPC.

     The Company includes its proportionate share of plant operating expenses in
the corresponding operating expenses in the Statements of Income.

     At December 31, 2001, the Company's percentage ownership and investment
(exclusive of nuclear fuel) in jointly owned facilities in commercial operation
were as follows:

7.   LONG-TERM POWER SALES AGREEMENTS

The Company and the other operating companies of Southern Company have long-term
contractual agreements for the sale of capacity and energy to certain
non-affiliated utilities located outside the system's service area. These
agreements consist of firm unit power sales pertaining to capacity from specific
generating units. Because energy is generally sold at cost under these
agreements, it is primarily the capacity revenues that affect the Company's
profitability.

     The Company's capacity revenues were as follows:

               Year      Revenues      Capacity
               ----------------------------------
                      (in millions) (megawatts)
               2001        $  26           102
               2000           30           124
               1999           32           162
               ----------------------------------

     Unit power from specific generating plants is being sold to Florida Power &
Light Company, FPC, and Jacksonville Electric Authority. Under these agreements,
approximately 102 megawatts of capacity is scheduled to be sold annually for
periods after 2001 with a minimum of three years notice until the expiration of
the contracts in 2010.

8.  INCOME TAXES

At December 31, 2001, tax-related regulatory assets were $544 million and
tax-related regulatory liabilities were $229 million. The assets are

attributable to tax benefits flowed through to customers in prior years and to
taxes applicable to capitalized interest. The liabilities are attributable to
deferred taxes previously recognized at rates higher than current enacted tax
law and to unamortized investment tax credits.

     Details of the federal and state income tax provisions are as follows:

     Deferred investment tax credits are amortized over the life of the related
property with such amortization normally applied as a credit to reduce
depreciation in the Statements of Income. Credits amortized in this manner
amounted to $15 million in 2001, 2000, and 1999. At December 31, 2001, all
investment tax credits available to reduce federal income taxes payable had been
utilized.

     A reconciliation of the federal statutory tax rate to the effective income
tax rate is as follows:

     Southern Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income
tax return. Under a joint consolidated income tax agreement, each subsidiary's
current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis. In
accordance with Internal Revenue Service regulations, each company is jointly
and severally liable for the tax liability.

9.  CAPITALIZATION

First Mortgage Bond Indenture Restrictions

The Company's first mortgage bond indenture contains various restrictions that
remain in effect as long as the bonds are outstanding. However, the Company
expects to discharge its first mortgage bond indenture by spring 2002 and to be
released from all indenture requirements. At December 31, 2001, $1.037 billion
of retained earnings and paid-in capital was unrestricted for the payment of
cash dividends or any other distributions under terms of the mortgage indenture.
The Company has no restrictions on the amount of indebtedness it may incur.

Preferred Securities

Statutory business trusts formed by the Company, of which the Company owns all
the common securities, have issued mandatorily redeemable preferred securities
as follows:

              Date of                                 Maturity
               Issue      Amount   Rate      Notes      Date

Trust III     6/1997       189.25  7.75       195      3/2037
Trust IV      2/1999       200.00  6.85       206      3/2029


                                     II-111

NOTES (continued)
Georgia Power Company 2001 Annual Report


     Substantially all of the assets of each trust are junior subordinated notes
issued by the Company in the respective approximate principal amounts set forth
above.

     The Company considers that the mechanisms and obligations relating to the
preferred securities, taken together, constitute a full and unconditional
guarantee by the Company of the Trusts' payment obligations with respect to the
preferred securities.

     The Trusts are subsidiaries of the Company, and accordingly are
consolidated in the Company's financial statements.

Pollution Control Bonds

The Company has incurred obligations in connection with the sale by public
authorities of tax-exempt pollution control revenue bonds. The Company has
authenticated and delivered to trustees an aggregate of $7.8 million of its
first mortgage bonds outstanding at December 31, 2001, which are pledged as
security for its obligations under pollution control revenue contracts. The
redemption of these securities will occur in March 2002.

Senior Notes

In February 2000, February 2001, and May 2001, the Company issued unsecured
senior notes. The proceeds of these issues were used to redeem higher cost
long-term debt and to reduce short-term borrowing. The senior notes are, in
effect, subordinated to all secured debt of the Company.

Bank Credit Arrangements

At the beginning of 2002, the Company had unused credit arrangements with banks
totaling $1.8 billion, of which $1.3 billion expires at various times during
2002 and $500 million expires at April 24, 2003.

     Of the total $1.8 billion in unused credit, $1.65 billion is a syndicated
credit arrangement with $1.15 billion expiring April 19, 2002 and $500 million
expiring April 24, 2003. Upon expiration, the $1.15 billion agreement provides
the option of converting borrowings into two-year term loans. Both agreements
contain stated borrowing rates but also allow for competitive bid loans. In
addition, the agreements require payment of commitment fees based on the unused
portions of the commitments. Annual fees are also paid to the agent bank.

     Approximately $115 million of the $1.3 billion arrangements expiring during
2002 allow for two-year term loans executable upon the expiration date of the
facilities. All of the arrangements include stated borrowing rates but also
allow for negotiated rates. These agreements also require payment of commitment
fees based on the unused portion of the commitments or the maintenance of
compensating balances with the banks. These balances are not legally restricted
from withdrawal.

     This $1.8 billion in unused credit arrangements provides liquidity support
to the Company's variable rate pollution control bonds. The amount of variable
rate pollution control bonds outstanding requiring that liquidity support as of
December 31, 2001 was $984 million.

     In addition, the Company borrows under uncommitted lines of credit with
banks and through commercial paper programs that has the liquidity support of
committed bank credit arrangements. Average compensating balances held under
these committed facilities were not material in 2001. The amount of commercial
paper outstanding at December 31, 2001 was $707.6 million

Other Long-Term Debt

Assets acquired under capital leases are recorded in the Balance Sheets as
utility plant in service, and the related obligations are classified as
long-term debt. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company had a capitalized
lease obligation for its corporate headquarters building of $83 million with an
interest rate of 8.1 percent. For ratemaking purposes, the GPSC has treated the
lease as an operating lease and has allowed only the lease payments in cost of
service. The difference between the accrued expense and the lease payments
allowed for ratemaking purposes has been deferred and is being amortized to
expense as ordered by the GPSC. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the interest and
lease amortization deferred on the Balance Sheets are $54 million and $55
million, respectively.

     The Company's first mortgage bond indenture includes an improvement fund
requirement that amounts to 1 percent of each outstanding series of bonds
authenticated under the indenture prior to January 1 of each year, other than
those issued to collateralize pollution control obligations. The requirement may
be satisfied by June 1 of each year by depositing cash, reacquiring bonds, or by
pledging additional property equal to 1 2/3 times the requirement. However, the
Company expects to discharge its first mortgage bond indenture by spring 2002
and to be released from all indenture requirements.

     Serial maturities through 2006 applicable to total long-term debt are as
follows: $312 million in 2002; $352 million in 2003; $2 million in 2004; $154
million in 2005; and $153 million in 2006.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT
Gulf Power Company 2001 Annual Report


The management of Gulf Power Company has prepared -- and is responsible for --
the financial statements and related information included in this report. These
statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States and necessarily include amounts that are based on
the best estimates and judgments of management. Financial information throughout
this annual report is consistent with the financial statements.

   The Company maintains a system of internal accounting controls to provide
reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that the accounting records
reflect only authorized transactions of the Company. Limitations exist in any
system of internal controls, however, based on a recognition that the cost of
the system should not exceed its benefits. The Company believes its system of
internal accounting controls maintains an appropriate cost/benefit relationship.

   The Company's system of internal accounting controls is evaluated on an
ongoing basis by the Company's internal audit staff. The Company's independent
public accountants also consider certain elements of the internal control system
in order to determine their auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the financial statements.

   The audit committee of the board of directors, composed of five independent
directors, provides a broad overview of management's financial reporting and
control functions. Periodically, this committee meets with management, the
internal auditors, and the independent public accountants to ensure that these
groups are fulfilling their obligations and to discuss auditing, internal
controls, and financial reporting matters. The internal auditors and independent
public accountants have access to the members of the audit committee at any
time.

   Management believes that its policies and procedures provide reasonable
assurance that the Company's operations are conducted according to a high
standard of business ethics.

   In management's opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows
of Gulf Power Company in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


To Gulf Power Company:


We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements of capitalization
of Gulf Power Company (a Maine corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Southern Company) as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related statements
of income, common stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2001. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

   We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

   In our opinion, the financial statements (pages II-129 through II-144)
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Gulf Power Company as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.

   As explained in Note 1 to the financial statements, effective January 1,
2001, Gulf Power Company changed its method of accounting for derivative
instruments and hedging activities.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION
Gulf Power Company 2001 Annual Report


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

Gulf Power Company's 2001 net income after dividends on preferred stock was
$58.3 million, an increase of $6.5 million from the previous year. In 2000,
earnings were $51.8 million, down $1.9 million when compared to 1999. The
increase in earnings in 2001 was due primarily to an increase in Allowance for
Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) and lower interest expense; the decrease
in 2000 was primarily a result of expenses related to the discontinuance of the
Company's appliance sales division, and higher interest expense.

Revenues

Operating revenues increased in 2001 when compared to 2000. The following table
summarizes the change in operating revenues for the past two years:

                                             Increase (Decrease)

Percent change                               1.5%          6.0%
- ----------------------------------------------------------------

   Retail revenues increased $36 million, or 6.6 percent in 2001, and $31.7
million or 6.1 percent in 2000, due primarily to the recovery of higher fuel and
purchased power costs. Retail base rate revenues increased $4.5 million due to
slightly higher energy sales and lower revenues subject to refund. Revenues
subject to refund were $1.5 million in 2001 compared to $6.9 million in 2000.
See Note 3 to the financial statements under "Retail Revenue Sharing Plan" for
further information.

    "Regulatory cost recovery and other" includes: recovery provisions for fuel
expenses and the energy component of purchased power costs, energy conservation
costs, purchased power capacity costs, and environmental compliance costs.
Annually, the Company seeks recovery of projected costs plus any true-up amount
from prior periods. Approved rates are implemented each January. Therefore, the
recovery provisions generally equal the related expenses and have no material
effect on net income. See Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements under
"Revenues and Regulatory Cost Recovery Clauses" and "Environmental Cost
Recovery," respectively, for further information.

   Sales for resale were $109.5 million in 2001, a decrease of $24.4 million, or
18.2 percent, from 2000 primarily due to reduced energy sales for resale to
affiliates. Revenues from sales to utilities outside the service area under
long-term contracts consist of capacity and energy components. Capacity revenues
reflect the recovery of fixed costs and a return on investment under the
contracts. Energy is generally sold at variable cost. The capacity and energy
components under these long-term contracts were as follows:

                             2001         2000          1999
                     ----------------------------------------
                                    (in thousands)
Capacity                  $19,472      $20,270       $19,792
Energy                     27,579       21,922        20,251
- -------------------------------------------------------------
Total                     $47,051      $42,192       $40,043
=============================================================

   Capacity revenues remained relatively unchanged during 2001 and 2000.

   Sales to affiliated companies vary from year to year depending on demand and
the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These sales
have little impact on earnings.

   Other operating revenues for 2000 increased due primarily to higher franchise
fees and higher revenues from the transmission of electricity to others.

Energy Sales

Kilowatt-hour sales for 2001 and the percent changes by year were as follows:

Total                      13,229     (3.7)      0.7
=====================================================

   Total retail energy sales increased in both 2001 and 2000 primarily due to an
increase in the total number of customers.

   An increase in energy sales for resale to non-affiliates of 22.8 percent in
2001 when compared to 2000 is primarily related to unit power sales under
long-term contracts to other Florida utilities and bulk power sales under
short-term contracts to other non-affiliated utilities. Energy sales to
affiliated companies vary from year to year depending on demand and availability
and cost of generating resources at each company.

Expenses

Total operating expenses in 2001 increased $13.5 million, or 2.3 percent, over
the amount recorded in 2000 due primarily to higher purchased power expenses and
maintenance expenses. In 2000, total operating expenses increased $39.5 million,
or 7.1 percent, compared to 1999 due primarily to higher fuel and purchased
power expenses.

   Fuel expenses in 2001, when compared to 2000, decreased $15.1 million, or 7.0
percent, due primarily to decreased generation, while average fuel costs
increased as noted below. In 2000, fuel expenses increased $6.7 million, or 3.2
percent, when compared to 1999. The increase in 2000 was a result of an increase
in average fuel costs.

   The amount and sources of generation and the average cost of fuel per net
kilowatt-hour generated were as follows:

                                          2001       2000       1999

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   Purchased power expenses increased in 2001 by $23.8 million, or 28.8 percent,
over 2000 primarily due to an increase in purchased power from affiliate
companies. Purchased power expenses for 2000 increased over 1999 by $25.5
million, or 44.7 percent, due primarily to a higher demand for energy.

   Purchases of energy from affiliates will vary from year to year depending on
demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company.
These purchases have little impact on earnings.

   Depreciation and amortization expense increased $1.3 million, or 2.0 percent,
in 2001, and $2.3 million, or 3.5 percent, in 2000 due to an increase in
depreciable property and the amortization of a portion of a regulatory asset,
which was allowed in the current retail revenue sharing plan.

   Other income, net increased in 2001 by $6.8 million compared to 2000 due
primarily to higher allowance for equity funds used during construction related
to the Company's new combined cycle unit. In 2000, other income, net decreased
$2.8 million due primarily to expenses related to the discontinuance of the
Company's appliance sales division. See Note 1 to the financial statements under
"Other Income" for further information.

   Interest expense, net decreased $3.1 million, or 10.9 percent, in 2001 due
primarily to higher allowance for debt funds used during construction related to
the Company's new combined cycle unit, as well as lower interest rates on notes
payable and variable rate pollution control bonds. These decreases were
partially offset by the issuance of $60 million of senior notes in August 2001
and $75 million of senior notes in October 2001. In 2000, interest expense, net

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  (continued)
Gulf Power Company 2001 Annual Report

increased $1.2 million, or 4.6 percent, due primarily to the issuance of $50
million of senior notes in August 1999.

Effects of Inflation

The Company is subject to rate regulation and income tax laws that are based on
the recovery of historical costs. Therefore, inflation creates an economic loss
because the Company is recovering its cost of investments in dollars that have
less purchasing power. While the inflation rate has been relatively low in
recent years, it continues to have an adverse effect on the Company because of
the large investment in utility plant with long economic lives. Conventional
accounting for historical cost does not recognize this economic loss nor the
partially offsetting gain that arises through financing facilities with
fixed-money obligations, such as long-term debt and preferred securities. Any
recognition of inflation by regulatory authorities is reflected in the rate of
return allowed.

Future Earnings Potential

General

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily
indicative of future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on
numerous factors. The major factor is the ability to achieve energy sales growth
while containing costs in a more competitive environment.

   In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No.
87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions, the Company recorded non-cash income of
approximately $5.9 million in 2001. Future pension income is dependent on
several factors including trust earnings and changes to the plan.

    The Company is involved in various matters being litigated. See Note 3 to
the financial statements for information regarding material issues that could
possibly affect future earnings.

   The Company currently operates as a vertically integrated utility providing
electricity to customers within its traditional service area located in
northwest Florida. Prices for electricity provided by the Company to retail
customers are set by the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC).

   Future earnings in the near term will depend upon growth in energy sales,
which is subject to a number of factors. Traditionally, these factors have
included the rate of economic growth in the Company's service area, weather,
competition, changes in contracts with neighboring utilities, the elasticity of
demand, and energy conservation practiced by the Company's customers. The
Company is actively pursuing additional earnings through unregulated new
products and services.

   In early 1999, the FPSC staff and the Company became involved in discussions
primarily related to reducing the Company's authorized rate of return. On
October 1, 1999, the Office of Public Counsel, the Coalition for Equitable
Rates, the Florida Industrial Power Users Group, and the Company jointly filed a
petition to resolve the issues. The stipulation included a reduction to retail
base rates of $10 million annually and provides for revenues to be shared within
set ranges for 1999 through 2002. Customers receive two-thirds of any revenue
within the sharing range and the Company retains one-third. Any revenue above
this range is refunded to the customers. The stipulation also included
authorization for the Company, at its discretion, to accrue up to an additional
$5 million to the property insurance reserve and $1 million to amortize a
regulatory asset related to the corporate office. The Company also filed a
request to prospectively reduce its authorized return on equity (ROE) range from
11 to 13 percent to 10.5 to 12.5 percent in order to help ensure that the FPSC
would approve the stipulation. The FPSC approved both the stipulation and the
ROE request with an effective date of November 4, 1999.

   On September 10, 2001, the Company filed a request with the FPSC for a base
rate increase of approximately $70 million, the majority of which is needed to
recover costs related to the Smith Unit 3 combined cycle facility currently
under construction and scheduled to be placed in service by June 2002. Hearings
are scheduled for February 25 through March 1, 2002 with a decision expected in
early May 2002 and new rates effective June 6, 2002.

   For calendar year 2001, the Company's retail revenue range for sharing was
$358 million to $374 million. Actual retail revenues in 2001 were $360.3 million
and the Company recorded revenues subject to refund of $1.5 million. The
estimated refund with interest was reflected in customer billings in February
2002. For calendar year 2002, there are specified sharing ranges for each month
from the expected in-service date of Smith Unit 3 until the end of the year. The

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  (continued)
Gulf Power Company 2001 Annual Report


sharing plan will expire at the earlier of the in-service date of Smith Unit 3
or December 31, 2002.

   Compliance costs related to current and future environmental laws and
regulations could affect earnings if such costs are not fully recovered. The
Clean Air Act and other important environmental items are discussed later under
"Environmental Matters." Also, Florida legislation adopted in 1993 that provides
for recovery of prudent environmental compliance costs is discussed in Note 3 to
the financial statements under "Environmental Cost Recovery."

Industry Restructuring

The electric utility industry in the United States is continuing to evolve as
a result of regulatory and competitive factors. Among the primary agents of
change has been the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Energy Act). The Energy Act
allows independent power producers (IPPs) to access a utility's transmission
network in order to sell electricity to other utilities. This enhances the
incentive for IPPs to build cogeneration plants for a utility's large industrial
and commercial customers and sell energy generation to other utilities. Also,
electricity sales for resale rates are being driven down by wholesale
transmission access and numerous potential new energy suppliers, including power
marketers and brokers.

   Although the Energy Act does not permit retail customer access, it has been a
major catalyst for recent restructuring and consolidations taking place within
the utility industry. Numerous federal and state initiatives are in varying
stages to promote wholesale and retail competition. Among other things, these
initiatives allow customers to choose their electricity provider. Some states
have approved initiatives that result in a separation of the ownership and/or
operation of generating facilities from the ownership and/or operation of
transmission and distribution facilities. While various restructuring and
competition initiatives have been discussed in Florida, none have been enacted.
Enactment would require numerous issues to be resolved, including significant
ones relating to recovery of any stranded investments, full cost recovery of
energy produced, and other issues related to the energy crisis that occurred in
California. As a result of that crisis, many states have either discontinued or
delayed implementation of initiatives involving retail deregulation.

   In 2000, Florida's Governor appointed a 17 member study commission to look at
the state's electric industry, studying issues ranging from current and future
reliability of electric and natural gas supply, electric industry retail and
wholesale competition, environmental impacts of energy supply, conservation, and
tax issues. A deadline of December 1, 2001 was set for the commission's final
report and recommendations to the Governor and the Legislature. During the
course of the study, the Stranded Investment Task Force Subcommittee recommended
a discretionary transfer approach regarding the transfer or sale of generation
assets by an investor owned utility (IOU). This would allow all new generation
to be competitively bid while allowing IOU's to transfer generation units to an
affiliate or sell generation units and share proceeds with both shareholders and
consumers. Merchants would also be allowed to compete in this restructured
wholesale market. This recommendation was approved during the final meeting of
the study commission on November 15, 2001 and has been incorporated into the
final report. The final report, entitled "Florida...Energy Wise" was presented
on December 11, 2001 to the Governor and the Legislature. Any recommendations
from the commission will have to be drafted and voted into law by the
Legislature. This is unlikely to occur in the upcoming 2002 legislative session.
The effects of any proposed changes cannot presently be determined, but could
have a material effect on the Company's financial condition and results of
operations.

    Continuing to be a low-cost producer could provide opportunities to increase
market share and profitability in markets that evolve with changing regulation.
Conversely, if the Company does not remain a low-cost producer and provide
quality service, then energy sales growth could be limited, and this could
significantly erode earnings.

    In December 1999, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued its
final rule on Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs). The order encouraged
utilities owning transmission systems to form RTOs on a voluntary basis.
Southern Company has submitted a series of status reports informing the FERC of
progress toward the development of a Southeastern RTO. In these status reports,
Southern Company explained that it is developing a for profit RTO known as
SeTrans with a number of non-jurisdictional cooperative and public power
entities. Recently, Entergy Corporation and Cleco Power joined the SeTrans
development process. In January 2002, the sponsors of SeTrans held a public

meeting to form a Stakeholder Advisory Committee, which will participate in the
development of the SeTrans RTO. Southern Company continues to work with the
other sponsors to develop the SeTrans RTO. The creation of SeTrans is not
expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. The
outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Accounting Policies

Critical Policy

Gulf Power Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to
the financial statements. The Company's most critical accounting policy involves
rate regulation. The Company is subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No.
71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. In the event that
a portion of the Company's operations is no longer subject to these provisions,
the Company would be required to write off related regulatory assets and
liabilities that are not specifically recoverable, and determine if any other
assets have been impaired. See Note 1 to the financial statements under
"Regulatory Assets and Liabilities" for additional information.

New Accounting Standards

Effective January 2001, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. Statement No. 133
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and
for hedging activities. This statement requires that certain derivative
instruments be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability
measured at fair value and that changes in the fair value be recognized
currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. The
impact on net income in 2001 was not material. (See Note 1 to the financial
statements under "Financial Instruments" for additional information). An
additional interpretation of Statement No. 133 will result in a change --
effective April 1, 2002 -- in accounting for certain contracts related to fuel
supplies that contain quantity options. These contracts will be accounted for as
derivatives and marked to market. However, due to the existence of specific
cost-based fuel recovery clauses for the Company, this change is not expected to
have a material impact on net income.

   In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for
acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 17. Statement No. 142 addresses how intangible
assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets -- but not
those acquired in a business combination -- should be accounted for upon
acquisition and on an ongoing basis. Goodwill and intangible assets that have
indefinite useful lives will not be amortized but rather will be tested at least
annually for impairment. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives will
continue to be amortized over their useful lives, which are no longer limited to
40 years. The Company adopted Statement No. 142 in January 2002 with no material
impact on the financial statements.

   Also in June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143, Asset Retirement
Obligations, which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal
obligations associated with retiring assets, including decommissioning of
nuclear plants. The liability for an asset's future retirement must be recorded
in the period in which the liability is incurred. The cost must be capitalized
as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful
life. Changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time will be
recognized as operating expenses. Statement No. 143 must be adopted by January
1, 2003. The Company has not yet quantified the impact of adopting Statement No.
143 on its financial statements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

During 2001, gross property additions were $274.7 million. Funds for the
Company's property additions were provided by operating activities and
additional financings, which were utilized to finance the construction of the
Company's new combined cycle unit. See the Statements of Cash Flows for further
details.

Credit Rating Risk

The Company does not have any credit agreements that would require material
changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating
downgrade.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  (continued)
Gulf Power Company 2001 Annual Report


Exposure to Market Risks

Due to cost-based rate regulations, the Company has limited exposure to market
volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity.
To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the
Company enters into fixed price contracts for the purchase and sale of
electricity through the wholesale electricity market and, to a lesser extent,
similar contracts for gas purchases. Realized gains and losses are recognized in
the income statement as incurred. At December 31, 2001, exposure from these
activities was not material. Fair value of changes in energy trading contracts
and year-end valuations are as follows:

   If the Company sustained a 100 basis point change in interest rates for all
variable rate long-term debt, the change would affect annualized interest
expense by approximately $0.61 million at December 31, 2001.

Financing Activities

In 2001, the Company sold $135 million of senior notes and $30 million of trust
preferred securities and used the proceeds to retire $30 million of first
mortgage bonds and to pay for construction of the Company's new combined cycle
unit. In 2000, there were no issuances or retirements of long-term debt. See the
Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

   Composite financing rates for the years 1999 through 2001 as of year end were
as follows:

                                       2001      2000      1999

   dividend rate                        5.1%      5.1%      5.1%
- -----------------------------------------------------------------

   The composite interest rate on long-term debt decreased in 2001 due to lower
interest rates on variable rate pollution control bonds and lower rates on new
senior notes.

Capital Requirements for Construction

The Company's gross property additions, including those amounts related to
environmental compliance, are budgeted at $282 million for the three years
beginning in 2002 ($103 million in 2002, $72 million in 2003, and $107 million
in 2004). These amounts include $24.3 million in 2002 for the remaining cost of
a 574 megawatt combined cycle gas generating unit and related interconnections
to be located in the eastern portion of the Company's service area. The unit is
expected to have an in-service date of June 2002. The remaining property
additions budget is primarily for maintaining and upgrading transmission and
distribution facilities and generating plants. Actual construction costs may
vary from this estimate because of changes in such factors as the following:
business conditions; environmental regulations; load projections; the cost and
efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; and the cost of
capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital
expenditures will be fully recovered.

Other Capital Requirements

The Company will continue to retire higher-cost debt and preferred securities
and replace these securities with lower-cost capital as market conditions and
terms of the instruments permit.

Environmental Matters

In November 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (Clean Air Act) was
signed into law. Title IV of the Clean Air Act -- the acid rain compliance
provision of the law -- significantly affected the Company. Specific reductions
in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from fossil-fired generating
plants were required in two phases. Phase I compliance began in 1995. Southern
Company achieved Phase I compliance at the affected plants by primarily
switching to low-sulfur coal and with some equipment upgrades. Construction
expenditures for Phase I nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions compliance
totaled approximately $42 million for the Company. Phase II sulfur dioxide
compliance was required in 2000. Southern Company used emission allowances and
fuel switching to comply with Phase II requirements. Also, equipment to control
nitrogen oxide emissions was installed on additional system fossil-fired units
as necessary to meet Phase II limits and ozone non-attainment requirements for
metropolitan Atlanta through 2000. Phase II compliance did not have a material
impact on the Company.

   A significant portion of costs related to the acid rain and ozone
non-attainment provisions of the Clean Air Act is expected to be recovered
through existing ratemaking provisions. However, there can be no assurance that
all Clean Air Act costs will be recovered.

   In 1993, the Florida Legislature adopted legislation that allows a utility to
petition the FPSC for recovery of prudent environmental compliance costs that
are not being recovered through base rates or any other recovery mechanism. The
legislation is discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements under
"Environmental Cost Recovery." Substantially all of the costs for the Clean Air
Act and other new environmental legislation discussed below are expected to be
recovered through the Environmental Cost Recovery Clause.

   In July 1997, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) revised the national
ambient air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter. This revision
made the standards significantly more stringent. In the subsequent litigation of
these standards, the U.S. Supreme Court found the EPA's implementation program
for the new ozone standard unlawful and remanded it to the EPA. In addition, the
Federal District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals is considering other legal
challenges to these standards. If the standards are eventually upheld,
implementation could be required by 2007 to 2010.

   In September 1998, the EPA issued regional nitrogen oxide reduction rule to
the states for implementation. Compliance is required by May 31, 2004 for most
states, but for Georgia, further ratemaking is required and compliance may be
delayed until May 2005. The final rule affects 21 states, including Georgia, but
not Florida. See Note 5 to the financial statements under "Joint Ownership
Agreements" related to the Company's ownership interest in Georgia Power's Plant
Scherer Unit No. 3. The EPA is presently evaluating whether to bring an
additional 15 states, not including Florida, under this regional nitrogen oxide
rule.

   In December 2000, the EPA completed its utility study for mercury and other
hazardous air pollutants (HAPS) and issued a determination that an emission
control program for mercury and, perhaps, other HAPS is warranted. The program
is to be developed over the next four years under the Maximum Achievable Control
Technology provisions of the Clean Air Act, and the regulations are scheduled to
be finalized by the end of 2004 with implementation to take place around 2007.
In January 2001, the EPA proposed guidance for the determination of Best

                                     II-125

Available Retrofit Technology (BART) emission controls under the Regional Haze
Regulations. Installation of BART controls is expected to take place around
2010. Litigation of the Regional Haze Regulations, including the BART
provisions, is ongoing in the Federal District of Columbia Circuit Court of
Appeals. A court decision is expected in mid-2002.

   Implementation of the final state rules for these initiatives could require
substantial further reductions in nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide and
reductions in mercury and other HAPS emissions from fossil-fired generating
facilities and other industries in these states. Additional compliance costs and
capital expenditures resulting from the implementation of these rules and
standards cannot be determined until the results of legal challenges are known,
and the states have adopted their final rules.

   In October 1997, EPA issued regulations setting forth requirements for
Compliance Assurance Monitoring (CAM) in its state and federal operating permit
programs. These regulations were amended by EPA in March 2001 in response to a
court order resolving challenges to the rules brought by environmental groups
and industry. Generally, this rule affects the operation and maintenance of
electrostatic precipitators and could involve significant additional ongoing
expense.

   The EPA and state environmental regulatory agencies are also reviewing and
evaluating various other matters including: control strategies to reduce
regional haze; limits on pollutant discharges to impaired waters; cooling water
intake restrictions; and hazardous waste disposal requirements. The impact of
any new standards will depend on the development and implementation of
applicable regulations.

   On November 3, 1999, the EPA brought a civil action in the U.S. District
Court against Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and the system service company. The
complaint alleges violations of the prevention of significant deterioration and
new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act with respect to five
coal-fired generating facilities in Alabama and Georgia. The civil action
requests penalties and injunctive relief, including an order requiring the
installation of the best available control technology at the affected units. The
EPA concurrently issued to the integrated Southeast utilities a notice of
violation related to 10 generating facilities, including the five facilities
mentioned previously and the Company's Plants Crist and Scherer. For additional
information, see Note 5 to the financial statements under "Joint Ownership
Agreements" related to the Company's ownership interest in Georgia Power's Plant
Scherer Unit No. 3. In early 2000, the EPA filed a motion to amend its complaint
to add the violations alleged in its notice of violation, and to add the
Company, Mississippi Power, and Savannah Electric as defendants. The complaint
and notice of violation are similar to those brought against and issued to
several other electric utilities. These complaints and notices of violation
allege that the utilities had failed to secure necessary permits or install
additional pollution control equipment when performing maintenance and
construction at coal burning plants constructed or under construction prior to
1978. The U.S. District Court granted Alabama Power's motion to dismiss for lack
of jurisdiction in Georgia and granted the system service company's motion to
dismiss on the grounds that it neither owned nor operated the generating units
involved in the proceedings. The court directed the EPA to re-file its amended
complaint limiting claims to those brought against Georgia Power and Savannah
Electric. The EPA re-filed those claims as directed by the court. Also, the EPA
re-filed its claims against Alabama Power in U.S. District Court in Alabama. It
has not re-filed against the Company, Mississippi Power, or the system service
company. The Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Savannah Electric cases have been
stayed since the spring of 2001, pending a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Eleventh Circuit in the appeal of a very similar New Source Review
enforcement action against the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). The TVA case
involves many of the same legal issues raised by the actions against Alabama
Power, Georgia Power, and Savannah Electric. Because the outcome of the TVA case
could have a significant adverse impact on Alabama Power and Georgia Power, both
companies are parties to that case as well. The U.S. District Court in Alabama
has indicated that it will revisit the issue of a continued stay in April 2002.
The U.S. District Court in Georgia is currently considering a motion by the EPA
to reopen the Georgia case. Georgia Power and Savannah Electric have opposed
that motion.

   The Company believes that it has complied with applicable laws and the EPA's
regulations and interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took
place. The Clean Air Act authorizes civil penalties of up to $27,500 per day per
violation at each generating unit. Prior to January 30, 1997, the penalty was
$25,000 per day. An adverse outcome of this matter could require substantial


                                     II-126

Gulf Power Company 2001 Annual Report


capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and possibly require
payment of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of
operations, cash flows, and possibly financial condition if such costs are not
recovered through regulated rates.

   The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that
cover the handling and disposal of hazardous waste. Under these various laws and
regulations, the Company could incur substantial costs to clean up properties.
The Company conducts studies to determine the extent of any required cleanup
costs and has recognized in the financial statements costs to clean up known
sites. For additional information, see Note 3 to the financial statements under
"Environmental Cost Recovery."

   Several major pieces of environmental legislation are being considered for
reauthorization or amendment by Congress. These include: the Clean Air Act; the
Clean Water Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances
Control Act; and the Endangered Species Act. Changes to these laws could affect
many areas of the Company's operations. The full impact of any such changes
cannot be determined at this time.

    Compliance with possible additional legislation related to global climate
change, electric and magnetic fields, and other environmental health concerns
could significantly affect the Company. The impact of new legislation -- if any
- -- will depend on the subsequent development and implementation of applicable
regulations. In addition, the potential exists for liability as the result of
lawsuits alleging damages caused by electric and magnetic fields.

Sources of Capital

At December 31, 2001, the Company had approximately $2.2 million of cash and
cash equivalents and $2.6 million of unused commercial paper backed by lines of
credit with banks to meet its short-term cash needs. See the Statements of Cash
Flows for details related to the Company's financing activities. See Note 8 to
the financial statements under "Bank Credit Arrangements" for additional
information.

   The Company may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company
subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper at the request and for
the benefit of the Company and the other Southern Company operating companies.
At December 31, 2001, the Company had outstanding $37.4 million of commercial
paper.

   The Company historically has relied on issuances of first mortgage bonds and
preferred stock, in addition to pollution control bonds issued for its benefit
by public authorities, to meet its long-term external financing requirements.
Recently, the Company's financings have consisted of unsecured debt and trust
preferred securities. The Company has no restrictions on the amounts of
unsecured indebtedness it may incur. However, in order to issue first mortgage
bonds or preferred stock, the Company is required to meet certain coverage
requirements specified in its mortgage indenture and corporate charter. The
Company's ability to satisfy all coverage requirements is such that it could
issue new first mortgage bonds and preferred stock to provide sufficient funds
for all anticipated requirements.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information

The Company's 2001 Annual Report contains forward looking and historical
information. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by
terminology such as "may," "will," "could," "should," "expects," "plans,"
"anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "projects," "predicts," "potential" or
"continue" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. The
Company cautions that there are various important factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking
statements; accordingly, there can be no assurance that such indicated results
will be realized. These factors include the impact of recent and future federal
and state regulatory change, including legislative and regulatory initiatives
regarding deregulation and restructuring of the electric utility industry and
also changes in environmental and other laws and regulations to which the
Company is subject, as well as changes in application of existing laws and
regulations; current and future litigation, including the pending EPA civil
action; the effects, extent, and timing of the entry of additional competition
in the markets of the Company; the impact of fluctuations in commodity prices,
interest rates and customer demand; state and federal rate regulations;
political, legal, and economic conditions and developments in the United States;
the performance of projects undertaken by the non-traditional business and the
success of efforts to invest in and develop new opportunities; internal

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Gulf Power Company 2001 Annual Report

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES

General

Gulf Power Company (Company) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company,
which is the parent company of five operating companies, a system service
company (SCS), Southern Communications Services (Southern LINC), Southern
Nuclear Operating Company (Southern Nuclear), Southern Power Company (Southern
Power), and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The operating companies --
Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, and Savannah
Electric -- provide electric service in four southeastern states. Contracts
among the operating companies -- related to jointly owned generating facilities,
interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power -- are
regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and/or the
Securities and Exchange Commission. SCS provides, at cost, specialized services
to Southern Company and subsidiary companies. Southern LINC provides digital
wireless communications services to the operating companies and also markets
these services to the public within the Southeast. Southern Nuclear provides
services to Southern Company's nuclear power plants. Southern Power was
established in 2001 to construct, own, and manage Southern Company's competitive
generation assets and sell electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale
market.

   Southern Company is registered as a holding company under the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA). Both Southern Company and its subsidiaries
are subject to the regulatory provisions of the PUHCA. The Company is also
subject to regulation by the FERC and the Florida Public Service Commission
(FPSC). The Company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States and complies with the accounting policies and practices prescribed
by the FPSC and the FERC. The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the
use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates.

   Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been
reclassified to conform with current year presentation.

Affiliate Transactions

The Company has an agreement with SCS under which the following services are
rendered to the Company at cost: general and design engineering, purchasing,
accounting and statistical, finance and treasury, tax, information resources,
marketing, auditing, insurance and pension administration, human resources,
systems and procedures, and other services with respect to business and
operations and power pool operations. Costs for these services amounted to $45
million, $44 million, and $43 million during 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

The Company is subject to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
Regulation. Regulatory assets represent probable future revenues to the Company
associated with certain costs that are expected to be recovered from customers
through the ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future
reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be credited
to customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory assets and (liabilities)
reflected in the Balance Sheets at December 31 relate to the following:

   In the event that a portion of the Company's operations is no longer subject
to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, the Company would be required to
write off related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically
recoverable through regulated rates. In addition, the Company would be required
to determine any impairment to other assets, including plant, and write down the
assets, if impaired, to their fair value.

NOTES (continued)
Gulf Power Company 2001 Annual Report


Revenues and Regulatory Cost Recovery Clauses

The Company currently operates as a vertically integrated utility providing
electricity to retail customers within its service area located in northwest
Florida and to wholesale customers in the Southeast.

   Revenues are recognized as services are rendered. Unbilled revenues are
accrued at the end of each fiscal period.

   Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is used. The Company's retail electric
rates include provisions to annually adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel
costs, the energy component of purchased power costs, and certain other costs.
The Company also has similar retail cost recovery clauses for energy
conservation costs, purchased power capacity costs, and environmental compliance
costs. Revenues are adjusted monthly for differences between recoverable costs
and amounts actually reflected in current rates.

   The Company has a diversified base of customers and no single customer or
industry comprises 10 percent or more of revenues. For all periods presented,
uncollectible accounts averaged significantly less than 1 percent of revenues.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation of the original cost of plant in service is provided primarily by
using composite straight-line rates, which approximated 3.7 percent in 2001 and
3.8 percent in both 2000, and 1999. When property subject to depreciation is
retired or otherwise disposed of in the normal course of business, its cost --
together with the cost of removal, less salvage -- is charged to the accumulated
provision for depreciation. Minor items of property included in the original
cost of the plant are retired when the related property unit is retired. Also,
the provision for depreciation expense includes an amount for the expected cost
of removal of facilities.

Other Income

Other income consists principally of interest and dividend income, Allowance for
Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC)-equity, and income or expenses on other
non-regulated activities. In 2000 and 1999, the non-regulated activities
included the results of the Company's merchandising operations, which were
discontinued in the latter part of 2000.

Income Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes and
provides deferred income taxes for all significant income tax temporary
differences. Investment tax credits utilized are deferred and amortized to
income over the average lives of the related property.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost. Original cost
includes: materials; labor; minor items of property; appropriate administrative
and general costs; payroll-related costs such as taxes, pensions, and other
benefits; and the estimated cost of funds used during construction. The cost of
maintenance, repairs, and replacement of minor items of property is charged to
maintenance expense. The cost of replacements of property (exclusive of minor
items of property) is charged to utility plant.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles

The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be
recoverable. The determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on
an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as
compared to the carrying value of the assets. If an impairment has occurred, the
amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value
of the assets and recording a provision for loss if the carrying value is
greater than the fair value. For assets identified as held for sale, the
carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value less the cost to sell in
order to determine if an impairment provision is required. Until the assets are
disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or
events change.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Temporary cash investments are considered cash equivalents. Temporary cash
investments are securities with original maturities of 90 days or less.

Financial Instruments

Effective January 2001, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended.  The impact on
net income was immaterial.

                                     II-136




NOTES (continued)
Gulf Power Company 2001 Annual Report


   The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to
fluctuations in interest rates, and certain commodity prices. Gains and losses
on qualifying hedges are deferred and recognized either in income or as an
adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item when the transaction
occurs.

   The Company is exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the
event of counterparties' nonperformance. The Company has established controls to
determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to
mitigate the Company's exposure to counterparty credit risk.

   The Company and its affiliates, through SCS acting as their agent, enters
into commodity related forward and option contracts to limit exposure to
changing prices on certain fuel purchases and electricity purchases and sales.
Substantially all of the Company's bulk energy purchases and sales contracts
meet the definition of a derivative under FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. In many cases, these fuel and
electricity contracts qualify for normal purchase and sale exceptions under
Statement No. 133 and are accounted for under the accrual method. Other
contracts qualify as cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions, resulting in
the deferral of related gains and losses, and are recorded in other
comprehensive income until the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness is
recognized currently in net income. Contracts that do not qualify for the normal
purchase and sale exception and that do not meet the hedge requirements are
marked to market through current period income.

   Other financial instruments for which the carrying amount did not equal fair
value at December 31 were as follows:

                                       Carrying          Fair
                                         Amount         Value

Long-term debt:
   At December 31, 2001                $467,784      $474,911
   At December 31, 2000                $365,993      $364,697

securities:
   At December 31, 2001                $115,000      $114,898
   At December 31, 2000                 $85,000       $80,988
- --------------------------------------------------------------

   The fair values for long-term debt and preferred securities were based on
either closing market prices or closing prices of comparable instruments.

Materials and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include the cost of transmission,
distribution, and generating plant materials. Materials are charged to inventory
when purchased and then expensed or capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when
installed.

Provision for Injuries and Damages

The Company is subject to claims and suits arising in the ordinary course of
business. As permitted by regulatory authorities, the Company provides for the
uninsured costs of injuries and damages by charges to income amounting to $1.2
million annually. The expense of settling claims is charged to the provision to
the extent available. The accumulated provision of $1.3 million and $1.2 million
at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, is included in other current
liabilities in the accompanying Balance Sheets.

Provision for Property Damage

The Company provides for the cost of repairing damages from major storms and
other uninsured property damages. This includes the full cost of major storms
and other damages to its transmission and distribution lines and the cost of
uninsured damages to its generation and other property. The expense of such
damages is charged to the provision account. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the
accumulated provision for property damage was $13.6 million and $8.7 million,
respectively. The FPSC approved annual accrual to the accumulated provision for
property damage is $3.5 million, with a target level for the accumulated
provision account between $25.1 and $36.0 million. The FPSC has also given the
Company the flexibility to increase its annual accrual amount above $3.5 million
at the Company's discretion. The Company accrued $4.5 million in 2001, $3.5
million in 2000, and $5.5 million in 1999 to the accumulated provision for
property damage. The Company had a net credit of $(0.3) million to the provision
account in 2001 related to insurance proceeds that exceeded actual claims. In
2000 and 1999, the Company charged $0.3 million and $1.6 million, respectively,
to the provision account.

2.  RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company has a defined benefit, trusteed, non-contributory pension plan that
covers substantially all regular employees. The Company provides certain medical
care and life insurance benefits for retired employees. Substantially all
employees may become eligible for these benefits when they retire. Trusts are

funded to the extent required by the Company's regulatory commissions. In late
2000, the Company adopted several pension and postretirement benefit plan
changes that had the effect of increasing benefits to both current and future
retirees. The measurement date for plan assets and obligations is September 30
for each year.

Employee Savings Plan

The Company also sponsors a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering
substantially all employees. The Company provides a 75 percent matching
contribution up to 6 percent of an employee's base salary. Total matching
contributions made to the plan for the years 2001, 2000, and 1999 were $2.3
million, $2.2 million, and $2.0 million, respectively.

3.   CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY
     MATTERS

General

The Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the
ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, after consultation
with legal counsel, the ultimate disposition of these matters is not expected to
have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition.

Environmental Cost Recovery

In 1993, the Florida Legislature adopted legislation for an Environmental Cost
Recovery Clause (ECRC), which allows a utility to petition the FPSC for recovery
of prudent environmental compliance costs that are not being recovered through
base rates or any other recovery mechanism. Such environmental costs include
operation and maintenance expense, emission allowance expense, depreciation, and
a return on invested capital.

   In 1994, the FPSC approved the Company's initial petition under the ECRC for
recovery of environmental costs. During 2001, 2000, and 1999, the Company
recorded ECRC revenues of $10.0 million, $9.9 million, and $11.5 million,
respectively.

   At December 31, 2001, the Company's liability for the estimated costs of
environmental remediation projects for known sites was $7.2 million. These
estimated costs are expected to be expended from 2002 through 2008. These
projects have been approved by the FPSC for recovery through the ECRC discussed
above. Therefore, the Company recorded $1.2 million in current assets and
current liabilities and $6.0 million in deferred assets and deferred liabilities
representing the future recoverability of these costs.

Environmental Litigation

On November 3, 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil
action in the U.S. District Court against Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and SCS.
The complaint alleges violations of the prevention of significant deterioration
and new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act with respect to five
coal-fired generating facilities in Alabama and Georgia. The civil action


                                     II-139



NOTES (continued)
Gulf Power Company 2001 Annual Report


requests penalties and injunctive relief, including an order requiring the
installation of the best available control technology at the affected units. The
Clean Air Act authorizes civil penalties of up to $27,500 per day, per violation
at each generating unit. Prior to January 30, 1997, the penalty was $25,000 per
day.

   The EPA concurrently issued to the integrated Southeast utilities a notice of
violation related to 10 generating facilities, including the five facilities
mentioned previously and the Company's Plants Crist and Scherer. See Note 5
under "Joint Ownership Agreements" related to the Company's ownership interest
in Georgia Power's Plant Scherer Unit No. 3. In early 2000, the EPA filed a
motion to amend its complaint to add the violations alleged in its notice of
violation, and to add the Company, Mississippi Power, and Savannah Electric as
defendants. The complaint and notice of violation are similar to those brought
against and issued to several other electric utilities. These complaints and
notices of violation allege that the utilities had failed to secure necessary
permits or install additional pollution control equipment when performing
maintenance and construction at coal burning plants constructed or under
construction prior to 1978. On August 1, 2000, the U.S. District Court granted
Alabama Power's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction in Georgia and
granted SCS's motion to dismiss on the grounds that it neither owned nor
operated the generating units involved in the proceedings. The court directed
the EPA to re-file its amended complaint limiting claims to those brought
against Georgia Power and Savannah Electric. The EPA re-filed those claims as
directed by the court. Also, the EPA re-filed its claims against Alabama Power
in U.S. District Court in Alabama. It has not re-filed against the Company,
Mississippi Power, or the system service company. The Alabama Power, Georgia
Power, and Savannah Electric cases have been stayed since the spring of 2001,
pending a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in the
appeal of a very similar New Source Review enforcement action against the
Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). The TVA case involves many of the same legal
issues raised by the actions against Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Savannah
Electric. Because the outcome of the TVA case could have a significant adverse
impact on Alabama Power and Georgia Power, both companies are parties to that
case as well. The U.S. District Court in Alabama has indicated that it will
revisit the issue of a continued stay in April 2002. The U.S. District Court in
Georgia is currently considering a motion by the EPA to reopen the Georgia case.
Georgia Power and Savannah Electric have opposed that motion.

   The Company believes that it has complied with applicable laws and the EPA's
regulations and interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took
place.

   An adverse outcome of this matter could require substantial capital
expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and possibly require payment
of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of operations, cash
flows, and possibly financial condition if such costs are not recovered through
regulated rates.

Retail Revenue Sharing Plan

In early 1999, the FPSC staff and the Company became involved in discussions
primarily related to reducing the Company's authorized rate of return. On
October 1, 1999, the Office of Public Counsel, the Coalition for Equitable
Rates, the Florida Industrial Power Users Group, and the Company jointly filed a
petition to resolve the issues. The stipulation included a reduction to retail
base rates of $10 million annually and provided for revenues to be shared within
set ranges for 1999 through 2002. Customers receive two-thirds of any revenue
within the sharing range and the Company retains one-third. Any revenue above
this range is refunded to the customers. The stipulation also included
authorization for the Company, at its discretion, to accrue up to an additional
$5 million to the property insurance reserve and $1 million to amortize a
regulatory asset related to the corporate office. The Company also filed a
request to prospectively reduce its authorized return on equity (ROE) range from
11 to 13 percent to 10.5 to 12.5 percent in order to help ensure that the FPSC
would approve the stipulation. The FPSC approved both the stipulation and the
ROE request with an effective date of November 4, 1999.

   The Company's retail revenue range for sharing was $358 million to $374
million in calendar year 2001, and $352 million to $368 million in 2000, to be
shared between the Company and its retail customers on the one-third/two-thirds
basis. Actual retail revenues in 2001 were $360.3 million and $362.4 million in
2000. The Company recorded revenues subject to refund of $1.5 million in 2001
and $6.9 million in 2000. The estimated refund with interest was $0.03 million
in 2001 and $0.3 million in 2000 and was reflected in customer billings in
February 2002 and 2001 respectively. In addition to the refund, the Company
amortized $1 million of the regulatory assets related to the corporate office in
2001 and 2000, and accrued an additional $1.0 million to the property insurance

reserve in 2001. For calendar year 2002, there are specified sharing ranges for
each month from the expected in-service date of Smith Unit 3 until the end of
the year. The sharing plan will expire at the earlier of the in-service date of
Smith Unit 3 or December 31, 2002.

Retail Rate Case

On September 10, 2001, the Company filed a request with the FPSC for a base rate
increase of approximately $70 million, the majority of which is needed to
recover costs related to the Smith Unit 3 combined cycle facility currently
under construction and scheduled to be placed in service by June 2002. Hearings
are scheduled for February 25 through March 1, 2002 with a decision expected in
early May 2002 and new rates effective June 6, 2002.

4. COMMITMENTS

Construction Program

The Company is engaged in a continuous construction program, the cost of which
is currently estimated to total $103 million in 2002, $72 million in 2003, and
$107 million in 2004. The construction program is subject to periodic review and
revision, and actual construction costs may vary from the above estimates
because of numerous factors. These factors include changes in business
conditions; revised load growth estimates; changes in environmental regulations;
increasing costs of labor, equipment, and materials; and cost of capital. At
December 31, 2001, significant purchase commitments were outstanding in
connection with the construction program. The Company has budgeted $24.3 million
in 2002 as the remaining cost of a 574 megawatt combined cycle gas generating
unit to be located in the eastern portion of its service area. The unit is
expected to have an in-service date of June 2002. The Company's remaining
construction program is related to maintaining and upgrading the transmission,
distribution, and generating facilities.

Fuel Commitments

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of its generating plants, the
Company has entered into contract commitments for the procurement of fuel. In
some cases, these contracts contain provisions for price escalations, minimum
purchase levels, and other financial commitments. Total estimated obligations at
December 31, 2001 were as follows:

   Year                                           Fuel
   ---------                                 ----------------

   2003                                                  109
   2004                                                  112
   2005                                                  113
   2006                                                  115
   2007-2025                                             398
   ----------------------------------------------------------
   Total commitments                                    $987
   ==========================================================

   In addition, SCS acts as agent for the five operating companies and Southern
Power with regard to natural gas purchases. Natural gas purchases (in dollars)
are based on various indices at the actual time of delivery; therefore, only the
volume commitments are firm. The Company's committed volumes are allocated based
on usage projections as of December 31 as follows:

   Year                                        Natural Gas
   ---------                                 ----------------

   ------------------------------------------------------
   Total commitments                          70,421,019
   ======================================================

   Additional commitments for fuel will be required in the future to supply the
Company's fuel needs.

Lease Agreements

In 1989, the Company and Mississippi Power jointly entered into a twenty-two
year operating lease agreement for the use of 495 aluminum railcars. In 1994, a
second lease agreement for the use of 250 additional aluminum railcars was
entered into for twenty-two years. Both of these leases are for the
transportation of coal to Plant Daniel. At the end of each lease term, the
Company has the option to purchase the 745 railcars at the greater of lease
termination value or fair market value, or to renew the leases at the end of the
lease term.

                                     II-141



NOTES (continued)
Gulf Power Company 2001 Annual Report


   The Company, as a joint owner of Plant Daniel, is responsible for one half of
the lease costs. The lease costs are charged to fuel inventory and are allocated
to fuel expense as the fuel is used. The Company's share of the lease costs
charged to fuel inventories was $1.9 million in 2001 and $2.4 million in 2000.
The annual amounts for 2002 through 2006 are expected to be $1.9 million, $1.9
million, $1.9 million, $2.0 million, and $2.0 million, respectively, and after
2006 are expected to total $11.7 million.

5.  JOINT OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS

The Company and Mississippi Power jointly own Plant Daniel Unit No. 1 and Unit
No. 2.  Plant Daniel is a generating plant located in Jackson County,
Mississippi. In accordance with the operating agreement, Mississippi Power
acts as the Company's agent with respect to the construction, operation, and
maintenance of these units.

   The Company and Georgia Power jointly own Plant Scherer Unit No. 3. Plant
Scherer is a generating plant located near Forsyth, Georgia. In accordance with
the operating agreement, Georgia Power acts as the Company's agent with respect
to the construction, operation, and maintenance of the unit.

   The Company's pro rata share of expenses related to both plants is included
in the corresponding operating expense accounts in the Statements of Income.

   At December 31, 2001, the Company's percentage ownership and its investment
in these jointly owned facilities were as follows:

6.  LONG-TERM POWER SALES AGREEMENTS

The Company and the other operating affiliates have long-term contractual
agreements for the sale of capacity to certain non-affiliated utilities located
outside the system's service area. The unit power sales agreements are firm and
pertain to capacity related to specific generating units. Because the energy is
generally sold at cost under these agreements, profitability is primarily
affected by revenues from capacity sales. The capacity revenues from these sales
were $19.5 million in 2001, $20.3 million in 2000, and $19.8 million in 1999.

   Unit power from specific generating plants of Southern Company is currently
being sold to Florida Power Corporation (FPC), Florida Power & Light Company
(FP&L), and Jacksonville Electric Authority (JEA). Under these agreements, 210
megawatts of net dependable capacity were sold by the Company during 2001. Sales
will remain close to that level, unless reduced by FP&L, FPC, and JEA with a
minimum of three years notice, until the expiration of the contracts in 2010.

7.  INCOME TAXES

At December 31, 2001, the tax-related regulatory assets to be recovered from
customers were $16.8 million. These assets are attributable to tax benefits
flowed through to customers in prior years and to taxes applicable to
capitalized allowance for funds used during construction. At December 31, 2001,
the tax-related regulatory liabilities to be credited to customers were $28.3
million. These liabilities are attributable to deferred taxes previously
recognized at rates higher than current enacted tax law and to unamortized
investment tax credits.

   Details of the federal and state income tax provisions are as follows:

                                     2001       2000        1999

   Deferred investment tax credits are amortized over the lives of the related
property with such amortization normally applied as a credit to reduce
depreciation and amortization in the Statements of Income. Credits amortized in
this manner amounted to $1.7 million in 2001 and $1.9 million in each of 2000
and 1999. At December 31, 2001, all investment tax credits available to reduce
federal income taxes payable had been utilized.

8.  CAPITALIZATION

Preferred Securities

In January 1997, Gulf Power Capital Trust I (Trust I), of which the Company owns
all of the common securities, issued $40 million of 7.625 percent mandatorily
redeemable preferred securities. Substantially all of the assets of Trust I are
$41 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 7.625 percent junior
subordinated notes due December 31, 2036.

   In January 1998, Gulf Power Capital Trust II (Trust II), of which the Company
owns all of the common securities, issued $45 million of 7.0 percent mandatorily
redeemable preferred securities. Substantially all of the assets of Trust II are
$46 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 7.0 percent junior
subordinated notes due December 31, 2037.

   In November 2001, Gulf Power Capital Trust III (Trust III), of which the
Company owns all of the common securities, issued $30 million of 7.375 percent
mandatorily redeemable preferred securities. Substantially all of the assets of
Trust III are $31 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 7.375
percent junior subordinated notes due September 30, 2041.

   The Company considers that the mechanisms and obligations relating to the
preferred securities, taken together, constitute a full and unconditional
guarantee by the Company of payment obligations with respect to the preferred
securities of Trust I, Trust II, and Trust III. Trust I, Trust II, and Trust III
are subsidiaries of the Company, and accordingly are consolidated in the
Company's financial statements.

Securities Due Within One Year

At December 31, 2001, the Company had an improvement fund requirement of
$550,000. The first mortgage bond improvement fund requirement amounts to 1
percent of each outstanding series of bonds authenticated under the indenture
prior to January 1 of each year, other than those issued to collateralize
pollution control revenue bond obligations. The requirement may be satisfied by
depositing cash, reacquiring bonds, or by pledging additional property equal to
1 and 2/3 times the requirement.

   The sinking fund requirements of first mortgage bonds were satisfied by
certifying property additions in 2001 and 2000. It is anticipated that the 2002


                                     II-143



NOTES (continued)
Gulf Power Company 2001 Annual Report


requirement will be satisfied by certifying property additions. Sinking fund
requirements and/or maturities through 2006 applicable to long-term debt are as
follows: none in 2002; $60.6 million in 2003; $50.6 million on 2004; none in
2005; and $37.6 million in 2006.

Dividend Restrictions

The Company's first mortgage bond indenture contains various common stock
dividend restrictions, which remain in effect as long as the bonds are
outstanding. At December 31, 2001, retained earnings of $127 million were
restricted against the payment of cash dividends on common stock under the terms
of the mortgage indenture.

Bank Credit Arrangements

At December 31, 2001, the Company had $41.5 million of lines of credit with
banks subject to renewal June 1 of each year, of which $41.5 million remained
unused. In addition, the Company has two unused committed lines of credit
totaling $61.9 million that were established for liquidity support of its
variable rate pollution control bonds. In connection with these credit lines,
the Company has agreed to pay commitment fees and/or to maintain compensating
balances with the banks. The compensating balances, which represent
substantially all of the cash of the Company except for daily working funds and
like items, are not legally restricted from withdrawal.

   The Company borrows through commercial paper programs that have the liquidity
support of committed bank credit arrangements. In addition, the Company from
time to time borrows under uncommitted lines of credit with banks. The amount of
commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2001 was $37.4 million.

   In addition, the Company has bid-loan facilities with five major money center
banks that total $110 million, of which $50 million was committed at December
31, 2001.

Assets Subject to Lien

The Company's mortgage, which secures the first mortgage bonds issued by the
Company, constitutes a direct first lien on substantially all of the Company's
fixed property and franchises.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT
Mississippi Power Company 2001 Annual Report


The management of Mississippi Power Company has prepared -- and is responsible
for -- the financial statements and related information included in this report.
These statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States and necessarily include amounts that are
based on the best estimates and judgments of management. Financial information
throughout this annual report is consistent with the financial statements.

    The Company maintains a system of internal accounting controls to provide
reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that the accounting records
reflect only authorized transactions of the Company. Limitations exist in any
system of internal controls, however, based on a recognition that the cost of
the system should not exceed its benefits. The Company believes its system of
internal accounting controls maintains an appropriate cost/benefit relationship.

    The Company's system of internal accounting controls is evaluated on an
ongoing basis by the Company's internal audit staff. The Company's independent
public accountants also consider certain elements of the internal control system
in order to determine their auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the financial statements.

    The audit committee of the board of directors, composed of four independent
directors, provides a broad overview of management's financial reporting and
control functions. Periodically, this committee meets with management, the
internal auditors, and the independent public accountants to ensure that these
groups are fulfilling their obligations and to discuss auditing, internal
controls, and financial reporting matters. The internal auditors and independent
public accountants have access to the members of the audit committee at any
time.

    Management believes that its policies and procedures provide reasonable
assurance that the Company's operations are conducted according to a high
standard of business ethics.

    In management's opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows
of Mississippi Power Company in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT


To Mississippi Power Company:

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements of capitalization
of Mississippi Power Company (a Mississippi corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Southern Company) as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the
related statements of income, common stockholder's equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

    We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

    In our opinion, the financial statements (pages II-160 through II-176)
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Mississippi Power Company as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.

    As explained in Note 1 to the financial statements, effective January 1,
2001, Mississippi Power Company changed its method of accounting for derivative
instruments and hedging activities.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION
Mississippi Power Company 2001 Annual Report


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

Mississippi Power Company's 2001 net income after dividends on preferred stock
of $63.9 million increased $8.9 million over 2000 earnings of $55.0 million,
which were $0.2 million more than 1999 earnings of $54.8 million. Net income for
2001 was higher due to additional sales for resale primarily attributable to the
commercial operation of the new Plant Daniel Combined Cycle Units 3 and 4 and
lower interest expense.

Revenues

Operating revenues for the Company in 2001 and the changes from the prior year
are as follows:
                                            Increase (Decrease)
                              Amount          From Prior Year

  Percent change                               15.8%          8.6%
  -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Total retail revenues for 2001 decreased approximately 1.9 percent when
compared to 2000. The decrease resulted primarily from lower energy sales to
residential, commercial, and industrial customers as a result of mild weather
and a slowdown in manufacturing activity in the Company's service territory.
Retail revenues for 2000 reflected a 6.2 percent increase over the prior year
due to the continued growth in the service area, increased fuel revenues, and a
positive weather impact.

    Fuel revenues generally represent the direct recovery of fuel expense
including purchased power. Therefore, changes in recoverable fuel expenses are
offset with corresponding changes in fuel revenues and have no effect on net
income.

    Sales for resale to non-affiliates are influenced by those utilities' own
customer demand, plant availability, and the cost of their predominant fuels.
Included in sales for resale to non-affiliates are revenues from rural electric
cooperative associations and municipalities located in southeastern Mississippi.
Energy sales to these customers decreased 3.7 percent in 2001 and increased 10.9
percent in 2000, with the related revenues decreasing 2.4 percent and rising
10.8 percent, respectively. The customer demand experienced by these utilities
is determined by factors very similar to those of the Company. Revenues from
other sales outside the service area increased in 2001 when compared to 2000 as
a result of a new long term contract made possible by the commercial operation
of Plant Daniel Units 3 and 4.

    Energy sales to affiliated companies within the Southern Company electric
system, as well as purchases, will vary from year to year depending on demand
and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
sales do not have a significant impact on earnings.

    Below is a breakdown of kilowatt-hour sales for 2001 and the percent change
for the last two years:

    Residential sales decreased 5.4 percent due to unusually mild weather in the
Company's service area. Commercial sales decreased 1.5 percent and industrial
sales fell 2.3 percent due to an economic slowdown. Total retail kilowatt-hour
sales increased slightly in 2000. This increase primarily resulted from the
continued growth in the service area, increased tourism, and the positive impact
of weather. Kilowatt-hour sales from outside the service area increased in 2001
when compared to 2000 as a result of a new contract made possible by the

Mississippi Power Company 2001 Annual Report


commercial operation of Plant Daniel Combined Cycle Units 3 and 4. Again, sales
to affiliates will vary year to year depending on demand and cost of generating
resources at each company.

Expenses

Total operating expenses were $663 million in 2001, reflecting an increase of
$98 million or 17.4 percent over the prior year. The increase was due primarily
to the commercial operation of Plant Daniel Combined Cycle Units 3 and 4. In
2000, total operating expenses increased by 10.1 percent over the prior year due
primarily to higher fuel and purchased power expenses.

    Fuel costs are the single largest expense for the Company. Fuel expenses for
2001 and 2000 increased 45.4 percent and 10.7 percent, respectively. The
increase for 2001 was due to increased generation especially from Plant Daniel
Combined Cycle Units 3 and 4 and a higher average cost of fuel. The 2000
increase was due to increased generation and a higher average cost of fuel.

    In 2001, expenses related to purchased power from non-affiliates decreased
26.4 percent, while expenses related to purchased power from affiliates
increased 5.7 percent which, in total, resulted in a 11.1 percent decrease when
compared to 2000. This decrease in purchased power is primarily due to the
commercial operation of Plant Daniel Combined Cycle Units 3 and 4 and the
expiration of non-affiliated purchase power contracts in 2000. Sales and
purchases among the Company and its affiliates will vary from period to period
depending on demand and the availability and variable production cost of each
generating unit in the Southern Company electric system.

    The amount and sources of generation and the average cost of fuel per net
kilowatt-hour generated were as follows:

                                        2001     2000      1999

- ----------------------------------------------------------------

    Other operation expenses increased 17.2 percent in 2001 primarily due to an
increase in other production expenses due to the commercial operation of Plant
Daniel Combined Cycle Units 3 and 4. In 2000, other operation expense decreased
8.2 percent primarily due to a decrease in administrative and general expenses.
Maintenance expense in 2001 increased primarily due to the commercial operation
of Plant Daniel Combined Cycle Units 3 and 4, while maintenance expense in 2000
increased primarily due to additional scheduled maintenance. Depreciation and
amortization expense increased 7.6 percent in 2001 due to a growth in plant
investment and the amortization of the Company's regulatory asset related to its
Environmental Compliance Overview Plan (ECO Plan). In 2000, depreciation expense
increased slightly due to growth in plant investment and new depreciation rates,
which became effective January 2000.

    Taxes other than income taxes decreased 7.6 percent in 2001 due to reduced
ad valorem taxes related to a change in the tax rate. These taxes increased 1.7
percent in 2000 due to higher municipal franchise taxes resulting from higher
retail revenues. Interest on long-term debt decreased in 2001 as a result of
lower interest rates on debt outstanding.

Effects of Inflation

The Company is subject to rate regulation and income tax laws that are based on
the recovery of historical costs. Therefore, inflation creates an economic loss
because the Company is recovering its costs of investments in dollars that have
less purchasing power. While the inflation rate has been relatively low in
recent years, it continues to have an adverse effect on the Company because of
the large investment in utility plant with long economic lives. Conventional
accounting for historical costs does not recognize this economic loss nor the
partially offsetting gain that arises through financing facilities with
fixed-money obligations, such as long-term debt and preferred securities. Any
recognition of inflation by regulatory authorities is reflected in the rate of
return allowed.

Future Earnings Potential

General

The results of continuing operations for the past three years are not
necessarily indicative of future earnings potential. The level of the Company's

                                     II-151

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Mississippi Power Company 2001 Annual Report


future earnings depends on numerous factors ranging from weather to energy sales
growth to a less regulated and more competitive environment. Expenses are
subject to constant review and cost control programs. The Company is also
maximizing the utility of invested capital and minimizing the need for
additional capital by refinancing outstanding obligations, managing the size of
its fuel stockpile, raising generating plant availability and efficiency, and
aggressively controlling its construction budget.

    The Company currently operates as a vertically integrated utility providing
electricity to customers within its traditional service area located in
southeastern Mississippi. Prices for electricity provided by the Company to
retail customers are set by the Mississippi Public Service Commission (MPSC)
under cost-based regulatory principles. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC) regulates the Company's wholesale rate schedules, power sales contracts,
and transmission facilities.

    Operating revenues will be affected by any changes in rates under the
Performance Evaluation Plan (PEP) -- the Company's performance based ratemaking
plan -- and the ECO Plan. PEP has proven to be a stabilizing force on electric
rates, with only moderate changes in rates taking place. The ECO Plan provides
for recovery of costs (including costs of capital) associated with environmental
projects approved by the MPSC, most of which are required to comply with Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990 (Clean Air Act) and the regulations thereunder. The
ECO Plan is operated independently of PEP. Compliance costs related to the Clean
Air Act could affect earnings if such costs cannot be recovered. The Company
filed its 2001 ECO Plan in January 2001 which was approved, as filed, by the
Mississippi PSC on March 7, 2001, and resulted in a slight increase in customer
prices. The Company filed its 2002 ECO Plan in January 2002, which, if approved
as filed, will result in a slight increase in rates. See Note 3 to the financial
statements under "Litigation and Regulatory Matters" for additional information.
The Clean Air Act and other important environmental items are discussed later
under "Environmental Matters."

    In August 2001, the Company filed a request with the MPSC for a retail rate
increase of approximately $46 million. In order to consider the Company's
request, the MPSC suspended the semi-annual evaluations under PEP. In December
2001, after a full investigation and hearing on the Company's request, the MPSC
approved an increase of approximately $39 million, which took effect in January
2002. Additionally, the MPSC ordered the Company to reactivate the semi-annual
evaluations under PEP, beginning in February 2003 for the year 2002. PEP will
remain in effect until the MPSC modifies, suspends, or terminates the plan. The
MPSC also set for hearing in 2002 a review of the return on equity models used
in PEP in setting the Company's authorized return on equity. This proceeding
will conclude in 2002, so that changes to the PEP return on equity models, if
any, may be incorporated into the February 2003 PEP evaluation filing for the
period ending December 31, 2002. The outcome of this matter and any future
impact to the Company cannot now be determined.

    In February 2002, the Company reached an agreement with certain of its
wholesale customers to increase its wholesale tariff rates effective June 2002.
The agreement results in an annual increase of approximately $10.5 million and
the adoption of an Energy Cost Management clause similar to the one approved by
the Company's retail jurisdiction (see Note 1 to the financials). In addition,
the Company and its customers agreed that neither party would seek a unilateral
change to the new rates prior to December 31, 2003, except for changes due to
the operation of the fuel adjustment and energy cost management clauses. The
Company and its customers will file the agreement with the FERC for its
approval. Though the FERC has accepted settlement agreements as filed in the
past, the ultimate outcome of this matter before the FERC cannot now be
determined.

    In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No.
87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions, the Company recorded non-cash pension
income of approximately $3.2 million in 2001. Future pension income is dependent
on several factors including trust earnings and changes to the plan. For the
Company, pension income is a component of the regulated rates and does not have
a significant effect on net income. For more information, see Note 2 to the
financial statements.

    The Company is involved in various matters being litigated. See Note 3 to
the financial statements for information regarding material issues that could
possibly affect future earnings.

Mississippi Power Company 2001 Annual Report


    Compliance costs related to current and future environmental laws,
regulations, and litigation could affect earnings if such costs are not fully
recovered. The Clean Air Act and other important environmental items are
discussed later under "Environmental Matters."

    Future earnings in the near term will depend upon growth in energy sales,
which is subject to a number of factors. These factors include weather,
competition, changes in contracts with neighboring utilities, energy
conservation practiced by customers, the elasticity of demand, and the rate of
economic growth in the Company's service area. The Company anticipates somewhat
slower growth in energy sales as the tourism industry stabilizes within its
service area. In addition to tourism, the healthcare and retail trade sectors
will provide most of the anticipated energy growth for the commercial class of
customers, while shipbuilding, chemicals, and the U.S. government will provide
much of the basis for anticipated growth in the industrial sector.

Industry Restructuring

The electric utility industry in the United States is continuing to evolve as a
result of regulatory and competitive factors. Among the primary agents of change
has been the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Energy Act). The Energy Act allows
independent power producers (IPPs) to access a utility's transmission network in
order to sell electricity to other utilities. This enhances the incentive for
IPPs to build cogeneration plants for a utility's large industrial and
commercial customers and sell energy generation to other utilities. Also,
electricity sales for resale rates are affected by wholesale transmission access
and numerous potential new energy suppliers, including power marketers and
brokers.

    Although the Energy Act does not permit retail customer access, it was a
major catalyst for the current restructuring and consolidation taking place
within the utility industry. Numerous federal and state initiatives are in
various stages to promote wholesale and retail competition. Among other things,
these initiatives allow customers to choose their electricity provider. As these
initiatives materialize, the structure of the utility industry could radically
change. In May 2000, the MPSC ordered that its docket reviewing restructuring of
the electric industry in the State of Mississippi be suspended. The MPSC found
that retail competition may not be in the public interest at this time, and
ordered that no further formal hearings would be held on this subject. It found
that the current regulatory structure produced reliable low cost power and
"should not be changed without clear and convincing demonstration that change
would be in the public interest." The MPSC will continue to monitor retail and
wholesale restructuring activities throughout the United States and reserves its
right to order further formal hearings on the matter should new evidence
demonstrate that retail competition would be in the public interest and all
customers could receive a reduction in the total cost of their electric service.
If the MPSC decides to hold future restructuring hearings on this matter,
enactment would require numerous issues to be resolved, including significant
ones relating to recovery of any stranded investments, full cost recovery of
energy produced, and other issues related to the energy crisis that occurred in
California. As a result of that crisis, many states have either discontinued or
delayed implementation of initiatives involving retail deregulation.

    Continuing to be a low-cost producer could provide significant opportunities
to increase market share and profitability in markets that evolve with changing
regulation. Conversely, unless the Company remains a low-cost producer and
provides quality service, the Company's energy sales growth could be limited,
and this could significantly erode earnings.

    In December 1999, the FERC issued its final ruling on Regional Transmission
Organizations (RTOs). The order encourages utilities owning transmission systems
to form RTOs on a voluntary basis. Southern Company and its operating companies,
including the Company, have submitted a series of status reports informing the
FERC of progress toward the development of a Southeastern RTO. In these status
reports, Southern Company explained that it is developing a for-profit RTO known
as SeTrans with a number of non-jurisdictional cooperative and public power
entities. Recently, Entergy Corporation and Cleco Power joined the SeTrans
development process. In January 2002, the sponsors of SeTrans held a public
meeting to form a Stakeholder Advisory Committee, which will participate in the
development of the RTO. Southern Company continues to work with the other
sponsors to develop the SeTrans RTO. While the creation of SeTrans is not
expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements, the
outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Accounting Policies

Critical Policies

The Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements. The Company's most critical accounting policy involves
rate regulation. The Company is subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No.
71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. In the event that
a portion of the Company's operation is no longer subject to these provisions,
the Company would be required to write off related regulatory assets and
liabilities that are not specifically recoverable and determine if any other
assets have been impaired. See Note 1 to the financial statements under
"Regulatory Assets and Liabilities" for additional information.

    Additionally, the Company accounts for its lease agreement with Escatawpa
Funding, Limited Partnership (Escatawpa) as an operating lease. Under this
agreement, Escatawpa, a special purpose entity, is owner-lessor of the
combined-cycle generating units at the Company's Plant Daniel. The Company does
not consolidate this entity since parties unrelated to the Company have made
substantive residual equity capital investments in excess of 3 percent. The FASB
has recently issued a draft interpretation that addresses issues related to
identifying and accounting for certain special purpose entities. One proposed
change would increase the 3 percent outside equity requirement to 10 percent.
This interpretation is in draft form; therefore, final conclusions may differ
from the draft. However, a change to a ten percent equity requirement could
result in the Company having to change its accounting for this lease agreement,
including having to consolidate the leased asset and related debt. See Note 4 to
the financial statements where the lease agreement and the Company's related
obligations are discussed.

New Accounting Standards

Effective January 2001, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. Statement No. 133
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and
for hedging activities. This statement requires that certain derivative
instruments be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability
measured at fair value, and that changes in the fair value be recognized
currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. See
Note 1 to the financial statements under "Financial Instruments" for additional
information. The impact on the Company's net income in 2001 was not material. An
additional interpretation of Statement No. 133 will result in a change -
effective April 1, 2002 - in accounting for certain contracts related to fuel
supplies that contain quantity options. These contracts will be accounted for as
derivatives and marked to market. However, due to the existence of the Company's
cost-based fuel recovery clause, this change is not expected to have a material
impact on net income.

   In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for
acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 17. Statement No. 142 addresses how intangible
assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets -- but not
those acquired in a business combination -- should be accounted for upon
acquisition and on an ongoing basis. Goodwill and intangible assets that have
indefinite useful lives will not be amortized but rather will be tested at least
annually for impairment. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives will
continue to be amortized over their useful lives, which are no longer limited to
40 years. The Company adopted Statement No.142 in January 2002 with no material
impact on the financial statements.

   Also in June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143, Asset Retirement
Obligations, which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal
obligations associated with retiring assets, including decommissioning of
nuclear plants. The liability for an asset's future retirement must be recorded
in the period in which the liability is incurred. The cost must be capitalized
as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful
life. Changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time will be
recognized as operating expenses. Statement No. 143 must be adopted by January
1, 2003. The Company has not yet quantified the impact of adopting Statement No.
143 on its financial statements.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The principal change in the Company's financial condition during 2001 was the
addition of approximately $61 million to utility plant. Funding for these


                                      II-154

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily from operations.
The Statements of Cash Flows provide additional details.

Credit Rating Risk

The Company does not have any credit agreements that would require material
changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating
downgrade. There are certain fixed-price physical gas purchase contracts that
could require collateral - but not accelerated payment - in the event of a
credit rating change to below investment grade; however, at December 31, 2001,
this exposure was immaterial.

Exposure to Market Risks

Due to cost-based rate regulations, the Company has limited exposure to market
volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity.
To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the
Company enters into fixed price contracts for the purchase and sale of
electricity through the wholesale electricity market. Realized gains and losses
are recognized in the income statements as incurred. At December 31, 2001,
exposure from these activities was not material to the Company's financial
statements. Also, based on the Company's overall variable rate long-term debt
exposure at December 31, 2001, a near-term 100 basis point change in interest
rates would not materially affect the Company's financial statements. Fair value
of changes in energy trading contracts and year-end valuations are as follows:

    For additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements under
"Financial Instruments."

    In June 2001, the MPSC approved the Company's request to implement an Energy
Cost Management Clause (ECM). ECM, among other things, allows the Company to
utilize financial instruments to hedge its fuel commitments. Amounts paid or
received as a result of the use of these instruments are recognized as fuel
related expense and are recovered or credited through the ECM factor calculated
annually and applied to customer billings. The Company records the fair value of
these financial instruments (cash flow hedges) in its financial statements in
accordance with FASB Statement No. 133 with a related regulatory asset or
liability recorded under the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71.

    As of December 31, 2001, the Company had financial instruments related to
natural gas commodity contracts that had a contract value of approximately $31
million and $30 million expiring in 2002 and 2003, respectively. The market
values as of December 31, 2001 for these contracts were approximately $27
million and $30 million, respectively. The amounts settled and recognized in the
financial statements for 2001 were not material. Currently, the Company does not
have any fixed price natural gas commitments, either physical or financial,
beyond 2003.

Sources of Capital

To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the Company had at December 31,
2001 approximately $18.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately
$114.5 million of unused committed credit agreements.

    The Company may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company
subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper at the request and for
the benefit of the Company and the other Southern Company operating companies.

                                     II-155



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Mississippi Power Company 2001 Annual Report


At December 31, 2001, the Company had outstanding $16 million of commercial
paper.

    It is anticipated that the funds required for construction and other
purposes, including compliance with environmental regulations, will be derived
from sources similar to those used in the past. These sources were primarily the
issuance of first mortgage bonds and preferred securities, in addition to
pollution control revenue bonds issued for the Company's benefit by public
authorities. The Company also utilized unsecured debt and lease arrangements in
the past as well.

    The Company has no restrictions on the amounts of unsecured indebtedness it
may incur. However, the Company is required to meet certain coverage
requirements specified in its mortgage indenture and corporate charter to issue
new first mortgage bonds and preferred stock. The Company's coverage ratios are
high enough to permit, at present interest rate levels, any foreseeable security
sales. The amount of securities which the Company will be permitted to issue in
the future will depend upon market conditions and other factors prevailing at
that time.

Financing Activity

In May 2001, the Company received a $70 million capital contribution which was
used to retire $35 million of 6.60 percent first mortgage bonds, $20 million of
series C variable-rate senior notes, and $15 million in short term debt. The
Company plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and replace these securities with lower-cost capital. See the
Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

    Composite financing rates decreased for the year 2001 when compared to 2000
and 1999. As of year-end, the composite rates were as follows:

                                   2001       2000      1999
                                -------------------------------

 Composite interest rate on
   preferred securities           7.75%      7.75%     7.75%
 --------------------------------------------------------------

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements

In 1999, the Company signed an Agreement for Lease and a Lease Agreement with
Escatawpa. These agreements called for the Company to design and construct, as
agent for Escatawpa, a 1,064 megawatt natural gas combined cycle facility at the
Company's Plant Victor J. Daniel Facility (Facility). In May 2001, the Facility
was completed and placed into commercial operation. Effective with commercial
operation of the Facility, the initial 10-year lease term under its lease
arrangement for the Facility with Escatawpa began. The completion cost was
approximately $370 million. The lease provides for a residual value guarantee
(approximately 71% of the completion cost) by the Company that is due upon
termination of the lease in certain circumstances. The lease also includes
purchase and renewal options. Upon termination of the lease, at the Company's
option, the Company may either exercise its purchase option or the Facility can
be sold to a third party. The Company expects that the fair market value of the
leased Facility would substantially reduce or eliminate the Company's payment
under the residual value guarantee. In 2001, the Company recognized
approximately $18 million in lease expense. See Note 4 to the financial
statements for additional information.

Capital Structure

At year-end 2001, the Company's ratio of common equity to total capitalization,
excluding long-term debt due within one year, increased from 48.1 percent in
2000 to 62.1 percent. The Company plans to replace the long-term debt due within
one year with new issues.

Capital Requirements for Construction

The Company's projected construction expenditures for the next three years total
$241 million ($84 million in 2002, $72 million in 2003, and $85 million in
2004). The major emphasis within the construction program will be on the upgrade
of existing facilities.

    Revisions to projected construction expenditures may be necessary because of
factors such as changes in business conditions, revised load projections, the
availability and cost of capital, changes in environmental regulations, and
alternatives such as leasing.

Mississippi Power Company 2001 Annual Report


Other Capital Requirements

In addition to the funds required for the Company's construction program,
approximately $115 million will be required by the end of 2003 for present
sinking fund requirements and maturities of long-term debt. The Company plans to
continue, when economically feasible, to retire higher cost debt and preferred
stock and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions
permit.

    These capital requirements, lease obligations, and purchase commitments -
discussed in notes 4 and 8 to the financial statements - are as follows:

Environmental Matters

On November 3, 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), brought a civil
action in the U.S. District Court against Alabama Power Company, Georgia Power
Company, and the system service company. The complaint alleges violations of the
New Source Review provisions of the Clean Air Act with respect to five
coal-fired generating facilities in Alabama and Georgia. The civil action
requests penalties and injunctive relief, including an order requiring the
installation of the best available control technology at the affected units. The
EPA concurrently issued to the operating companies a notice of violation related
to 10 generating facilities, which includes the five facilities mentioned
previously, and the Company's plants Watson and Greene County. In early 2000,
the EPA filed a motion to amend its complaint to add the violations alleged in
its notice of violation, and to add Gulf Power, Savannah Electric, and the
Company as defendants. The complaint and notice of violation are similar to
those brought against and issued to several other electric utilities. These
complaints and notices of violation allege that the utilities had failed to
secure necessary permits or install additional pollution control equipment when
performing maintenance and construction at coal burning plants constructed or
under construction prior to 1978. The U.S. District Court in Georgia granted
Alabama Power's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction in Georgia and
granted the system service company's motion to dismiss on the grounds that it
neither owned nor operated the generating units involved in the proceedings. The
court granted the EPA's motion to add Savannah Electric as a defendant, but it
denied the motion to add Gulf Power and the Company based on lack of
jurisdiction over those companies. The court directed the EPA to re-file its
amended complaint limiting claims to those brought against Georgia Power and
Savannah Electric. The EPA re-filed those claims as directed by the court. Also,
the EPA re-filed its claims against Alabama Power in U.S. District Court in
Alabama. It has not re-filed against Gulf Power, the system service company, or
the Company.

     The Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Savannah Electric cases have been
stayed since the spring of 2001, pending a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Eleventh Circuit in the appeal of a very similar New Source Review
enforcement action against the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). The TVA case
involves many of the same legal issues raised by the actions against Alabama
Power, Georgia Power, and Savannah Electric. Because the outcome of the TVA case
could have a significant adverse impact on Alabama Power and Georgia Power, both
companies are parties to that case as well. The U.S. District Court in Alabama
has indicated that it will revisit the issue of a continued stay in April 2002.
The U.S. District Court in Georgia is currently considering a motion by the EPA
to reopen the Georgia case. Georgia Power and Savannah Electric have opposed
that motion.

     The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA's
regulations and interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took
place. The Clean Air Act authorizes civil penalties of up to $27,500 per day per
violation at each generating unit. Prior to January 30, 1997, the penalty was

                                      II-157

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Mississippi Power Company 2001 Annual Report


$25,000 per day. An adverse outcome of this matter could require substantial
capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and possibly require
payment of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of
operations, cash flows and possibly financial condition unless such costs can be
recovered through regulated rates.

    In November 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (Clean Air Act) were
signed into law. Title IV of the Clean Air Act -- the acid rain compliance
provision of the law -- significantly affected Southern Company. Reductions in
sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from fossil-fired generating plants
were required in two phases. Phase I compliance began in 1995.

    Southern Company achieved Phase I compliance at its affected plants by
primarily switching to low-sulfur coal and with some equipment upgrades.
Construction expenditures for Phase I nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide
emissions compliance totaled approximately $65 million for the Company.

    Phase II sulfur dioxide compliance was required in 2000. Southern Company
used emission allowances and fuel switching to comply with Phase II
requirements. Also, equipment to control nitrogen oxide emissions was installed
on additional system fossil-fired units as necessary to meet Phase II limits and
ozone non-attainment requirements for metropolitan Atlanta through 2000. Phase
II compliance did not have a material impact on the Company.

    The Company's ECO Plan is designed to allow recovery of costs of compliance
with the Clean Air Act, as well as other environmental statutes and regulations.
The MPSC reviews environmental projects and the Company's environmental policy
through the ECO Plan. Under the ECO Plan, any increase in the annual revenue
requirement is limited to 2 percent of retail revenues. The Company's management
believes that the ECO Plan provides for recovery of the Clean Air Act costs. See
Note 3 to the financial statements under "Environmental Compliance Overview
Plan" for additional information.

    A significant portion of costs related to the acid rain and ozone
non-attainment provisions of the Clean Air Act is expected to be recovered
through existing ratemaking provisions. However, there can be no assurance that
all Clean Air Act costs will be recovered.

    In July 1997, the EPA revised the national ambient air quality standards for
ozone and fine particulate matter. This revision made the standards
significantly more stringent. In the subsequent litigation of these standards,
the U.S. Supreme Court found the EPA's implementation program for the new ozone
standard unlawful and remanded it to the EPA. In addition, the Federal District
of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals is considering other legal challenges to
these standards. A court decision is expected in the spring of 2002. If the
standards are eventually upheld, implementation could be required by 2007 to
2010.

    In September 1998, the EPA issued regional nitrogen oxide reduction rules to
the states for implementation. Compliance is required by May 31, 2004 for most
states including Alabama. For Georgia, further rulemaking was required, and
proposed compliance was delayed until May 1, 2005. The final rules affect 21
states that do not include Mississippi. The EPA is presently evaluating whether
or not to bring an additional 15 states including Mississippi, under this
regional nitrogen oxide rule.

    In December 2000, having completed its utility studies for mercury and other
hazardous air pollutants (HAPS), the EPA issued a determination that an emission
control program for mercury and, perhaps, other HAPS is warranted. The program
is being developed under the Maximum Achievable Control Technology provisions of
the Clean Air Act, and the regulations are scheduled to be finalized by the end
of 2004 with implementation to take place around 2007. In January 2001, the EPA
proposed guidance for the determination of Best Available Retrofit Technology
(BART) emission controls under the Regional Haze Regulations. Installation of
BART controls is expected to take place in 2010. Litigation of the Regional Haze
Regulations, including the BART provisions, is ongoing in the Federal District
of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals. A court decision is expected in mid-2002.

    Implementation of the final state rules for these initiatives could require
substantial further reductions in nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide and
reductions in mercury and other HAPS emissions from fossil-fired generating
facilities and other industries in these states. Additional compliance costs and
capital expenditures resulting from the implementation of these rules and

standards cannot be determined until the results of legal challenges are known,
and the states have adopted their final rules.

    In October 1997, the EPA issued regulations setting forth requirements for
Compliance Assurance Monitoring (CAM) in its state and federal operating permit
programs. These regulations were amended by the EPA in March 2001 in response to
a court order resolving challenges to the rules brought by environmental groups
and industry. Generally, this rule affects the operation and maintenance of
electrostatic precipitators and could involve significant additional ongoing
expense.

    The EPA and state environmental regulatory agencies are reviewing and
evaluating various other matters including: control strategies to reduce
regional haze; limits on pollutant discharges to impaired waters; cooling water
intake restrictions; and hazardous waste disposal requirements. The impact of
any new standards will depend on the development and implementation of
applicable regulations.

    The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that
cover the handling and disposal of hazardous waste. Under these various laws and
regulations, the Company could incur costs to clean up properties currently or
previously owned. Upon identifying potential sites, the Company conducts
studies, when possible, to determine the extent of any required cleanup. Should
remediation be determined to be probable, reasonable estimates of costs to clean
up such sites are developed and recognized in the financial statements.

    Several major pieces of environmental legislation are being considered for
reauthorization or amendment by Congress. These include: the Clean Air Act; the
Clean Water Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; and the Endangered
Species Act. Changes to these laws could affect many areas of the Company's
operations. The full impact of any such changes cannot be determined at this
time.

    Compliance with possible additional legislation related to global climate
change, electromagnetic fields, and other environmental and health concerns
could significantly affect the Company. The impact of new legislation -- if any
- -- will depend on the subsequent development and implementation of applicable
regulations. In addition, the potential exists for liability as the result of
lawsuits alleging damages caused by electromagnetic fields.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Mississippi Power Company 2001 Annual Report


1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES

General

Mississippi Power Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company,
which is the parent company of five operating companies, a system service
company, Southern Communications Services (Southern LINC), Southern Nuclear
Operating Company (Southern Nuclear), Southern Power Company (Southern Power),
and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The operating companies -- Alabama
Power Company, Georgia Power Company, Gulf Power Company, Mississippi Power
Company, and Savannah Electric and Power Company -- provide electric service in
four southeastern states. Contracts among the operating companies -- related to
jointly owned generating facilities, interconnecting transmission lines, and the
exchange of electric power -- are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) and/or the Securities and Exchange Commission. The system
service company provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and
subsidiary companies. Southern LINC provides digital wireless communications
services to the operating companies and also markets these services to the
public within the Southeast. Southern Nuclear provides services to Southern
Company's nuclear power plants. Southern Power was established in 2001 to
construct, own, and manage Southern Company's competitive generation assets and
sell electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market.

    Southern Company is registered as a holding company under the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA). Both the Company and its subsidiaries are
subject to the regulatory provisions of the PUHCA. The Company is also subject
to regulation by the FERC and the Mississippi Public Service Commission (MPSC).
The Company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States and complies with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by the
respective commissions. The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the
use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates.

    Prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been
reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.

Affiliate Transactions

The Company has an agreement with the system service company under which the
following services are rendered to the Company at cost: general and design
engineering, purchasing, accounting and statistical, finance and treasury, tax,
information resources, marketing, auditing, insurance and pension
administration, human resources, systems and procedures, and other services with
respect to business and operations and power pool operations. Costs for these
services amounted to $44.1 million, $46.2 million, and $45.5 million during
2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

The Company is subject to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
Regulation. Regulatory assets represent probable future revenues to the Company
associated with certain costs that are expected to be recovered from customers
through the ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future
reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be credited
to customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory assets and (liabilities)
reflected in the Balance Sheets at December 31 relate to the following:

NOTES (continued)
Mississippi Power Company 2001 Annual Report


    In the event that a portion of the Company's operations is no longer subject
to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, the Company would be required to
write off related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically
recoverable through regulated rates. In addition, the Company would be required
to determine if any impairment to other assets exists, including plant, and
write down the assets, if impaired, to their fair value.

Revenues and Fuel Costs

The Company currently operates as a vertically integrated utility providing
electricity to retail customers within its traditional service area located
within the state of Mississippi and to wholesale customers in the Southeast.

    Revenues are recognized as services are rendered. Unbilled revenues are
accrued at the end of each fiscal period. The Company's retail and wholesale
rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, the
energy component of purchased power costs, and certain other costs. Retail rates
also include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in costs for ad
valorem taxes, certain qualifying environmental costs, and energy cost
management activities. Revenues are adjusted for differences between actual
allowable amounts and the amounts included in rates.

    The Company has a diversified base of customers. No single customer or
industry comprises 10 percent or more of revenues. For all periods presented,
uncollectible accounts continued to average less than 1 percent of revenues.

Depreciation

Depreciation of the original cost of plant in service is provided primarily by
using composite straight-line rates, which approximated 3.5 percent in 2001, 3.5
percent in 2000, and 3.3 percent in 1999. When property subject to depreciation
is retired or otherwise disposed of in the normal course of business, its
original cost -- together with the cost of removal, less salvage -- is charged
to accumulated depreciation. Minor items of property included in the original
cost of the plant are retired when the related property unit is retired.
Depreciation expense includes an amount for the expected cost of removal of
facilities.

Income Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes
and provides deferred income taxes for all significant income tax temporary
differences. Investment tax credits utilized are deferred and amortized to
income over the average lives of the related property.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost. Original cost
includes: materials; labor; minor items of property; appropriate administrative
and general costs; payroll-related costs such as taxes, pensions, and other
benefits; and the estimated cost of funds used during construction, if
applicable. The cost of maintenance, repairs, and replacement of minor items of
property is charged to maintenance expense except for the maintenance of coal
cars and a portion of the railway track maintenance, which are charged to fuel
stock. The cost of replacements of property -- exclusive of minor items of
property -- is capitalized.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the Statements of Cash Flows, temporary cash investments are
considered cash equivalents. Temporary cash investments are securities with
original maturities of 90 days or less.

Financial Instruments

Effective January 2001, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. The 2001 impact
on net income was immaterial. The Company uses derivative financial instruments
to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and certain commodity
prices. Gains and losses on qualifying hedges are deferred and recognized either
as income or as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item when the
transaction occurs. The Company is exposed to losses related to financial
instruments in the event of counterparties' nonperformance. The Company has
established controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of
counterparties in order to mitigate the Company's exposure to counterparty
credit risk.

    The Company and its affiliates, through the system service company acting as
their agent, enters into commodity related forward and option contracts to limit


                                     II-168

NOTES (continued)
Mississippi Power Company 2001 Annual Report


exposure to changing prices on certain fuel purchases and electricity purchases
and sales. Substantially all of these bulk energy purchases and sales contracts
meet the definition of a derivative under FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. In many cases, these fuel and
electricity contracts qualify for normal purchase and sale exceptions under
Statement No. 133 and are accounted for under the accrual method. Other
contracts qualify as cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions, resulting in
the deferral of related gains and losses, and are recorded in other
comprehensive income until the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness is
recognized currently in net income. Contracts that do not qualify for the normal
purchase and sale exception and that do not meet the hedge requirements are
marked to market through current period income.

    In June 2001, the MPSC approved the Company's request to implement an Energy
Cost Management Clause (ECM). ECM, among other things, allows the Company to
utilize financial instruments that are used to hedge its fuel commitments.
Amounts paid or received as a result of financial settlement of these
instruments are classified as fuel expense and are included in the ECM factor
applied to customer billings. The Company records the fair value of these
financial instruments (cash flow hedges) in its financial statements in
accordance with FASB Statement No. 133 with a related regulatory asset or
liability recorded under the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71.

    As of December 31, 2001, the Company had financial instruments related to
natural gas commodity contracts that had a contract value of approximately $31
million and $30 million expiring in 2002 and 2003, respectively. The market
values as of December 31, 2001 for these contracts were approximately $27
million and $30 million, respectively. The amounts settled and recognized in the
financial statements for 2001 were not material. Currently, the Company does not
have any fixed price natural gas commitments, either physical or financial,
beyond 2003.

    The Company's other financial instruments for which the carrying amount did
not equal fair value at December 31 were as follows:

                                      Carrying        Fair
                                       Amount        Value
                                   ------------------------
                                           (in millions)
Long-term debt:
 At December 31, 2001                   $314          $309
 At December 31, 2000                   $371          $362
Capital trust preferred
  securities:
 At December 31, 2001                   $ 35          $ 35
 At December 31, 2000                   $ 35          $ 34
- -----------------------------------------------------------

    The fair values for long-term debt and preferred securities were based on
either closing market price or closing price of comparable instruments.

Materials and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include the cost of transmission,
distribution, and generating plant materials. Materials are charged to inventory
when purchased and then expensed or capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when
used or installed.

Provision for Property Damage

The Company is self-insured for the cost of storm, fire, and other uninsured
casualty damage to its property, including transmission and distribution
facilities. As permitted by regulatory authorities, the Company accrues for the
cost of such damage by charging expense and crediting an accumulated provision.
The cost of repairing damage resulting from such events that individually exceed
$50 thousand is charged to the accumulated provision. In 1999, an order from the
MPSC increased the maximum Property Damage Reserve from $18 million to $23
million and allows an annual accrual of up to $4.6 million. In 2001, the Company
provided for such costs by charges to income of $2.5 million. In 2000 and 1999,
the Company provided for such costs by charges to income of $3.5 million and
$4.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2001, the accumulated provision
amounted to $4.0 million.

2.  RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company has a defined benefit, trusteed, pension plan that covers
substantially all employees. The Company provides certain medical care and life
insurance benefits for retired employees. Substantially all these employees may
become eligible for such benefits when they retire. The Company funds trusts to

NOTES (continued)

the extent deductible under federal income tax regulations or the extent
required by regulatory authorities. In late 2000, the Company adopted several
pension and postretirement benefits plan changes that had the effect of
increasing benefits to both current and future retirees. The measurement date
for plan assets and obligations is September 30 for each year.

Pension Plan

Changes during the year in the projected benefit obligations and in the fair
value of plan assets were as follows:

percent for 2001, decreasing gradually to 5.25 percent through the year 2010 and
remaining at that level thereafter. An annual increase or decrease in the
assumed medical care cost trend rate of 1 percent would affect the accumulated
benefit obligation and the service and interest cost components at December 31,
2001 as follows:

Employee Savings Plan

The Company also sponsors a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering
substantially all employees. The Company provides a 75 percent matching
contribution up to 6 percent of an employee's base salary. Total matching
contributions made to the plan for the years 2001, 2000, and 1999 were $2.5
million, $2.3 million, and $2.2 million, respectively.

3. LITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS

General

The Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the
ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, after consultation
with legal counsel, the ultimate disposition of these matters is not expected to
have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition.

Environmental Litigation

On November 3, 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil
action in the U.S. District Court in Georgia against Alabama Power, Georgia
Power and the system service company. The complaint alleges violations of the
New Source Review provisions of the Clean Air Act with respect to five
coal-fired generating facilities in Alabama and Georgia. The civil action
requests penalties and injunctive relief, including an order requiring the
installation of the best available control technology at the affected units. The
Clean Air Act authorizes civil penalties of up to $27,500 per day per violation
at each generating unit. Prior to January 30, 1997, the penalty was $25,000 per
day.

     The EPA concurrently issued to the operating companies a notice of
violation related to 10 generating facilities, which includes the five
facilities mentioned previously, and the Company's plants Watson and Greene
County. In early 2000, the EPA filed a motion to amend its complaint to add the
violations alleged in its notice of violation and to add Gulf Power, Savannah


                                     II-171

NOTES (continued)
Mississippi Power Company 2001 Annual Report


Electric and the Company as defendants. The complaint and notice of violation
are similar to those brought against and issued to several other electric
utilities. These complaints and notices of violation allege that the utilities
had failed to secure necessary permits or install additional pollution control
equipment when performing maintenance and construction at coal burning plants
constructed or under construction prior to 1978. The U.S. District Court in
Georgia granted Alabama Power's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and
granted the system service company's motion to dismiss on the grounds that it
neither owned nor operated the generating units involved in the proceedings. The
court granted the EPA's motion to add Savannah Electric as a defendant, but it
denied the motion to add Gulf Power and the Company based on lack of
jurisdiction over those companies. The court directed the EPA to re-file its
amended complaint limiting claims to those brought against Georgia Power and
Savannah Electric. The EPA re-filed those claims as directed by the court. Also,
the EPA re-filed its claims against Alabama Power in U.S. District Court in
Alabama. It has not re-filed against Gulf Power, the system service company, or
the Company.

     The Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Savannah Electric cases have been
stayed since the spring of 2001, pending a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Eleventh Circuit in the appeal of a very similar New Source Review
enforcement action against the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). The TVA case
involves many of the same legal issues raised by the actions against Alabama
Power, Georgia Power, and Savannah Electric. Because the outcome of the TVA case
could have a significant adverse impact on Alabama Power and Georgia Power, both
companies are parties to that case as well. The U.S. District Court in Alabama
has indicated that it will revisit the issue of a continued stay in April 2002.
The U.S. District Court in Georgia is currently considering a motion by the EPA
to reopen the Georgia case. Georgia Power and Savannah Electric have opposed
that motion.

     The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA's
regulations and interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took
place. An adverse outcome of this matter could require substantial capital
expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly require
payment of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of
operations, cash flows and possibly financial condition unless such costs can be
recovered through regulated rates.

Retail Rate Adjustment Plans

The Company's retail base rates are set under a Performance Evaluation Plan
(PEP) approved by the MPSC in 1994. PEP was designed with the objective that the
plan would reduce the impact of rate changes on the customer and provide
incentives for the Company to keep customer prices low. PEP includes a mechanism
for rate adjustments based on the Company's ability to maintain low rates for
customers and on the Company's performance as measured by three indicators that
emphasize price and service to the customer. PEP provides for semiannual
evaluations of the Company's performance-based return on investment. Any change
in rates is limited to 2 percent of retail revenues per evaluation period.

     In August 2001, the Company filed a request with the MPSC for a retail rate
increase of approximately $46 million. In order to consider the Company's
request, the MPSC suspended the semi-annual evaluations under PEP. In December
2001, after a full investigation and hearing on the Company's request, the MPSC
approved an increase of approximately $39 million, which took effect in January
2002. Additionally, the MPSC ordered the Company to reactivate the semi-annual
evaluations under PEP, beginning in February 2003 for the year 2002. PEP will
remain in effect until the MPSC modifies, suspends, or terminates the plan. The
MPSC also set for hearing in 2002 a review of the return on equity models used
in PEP in setting the Company's authorized return on equity. This proceeding
will conclude in 2002, so that changes to the PEP return on equity models, if
any, may be incorporated into the February 2003 PEP evaluation filing for the
period ending December 31, 2002. The outcome of this matter and any future
impact to the Company cannot now be determined.

Environmental Compliance Overview Plan

The MPSC approved the Company's Environmental Compliance Overview Plan (ECO
Plan) in 1992. The ECO Plan establishes procedures to facilitate the MPSC's
overview of the Company's environmental strategy and provides for recovery of
costs (including costs of capital) associated with environmental projects
approved by the MPSC. Under the ECO Plan, any increase in the annual revenue


                                     II-172

NOTES (continued)
Mississippi Power Company 2001 Annual Report


requirement is limited to 2 percent of retail revenues. However, the ECO Plan
also provides for carryover of any amount over the 2 percent limit into the next
year's revenue requirement. The Company conducts studies, when possible, to
determine the extent of any required environmental remediation. Should such
remediation be determined to be probable, reasonable estimates of costs to clean
up such sites are developed and recognized in the financial statements. The
Company recovers such costs under the ECO Plan as they are incurred, as provided
for in the Company's 1995 ECO Plan Order. The Company filed its 2002 ECO Plan in
January, which, if approved as filed, will result in a slight increase in
customer prices.

Approval for New Capacity

In January 1998, the Company was granted a Certificate of Public Convenience and
Necessity by the MPSC to build approximately 1,064 megawatts of combined cycle
generation at the Company's Plant Daniel site, to be placed in service by June
2001. In December 1998, the Company requested approval to transfer the ownership
rights under the certificate to Escatawpa Funding, Limited Partnership
(Escatawpa), which will lease the facility to the Company (see Note 4,
Commitments). In September 2000, the Company and the Mississippi Public
Utilities Staff entered, and the MPSC in October 2000 approved, a new
stipulation that modifies a January 1999 stipulation and order covering cost
allocation. The 1999 stipulation and MPSC order would have excluded the new
capacity from retail rate base and would have assigned the Company's existing
generating facilities entirely to the retail jurisdiction. The new stipulation
and MPSC order allocates a pro-rata share of the new capacity along with the
Company's existing generating capacity to the retail jurisdiction. The Company's
2001 retail rate case reflected this methodology and the MPSC's December 2001
order on the retail rate case filing approved the Company's cost allocations.

4.  COMMITMENTS

Construction Program

The Company is engaged in continuous construction programs, the costs of which
are currently estimated to total $84 million in 2002, $72 million in 2003, and
$85 million in 2004. The construction program is subject to periodic review and
revision, and actual construction costs may vary from the above estimates
because of numerous factors. These factors include changes in business
conditions; revised load growth estimates; changes in environmental regulations;
increasing costs of labor, equipment and materials; and cost of capital.
Significant construction will continue related to transmission and distribution
facilities, and the upgrading of generating plants.

Lease Agreements

In 1989, the Company entered into a twenty-two year operating lease agreement
for the use of 495 aluminum railcars. In 1994, a second lease agreement for the
use of 250 additional aluminum railcars was also entered into for twenty-two
years. The Company has the option to purchase the 745 railcars at the greater of
lease termination value or fair market value, or to renew the leases at the end
of the lease term. Both of these leases were for the transport of coal to Plant
Daniel.

    Gulf Power, as joint owner of Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2, is responsible for
one half of the lease cost. The Company's share (50%) of the leases, charged to
fuel stock, was $1.9 million in 2001, $2.1 million in 2000, and $2.8 million in
1999. The Company's annual lease payments for 2002 through 2006 will average
approximately $2.0 million and after 2006, lease payments total in aggregate
approximately $12 million.

    In 1999, the Company signed an Agreement for Lease and a Lease Agreement
with Escatawpa Funding, Limited Partnership (Escatawpa). These agreements called
for the Company to design and construct, as agent for Escatawpa, a 1,064
megawatt natural gas combined cycle facility at the Company's Plant Victor J.
Daniel Facility (Facility). In May 2001, the Facility was completed and placed
into commercial operation. Effective with commercial operation of the Facility
at Plant Daniel, the initial 10-year lease term under its lease arrangement for
the Facility with Escatawpa began. The completion cost was approximately $370
million. The lease provides for a residual value guarantee (approximately 71% of
the completion cost) by the Company that is due upon termination of the lease in
certain circumstances. The lease also includes a purchase and renewal option.
Upon termination of the lease, at the Company's option, the Company may either
exercise its purchase option or the Facility can be sold to a third party. The
Company expects that the fair market value of the leased Facility would


                                     II-173

NOTES (continued)
Mississippi Power Company 2001 Annual Report


substantially reduce or eliminate the Company's payment under the residual value
guarantee. In 2001, the Company recognized approximately $18 million in lease
expense. The Company estimates that its annual amount of future minimum
operating lease payments, exclusive of any payment related to the residual value
guarantee, as of December 31, 2001, were as follows:

Fuel

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of its generating plants, the
Company has entered into various long-term commitments for the procurement of
fuel. In most cases, these contracts contain provisions for price escalations,
minimum production levels, and other financial commitments. In addition, the
Company utilizes financial instruments to eliminated price volatility. Total
estimated fixed-price obligations at December 31, 2001, were as follows:

    In addition, the system service company acts as agent for the five operating
companies and Southern Power with regard to natural gas purchases. Natural gas
purchases (in dollars) are based on various indices at the actual time of
delivery; therefore, only the volume commitments are firm. The Company's
committed volumes allocated based on usage projections, as of December 31, 2001
are as follows:

Company's fuel needs.

5.  JOINT OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS

The Company and Alabama Power own as tenants in common Units 1 and 2 at Plant
Greene County located in Alabama. Additionally, the Company and Gulf Power own
as tenants in common Units 1 and 2 at Plant Daniel located in Mississippi.

    At December 31, 2001, the Company's percentage ownership and investment in
these jointly owned facilities were as follows:

    The Company's share of plant operating expenses is included in the
corresponding operating expenses in the Statements of Income.

 6. LONG-TERM CAPACITY SALES AND LEASE
    AGREEMENTS

The Company and the other operating companies of Southern Company have long-term
contractual agreements for the sale of capacity and energy to certain
non-affiliated utilities located outside the system's service area. Because the
energy is generally sold at cost under these agreements, profitability is
primarily affected by revenues from capacity sales. The Company's capacity
revenues under these agreements were not material during the periods reported.

entered into a 40-year transmission facilities agreement whereby Entergy began
paying a use fee to the Company covering all expenses relative to ownership and
operation and maintenance of a 500 kV line, including amortization of its
original $57 million cost. For the three years ended 2001, use fees collected
under this agreement, net of related expenses, amounted to approximately $2.7
million each year and are included within Other Income in the Statements of
Income.

    During 2000, the Company entered into a 10-year capacity lease that began in
mid 2001. The minimum capacity lease revenue that the Company will receive will
average approximately $21 million per year over the 10-year period. Capacity
revenues for 2001 were approximately $12.3 million and were classified as sales
for resale in the financial statements.

7.  INCOME TAXES

At December 31, 2001, the tax-related regulatory assets and liabilities were $13
million and $24 million, respectively. These assets are attributable to tax
benefits flowed through to customers in prior years and to taxes applicable to
capitalized interest. These liabilities are attributable to deferred taxes
previously recognized at rates higher than current enacted tax law and to
unamortized investment tax credits.

    Details of the federal and state income tax provisions are shown below:

    Deferred investment tax credits are amortized over the lives of the related
property with such amortization normally applied as a credit to reduce
depreciation in the Statements of Income. Credits amortized in this manner
amounted to $1.2 million in 2001, 2000, and 1999. At December 31, 2001, all
investment tax credits available to reduce federal income taxes payable had been
utilized.

8. CAPITALIZATION

Preferred Securities

In February 1997, Mississippi Power Capital Trust I (Trust I), of which the
Company owns all the common securities, issued $35 million of 7.75 percent
mandatorily redeemable preferred securities. Substantially all of the assets of
Trust I are $36 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 7.75 percent
junior subordinated notes due February 15, 2037.

    The Company considers that the mechanisms and obligations relating to the
preferred securities, taken together, constitute a full and unconditional
guarantee by the Company of the Trust's payment obligations with respect to the
preferred securities.

    Trust I is a subsidiary of the Company, and accordingly is consolidated in
the Company's financial statements.

Long-Term Debt Due Within One Year

A summary of the improvement fund requirements and scheduled maturities and
redemptions of long-term debt due within one year is as follows:

 Total                                      $80,020    $   20
 ==============================================================

    The first mortgage bond improvement fund requirement is one percent of each
outstanding series authenticated under the indenture of the Company prior to
January 1 of each year, other than first mortgage bonds issued as collateral
security for certain pollution control obligations. The requirement must be
satisfied by June 1 of each year by depositing cash or reacquiring bonds, or by
pledging additional property equal to 166-2/3 percent of such requirement.


Bank Credit Arrangements

At December 31, 2001, the Company had total committed credit agreements with
banks for approximately $114.5 million. At year-end 2001, the unused portion of
these committed credit agreements was approximately $114.5 million. These credit
agreements expire at various dates in 2002 and 2003. Some of these agreements
allow short-term borrowings to be converted into term loans, payable in 12 equal
quarterly installments, with the first installment due at the end of the first
calendar quarter after the applicable termination date or at an earlier date at
the Company's option. In connection with these credit arrangements, the Company
agrees to pay commitment fees based on the unused portions of the commitments or
to maintain compensating balances with the banks. The amount of commercial paper
outstanding at December 31, 2001 was $16 million.

Assets Subject to Lien

The Company's mortgage indenture dated as of September 1, 1941, as amended and
supplemented, which secures the first mortgage bonds issued by the Company,
constitutes a direct first lien on substantially all of the Company's fixed
property and franchises.

Dividend Restrictions

The Company's first mortgage bond indenture and the corporate charter contain
various common stock dividend restrictions. At December 31, 2001, approximately
$118 million of retained earnings was restricted against the payment of cash
dividends on common stock under the most restrictive terms of the mortgage
indenture or corporate charter.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT
Savannah Electric and Power Company 2001 Annual Report


The management of Savannah Electric and Power Company has prepared--and is
responsible for--the financial statements and related information included in
this report. These statements were prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States and necessarily include
amounts that are based on the best estimates and judgments of management.
Financial information throughout this annual report is consistent with the
financial statements.

     The Company maintains a system of internal accounting controls to provide
reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that accounting records
reflect only authorized transactions of the Company. Limitations exist in any
system of internal controls, however, based on a recognition that the cost of
the system should not exceed its benefits. The Company believes its system of
internal accounting controls maintains an appropriate cost/benefit relationship.

     The Company's system of internal accounting controls is evaluated on an
ongoing basis by the Company's internal audit staff. The Company's independent
public accountants also consider certain elements of the internal control system
in order to determine their auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the financial statements.

     The audit committee of the board of directors, composed of five independent
directors who are not employees, provides a broad overview of management's
financial reporting and control functions. Periodically, this committee meets
with management, the internal auditors and the independent public accountants to
ensure that these groups are fulfilling their obligations and to discuss
auditing, internal controls and financial reporting matters. The internal
auditors and the independent public accountants have access to the members of
the audit committee at any time.

     Management believes that its policies and procedures provide reasonable
assurance that the Company's operations are conducted according to a high
standard of business ethics.

     In management's opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows
of Savannah Electric and Power Company in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


To Savannah Electric and Power Company:


We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements of capitalization
of Savannah Electric and Power Company (a Georgia corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Southern Company) as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the
related statements of income, common stockholder's equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements (pages II-192 through II-206)
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Savannah Electric and Power Company as of December 31, 2001 and
2000, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.

    As explained in Note 1 to the financial statements, effective January 1,
2001, Savannah Electric and Power Company changed its method of accounting for
derivative instruments and hedging activities.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Savannah Electric and Power Company 2001 Annual Report


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
- ---------------------

Earnings

Savannah Electric and Power Company's net income for 2001 totaled $22.1 million,
representing a decrease of $0.9 million or 3.9 percent from the prior year.
Earnings were down primarily due to lower retail revenues.

     In 2000, earnings were $23.0 million, representing no significant change
from the prior year.

Revenues

Total operating revenues for 2001 were $283.9 million, reflecting a 4.0 percent
decrease when compared to 2000. The following table summarizes the factors
affecting operating revenues for the past two years:

                                                  Increase (Decrease)

    Percent change                                  (4.0)%     17.5%
    -----------------------------------------------------------------

     Retail revenues decreased 4.8 percent or $13.5 million in 2001 as compared
to 2000. The primary contributors to the decrease were the negative impact of
mild weather on energy sales and a decrease in fuel revenues, partially due to a
lower average cost of fuel consumed.

     Electric rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in
fuel costs, the energy component of purchased power costs, and certain other
costs. Under these fuel recovery provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel
expenses--including the fuel component of purchased energy--and do not affect
net income.  However, cash flow is affected by the economic loss from
untimely recovery of these receivables. In May 2001, the Company implemented a
Fuel Cost Recovery (FCR) rate increase under a Georgia Public Service Commission
(GPSC) rate order. The order established a new fuel rate to better reflect
current fuel costs and to collect the under-recovered balance. The GPSC-approved
FCR anticipated a three year recovery of the under-recovered fuel balance. Due
to the current year decreases in fuel costs, the Company recovered approximately
70 percent of this balance by year-end 2001.

     Revenues from sales to utilities outside the service area under long-term
contracts consist of capacity and energy components. These transactions do not
have a significant impact on earnings.

     Sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric system vary from
year to year depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating
resources at each company. These energy sales do not have a significant impact
on earnings.

Energy Sales

Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the amount of energy sold each
year. Kilowatt-hour (KWH) sales for 2001 and the percent change by year were as
follows:
                           KWH            Percent Change

Total                         4,168        0.6%      7.8%
===========================================================

     Total retail energy sales in 2001 decreased slightly from the prior year.
Residential sales decreased reflecting mild weather, somewhat offset by
continued growth in customers. Industrial sales decreased reflecting a slowing
of the economy. Commercial energy sales increased 1.4 percent reflecting
continued customer growth.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Savannah Electric and Power Company 2001 Annual Report


     In 2000, total retail energy sales were up by 7.1 percent from the prior
year, reflecting increased energy sales of 12.2 percent to industrial customers
due to the re-opening of an industrial facility under new ownership. Residential
and commercial energy sales also increased reflecting weather related demand and
customer growth.

Expenses

Total operating expenses for 2001 were $234.3 million, a decrease of $9.0
million from the prior year due primarily to decreases in fuel expense and
purchased power from both affiliates and non-affiliates. The decrease in fuel
expense is attributable to a decrease in generation and lower fuel costs.
Purchased power decreased due principally to lower energy costs. Other operation
expense was lower reflecting decreased costs associated with discontinuation of
a marketing program and lower administrative and general expenses. Maintenance
expense increased from 2000 reflecting higher power delivery costs to support
improved customer reliability.

     In 2000, total operating expenses were $243.3 million, an increase of $41.8
million from the prior year. This increase was due primarily to increases in
purchased power from both affiliates and non-affiliates and fuel expense.
Purchased power increased due principally to higher energy costs. Other
operation expense was higher reflecting increased benefit expenses. Maintenance
expense increased from 1999 reflecting higher power delivery and power
generation maintenance costs to support improved customer reliability and unit
availability, respectively. Depreciation and amortization increased reflecting
additional depreciation charges related to the GPSC accounting order. See Note 3
to the financial statements for additional information on the GPSC's 1998
accounting order.

     Fuel and purchased power costs constitute the single largest expense for
the Company. The mix of energy supply is determined primarily by system load,
the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the availability of units.

     The amount and sources of energy supply and the total average cost of
energy supply were as follows:

Effects of Inflation

The Company is subject to rate regulation and income tax laws that are based on
the recovery of historical costs. Therefore, inflation creates an economic loss
because the Company is recovering its costs of investments in dollars that have
less purchasing power. While the inflation rate has been relatively low in
recent years, it continues to have an adverse effect on the Company because of
the large investment in utility plant with long economic lives. Conventional
accounting for historical cost does not recognize this economic loss nor the
partially offsetting gain that arises through financing facilities with
fixed-money obligations such as long-term debt and trust preferred securities.
Any recognition of inflation by regulatory authorities is reflected in the rate
of return allowed.

Future Earnings Potential

General

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily
indicative of future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on
numerous factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated, more
competitive environment.

     Future earnings in the near term will depend upon growth in energy sales,
which is subject to a number of factors. These factors include weather,
competition, new short and long-term contracts with neighboring utilities,
energy conservation practiced by customers, the elasticity of demand, and the
rate of economic growth in the Company's service area.

                                      II-184



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Savannah Electric and Power Company 2001 Annual Report


     The Company currently operates as a vertically integrated utility providing
electricity to customers within the traditional service area of southeastern
Georgia. Prices for electricity provided by the Company to retail customers are
set by the GPSC. Prices for electricity relating to jointly owned generating
facilities, interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric
power are set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).

     As part of the Company's retail rate settlement in 1992, it was informally
agreed that the Company's earned rate of return on common equity should be 12.95
percent. In 1998, the GPSC issued a four-year accounting order settling its
review of the Company's earnings. See Note 3 to the financial statements for
additional information.

     Southern Power Company, a new Southern Company affiliate formed in 2001 to
construct, own, and manage wholesale generating assets in the Southeast, is
currently constructing two 566 megawatt combined cycle units at Plant Wansley to
begin operation in 2002. The GPSC has certified the Company's purchase of 200
megawatts of capacity from these units to serve its retail customers for
approximately seven years.

     The Company filed a base rate case on November 30, 2001 for the first time
since 1985. The primary reason for this base rate case is to recover significant
new costs related to the Plant Wansley power purchase agreement beginning June
2002, as well as other operation and maintenance expense changes. The requested
increase is 7.6 percent of total rates (base plus fuel). In the filing, the
Company announced it would file for a fuel decrease in early 2002 to offset
most, if not all, of the base rate increase.

     The Company is involved in various matters being litigated. See Note 3 to
the financial statements for information regarding material issues that could
possibly affect future earnings.

     Compliance costs related to current and future environmental laws and
regulations could affect earnings if such costs are not fully recovered. The
Clean Air Act and other important environmental items are discussed under
"Environmental Matters."

Industry Restructuring

The electric utility industry in the United States is currently undergoing a
period of dramatic change as a result of regulatory and competitive factors.
Among the primary agents of change has been the Energy Policy Act of 1992
(Energy Act). The Energy Act allows independent power producers (IPPs) to access
the Company's transmission network in order to sell electricity to other
utilities. This enhances the incentive for IPPs to build cogeneration plants for
industrial and commercial customers and sell energy generation to other
utilities. Also, electricity sales for resale rates are affected by wholesale
transmission access and numerous potential new energy suppliers, including power
marketers and brokers.

     Although the Energy Act does not permit retail customer access, it was a
major catalyst for the current restructuring and consolidation taking place
within the utility industry. Numerous federal and state initiatives are in
varying stages to promote wholesale and retail competition. Among other things,
these initiatives allow customers to choose their electricity provider. Some
states have approved initiatives that result in a separation of the ownership
and/or operation of generating facilities from the ownership and/or operation of
transmission and distribution facilities. While the GPSC has held workshops to
discuss retail competition and industry restructuring, there has been no
proposed or enacted legislation to date in Georgia. Enactment would require
numerous issues to be resolved, including significant ones relating to recovery
of any stranded investments, full cost recovery of energy produced, and other
issues related to the energy crisis that occurred in California. As a result of
that crisis, many states have either discontinued or delayed implementation of
initiatives involving retail deregulation. The Company does compete with other
electric suppliers within the state. In Georgia, most new retail customers with
at least 900 kilowatts of connected load may choose their electricity supplier.

     In December 1999, the FERC issued its final rule on Regional Transmission
Organizations (RTOs). The order encouraged utilities owning transmission systems
to form RTOs on a voluntary basis. Southern Company and its operating companies,
including the Company, have submitted a series of status reports informing the


                                     II-185

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Savannah Electric and Power Company 2001 Annual Report


FERC of progress toward the development of a Southeastern RTO. In these status
reports, Southern Company explained that it is developing a for-profit RTO known
as SeTrans with a number of non-jurisdictional cooperative and public power
entities. Recently, Entergy Corporation and Cleco Power joined the SeTrans
development process. In January 2002, the sponsors of SeTrans held a public
meeting to form a Stakeholder Advisory Committee, which will participate in the
development of the RTO. Southern Company continues to work with the other
sponsors to develop the SeTrans RTO. The creation of SeTrans is not expected to
have a material impact on Southern Company's financial statements. The outcome
of this matter cannot now be determined.

Accounting Policies

Critical Policy

The Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements. The Company's most critical accounting policy involves
rate regulation. The Company is subject to the provisions of Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects
of Certain Types of Regulation. In the event that a portion of the Company's
operations is no longer subject to these provisions, the Company would be
required to write off related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not
specifically recoverable and determine if any other assets have been impaired.
See Note 1 to the financial statements under "Regulatory Assets and Liabilities"
for additional information.

New Accounting Standards

Effective January 2001, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. Statement No. 133
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and
for hedging activities. This statement requires that certain derivative
instruments be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability
measured at fair value, and that changes in the fair value be recognized
currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. See
Note 1 to the financial statements under "Financial Instruments" for additional
information. The impact on net income in 2001 was not material. An additional
interpretation of Statement No. 133 will result in a change -- effective April
1, 2002 -- in accounting for certain contracts related to fuel supplies that
contain quantity options. These contracts will be accounted for as derivatives
and marked to market. However, due to the existence of the Company's cost-based
fuel recovery clause, this change is not expected to have a material impact on
net income.

     On June 1, 2001, the Company implemented a natural gas/oil hedging program
which was ordered by the GPSC as part of the fuel cost recovery increase filing.
The maximum annual dollar amount of the hedges recoverable through the fuel cost
recovery clause is 10 percent of the annual gas/oil budget or $1.5 million for
2001 and $2.4 million for 2002.

     In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for
acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 17. Statement No. 142 addresses how intangible
assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets -- but not
those acquired in a business combination -- should be accounted for upon
acquisition and on an ongoing basis. Goodwill and intangible assets that have
indefinite useful lives will not be amortized but rather will be tested at least
annually for impairment. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives will
continue to be amortized over their useful lives, which are no longer limited to
40 years. The Company adopted Statement No. 142 in January 2002 with no material
impact on the financial statements.

     Also in June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143, Asset Retirement
Obligations, which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal
obligations associated with retiring assets, including decommissioning of
nuclear plants. The liability for an asset's future retirement must be recorded
in the period in which the liability is incurred. The cost must be capitalized
as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful
life. Changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time will be
recognized as operating expenses. Statement No. 143 must be adopted by January
1, 2003. The Company has not yet quantified the impact of adopting Statement No.
143 on its financial statements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION
- -------------------

Overview

The principal change in the Company's financial condition in 2001 was the
addition of $31.3 million to utility plant. The funds needed for gross property
additions are currently provided from operating activities, principally from
earnings, and non-cash charges to income such as depreciation and deferred
income taxes and from financing activities. See Statements of Cash Flows for
additional information.

Credit Rating Risk

The Company does not have any credit agreements that would require material
changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating
downgrade.

Exposure to Market Risks

Due to cost-based regulation, the Company has limited exposure to market
volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity.
To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the
Company enters into fixed price contracts for the purchase and sale of
electricity through the wholesale electricity market. At December 31, 2001,
exposure from these activities was not material to the Company's financial
statements. Also, if the Company sustained a 100 basis point change in interest
rates for all variable rate long-term debt, the change would affect annualized
interest expense by approximately $0.2 million at December 31, 2001. Fair values
of changes in energy trading contracts and year-end valuations are as follows:

Capital Structure

As of December 31, 2001, the Company's capital structure consisted of 46.8
percent common stockholder's equity, 10.6 percent trust preferred securities,
and 42.6 percent long-term debt, excluding amounts due within one year.

     Maturities and retirements of long-term debt were $50.7 million in 2001,
$0.4 million in 2000, and $16.2 million in 1999.

     In May 2001, the Company issued $20 million of series B 5.12% senior notes
maturing in 2003 and $45 million of series C 6.55% senior notes maturing in
2008. The Company used these proceeds to redeem its $20 million 6 3/8 Series
First Mortgage Bonds due in 2003, to repay long-term bank loans in the amount of
$30 million, and to repay a portion of its short-term indebtedness.

     The composite interest rates and dividend rates for the years 1999 through
2001 as of year-end were as follows:

                                      2001       2000       1999

Capital Requirements for Construction

The Company's projected construction expenditures for the next three years total
$115.7 million ($34.8 million in 2002, $37.6 million in 2003, and $43.3 million
in 2004). Actual construction costs may vary from this estimate because of

factors such as changes in: business conditions; environmental regulations; load
projections; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment and
materials; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that
costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered. Construction and
upgrading of new and existing transmission and distribution facilities and
upgrading of generating plants will be continuing.

Other Capital Requirements

In addition to the funds needed for the construction program, approximately
$22.5 million will be needed by the end of 2004 for maturities of long-term debt
and present sinking fund requirements.

    Capital requirements, lease obligations, and purchase commitments -
discussed in Notes 4 and 6 to the financial statements -- are as follows:

Environmental Matters

On November 3, 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil
action in the U.S. District Court against Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and the
system service company. The complaint alleges violations of the prevention of
significant deterioration and new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act
with respect to five coal-fired generating facilities in Alabama and Georgia.
The civil action requests penalties and injunctive relief, including an order
requiring the installation of the best available control technology at the
affected units. The EPA concurrently issued to Southern Company's operating
companies a notice of violation related to 10 generating facilities, which
includes the five facilities mentioned previously and the Company's Plant Kraft.
In early 2000, the EPA filed a motion to amend its complaint to add the
violations alleged in its notice of violation, and to add Gulf Power,
Mississippi Power, and the Company as defendants. The complaint and notice of
violation are similar to those brought against and issued to several other
electric utilities. These complaints and notices of violation allege that the
utilities had failed to secure necessary permits or install additional pollution
control equipment when performing maintenance and construction at coal burning
plants constructed or under construction prior to 1978. The U.S. District Court
in Georgia granted Alabama Power's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction in
Georgia and granted the system service company's motion to dismiss on the
grounds that it neither owned nor operated the generating units involved in the
proceedings. The court granted the EPA's motion to add the Company as a
defendant, but it denied the motion to add Gulf Power and Mississippi Power
based on lack of jurisdiction over those companies. The court directed the EPA
to re-file its amended complaint limiting claims to those brought against
Georgia Power and the Company. The EPA re-filed those claims as directed by the
court. Also, the EPA re-filed its claims against Alabama Power in U.S. District
Court in Alabama. It has not re-filed against Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, or
the system service company. The Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and the Company's
cases have been stayed since the spring of 2001, pending a ruling by the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in the appeal of a very similar New
Source Review enforcement action against the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA).
The TVA case involves many of the same legal issues raised by the actions
against Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and the Company. Because the outcome of

                                     II-188

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Savannah Electric and Power Company 2001 Annual Report


the TVA case could have a significant adverse impact on Alabama Power and
Georgia Power, both companies are parties to that case as well. The U.S.
District Court in Alabama has indicated that it will revisit the issue of a
continued stay in April 2002. The U.S. District Court in Georgia is currently
considering a motion by the EPA to reopen the Georgia case. Georgia Power and
the Company have opposed that motion.

     The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA's
regulations and interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took
place. The Clean Air Act authorizes civil penalties of up to $27,500 per day per
violation at each generating unit. Prior to January 30, 1997, the penalty was
$25,000 per day. An adverse outcome of this matter could require substantial
capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and possibly require
payment of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of
operations, cash flows, and possibly financial condition if such costs are not
recovered through regulated rates.

     In November 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (Clean Air Act) were
signed into law. Title IV of the Clean Air Act--the acid rain compliance
provision of the law--significantly affected the Company and other subsidiaries
of Southern Company. Specific reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide
emissions from fossil-fired generating plants were required in two phases. Phase
I compliance began in 1995. Southern Company's subsidiaries, including the
Company, achieved Phase I compliance at the affected plants by primarily
switching to low-sulfur coal and with some equipment upgrades. The construction
expenditures for Phase I compliance totaled approximately $2 million for the
Company.

    Phase II sulfur dioxide compliance was required in 2000. Southern Company
used emission allowances and fuel switching to comply with Phase II
requirements. Phase II compliance had no significant impact on the Company.

     A significant portion of costs related to the acid rain and ozone
non-attainment provisions of the Clean Air Act is expected to be recovered
through existing ratemaking provisions. However, there can be no assurance that
all Clean Air Act costs will be recovered.

     In July 1997, the EPA revised the national ambient air quality standards
for ozone and particulate matter. This revision made the standards significantly
more stringent. In the subsequent litigation of these standards, the U.S.
Supreme Court found the EPA's implementation program for the new ozone standard
unlawful and remanded it to the EPA. In addition, the Federal District of
Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals is considering other legal challenges to these
standards. If the standards are eventually upheld, implementation could be
required by 2007 to 2010.

     In September 1998, the EPA issued regional nitrogen oxide reduction rules
to the states for implementation. The final rule affects 21 states, including
Georgia. Compliance is required by May 31, 2004 for most states. For Georgia,
further rulemaking was required, and proposed compliance was delayed until May
1, 2005.

     In December 2000, having completed its utility studies for mercury and
other hazardous air pollutants (HAPS), the EPA issued a determination that an
emission control program for mercury and, perhaps, other HAPS is warranted. The
program is being developed under the Maximum Achievable Control Technology
provisions of the Clean Air Act, and the regulations are scheduled to be
finalized by the end of 2004 with implementation to take place around 2007. In
January 2001, the EPA proposed guidance for the determination of Best Available
Retrofit Technology (BART) emission controls under the Regional Haze
Regulations. Installation of BART controls is expected to take place around
2010. Litigation of the Regional Haze Regulations, including the BART
provisions, is ongoing in the Federal District of Columbia Circuit Court of
Appeals. A court decision is expected in mid-2002.

     Implementation of the final state rules for these initiatives could require
substantial further reductions in nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide and
reductions in mercury and other HAPS emissions from fossil-fired generating
facilities and other industries in these states. Additional compliance costs and
capital expenditures resulting from the implementation of these rules and
standards cannot be determined until the results of legal challenges are known,
and the states have adopted their final rules.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Savannah Electric and Power Company 2001 Annual Report


     In October 1997, the EPA issued regulations setting forth requirements for
Compliance Assurance Monitoring (CAM) in its state and federal operating permit
programs. These regulations were amended by the EPA in March 2001 in response to
a court order resolving challenges to the rules brought by environmental groups
and industry. Generally, this rule affects the operation and maintenance of
electrostatic precipitators and could involve significant additional ongoing
expense.

     The EPA and state environmental regulatory agencies are reviewing and
evaluating various other matters including: control strategies to reduce
regional haze; limits on pollutant discharges to impaired waters; cooling water
intake restrictions; and hazardous waste disposal requirements. The impact of
any new standards will depend on the development and implementation of
applicable regulations.

     The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that
cover the handling and disposal of hazardous waste. Under these various laws and
regulations, the Company could incur substantial costs to clean up properties.
The Company conducts studies to determine the extent of any required cleanup and
will recognize in the financial statements costs to clean up known sites.

     Several major pieces of environmental legislation are being considered for
reauthorization or amendment by Congress. These include: the Clean Air Act; the
Clean Water Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances
Control Act; and the Endangered Species Act. Changes to these laws could affect
many areas of the Company's operations. The full impact of any such changes
cannot be determined at this time.

     Compliance with possible additional legislation related to global climate
change, electromagnetic fields, and other environmental and health concerns
could significantly affect the Company. The impact of new legislation--if
any--will depend on the subsequent development and implementation of applicable
regulations. In addition, the potential exists for liability as the result of
lawsuits alleging damages caused by electromagnetic fields.

Sources of Capital

At December 31, 2001, the Company had $65.5 million of short-term and
revolving credit arrangements with banks to meet its short-term cash needs and
to provide additional interim funding for the Company's construction program.
Revolving credit arrangements total $20 million, of which $10 million expires
April 30, 2003 and $10 million expires December 31, 2003.

     The Company may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company
subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper at the request and for
the benefit of the Company and the other Southern Company operating companies.
At December 31, 2001, the Company had outstanding $32.2 million of commercial
paper.

     The Company's committed credit arrangements provide liquidity support to
the Company's variable rate obligations and to its commercial paper program. The
amount of variable rate obligations outstanding at December 31, 2001 was $22.6
million.

     It is anticipated that the funds required for construction and other
purposes, including compliance with environmental regulations, will be derived
from sources similar to those used in the past. These sources were primarily
from the issuances of first mortgage bonds, other long-term debt, and preferred
stock, in addition to pollution control revenue bonds issued for the Company's
benefit by public authorities, to meet long-term external financing
requirements. Recently, the Company's financings have consisted of unsecured
debt and trust preferred securities. The Company is required to meet certain
earnings coverage requirements specified in its mortgage indenture and corporate
charter to issue new first mortgage bonds and preferred stock. The Company's
coverage ratios are sufficiently high to permit, at present interest rate
levels, any foreseeable security sales. There are no restrictions on the amount
of unsecured indebtedness allowed. The amount of securities which the Company
will be permitted to issue in the future will depend upon market conditions and
other factors prevailing at that time.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Savannah Electric and Power Company 2001 Annual Report


1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES

General

Savannah Electric and Power Company (the Company) is a wholly owned subsidiary
of Southern Company, which is the parent company of five operating companies, a
system service company, Southern Communications Services (Southern LINC),
Southern Nuclear Operating Company (Southern Nuclear), Southern Power Company
(Southern Power), and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The operating
companies provide electric service in four states. Contracts among the operating
companies--related to jointly owned generating facilities, interconnecting
transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power--are regulated by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and/or the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The system service company provides, at cost, specialized services
to Southern Company and subsidiary companies. Southern LINC provides digital
wireless communications services to the operating companies and also markets
these services to the public within the Southeast. Southern Nuclear provides
services to Southern Company's nuclear power plants. Southern Power was
established in 2001 to construct, own, and manage Southern Company's competitive
generation assets and sell electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale
market.

     Southern Company is registered as a holding company under the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA). Both Southern Company and its
subsidiaries are subject to the regulatory provisions of the PUHCA. The Company
also is subject to regulation by the FERC and the Georgia Public Service
Commission (GPSC). The Company follows accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States and complies with the accounting policies and practices
prescribed by the GPSC. The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the
use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates.

     Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements has been
reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.

Affiliate Transactions

The Company has an agreement with the system service company under which the
following services are rendered to the Company at cost: general and design
engineering, purchasing, accounting and statistical, finance and treasury, tax,
information resources, marketing, auditing, insurance and employee benefits,
human resources, systems and procedures, and other administrative services with
respect to business and operations and power pool operations. Costs for these
services amounted to $15.0 million, $15.1 million, and $16.0 million during
2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

The Company is subject to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
Regulation. Regulatory assets represent probable future revenues to the Company
associated with certain costs that are expected to be recovered from customers
through the ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future
reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be credited
to customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory assets and (liabilities)
reflected in the Balance Sheets at December 31 relate to:

                                         2001            2000
                                     --------------------------
                                         (in thousands)
Deferred income tax charges             $ 12,283      $ 12,404
Premium on reacquired debt                 6,890         7,575
Gas by-pass facility                         209           299
Deferred income tax credits              (13,776)      (16,038)
Storm damage reserves                     (4,228)       (2,733)
Accelerated depreciation                  (8,000)       (5,500)
- ---------------------------------------------------------------
Total                                   $ (6,622)     $ (3,993)
===============================================================

     In the event that a portion of the Company's operations is no longer
subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, the Company would be
required to write off related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not
specifically recoverable through regulated rates. In addition, the Company would
be required to determine if any impairment to other assets exists, including
plant, and write down the assets, if impaired, to their fair value.

Revenues and Fuel Costs

The Company currently operates as a vertically integrated utility providing
electricity to retail customers within its traditional service area of
southeastern Georgia and to wholesale customers in the Southeast.


                                     II-198

NOTES (continued)
Savannah Electric and Power Company 2001 Annual Report


    Revenues are recognized as services are rendered. Unbilled revenues are
accrued at the end of each fiscal period. Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is
used. Electric rates for the Company include provisions to adjust billings for
fluctuations in fuel costs, the energy component of purchased power costs, and
certain other costs. Revenues are adjusted for differences between recoverable
fuel costs and amounts actually recovered in current regulated rates.

    The Company has a diversified base of customers. No single customer or
industry comprises 10 percent or more of revenues. For all periods presented,
uncollectible accounts averaged less than 1 percent of revenues.

    In 2001, the GPSC approved an increase in the Company's fuel cost recovery
rate amounting to a total average annual rate increase of 18 percent for all
customer classes. An increase of slightly over one-third of a cent per
kilowatt-hour was approved in 2000.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation of the original cost of plant in service is provided primarily by
using composite straight-line rates, which approximated 3.0 percent in 2001,
2000, and 1999. When property subject to depreciation is retired or otherwise
disposed of in the normal course of business, its cost--together with the cost
of removal, less salvage--is charged to the accumulated provision for
depreciation. Minor items of property included in the original cost of the plant
are retired when the related property unit is retired. Depreciation expense
includes an amount for the expected cost of removal of certain facilities. In
2001, 2000, and 1999, the Company recorded accelerated depreciation of $2.5
million, $2.5 million, and $2.0 million, respectively, in accordance with the
GPSC's 1998 rate order. See Note 3 to the financial statements for more
information.

Income Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes
and provides deferred income taxes for all significant income tax temporary
differences. Investment tax credits utilized are deferred and amortized to
income over the average lives of the related property.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction
    (AFUDC)

AFUDC represents the estimated debt and equity costs of capital funds that are
necessary to finance the construction of new facilities. While cash is not
realized currently from such allowance, it increases the revenue requirement
over the service life of the plant through a higher rate base and higher
depreciation expense. The composite rates used by the Company to calculate AFUDC
were 5.13 percent in 2001, 6.87 percent in 2000, and 6.26 percent in 1999.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost less regulatory
disallowances and impairments. Original cost includes: materials; labor; minor
items of property; appropriate administrative and general costs; payroll-related
costs such as taxes, pensions, and other benefits, and AFUDC. The cost of
maintenance, repairs, and replacement of minor items of property is charged to
maintenance expense. The cost of replacements of property exclusive of minor
items of property is capitalized.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are
considered cash equivalents. Temporary cash investments are securities with
original maturities of 90 days or less.

Materials and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include the costs of transmission,
distribution, and generating plant materials. Materials are charged to inventory
when purchased and then expensed or capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when
installed.

Financial Instruments

Effective January 2001, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. The impact on net
income was immaterial. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to
hedge exposure to fluctuations in certain commodity prices. Gains and losses on
qualifying hedges are deferred and recognized either as income or as an
adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item when the transaction
occurs.

                                      II-199



NOTES (continued)
Savannah Electric and Power Company 2001 Annual Report


     The Company is exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the
event of counterparties' nonperformance. The Company has established controls to
determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to
mitigate the Company's exposure to counterparty credit risk.

   The five operating companies and Southern Power enter into commodity related
forward and option contracts to limit exposure to changing prices on certain
fuel purchases and electricity purchases and sales. Substantially all of
Southern Company's bulk energy purchases and sales contracts meet the definition
of a derivative under FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. In many cases, these fuel and electricity
contracts qualify for normal purchase and sale exceptions under Statement No.
133 and are accounted for under the accrual method. Other contracts qualify as
cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions, resulting in the deferral of
related gains and losses, and are recorded in other comprehensive income until
the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness is recognized currently in
net income. Contracts that do not qualify for the normal purchase and sale
exception and that do not meet the hedge requirements are marked to market
through current period income.

     On June 1, 2001, the Company implemented a natural gas/oil hedging program
which was ordered by the GPSC as part of the fuel cost recovery increase filing.
The maximum annual dollar amount of the hedges recoverable through the fuel cost
recovery clause is 10 percent of the annual gas/oil budget or $1.5 million for
2001 and $2.4 million for 2002.

     The Company's other financial instruments for which the carrying amounts
did not equal fair value at December 31 were as follows:

                                      Carrying           Fair
                                        Amount          Value
                                    --------------------------
                                          (in millions)
Long-term debt:
    At December 31, 2001                 $157             $157
    At December 31, 2000                 $142             $140
Trust preferred securities:
    At December 31, 2001                  $40              $38
    At December 31, 2000                  $40              $36

     The fair values for long-term debt and trust preferred securities were
based on either closing market prices or closing prices of comparable
instruments.

2.  RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company has defined benefit, trusteed, non-contributory pension plans that
cover substantially all employees. The Company provides certain medical care and
life insurance benefits for retired employees. The Company funds trusts to the
extent required by the GPSC and the FERC. The measurement date for plan assets
and obligations is September 30 of each year. In late 2000, the Company adopted
several pension and postretirement benefit plan changes that had the effect of
increasing benefits to both current and future retirees.

Pension Plans

Changes during the year in the projected benefit obligations and in the fair
value of plan assets were as follows:

                                            Projected
                                       Benefit Obligations

     The Company has a supplemental retirement plan for certain executive
employees. The plan is unfunded and payable from the general funds of the
Company. The Company has purchased life insurance on participating executives
and plans to use these policies to satisfy this obligation.

Employee Savings Plan

The Company also sponsors a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering
substantially all employees. The Company provides a 75 percent matching
contribution up to 6 percent of an employee's base salary. Total matching
contributions made to the plan for the years 2001, 2000, and 1999 were $1.0
million, $0.9 million, and $0.9 million, respectively.

3.   CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY
     MATTERS

General

The Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the
ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, after consultation
with legal counsel, the ultimate disposition of these matters is not expected to
have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition.

Environmental Litigation

On November 3, 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil
action in the U.S. District Court against Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and the
system service company. The complaint alleges violations of the prevention of
significant deterioration and new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act
with respect to five coal-fired generating facilities in Alabama and Georgia.
The civil action requests penalties and injunctive relief, including an order
requiring the installation of the best available control technology at the
affected units. The Clean Air Act authorizes civil penalties of up to $27,500
per day, per violation at each generating unit. Prior to January 30, 1997, the
penalty was $25,000 per day.

   The EPA concurrently issued to the operating companies a notice of violation
related to 10 generating facilities, which includes the five facilities
mentioned previously and the Company's Plant Kraft. In early 2000, the EPA filed
a motion to amend its complaint to add the violations alleged in its notice of
violation, and to add Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, and the Company as
defendants. The complaint and notice of violation are similar to those brought
against and issued to several other electric utilities. These complaints and
notices of violation allege that the utilities had failed to secure necessary
permits or install additional pollution control equipment when performing
maintenance and construction at coal burning plants constructed or under
construction prior to 1978. The U.S. District Court in Georgia granted Alabama
Power's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction in Georgia and granted the
system service company's motion to dismiss on the grounds that it neither owned
nor operated the generating units involved in the proceedings. The court granted
the EPA's motion to add the Company as a defendant, but it denied the motion to
add Gulf Power and Mississippi Power based on lack of jurisdiction over those
companies. The court directed the EPA to re-file its amended complaint limiting
claims to those brought against Georgia Power and the Company. The EPA re-filed
those claims as directed by the court. Also, the EPA re-filed its claims against
Alabama Power in U.S. District Court in Alabama. It has not re-filed against
Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, or the system service company.

   The Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and the Company's cases have been stayed
since the spring of 2001, pending a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Eleventh Circuit in the appeal of a very similar New Source Review enforcement
action against the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). The TVA case involves many
of the same legal issues raised by the actions against Alabama Power, Georgia
Power, and the Company. Because the outcome of the TVA case could have a


                                      II-202

NOTES (continued)
Savannah Electric and Power Company 2001 Annual Report


significant adverse impact on Alabama Power and Georgia Power, both companies
are parties to that case as well. The U.S. District Court in Alabama has
indicated that it will revisit the issue of a continued stay in April 2002. The
U.S. District Court in Georgia is currently considering a motion by the EPA to
reopen the Georgia case. Georgia Power and the Company have opposed that motion.

     The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA's
regulations and interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took
place. An adverse outcome of this matter could require substantial capital
expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and possibly require payment
of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of operations, cash
flows, and possibly financial condition if such costs are not recovered through
regulated rates.

Retail Regulatory Matters

Rates to retail customers served by the Company are regulated by the GPSC. As
part of the Company's rate settlement in 1992, it was informally agreed that the
Company's earned rate of return on common equity should be 12.95 percent.

     In 1998, the GPSC approved a four-year accounting order for the Company.
Under this order, the Company will reduce the electric rates of its small
business customers by approximately $11 million over four years. The Company
will also expense an additional $1.95 million in storm damage accruals and
accrue an additional $8 million in depreciation on generating assets over the
term of the order. The additional depreciation will be accumulated in a
regulatory liability account to be available to mitigate any potential stranded
costs. In addition, the Company has discretionary authority to provide up to an
additional $0.3 million per year in storm damage accruals and up to an
additional $4.0 million in depreciation expense over the four years. Total storm
damages accrued under the order were $1.5 million per year in 2001, 2000, and
1999 which included discretionary expense of $0.3 million in each year. No
discretionary depreciation was recorded in the last three years. Over the term
of the order, the Company is precluded from asking for a rate increase except
upon significant changes in economic conditions, new laws, or regulations. There
is a quarterly monitoring of the Company's earnings performance.

     The Company filed a base rate case November 30, 2001 for the first time
since 1985. The primary reason for this base rate case is to recover significant
new costs related to the 200 megawatt Plant Wansley power purchase agreement
beginning June 2002, as well as other operation and maintenance expense changes.
The requested increase is 7.6 percent of total rates (base plus fuel). In the
filing, the Company announced it would file in early 2002 for a fuel decrease
which would offset most, if not all, of the base rate increase.

4.   COMMITMENTS

Construction Program

The Company is engaged in a continuous construction program, currently estimated
to total $34.8 million in 2002, $37.6 million in 2003, and $43.3 million in
2004. The construction program is subject to periodic review and revision, and
actual construction costs may vary from the above estimates because of numerous
factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions; revised load
growth estimates; changes in environmental regulations; increasing costs of
labor, equipment, and materials; and changes in cost of capital. The Company
does not have any traditional baseload generating plants under construction.
However, construction related to new and upgrading of existing transmission and
distribution facilities and the upgrading of generating plants will continue.

Fuel and Purchased Power Commitments

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of its generating plants, the
Company has entered into long-term commitments for the procurement of fuel. In
most cases, these contracts contain provisions for price escalations, minimum
purchase levels, and other financial commitments. The Company has fuel
commitments of $34 million for 2002, $0.3 million for each of the four years
2003 through 2006, and $6 million for 2007 and beyond.

     In addition, the system service company acts as agent for the Company and
the other operating companies and Southern Power with regard to natural gas
purchases. Natural gas purchases (in dollars) are based on various indices at
the actual time of delivery; therefore, only the volume commitments are firm.
The Company's committed volumes allocated based on usage projections as of

At December 31, 2001, tax-related regulatory assets and liabilities were $12.3
million and $13.8 million, respectively. The assets are attributable to tax
benefits flowed through to customers in prior years and to taxes applicable to
capitalized interest. The liabilities are attributable to deferred taxes
previously recognized at rates higher than current enacted tax law and to
unamortized investment tax credits.

     Details of income tax provisions are as follows:

In December 1998, Savannah Electric Capital Trust I, of which the Company owns
all of the common securities, issued $40 million of 6.85% mandatorily redeemable
preferred securities. Substantially all of the assets of the Trust are $40
million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 6.85% junior subordinated
notes due December 31, 2028.

     The Company considers that the mechanisms and obligations relating to the
trust preferred securities, taken together, constitute a full and unconditional
guarantee by the Company of payment obligations with respect to the preferred
securities of Savannah Electric Capital Trust I.

     Savannah Electric Capital Trust I is a subsidiary of the Company, and
accordingly is consolidated in the Company's financial statements.

Long-Term Debt and Capital Leases

The Company's Indenture related to its First Mortgage Bonds is unlimited as to
the authorized amount of bonds which may be issued, provided that required
property additions, earnings, and other provisions of such Indenture are met.

     Maturities and retirements of long-term debt were $50.7 million in 2001,
$0.4 million in 2000, and $16.2 million in 1999.

     In May 2001, the Company issued $20 million of series B 5.12% senior notes
maturing May 15, 2003 and $45 million of series C 6.55% senior notes maturing
May 15, 2008. The Company used these proceeds to redeem its $20 million 6 3/8
Series First Mortgage Bonds due July 1, 2003, to repay long-term bank loans in
the amount of $30 million, and to repay a portion of its short-term
indebtedness.

     Assets acquired under capital leases are recorded as utility plant in
service, and the related obligation is classified as other long-term debt.
Leases are capitalized at the net present value of the future lease payments.
However, for ratemaking purposes, these obligations are treated as operating
leases, and as such, lease payments are charged to expense as incurred.

Securities Due Within One Year

A summary of the sinking fund requirements and scheduled maturities and
redemptions of long-term debt due within one year at December 31 is as follows:

===================================================================

     The first mortgage bond improvement (sinking) fund requirements amount to 1
percent of each outstanding series of bonds authenticated under the Indenture
prior to January 1 of each year, other than those issued to collateralize
pollution control and other obligations. The requirements may be satisfied by
depositing cash or reacquiring bonds, or by pledging additional property equal
to 1 2/3 times the requirements.

     The sinking fund requirements of first mortgage bonds were satisfied by
cash redemption in 2001 and by certifying property additions in 2000. It is
anticipated that the 2002 requirement will be satisfied by cash redemption.

NOTES (continued)
Savannah Electric and Power Company 2001 Annual Report


Sinking fund requirements and/or maturities through 2006 applicable to long-term
debt are as follows: $1.2 million in 2002; $20.7 million in 2003; $0.6 million
in 2004; $0.6 million in 2005; and $20.6 million in 2006.

Bank Credit Arrangements

At the end of 2001, unused credit arrangements with five banks totaled $65.5
million and expire at various times during 2002 and 2003.

     The Company has revolving credit arrangements of $20 million, of which $10
million expires April 30, 2003 and $10 million expires December 31, 2003. One of
these agreements allows short-term borrowings to be converted into term loans,
payable in 12 equal quarterly installments, with the first installment due at
the end of the first calendar quarter after the applicable termination date or
at an earlier date at the Company's option.

     In connection with these credit arrangements, the Company agrees to pay
commitment fees based on the unused portions of the commitments.

     The Company may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company
subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper at the request and for
the benefit of the Company and the other Southern Company operating companies.
At December 31, 2001, the Company had outstanding $32.2 million of commercial
paper.

     The Company's committed credit arrangements provide liquidity support to
the Company's variable rate obligations and to its commercial paper program. The
amount of variable rate obligations outstanding at December 31, 2001 was $22.6
million.

Assets Subject to Lien

As amended and supplemented, the Company's Indenture of Mortgage, which secures
the first mortgage bonds issued by the Company, constitutes a direct first lien
on substantially all of the Company's fixed property and franchises. A second
lien for $14 million in pollution control obligations is secured by a portion of
the Plant McIntosh property.

Common Stock Dividend Restrictions

The Company's Indenture contains certain limitations on the payment of cash
dividends on common stock. At December 31, 2001, approximately $68 million of
retained earnings was restricted against the payment of cash dividends on common
stock under the terms of the Indenture.

Stock Option Grants. The following table sets forth all stock option grants to
the named executive officers of SAVANNAH during the year ending December 31,

7 Under the terms of the Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, stock option
grants were made on February 16, 2001 and April 16, 2001, and vest annually at a
rate of one-third on the anniversary date of the grant. Grants fully vest upon
termination as a result of death, total disability or retirement and expire five
years after retirement, three years after death or total disability or their
normal expiration date if earlier. The exercise price is the average of the high
and low price of SOUTHERN's common stock on the date granted. Options may be
transferred to certain family members, family trusts and family limited
partnerships. The number of options granted on February 16, 2001 and the
exercise price thereof were adjusted after the spin-off of Mirant under the
antidilution provisions of the plan such that the options had the same aggregate
intrinsic value on the day of the spin-off as the day before.
8 A total of 200,946 stock options were granted in 2001.
9 Value was calculated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The
actual value, if any, ultimately realized depends on the market value of
SOUTHERN's common stock at a future date. Significant assumptions are shown
below:

Compensation of Directors.

     Standard Arrangements. The following table presents compensation paid to
the directors during 2001 for service as a member of the board of directors and
any board committee(s), except that employee directors received no fees or
compensation for service as a member of the board of directors or any board
committee. At the election of the director, all or a portion of the cash
retainer may be payable in SOUTHERN's common stock, and all or a portion of the
total fees may be deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan until membership
on the board is terminated.

Cash Retainer Fee       $10,000
Stock Retainer Fee      50 shares in the first quarter 2001 and 85 shares per
                        quarter thereafter

Meeting Fees:
$750 for each Board or Committee meeting attended

     Effective January 1, 1997, the Outside Directors Pension Plan (the "Plan")
was terminated and benefits payable under the Plan were frozen. Non-employee
directors serving as of January 1, 1997 were given a one-time election to
receive a Plan benefit buy-out equal to the actuarial present value of future
Plan benefits or receive benefits under the terms of the Plan at the annual
retainer rate in effect on December 31, 1996. Directors who elected to receive
the benefit buy-out were required to defer receipt of that amount under the
Deferred Compensation Plan until termination from board membership. Directors
who elected to continue to participate under the terms of the Plan are entitled
to benefits upon retirement from the board on the retirement date designated in
SAVANNAH's by-laws. The annual benefit payable is based upon length of service
and varies from 75 percent of the annual retainer in effect on December 31, 1996
if the participant has at least 60 months of service on the board of one or more
system companies, to 100 percent if the participant has at least 120 months of
such service. Payments will continue for the greater of the lifetime of the
participant or 10 years.

                                     III-7



Other Arrangements. No director received other compensation for services as
a director during the year ending December 31, 2001 in addition to or in lieu of
that specified by the standard arrangements specified above.

Employment Contracts and Termination of Employment and Change in Control
Arrangements.
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

SAVANNAH has adopted SOUTHERN's Change in Control Plan, which is applicable to
certain of its officers, and has entered into individual change in control
agreements with its most highly compensated executive officers. If an executive
is involuntarily terminated, other than for cause, within two years following a
change in control of SAVANNAH or SOUTHERN, the agreements provide for:

o lump sum payment of two or three times annual compensation,
o up to five years' coverage under group health and life insurance plans,
o immediate vesting of all stock options, stock appreciation rights and
  restricted stock previously granted,
o payment of any accrued long-term and short-term bonuses and dividend
  equivalents and
o payment of any excise tax liability incurred as a result of payments
  made under any individual agreements.

A SOUTHERN change in control is defined under the agreements as:

o acquisition of at least 20 percent of the SOUTHERN's stock,
o a change in the majority of the members of the SOUTHERN's board of directors,
o a merger or other business combination that results in SOUTHERN's
  shareholders immediately before the merger owning less than 65 percent of
  the voting power after the merger or
o a sale of substantially all the assets of SOUTHERN.

A change in control of SAVANNAH is defined under the agreements as:

o acquisition of at least 50 percent of SAVANNAH's stock,
o a merger or other business combination unless SOUTHERN controls the
  surviving entity or
o a sale of substantially all the assets of SAVANNAH.

     SOUTHERN also has amended its short- and long-term incentive plans to
provide for pro-rata payments at not less than target-level performance if a
change in control occurs and the plans are not continued or replaced with
comparable plans.
