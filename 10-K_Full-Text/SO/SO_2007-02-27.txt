PART I

Item 1.

BUSINESS

Southern Company was incorporated under the laws of Delaware on
    November 9, 1945. Southern Company is domesticated under
    the laws of Georgia and is qualified to do business as a foreign
    corporation under the laws of Alabama. Southern Company owns all
    the outstanding common stock of Alabama Power, Georgia Power,
    Gulf Power and Mississippi Power, each of which is an operating
    public utility company. The traditional operating companies
    supply electric service in the states of Alabama, Georgia,
    Florida and Mississippi. More particular information relating to
    each of the traditional operating companies is as follows:

Alabama Power

is a corporation organized under the laws
    of the State of Alabama on November 10, 1927, by the
    consolidation of a predecessor Alabama Power Company, Gulf
    Electric Company and Houston Power Company. The predecessor
    Alabama Power Company had been in continuous existence since its
    incorporation in 1906.

Georgia Power

was incorporated under the laws of the
    State of Georgia on June 26, 1930, and admitted to do
    business in Alabama on September 15, 1948. Effective
    July 1, 2006, Savannah Electric, formerly a wholly-owned
    subsidiary of Southern Company, was merged with and into Georgia
    Power.

Gulf Power

is a Florida corporation that has had a
    continuous existence since it was originally organized under the
    laws of the State of Maine on November 2, 1925. Gulf Power
    was admitted to do business in Florida on January 15, 1926,
    in Mississippi on October 25, 1976, and in Georgia on
    November 20, 1984. Gulf Power became a Florida corporation
    after being domesticated under the laws of the State of Florida
    on November 2, 2005.

Mississippi Power

was incorporated under the laws of the
    State of Mississippi on July 12, 1972, was admitted to do
    business in Alabama on November 28, 1972, and effective
    December 21, 1972, by the merger into it of the predecessor
    Mississippi Power Company, succeeded to the business and
    properties of the latter company. The predecessor Mississippi
    Power Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of
    Maine on November 24, 1924, and was admitted to do business
    in Mississippi on December 23, 1924, and in Alabama on
    December 7, 1962.

In addition, Southern Company owns all of the common stock of
    Southern Power, which is also an operating public utility
    company. Southern Power constructs, acquires and manages
    generation assets and sells electricity at market-based rates in
    the wholesale market. Southern Power is a corporation organized
    under the laws of Delaware on January 8, 2001 and was
    admitted to do business in the States of Alabama, Florida and
    Georgia on January 10, 2001 and in the State of Mississippi
    on January 30, 2001.

Southern Company also owns all the outstanding common stock or
    membership interests of SouthernLINC Wireless, Southern Company
    Gas, Southern Nuclear, SCS, Southern Telecom, Southern Holdings
    and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. SouthernLINC
    Wireless provides digital wireless communications services to
    the traditional operating companies and also markets these
    services to the public within the Southeast. Southern Nuclear
    provides services to Alabama Power’s and Georgia
    Power’s nuclear plants. SCS is the system service company
    providing, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and
    its subsidiary companies. Southern Telecom provides wholesale
    fiber optic solutions to telecommunication providers in the
    Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding
    subsidiary for Southern Company’s investments in synthetic
    fuels and leveraged leases and various other energy-related
    businesses.

Alabama Power and Georgia Power each own 50% of the outstanding
    common stock of SEGCO. SEGCO is an operating public utility
    company that owns electric generating units with an aggregate
    capacity of 1,019,680 kilowatts at Plant Gaston on the Coosa
    River near Wilsonville, Alabama. Alabama Power and Georgia Power
    are each entitled to one-half of SEGCO’s capacity and
    energy. Alabama Power acts as SEGCO’s agent in the
    operation of SEGCO’s units and furnishes coal to SEGCO as
    fuel for its units. SEGCO also owns three 230,000 volt
    transmission lines extending from Plant Gaston to the Georgia
    state line at which point connection is made with the Georgia
    Power transmission line system.

The
    Southern Company System

Traditional
    operating companies

The transmission facilities of each of the traditional operating
    companies are connected to the respective company’s own
    generating plants and other sources of power and are
    interconnected with the transmission facilities of the other
    traditional operating companies and SEGCO by means of heavy-duty
    high voltage lines. For information on Georgia Power’s
    integrated transmission system, see “Territory Served by
    the Utilities” herein for additional information.

Operating contracts covering arrangements in effect with
    principal neighboring utility systems provide for capacity
    exchanges, capacity purchases and sales, transfers of economy
    energy and other similar transactions. Additionally, the
    traditional operating companies have entered into voluntary
    reliability agreements with the subsidiaries of Entergy
    Corporation, Florida Electric Power Coordinating Group and TVA
    and with Progress Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy, South Carolina
    Electric & Gas Company and Virginia Electric and Power
    Company, each of which provides for the establishment and
    periodic review of principles and procedures for planning and
    operation of generation and transmission facilities, maintenance
    schedules, load retention programs, emergency operations and
    other matters affecting the reliability of bulk power supply.
    The traditional operating companies have joined with other
    utilities in the Southeast (including those referred to above)
    to form the SERC to augment further the reliability and adequacy
    of bulk power supply. Through the SERC, the traditional
    operating companies are represented on the National Electric
    Reliability Council.

The IIC provides for coordinating operations of the power
    producing facilities of the traditional operating companies and
    Southern Power and the capacities available to such companies
    from non-affiliated sources and for the pooling of surplus
    energy available for interchange. Coordinated operation of the
    entire interconnected system is conducted through a central
    power supply coordination office maintained by SCS. The
    available sources of energy are allocated to the traditional
    operating companies and Southern Power to provide the most
    economical sources of power consistent with reliable operation.
    The resulting benefits and savings are apportioned among each of
    the companies. See MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL –
    “FERC Matters – Intercompany Interchange
    Contract” of each of the registrants in Item 7 herein
    and Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company,
    each of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power,
    all under “FERC Matters – Intercompany
    Interchange Contract” in Item 8 herein for information
    on the settlement of the FERC proceeding related to the IIC.

Southern Company, each traditional operating company, Southern
    Power, Southern Nuclear, SEGCO and other subsidiaries have
    contracted with SCS to furnish, at direct or allocated cost and
    upon request, the following services: general and design
    engineering, purchasing, accounting and statistical analysis,
    finance and treasury, tax, information resources, marketing,
    auditing, insurance and pension administration, human resources,
    systems and procedures and other services with respect to
    business and operations and power pool transactions. Southern
    Power, SouthernLINC Wireless and Southern Telecom have also
    secured from the traditional operating companies certain
    services which are furnished at cost.

Alabama Power and Georgia Power each have a contract with
    Southern Nuclear to operate Plant Farley and Plants Hatch and
    Vogtle, respectively. See “Regulation – Atomic
    Energy Act of 1954” herein for additional information.

Southern
    Power

Southern Power is an electric wholesale generation subsidiary
    with market-based rate authority from the FERC. Southern Power
    constructs, acquires and manages generating facilities and sells
    the output under long-term, fixed-price capacity contracts both
    to unaffiliated wholesale purchasers as well as to the
    traditional operating companies (under PPAs approved by the
    respective state PSCs). Southern Power’s business
    activities are not subject to traditional state regulation of
    utilities but are subject to regulation by the FERC. Southern
    Power has attempted to insulate itself from significant fuel
    supply, fuel transportation and electric transmission risks by
    making such risks the responsibility of the counterparties to
    the PPAs. However, Southern Power’s overall profit will
    depend on the parameters of the wholesale market and its
    efficient operation of its wholesale generating assets. At
    December 31, 2006, Southern Power had 6,733 megawatts of
    nameplate capacity in commercial operation.

one of the synthetic fuel entities was terminated in 2006.
    Synthetic fuel tax credits will no longer be available after
    December 31, 2007.

SouthernLINC Wireless serves Southern Company’s traditional
    operating companies and markets its services to non-affiliates
    within the Southeast. SouthernLINC Wireless delivers multiple
    wireless communication options including push to talk, cellular
    service, text messaging, wireless internet access and wireless
    data. Its system covers approximately 128,000 square miles
    in the Southeast.

These continuing efforts to invest in and develop new business
    opportunities offer potential returns exceeding those of
    rate-regulated operations. However, these activities also
    involve a higher degree of risk.

Construction
    Programs

The subsidiary companies of Southern Company are engaged in
    continuous construction programs to accommodate existing and
    estimated future loads on their respective systems. For
    estimated construction and environmental expenditures for the
    periods 2007 through 2009, see Note 7 to the financial
    statements of Southern Company, each traditional operating
    company and Southern Power all under “Construction
    Program” in Item 8 herein.

The construction programs are subject to periodic review and
    revision, and actual construction costs may vary from the above
    estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include:
    changes in business conditions; acquisition of additional
    generating assets; revised load growth estimates; changes in
    environmental regulations; changes in existing nuclear plants to
    meet new regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules and
    regulations; increasing costs of labor, equipment and materials;
    and cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that
    costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered.

Under Georgia law, Georgia Power is required to file an IRP for
    approval by the Georgia PSC. Through the IRP process, the
    Georgia PSC must pre-certify the construction of new power
    plants and new PPAs. See “Rate Matters –
    Integrated Resource Planning” herein for additional

Fuel
    Supply

The traditional operating companies’ and SEGCO’s
    supply of electricity is derived predominantly from coal.
    Southern Power’s supply of electricity is primarily fueled
    by natural gas. The sources of generation for the years 2004
    through 2006 are shown below:

The traditional operating companies have long-term agreements in
    place from which they expect to receive approximately 89% of
    their coal burn requirements in 2007. These agreements cover
    remaining terms up to nine years. In 2006, the weighted average
    sulfur content of all coal burned by the traditional operating
    companies was 0.86% sulfur. This sulfur level, along with banked
    and purchased sulfur dioxide allowances, allowed the traditional
    operating companies to remain within limits set by the
    Phase II acid rain requirements of the Clean Air Act. In
    2006, Southern Company purchased approximately
    $50.8 million of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission
    allowances to be used in current and future periods. As
    additional environmental regulations are proposed that impact
    the utilization of coal, the traditional operating
    companies’ fuel mix will be monitored to ensure that the
    traditional operating companies remain in compliance with
    applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, Southern Company
    and the traditional operating companies will continue to
    evaluate the need to purchase additional emission allowances and
    the timing of capital expenditures for emission control
    equipment. See MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL –
    “Environmental Matters – Environmental Statutes
    and Regulations” of Southern Company and each of the
    traditional operating companies in Item 7 herein for
    information on the Clean Air Act.

The Southern Company system has long-term agreements in place
    for its natural gas burn requirements. For 2007, the Southern
    Company system has contracted for 176 billion cubic feet of
    natural gas supply. These agreements cover remaining terms up to
    12 years. In addition to gas supply, the Southern Company
    system has contracts in place for both firm gas transportation
    and storage. Management believes that these contracts provide
    sufficient natural gas supplies, transportation and storage to
    ensure normal operations of the Southern Company system’s
    natural gas generating units.

Changes in fuel prices to the traditional operating companies
    are generally reflected in fuel adjustment

I-4


clauses contained in rate schedules. See “Rate
    Matters – Rate Structure” herein for additional
    information. Southern Power’s PPAs generally provide that
    the counterparty is responsible for substantially all of the
    cost of fuel.

Alabama Power and Georgia Power have numerous contracts covering
    a portion of their nuclear fuel needs for uranium, conversion
    services, enrichment services and fuel fabrication. These
    contracts have varying expiration dates and most are short to
    medium term (less than 10 years). Management believes that
    sufficient capacity for nuclear fuel supplies and processing
    exists to preclude the impairment of normal operations of the
    Southern Company system’s nuclear generating units.

Alabama Power and Georgia Power have contracts with the DOE that
    provide for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The
    DOE failed to begin disposing of spent fuel in 1998, as required
    by the contracts, and Alabama Power and Georgia Power are
    pursuing legal remedies against the government for breach of
    contract. At Plants Farley and Hatch,

on-site

dry
    storage facilities are operational and can be expanded to
    accommodate spent fuel through the life of each plant.
    Sufficient pool storage capacity for spent fuel is available at
    Plant Vogtle to maintain full-core discharge capability for both
    units into 2014. Construction of an

on-site

dry
    storage facility at Plant Vogtle is expected to begin in
    sufficient time to maintain pool full-core discharge capability.

The Energy Act of 1992 established a Uranium Enrichment
    Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund, which is funded in
    part by a special assessment on utilities with nuclear plants,
    including Alabama Power and Georgia Power. This assessment was
    paid over a

15-year

period that ended in 2006. This fund will be used by the DOE for
    the decontamination and decommissioning of its nuclear fuel
    enrichment facilities. The law provides that utilities will
    recover these payments in the same manner as any other fuel
    expense. See Note 1 to the financial statements of Southern
    Company, Alabama Power and Georgia Power under “Nuclear
    Fuel Disposal Costs” in Item 8 herein for additional
    information.

Territory
    Served by the Utilities

The territory in which the traditional operating companies
    provide electric service comprises most of the states of Alabama
    and Georgia together with the northwestern portion of Florida
    and southeastern Mississippi. In this territory there are
    non-affiliated electric distribution systems which obtain some
    or all of their power requirements either directly or indirectly
    from the traditional operating companies. The territory has an
    area of approximately 120,000 square miles and an estimated
    population of approximately 11 million.

Alabama Power is engaged, within the State of Alabama, in the
    generation and purchase of electricity and the distribution and
    sale of such electricity at retail in over 1,000 communities
    (including Anniston, Birmingham, Gadsden, Mobile, Montgomery and
    Tuscaloosa) and at wholesale to 15 municipally-owned electric
    distribution systems, 11 of which are served indirectly through
    sales to AMEA, and two rural distributing cooperative
    associations. Alabama Power also supplies steam service in
    downtown Birmingham. Alabama Power owns coal reserves near its
    Plant Gorgas and uses the output of coal from the reserves in
    its generating plants. Alabama Power also sells, and cooperates
    with dealers in promoting the sale of, electric appliances.

Georgia Power is engaged in the generation and purchase of
    electricity and the transmission, distribution and sale of such
    electricity within the State of Georgia at retail in over 600
    communities (including Athens, Atlanta, Augusta, Columbus, Macon
    and Rome), as well as in rural areas, and at wholesale currently
    to OPC, MEAG, Dalton and Hampton. This territory also includes
    the five-county area in eastern Georgia formerly served by
    Savannah Electric. See Note 3 to the financial statements
    of Georgia Power under “Merger” in Item 8 herein
    for information on the merger of Savannah Electric with and into
    Georgia Power.

Gulf Power is engaged, within the northwestern portion of
    Florida, in the generation and purchase of electricity and the
    distribution and sale of such electricity at retail in 71
    communities (including Pensacola, Panama City and
    Fort Walton Beach), as well as in rural areas, and at
    wholesale to a non-affiliated utility and a municipality.

Mississippi Power is engaged in the generation and purchase of
    electricity and the distribution and sale of such energy within
    the 23 counties of southeastern Mississippi, at retail in 123
    communities (including Biloxi, Gulfport, Hattiesburg, Laurel,
    Meridian and Pascagoula), as well as in rural areas, and at
    wholesale to one municipality, six rural electric distribution
    cooperative associations and one generating and transmitting
    cooperative.

For information relating to

kilowatt-hour

sales by classification for the traditional operating companies,
    see MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS –
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS of each of the traditional operating
    companies in Item 7 herein. Also, for information relating
    to the sources of revenues for the Southern Company system, each
    of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power,
    reference is made to Item 6 herein.

I-5


A portion of the area served by the traditional operating
    companies adjoins the area served by TVA and its municipal and
    cooperative distributors. An Act of Congress limits the
    distribution of TVA power, unless otherwise authorized by
    Congress, to specified areas or customers which generally were
    those served on July 1, 1957.

The RUS has authority to make loans to cooperative associations
    or corporations to enable them to provide electric service to
    customers in rural sections of the country. There are 71
    electric cooperative organizations operating in the territory in
    which the traditional operating companies provide electric
    service at retail or wholesale.

One of these organizations, AEC, is a generating and
    transmitting cooperative selling power to several distributing
    cooperatives, municipal systems and other customers in south
    Alabama and northwest Florida. AEC owns generating units with
    approximately 1,776 megawatts of nameplate capacity, including
    an undivided 8.16% ownership interest in Alabama Power’s
    Plant Miller Units 1 and 2. AEC’s facilities were financed
    with RUS loans secured by long-term contracts requiring
    distributing cooperatives to take their requirements from AEC to
    the extent such energy is available.

Four electric cooperative associations, financed by the RUS,
    operate within Gulf Power’s service area. These
    cooperatives purchase their full requirements from AEC and SEPA
    (a federal power marketing agency). A

non-affiliated

utility also operates within Gulf Power’s service area and
    purchases its full requirements from Gulf Power.

Alabama Power and Gulf Power have entered into separate
    agreements with AEC involving interconnection between their
    respective systems. The delivery of capacity and energy from AEC
    to certain distributing cooperatives in the service areas of
    Alabama Power and Gulf Power is governed by the Southern
    Company/AEC Network Transmission Service Agreement. The rates
    for this service to AEC are on file with the FERC. See
    PROPERTIES – “Jointly-Owned Facilities” in
    Item 2 herein for details of Alabama Power’s
    joint-ownership with AEC of a portion of Plant Miller.

Mississippi Power has an interchange agreement with SMEPA, a
    generating and transmitting cooperative, pursuant to which
    various services are provided, including the furnishing of
    protective capacity by Mississippi Power to SMEPA.

There are 43 electric cooperative organizations operating in, or
    in areas adjoining, territory in the State of Georgia in which
    Georgia Power provides electric service at retail or wholesale.
    Three of these organizations obtain their power from TVA, one
    from Southern Power under a

15-year

agreement which began in January 2005 and one from other
    sources. OPC has a wholesale power contract with the remaining
    38 of these cooperative organizations. OPC and these cooperative
    organizations utilize self-owned generation, some of which is
    acquired and jointly-owned with Georgia Power, megawatt capacity
    purchases from Georgia Power under power supply agreements and
    other arrangements to meet their power supply obligations.
    Georgia Power, OPC and Georgia Systems Operations Corporation
    entered into a new control area compact agreement effective
    March 2005 which replaced previous coordination service
    agreements.

In April 2006, AEC began purchasing 250 megawatts of capacity
    from Georgia Power for a

10-year

term. In January 2005, 29 electric cooperative organizations
    served by OPC and one served by Southern Power began purchasing
    a total of 700 megawatts of capacity from Georgia Power under
    individual contracts for

10-year

terms. Also, in January 2005, the electric cooperative served by
    Southern Power began purchasing 25 megawatts of peaking
    capacity from Georgia Power under a

10-year

contract. This electric cooperative began purchasing
    50 megawatts of coal-fired capacity from Georgia Power
    beginning on April 1, 2006 and ending on December 31,
    2014 and will purchase another 75 megawatts of coal-fired
    capacity from Georgia Power beginning June 1, 2010 and
    ending December 31, 2019. See PROPERTIES –
    “Jointly-Owned Facilities” in Item 2 herein for
    additional information.

There are 65 municipally-owned electric distribution systems
    operating in the territory in which the traditional operating
    companies provide electric service at retail or wholesale.

AMEA was organized under an act of the Alabama legislature and
    is comprised of 11 municipalities. In December 2001, Alabama
    Power entered into a power sales agreement with AMEA which began
    on January 1, 2006. Under this contract, AMEA supplies 70
    to 95 megawatts of power from its combustion turbine plant
    and Alabama Power serves the remainder of its member needs
    through 2010. Beginning in 2011, the amount of power supplied to
    AMEA by Alabama Power is fixed at 2010 levels and AMEA has the
    option to seek other suppliers for its incremental growth needs
    through 2015, at which time the contract terminates.

Forty-eight municipally-owned electric distribution systems and
    one county-owned system receive their requirements through MEAG,
    which was established by a Georgia state statute in 1975. MEAG
    serves these requirements from self-owned generation facilities,
    some of which are acquired and jointly-owned with Georgia Power,
    power purchased from Georgia Power and purchases from other
    resources. In 1997, a pseudo scheduling and services agreement
    was implemented

I-6


between Georgia Power and MEAG. Since 1977, Dalton has filled
    its requirements from self-owned generation facilities, some of
    which are acquired and jointly-owned with Georgia Power, and
    through purchases from Georgia Power pursuant to their partial
    requirements tariff. Beginning January 1, 2003, Dalton
    entered into a power supply agreement with Georgia Power and
    Southern Power pursuant to which it will purchase 134 megawatts
    from Georgia Power and the balance of its requirements, net of
    self-owned generation, from Southern Power for a

15-year

term. In addition, Georgia Power serves the full requirements of
    Hampton’s electric distribution system under a market-based
    contract. See PROPERTIES – “Jointly-Owned
    Facilities” in Item 2 herein for additional
    information.

Georgia Power has entered into substantially similar agreements
    with Georgia Transmission Corporation (formerly OPC’s
    transmission division), MEAG and Dalton providing for the
    establishment of an integrated transmission system to carry the
    power and energy of each. The agreements require an investment
    by each party in the integrated transmission system in
    proportion to its respective share of the aggregate system load.
    See PROPERTIES – “Jointly-Owned Facilities”
    in Item 2 herein for additional information.

See MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE
    EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “Power Sales
    Agreements” of Southern Power in Item 7 herein for
    information concerning its PPAs.

SCS, acting on behalf of the traditional operating companies,
    also has a contract with SEPA providing for the use of the
    traditional operating companies’ facilities at government
    expense to deliver to certain cooperatives and municipalities,
    entitled by federal statute to preference in the purchase of
    power from SEPA, quantities of power equivalent to the amounts
    of power allocated to them by SEPA from certain United States
    government hydroelectric projects.

The retail service rights of all electric suppliers in the State
    of Georgia are regulated by the 1973 State Territorial Electric
    Service Act. Pursuant to the provisions of this Act, all areas
    within existing municipal limits were assigned to the primary
    electric supplier therein (451 municipalities, including
    Atlanta, Columbus, Macon, Augusta, Athens, Rome and Valdosta, to
    Georgia Power; 115 to electric cooperatives; and 50 to
    publicly-owned systems). Areas outside of such municipal limits
    were either to be assigned or to be declared open for customer
    choice of supplier by action of the Georgia PSC pursuant to
    standards set forth in this Act. Consistent with such standards,
    the Georgia PSC has assigned substantially all of the land area
    in the state to a supplier. Notwithstanding such assignments,
    this Act provides that any new customer locating outside of 1973
    municipal limits and having a connected load of at least 900
    kilowatts may receive electric service from the supplier of its
    choice. See “Competition” herein for additional
    information.

Under the provisions of its franchises and concessions and the
    1973 State Territorial Electric Service Act, and pursuant to the
    merger with Savannah Electric, Georgia Power now has the full
    but nonexclusive right to serve the City of Savannah, the Towns
    of Bloomingdale, Pooler, Garden City, Guyton, Newington, Oliver,
    Port Wentworth, Rincon, Tybee Island, Springfield, Thunderbolt
    and Vernonburg, and in conjunction with a secondary supplier,
    the Town of Richmond Hill. In addition, Savannah Electric was
    assigned certain unincorporated areas in Chatham, Effingham,
    Bryan, Bulloch and Screven Counties by the Georgia PSC. In
    connection with the merger of Savannah Electric with and into
    Georgia Power, the Georgia PSC approved the transfer of Savannah
    Electric’s service territory to Georgia Power at the
    effective time of merger. See “Competition” herein for
    additional information.

Pursuant to the 1956 Utility Act, the Mississippi PSC issued
    “Grandfather Certificates” of public convenience and
    necessity to Mississippi Power and to six distribution rural
    cooperatives operating in southeastern Mississippi, then served
    in whole or in part by Mississippi Power, authorizing them to
    distribute electricity in certain specified geographically
    described areas of the state. The six cooperatives serve
    approximately 375,000 retail customers in a certificated area of
    approximately 10,300 square miles. In areas included in a
    “Grandfather Certificate,” the utility holding such
    certificate may, without further certification, extend its lines
    up to five miles; other extensions within that area by such
    utility, or by other utilities, may not be made except upon a
    showing of, and a grant of a certificate of, public convenience
    and necessity. Areas included in such a certificate which are
    subsequently annexed to municipalities may continue to be served
    by the holder of the certificate, irrespective of whether it has
    a franchise in the annexing municipality. On the other hand, the
    holder of the municipal franchise may not extend service into
    such newly annexed area without authorization by the Mississippi
    PSC.

Competition

The electric utility industry in the United States is continuing
    to evolve as a result of regulatory and competitive factors.
    Among the early primary agents of change was the Energy Act of
    1992. The Energy Act of 1992 allowed IPPs to access a
    utility’s transmission network in order to sell electricity
    to other utilities.

Alabama Power currently has cogeneration contracts in effect
    with 10 industrial customers. Under the terms of these
    contracts, Alabama Power purchases excess

I-7


generation of such companies. During 2006, Alabama Power
    purchased approximately 78 million

kilowatt-hours

from such companies at a cost of $3.9 million.

Georgia Power currently has contracts in effect with 10 small
    power producers whereby Georgia Power purchases their excess
    generation. During 2006, Georgia Power purchased 11 million

kilowatt-hours

from such companies at a cost of $2.4 million. Georgia
    Power has PPAs for electricity with two cogeneration facilities.
    Payments are subject to reductions for failure to meet minimum
    capacity output. During 2006, Georgia Power purchased
    356 million

kilowatt-hours

at a cost of $70.6 million from these facilities.

Also during 2006, pursuant to the merger with Savannah Electric,
    Georgia Power purchased energy from seven customer-owned
    generating facilities. Six of the seven customers provide only
    energy to Georgia Power. These six customers make no capacity
    commitment and are not dispatched by Georgia Power. Georgia
    Power does have a contract with the remaining customer for eight
    megawatts of dispatchable capacity and energy. During 2006,
    Georgia Power purchased a total of 48.6 million

kilowatt-hours

from the seven suppliers at a cost of approximately
    $1.9 million.

Gulf Power currently has agreements in effect with various
    industrial, commercial and qualifying facilities pursuant to
    which Gulf Power purchases “as available” energy from
    customer-owned generation. During 2006, Gulf Power purchased
    9.3 million

kilowatt-hours

from such companies for approximately $0.5 million.

Mississippi Power currently has a cogeneration agreement in
    effect with one of its industrial customers. Under the terms of
    this contract, Mississippi Power purchases any excess
    generation. During 2006, this customer had no excess generation.

The competition for retail energy sales among competing
    suppliers of energy is influenced by various factors, including
    price, availability, technological advancements and reliability.
    These factors are, in turn, affected by, among other influences,
    regulatory, political and environmental considerations, taxation
    and supply.

Generally, the traditional operating companies have experienced,
    and expect to continue to experience, competition in their
    respective retail service territories in varying degrees as the
    result of self-generation (as described above) and fuel
    switching by customers and other factors. See also
    “Territory Served by the Utilities” herein for
    additional information concerning suppliers of electricity
    operating within or near the areas served at retail by the
    traditional operating companies.

Southern Power competes with investor owned utilities, IPPs and
    others for wholesale energy sales in the Southeastern United
    States wholesale market. The needs of this market are driven by
    the demands of end users in the Southeast and the generation
    available. Southern Power’s success in wholesale energy
    sales is influenced by various factors including reliability and
    availability of Southern Power’s plants, availability of
    transmission to serve the demand, price and Southern
    Power’s ability to contain costs.

Seasonality

Electric power generation is a seasonal business. At the
    traditional operating companies and Southern Power, the demand
    for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices
    also peaking at that time. Power demand peaks can also be
    recorded during the winter. As a result, the overall operating
    results of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies
    and Southern Power in the future may fluctuate substantially on
    a seasonal basis. In addition, Southern Company, the traditional
    operating companies and Southern Power have historically sold
    less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather
    conditions are milder.

Regulation

State
    Commissions

The traditional operating companies are subject to the
    jurisdiction of their respective state PSCs, which have broad
    powers of supervision and regulation over public utilities
    operating in the respective states, including their rates,
    service regulations, sales of securities (except for the
    Mississippi PSC) and, in the cases of the Georgia PSC and the
    Mississippi PSC, in part, retail service territories. See
    “Territory Served by the Utilities” and “Rate
    Matters” herein for additional information.

Federal
    Power Act

In July 2005, the U.S. Congress passed the Energy Act of
    2005 which repealed the Holding Company Act effective
    February 8, 2006. The traditional operating companies,
    Southern Power and its generation subsidiaries and SEGCO are all
    public utilities engaged in wholesale sales of energy in
    interstate commerce and therefore remain subject to the rate,
    financial and accounting jurisdiction of the FERC under the
    Federal Power Act. Certain financing approvals which would have
    been obtained from the SEC under the repealed Holding Company
    Act now must be obtained from the FERC. In implementing repeal
    of the Holding Company Act, the FERC sought to minimize
    unnecessary administrative burdens and decided to retain an
    “at cost standard” for services rendered by system
    service companies such as SCS, to permit certain existing
    financing authorizations to remain effective without further
    action by the FERC and to reduce reporting requirements. In
    addition to its repeal of the Holding

I-8


Company Act, the Energy Act of 2005 authorized the FERC to
    establish regional reliability organizations authorized to
    enforce reliability standards, established a process for the
    FERC to address impediments to the construction of transmission
    and established clear responsibility for the FERC to prohibit
    manipulative energy trading practices.

Alabama Power and Georgia Power are also subject to the
    provisions of the Federal Power Act or the earlier Federal Water
    Power Act applicable to licensees with respect to their
    hydroelectric developments. Among the hydroelectric projects
    subject to licensing by the FERC are 14 existing Alabama Power
    generating stations having an aggregate installed capacity of
    1,662,400 kilowatts and 18 existing Georgia Power generating
    stations having an aggregate installed capacity of 1,074,696
    kilowatts.

In 2003, Georgia Power started the relicensing process for the
    Morgan Falls project which is located on the Chattahoochee River
    near Atlanta, Georgia and submitted the final license
    application for this facility to the FERC in February 2007. The
    current license for the Morgan Falls project expires in 2009. In
    2007, Georgia Power expects to begin the relicensing process for
    Bartlett’s Ferry which is located on the Chattahoochee
    River near Columbus, Georgia. The current Bartlett’s Ferry
    license expires in 2014 and the application for a new license is
    expected to be submitted to the FERC in 2012. In July 2005,
    Alabama Power filed two applications with the FERC for new

50-year

licenses for its seven hydroelectric developments on the Coosa
    River (Weiss, Henry, Logan Martin, Lay, Mitchell, Jordan and
    Bouldin) and for the Lewis Smith and Bankhead developments on
    the Warrior River. The FERC licenses for all of these nine
    developments expire in July and August of 2007. In 2006, Alabama
    Power initiated the process of developing an application to
    relicense the Martin hydroelectric project located on the
    Tallapoosa River. The current Martin license will expire in 2013
    and the application for a new license is expected to be filed
    with the FERC in 2011. See MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL –
    “FERC Matters – Hydro Relicensing” of
    Alabama Power in Item 7 herein for additional information.

Georgia Power and OPC also have a license, expiring in 2027, for
    the Rocky Mountain Plant, a pure pumped storage facility of
    847,800 kilowatt capacity. See PROPERTIES –
    “Jointly-Owned Facilities” in Item 2 herein for
    additional information.

Licenses for all projects, excluding those discussed above,
    expire in the period

2013-2033

in
    the case of Alabama Power’s projects and in the period

2014-2039

in
    the case of Georgia Power’s projects.

Upon or after the expiration of each license, the United States
    Government, by act of Congress, may take over the project or the
    FERC may relicense the project either to the original licensee
    or to a new licensee. In the event of takeover or relicensing to
    another, the original licensee is to be compensated in
    accordance with the provisions of the Federal Power Act, such
    compensation to reflect the net investment of the licensee in
    the project, not in excess of the fair value of the property
    taken, plus reasonable damages to other property of the licensee
    resulting from the severance therefrom of the property taken. If
    the FERC does not act on the new license application prior to
    the expiration of the existing license, the FERC is required to
    issue annual licenses, under the same terms and conditions of
    the existing license, until a new license is issued.

Atomic
    Energy Act of 1954

Alabama Power, Georgia Power and Southern Nuclear are subject to
    the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended,
    which vests jurisdiction in the NRC over the construction and
    operation of nuclear reactors, particularly with regard to
    certain public health and safety and antitrust matters. The
    National Environmental Policy Act has been construed to expand
    the jurisdiction of the NRC to consider the environmental impact
    of a facility licensed under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as
    amended.

The NRC operating licenses for Plant Vogtle units 1 and 2
    currently expire in January 2027 and February 2029,
    respectively. In January 2002, the NRC granted Georgia Power a

20-year

extension of the licenses for both units at Plant Hatch which
    permits the operation of units 1 and 2 until 2034 and 2038,
    respectively. Georgia Power plans to file an application with
    the NRC in June 2007 to extend the licenses for Plant Vogtle
    units 1 and 2 for an additional 20 years. In May 2005, the
    NRC granted Alabama Power a

20-year

extension of the licenses for both units at Plant Farley which
    permits operation of units 1 and 2 until 2037 and 2041,
    respectively.

See Notes 1 and 9 to the financial statements of Southern
    Company, Alabama Power and Georgia Power in Item 8 herein
    for information on nuclear decommissioning costs and nuclear
    insurance.

FERC
    Matters

See MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE
    EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “FERC Matters” of each
    of the registrants in Item 7 herein for information on
    matters regarding the FERC.

I-9


Environmental
    Statutes and Regulations

Southern Company’s operations are subject to extensive
    regulation by state and federal environmental agencies under a
    variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental
    media, including air, water and land resources. Compliance with
    these environmental requirements involves significant capital
    and operating costs, a major portion of which is expected to be
    recovered through existing ratemaking provisions. There is no
    assurance, however, that all such costs will be recovered.

Compliance with the federal Clean Air Act and resulting
    regulations has been, and will continue to be, a significant
    focus for Southern Company, each traditional operating company
    and SEGCO. See MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL –
    “Environmental Matters” of Southern Company and each
    of the traditional operating companies in Item 7 herein for
    additional information about the Clean Air Act and other
    environmental issues, including the litigation brought by the
    EPA under the New Source Review provisions of the Clean Air Act.

Additionally, each traditional operating company and SEGCO has
    incurred costs for environmental remediation of various sites.
    See MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE
    EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “Environmental
    Matters – Environmental Statutes and
    Regulation – Environmental Remediation” of
    Southern Company and each of the traditional operating companies
    in Item 7 herein for information regarding environmental
    remediation efforts. Also, see Note 3 to the financial
    statements of Southern Company, Georgia Power, Gulf Power and
    Mississippi Power under “Environmental Matters –
    Environmental Remediation” in Item 8 herein for
    information regarding the identification of sites that may
    require environmental remediation.

The traditional operating companies, Southern Power and SEGCO
    are unable to predict at this time what additional steps they
    may be required to take as a result of the implementation of
    existing or future quality control requirements for air, water
    and hazardous or toxic materials, but such steps could adversely
    affect system operations and result in substantial additional
    costs.

The outcome of the matters mentioned above under
    “Regulation” cannot now be determined, except that
    these developments may result in delays in obtaining appropriate
    licenses for generating facilities, increased construction and
    operating costs or reduced generation, the nature and extent of
    which, while not determinable at this time, could be substantial.

Rate
    Matters

Rate
    Structure

The rates and service regulations of the traditional operating
    companies are uniform for each class of service throughout their
    respective service areas. Rates for residential electric service
    are generally of the block type based upon

kilowatt-hours

used and include minimum charges. Residential and other rates
    contain separate customer charges. Rates for commercial service
    are presently of the block type and, for large customers, the
    billing demand is generally used to determine capacity and
    minimum bill charges. These large customers’ rates are
    generally based upon usage by the customer and include rates
    with special features to encourage off-peak usage. Additionally,
    Alabama Power, Gulf Power and Mississippi Power are generally
    allowed by their respective state PSCs to negotiate the terms
    and cost of service to large customers. Such terms and cost of
    service, however, are subject to final state PSC approval.

Fuel and net purchased energy costs are recovered through
specific fuel
    cost recovery provisions at the traditional operating companies. These fuel cost
    recovery provisions are adjusted to reflect increases or
    decreases in such costs as needed. Gulf
    Power’s and Mississippi Power’s fuel cost recovery
    provisions are adjusted annually to reflect increases or
    decreases in such costs. Georgia Power is currently required to
    file for an adjustment to its fuel cost recovery rate no later
    than March 1, 2008. Alabama Power’s fuel clause is
    adjusted as required. Revenues are adjusted for differences
    between recoverable costs and amounts actually recovered in
    current rates.

Approved environmental compliance and storm damage costs are
    recovered at Alabama Power, Gulf Power and Mississippi Power
    through cost recovery provisions approved by their respective
    state PSCs. Within limits approved by their respective PSCs,
    these rates are adjusted to reflect increases or
    decreases in such costs as required. Alabama Power recovers the
cost of new plant and Gulf Power recovers purchased power capacity
and conservation costs through cost recovery provisions which are adjusted as required
    to reflect increases or decreases in such costs as needed.
    Georgia Power continues to recover environmental compliance,
    storm damage and new plant costs through its base rates.
    Revenues are adjusted for differences between recoverable costs
    and amounts actually recovered in current rates.

See MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE
    EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “PSC Matters” of
    Southern Company and each of the

    Matters” in Item 8 herein for a discussion of rate
    matters. Also, see Note 1 to the financial statements of
    Southern Company and each of the traditional operating companies
    in Item 8 herein for a discussion of recovery of fuel costs
    and environmental compliance costs through rates.

Southern Power is authorized by the FERC to sell power to
    non-affiliates at market-based prices and to make short-term
    opportunity sales at market rates. Special FERC approval must be
    obtained with respect to a market-based contract with an
    affiliate. See MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
    ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL –
    “FERC Matters – Market-Based Rate Authority”
    of Southern Power in Item 7 herein and Note 3 to the
    financial statements of Southern Power under “FERC
    Matters – Market-Based Rate Authority” in
    Item 8 herein for a discussion of rate matters.

Integrated
    Resource Planning

Georgia Power must file an IRP with the Georgia PSC that
    specifies how it intends to meet the future electrical needs of
    its customers through a combination of demand-side and
    supply-side resources. The Georgia PSC must certify any new
    demand-side or supply-side resources. Once certified, the lesser
    of actual or certified construction costs and purchased power
    costs will be recoverable through rates.

In December 2002, the Georgia PSC certified a PPA between Duke
    Energy and Georgia Power for 620 megawatts for seven years that
    began in June 2005.

K-Gen

Power,
    LLC has replaced Duke Energy as a party to this contract.

In May 2004, the Georgia PSC ordered Georgia Power and Savannah
    Electric to purchase the McIntosh combined cycle generating
    facility from Southern Power and place it into their respective
    rate bases. The McIntosh resource was previously certified as a
    PPA by the Georgia PSC in the supply-side certification
    conducted in 2002 and, at the same time, the Georgia PSC also
    approved the de-certification of Savannah Electric’s Plant
    Riverside, units 4 through 8, effective in May 2005. The
    McIntosh units produce a combined 1,240 megawatts and have been
    available since June 2005. Pursuant to the merger with Savannah
    Electric, Georgia Power now has 100% ownership of the McIntosh
    units. See Note 3 to the financial statements of Georgia
    Power under “Retail Regulatory Matters – Rate
    Plans” in Item 8 herein for additional information.

Following the Georgia PSC’s approval of the 2004 IRP,
    Georgia Power de-certified the Atkinson combustion turbine units
    5A and 5B totaling approximately 80 megawatts of capacity
    and extended the life of the Kraft combustion turbine unit until
    such time as its retirement is warranted.

Georgia Power received certification of its RFP for
    approximately 1,000 megawatts to meet its future supply-side
    capacity needs for 2009 and beyond.

In January 2006, Georgia Power filed an application with the
    Georgia PSC to approve an amendment to Georgia Power’s IRP
    in connection with the merger to add Savannah Electric customers
    and generating assets. In June 2006, the Georgia PSC approved
    the merger between Georgia Power and Savannah Electric. Also,
    the Georgia PSC approved the transfer of territory, customers,
    power plants and demand-side programs from Savannah Electric to
    Georgia Power.

In March 2006, Georgia Power issued RFPs for approximately 2,100
    and 1,400 megawatts, respectively, to meet its 2010 and 2011
    supply-side needs. For the 2011 RFP, Georgia Power submitted
    self-build proposals that compare to the market. Additionally,
    Georgia Power will continue a residential load management
    program which was certified by the Georgia PSC for up to 40
    megawatts of equivalent supply-side capacity. Georgia Power will
    continue to utilize approximately eight megawatts of capacity
    from existing qualifying facilities under firm contracts and
    continue to add additional resources as ordered by the Georgia
    PSC.

On January 31, 2007, Georgia Power filed its 2007 IRP with
    the Georgia PSC. With the 2007 IRP and subsequent filings,
    Georgia Power proposes to: (1) retire the coal units at
    Plant McDonough and replace them with combined-cycle natural gas
    units; (2) gain approval for five new energy efficiency
    pilot programs and request that certified demand-side management
    programs receive similar financial treatment as supply-side
    options; (3) pursue up to three new renewable generation
    projects with a Georgia Power ownership interest;
    (4) establish new nuclear units as a preferred option to
    meet demand in the 2015/2016 timeframe; and (5) establish
    policy that baseload generating plants should be built by
    Georgia Power and should not be subject to the competitive bid
    process. The Georgia PSC decision on this 2007 IRP filing is
    expected in July 2007.

Item 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

In addition to the other information in this

Form 10-K,

including MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS –
    FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL in Item 7 of each registrant, and
    other documents filed by Southern Company

and/or

its
    subsidiaries with the SEC from time to time, the following
    factors should be carefully considered in evaluating Southern
    Company and its subsidiaries. Such factors could affect actual
    results and cause results to differ materially from

I-12


those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or
    on behalf of, Southern Company

and/or

its
    subsidiaries.

Risks
    Related to the Energy Industry

Southern Company and its subsidiaries are subject to
    substantial governmental regulation. Compliance with current and
    future regulatory requirements and procurement of necessary
    approvals, permits and certificates may result in substantial
    costs to Southern Company and its subsidiaries.

Southern Company and its subsidiaries, including the traditional
    operating companies and Southern Power, are subject to
    substantial regulation from federal, state and local regulatory
    agencies. Southern Company and its subsidiaries are required to
    comply with numerous laws and regulations and to obtain numerous
    permits, approvals and certificates from the governmental
    agencies that regulate various aspects of their businesses,
    including customer rates, service regulations, retail service
    territories, sales of securities, asset acquisitions and sales,
    accounting policies and practices and the operation of
    fossil-fuel, hydroelectric and nuclear generating facilities.
    For example, the rates charged to wholesale customers by the
    traditional operating companies and by Southern Power must be
    approved by the FERC. In addition, the respective state PSCs
    must approve the traditional operating companies’ rates for
    retail customers. While the retail rates approved by the
    respective state PSCs are designed to provide for recovery of
    costs and a return on invested capital, there can be no
    assurance that a state PSC will not deem certain costs to be
    imprudently incurred and not subject to recovery.

Southern Company and its subsidiaries believe the necessary
    permits, approvals and certificates have been obtained for its
    existing operations and that their respective businesses are
    conducted in accordance with applicable laws; however, the
    impact of any future revision or changes in interpretations of
    existing regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations
    applicable to Southern Company or any of its subsidiaries cannot
    now be predicted. Changes in regulation or the imposition of
    additional regulations could influence the operating environment
    of Southern Company and its subsidiaries and may result in
    substantial costs.

General
    Risks Related to Operation of Southern Company’s Utility
    Subsidiaries

The regional power market in which Southern Company and its
    utility subsidiaries compete may have changing transmission
    regulatory structures, which could affect the ownership of these
    assets and related revenues and expenses.

The traditional operating companies currently own and operate
    transmission facilities as part of a vertically integrated
    utility. Transmission revenues are not separated from generation
    and distribution revenues in their approved retail rates. Since
    1999, when the FERC issued final rules on RTOs, there have been
    a number of proceedings at FERC designed to encourage further
    voluntary formation of RTOs or to mandate their formation. Under
    this new transmission regulatory structure, the traditional
    operating companies could transfer functional control (but not
    ownership) of their transmission facilities to an independent
    third party. While there are no active proceedings at FERC that
    would require Southern Company to participate in a RTO, current
    FERC efforts that may potentially change the regulatory

and/or

operational structure of transmission include rules related to
    the standardization of generation interconnection, as well as an
    inquiry into, among other things, market power by vertically
    integrated utilities. The financial condition, net income and
    cash flows of Southern Company and its utility subsidiaries
    could be adversely affected by future changes in the federal
    regulatory or operational structure of transmission.

Certain events in the energy markets that are beyond the
    control of Southern Company and its subsidiaries have increased
    the level of public and regulatory scrutiny in the energy
    industry and in the capital markets. The reaction to these
    events may result in new laws or regulations related to the
    business operations or the accounting treatment of the existing
    operations of Southern Company and its subsidiaries which could
    have a negative impact on the net income or access to capital of
    Southern Company and its subsidiaries.

As a result of the energy crisis in California during the summer
    of 2001, the Enron Corporation bankruptcy, investigations by
    governmental authorities into energy trading activities and the
    August 2003 power outage in the Northeast, companies in
    regulated and unregulated electric utility businesses have been
    under an increased amount of public and regulatory scrutiny with
    respect to, among other things, accounting practices, financial
    disclosures and relationships with independent auditors. This
    increased scrutiny has led to substantial changes in laws and
    regulations affecting Southern Company and its subsidiaries,
    including, among others, enhanced internal control and auditor
    independence requirements, financial statement certification
    requirements, more frequent SEC reviews of financial statements
    and accelerated and additional SEC filing requirements. New
    accounting and disclosure requirements have changed the way
    Southern Company and its subsidiaries are required to record
    revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. Southern Company
    expects continued regulatory focus on accounting and financial
    reporting issues. Future

I-13


disruptions in the industry such as those described above and
    any additional resulting regulations may have a negative impact
    on the net income or access to capital of Southern Company and
    its subsidiaries.

Deregulation or restructuring in the electric industry may
    result in increased competition and unrecovered costs which
    could negatively impact the net income of Southern Company and
    the traditional operating companies and the value of their
    respective assets.

Increased competition, which may result from restructuring
    efforts, could have a significant adverse financial impact on
    Southern Company and its traditional operating companies.
    Increased competition could result in increased pressure to
    lower the cost of electricity. Any adoption in the territories
    served by the traditional operating companies of retail
    competition and the unbundling of regulated energy service could
    have a significant adverse financial impact on Southern Company
    and the traditional operating companies due to an impairment of
    assets, a loss of retail customers, lower profit margins, an
    inability to recover reasonable costs or increased costs of
    capital. Southern Company and the traditional operating
    companies cannot predict if or when they may be subject to
    changes in legislation or regulation, nor can Southern Company
    and the traditional operating companies predict the impact of
    these changes.

Additionally, the electric utility industry has experienced a
    substantial increase in competition at the wholesale level. As a
    result of changes in federal law and regulatory policy,
    competition in the wholesale electricity market has greatly
    increased due to a greater participation by traditional
    electricity suppliers, non-utility generators, IPPs, wholesale
    power marketers and brokers and due to the trading of energy
    futures contracts on various commodities exchanges. In addition,
    FERC rules on transmission service are designed to facilitate
    competition in the wholesale market on a nationwide basis by
    providing greater flexibility and more choices to wholesale
    power customers.

Potential changes to the criteria used by the FERC for
    approval of market-based contracts may negatively impact the
    traditional operating companies’ and Southern Power’s
    ability to charge market-based rates.

Each of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power
    have authorization from the FERC to sell power to nonaffiliates,
    including short-term opportunity sales, at market-based prices.
    Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a
    market-based sale to an affiliate. In December 2004, the FERC
    initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s
    generation dominance within its retail service territory. The
    ability to charge market-based rates in other markets is not an
    issue in that proceeding. Any new market-based rate sales by any
    subsidiary of Southern Company in Southern Company’s retail
    service territory entered into during a

15-month

refund period beginning February 27, 2005 could be subject
    to refund to the level of the default cost-based rates, pending
    the outcome of the proceeding. Such sales through May 27,
    2006, the end of the refund period were approximately
    $19.7 million for the Southern Company system. In the event
    that FERC’s default mitigation measures for entities that
    are found to have market power are ultimately applied, the
    traditional operating companies and Southern Power may be
    required to charge cost-based rates for certain wholesale sales
    in the Southern Company retail service territory, which may be
    lower than negotiated market-based rates.

In addition, in May 2005 the FERC started an investigation to
    determine whether Southern Company satisfies the other three
    parts of FERC’s market-based rate analysis: transmission
    market power, barriers to entry and affiliate abuse or
    reciprocal dealing. The FERC established a new

15-month

refund period related to this expanded investigation. Any new
    market-based rate sales involving any Southern Company
    subsidiary could be subject to refund to the extent the FERC
    orders lower rates as a result of this new investigation. Such
    sales through October 19, 2006, the end of the refund
    period, were approximately $55.4 million for the Southern
    Company system, of which $15.5 million relates to sales
    inside the retail service territory discussed above.

Risks
    Related to Environmental Regulation

Southern Company’s and the traditional operating
    companies’ costs of compliance with environmental laws are
    significant. The costs of compliance with future environmental
    laws and the incurrence of environmental liabilities could
    negatively impact the net income and cash flows of Southern
    Company, the traditional operating companies or Southern
    Power.

Southern Company and the traditional operating companies are
    subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental
    requirements which, among other things, regulate air emissions,
    water discharges and the management of hazardous and solid waste
    in order to adequately protect the environment. Compliance with
    these legal requirements requires Southern Company and the
    traditional operating companies to commit significant
    expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment,
    environmental monitoring, emissions fees and permits at all of
    their respective facilities. These expenditures are significant
    and Southern Company and the traditional operating companies
    expect that they will increase in the future. Through 2006,
    Southern Company had invested approximately $3.1 billion in
    capital projects

I-14


to comply with these requirements, with annual totals of
    $661 million, $423 million and $300 million for
    2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Southern Company expects that
    capital expenditures to assure compliance with existing and new
    regulations will be an additional $1.66 billion,
    $1.65 billion and $1.27 billion for 2007, 2008 and
    2009, respectively. Because Southern Company’s compliance
    strategy is impacted by changes to existing environmental laws
    and regulations, the cost, availability, and existing inventory
    of emission allowances, and Southern Company’s fuel mix,
    the ultimate outcome cannot be determined at this time.

Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various
    types, including property damage, personal injury, and citizen
    enforcement of environmental requirements, such as opacity and
    other air quality standards, has increased generally throughout
    the United States. In particular, personal injury claims for
    damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have
    become more frequent.

If Southern Company, the traditional operating companies or
    Southern Power fail to comply with environmental laws and
    regulations, even if caused by factors beyond their control,
    that failure may result in the assessment of civil or criminal
    penalties and fines. The EPA has filed civil actions against
    Alabama Power and Georgia Power alleging violations of the new
    source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. Southern Company
    is a party to suits alleging its emissions of carbon dioxide, a
    greenhouse gas, contribute to global warming. An adverse outcome
    in any one of these cases could require substantial capital
    expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could
    possibly require the payment of substantial penalties. This
    could affect future results of operations, cash flows, and
    possibly financial condition if such costs are not recovered
    through regulated rates.

Existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised or
    new laws and regulations related to global climate change, air
    quality or other environmental and health concerns may be
    adopted or become applicable to Southern Company, the
    traditional operating companies and Southern Power. Revised or
    additional laws and regulations could result in significant
    additional expense and operating restrictions on the facilities
    of the traditional operating companies or Southern Power or
    increased compliance costs which may not be fully recoverable
    from customers and would therefore reduce the net income of
    Southern Company, the traditional operating companies or
    Southern Power. The cost impact of such legislation would depend
    upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined
    at this time.

Risks
    Related to Southern Company and its Business

Southern Company may be unable to meet its ongoing and future
    financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock
    if its subsidiaries are unable to pay upstream dividends or
    repay funds to Southern Company.

Southern Company is a holding company and, as such, Southern
    Company has no operations of its own. Substantially all of
    Southern Company’s consolidated assets are held by
    subsidiaries. Southern Company’s ability to meet its
    financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock
    at the current rate is primarily dependent on the net income and
    cash flows of its subsidiaries and their ability to pay upstream
    dividends or to repay funds to Southern Company. Prior to
    funding Southern Company, Southern Company’s subsidiaries
    have financial obligations that must be satisfied, including
    among others, debt service and preferred and preference stock
    dividends. Southern Company’s subsidiaries are separate
    legal entities and have no obligation to provide Southern
    Company with funds for its payment obligations.

The financial performance of Southern Company and its
    subsidiaries may be adversely affected if its subsidiaries are
    unable to successfully operate their facilities.

Southern Company’s financial performance depends on the
    successful operation of its subsidiaries’ electric
    generating, transmission and distribution facilities. Operating
    these facilities involves many risks, including:

•

operator error and breakdown or failure of equipment or
    processes;

•

operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or
    other regulatory requirements;

•

labor disputes;

•

terrorist attacks;

•

fuel or material supply interruptions;

•

compliance with mandatory reliability standards if
    adopted; and

•

catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions,
    floods, hurricanes, pandemic health events such as an avian
    influenza or other similar occurrences.

A decrease or elimination of revenues from power produced by the
    electric generating facilities or an increase in the cost of
    operating the facilities would reduce the net income and cash
    flows and could adversely impact the financial condition of the
    affected traditional operating company or Southern Power and of
    Southern Company.

The revenues of Southern Company, the traditional operating
    companies and Southern Power depend in

I-15


part on sales under PPAs. The failure of a counterparty to
    one of these PPAs to perform its obligations, or the failure to
    renew the PPAs, could have a negative impact on the net income
    and cash flows of the affected traditional operating company or
    Southern Power and of Southern Company.

Most of Southern Power’s generating capacity has been sold
    to purchasers under PPAs having initial terms of five to
    15 years. In addition, the traditional operating companies
    enter into PPAs with non-affiliated parties. Revenues are
    dependent on the continued performance by the purchasers of
    their obligations under these PPAs. Even though Southern Power
    and the traditional operating companies have a rigorous credit
    evaluation, the failure of one of the purchasers to perform its
    obligations could have a negative impact on the net income and
    cash flows of the affected traditional operating company or
    Southern Power and of Southern Company. Although these credit
    evaluations take into account the possibility of default by a
    purchaser, actual exposure to a default by a purchaser may be
    greater than the credit evaluation predicts. Neither Southern
    Power nor the traditional operating companies can predict
    whether the PPAs will be renewed at the end of their respective
    terms or on what terms any renewals may be made. If a PPA is not
    renewed, a replacement PPA cannot be assured.

Southern Company, the traditional operating companies and
    Southern Power may incur additional costs or delays in the
    construction of new plants or environmental facilities and may
    not be able to recover their investment. The facilities of
    Southern Company, the traditional operating companies and
    Southern Power require ongoing capital expenditures.

Certain of the traditional operating companies and Southern
    Power are in the process of constructing new generating
    facilities and adding environmental controls equipment at
    existing generating facilities. Southern Company intends to
    continue its strategy of developing and constructing other new
    facilities, expanding existing facilities and adding
    environmental control equipment. The completion of these types
    of projects without delays or cost overruns is subject to
    substantial risks, including:

•

shortages and inconsistent quality of equipment, materials and
    labor;

•

work stoppages;

•

permits, approvals and other regulatory matters;

•

adverse weather conditions;

•

unforeseen engineering problems;

•

environmental and geological conditions;

•

delays or increased costs to interconnect its facilities to
    transmission grids;

•

unanticipated cost increases; and

•

attention to other projects.

Tightening labor markets in the Southeast and increasing costs
    of materials have resulted in increasing cost estimates for
    Southern Company’s subsidiaries’ construction
    projects. If a traditional operating company or Southern Power
    is unable to complete the development or construction of a
    facility or decides to delay or cancel construction of a
    facility, it may not be able to recover its investment in that
    facility. In addition, construction delays and contractor
    performance shortfalls can result in the loss of revenues and
    may, in turn, adversely affect the net income and financial
    position of a traditional operating company or Southern Power
    and of Southern Company. Furthermore, if construction projects
    are not completed according to specification, a traditional
    operating company or Southern Power and Southern Company may
    incur liabilities and suffer reduced plant efficiency, higher
    operating costs and reduced net income.

Once facilities come into commercial operation, ongoing capital
    expenditures are required to maintain reliable levels of
    operation. Significant portions of the traditional operating
    companies’ existing facilities were constructed many years
    ago. Older generation equipment, even if maintained in
    accordance with good engineering practices, may require
    significant capital expenditures to maintain efficiency, to
    comply with changing environmental requirements or to provide
    reliable operations.

Changes in technology may make Southern Company’s
    electric generating facilities owned by the traditional
    operating companies and Southern Power less competitive.

A key element of the business model of Southern Company, the
    traditional operating companies and Southern Power is that
    generating power at central power plants achieves economies of
    scale and produces power at relatively low cost. There are other
    technologies that produce power, most notably fuel cells,
    microturbines, windmills and solar cells. It is possible that
    advances in technology will reduce the cost of alternative
    methods of producing power to a level that is competitive with
    that of most central power station electric production. If this
    were to happen and if these technologies achieved economies of
    scale, the market share of Southern Company, the traditional
    operating companies and Southern Power could be eroded, and the
    value of their respective electric generating facilities could
    be reduced. Changes in technology could also alter the channels
    through which retail electric customers buy or utilize power,
    which could reduce the revenues or increase the expenses of
    Southern Company, the traditional operating companies or
    Southern Power.

Operation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks,
    including environmental, health, regulatory, terrorism and
    financial risks that could result in fines or the

I-16


closure of Southern Company’s nuclear units owned by
    Alabama Power or Georgia Power, and which may present potential
    exposures in excess of insurance coverage.

Alabama Power owns two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds
    undivided interests in, and contracts for operation of, four
    nuclear units. These six units are operated by Southern Nuclear
    and represent approximately 3,680 megawatts, or 9.1%, of
    Southern Company’s generation capacity as of
    December 31, 2006. These nuclear facilities are subject to
    environmental, health and financial risks such as

on-site

storage of spent nuclear fuel, the ability to dispose of such
    spent nuclear fuel, the ability to maintain adequate reserves
    for decommissioning, potential liabilities arising out of the
    operation of these facilities and the threat of a possible
    terrorist attack. Alabama Power and Georgia Power maintain
    decommissioning trusts and external insurance coverage to
    minimize the financial exposure to these risks; however, it is
    possible that damages could exceed the amount of insurance
    coverage.

The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose
    licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of
    nuclear generation facilities. In the event of non-compliance,
    the NRC has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit,
    or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the
    situation, until compliance is achieved. NRC orders or new
    regulations related to increased security measures and any
    future safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could require
    Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make substantial operating
    and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition,
    although Alabama Power, Georgia Power and Southern Company have
    no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at their
    plants, if an incident did occur, it could result in substantial
    costs to Alabama Power or Georgia Power and Southern Company. A
    major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could
    cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of
    any domestic nuclear unit.

In addition, potential terrorist threats and increased public
    scrutiny of utilities could result in increased nuclear
    licensing or compliance costs that are difficult or impossible
    to predict.

The generation and energy marketing operations of Southern
    Company, the traditional operating companies and Southern Power
    are subject to risks, many of which are beyond their control,
    including changes in power prices and fuel costs, that may
    reduce Southern Company’s, the traditional operating
    companies’ and Southern Power’s revenues and increase
    costs.

The generation and energy marketing operations of Southern
    Company, the traditional operating companies and Southern Power
    are subject to changes in power prices or fuel costs, which
    could increase the cost of producing power or decrease the
    amount Southern Company, the traditional operating companies and
    Southern Power receive from the sale of power. The market prices
    for these commodities may fluctuate over relatively short
    periods of time. Southern Company, the traditional operating
    companies and Southern Power attempt to mitigate risks
    associated with fluctuating fuel costs by passing these costs on
    to customers through the traditional operating companies’
    fuel cost recovery clauses or through PPAs. Among the factors
    that could influence power prices and fuel costs are:

•

prevailing market prices for coal, natural gas, uranium, fuel
    oil and other fuels used in the generation facilities of the
    traditional operating companies and Southern Power including
    associated transportation costs, and supplies of such
    commodities;

•

demand for energy and the extent of additional supplies of
    energy available from current or new competitors;

•

liquidity in the general wholesale electricity market;

•

weather conditions impacting demand for electricity;

•

seasonality;

•

transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies;

•

availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources;

•

forced or unscheduled plant outages for the Southern Company
    system, its competitors or third party providers;

•

the financial condition of market participants;

•

the economy in the service territory and in general, including
    the impact of economic conditions on industrial and commercial
    demand for electricity;

•

natural disasters, wars, embargos, acts of terrorism and other
    catastrophic events; and

•

federal, state and foreign energy and environmental regulation
    and legislation.

Certain of these factors could increase the expenses of the
    traditional operating companies or Southern Power and Southern
    Company. For the traditional operating companies, such increases
    may not be fully recoverable through rates. Other of these
    factors could reduce the revenues of the traditional operating
    companies or Southern Power and Southern Company.

As a result of increasing fuel costs, the traditional operating
    companies have accrued significant

I-17


underrecovered fuel cost balances. In addition, Gulf Power and
    Mississippi Power have significant deficit balances in their
    storm cost recovery reserves as a result of Hurricanes Ivan,
    Dennis and Katrina. The traditional operating companies may
    experience similar deficit balances following future storms.
    While the traditional operating companies are generally
    authorized to recover underrecovered fuel costs through
    fuel cost recovery clauses and storm recovery costs through
    special rate provisions administered by the
    respective PSCs, recovery may be denied if costs are
    deemed to be imprudently incurred and delays in the
    authorization of such recovery could negatively impact the cash
    flows of the affected traditional operating companies and
    Southern Company.

The use of derivative contracts by Southern Company and its
    subsidiaries in the normal course of business could result in
    financial losses that negatively impact the net income of
    Southern Company and its subsidiaries.

Southern Company and its subsidiaries, including the traditional
    operating companies and Southern Power, use derivative
    instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forwards, to
    manage their commodity and financial market risks and, to a
    lesser extent, engage in limited trading activities. Southern
    Company and its subsidiaries could recognize financial losses as
    a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts
    or if a counterparty fails to perform. In the absence of
    actively quoted market prices and pricing information from
    external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments
    can involve management’s judgment or use of estimates. As a
    result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of
    alternative valuation methods could affect the value of the
    reported fair value of these contracts.

The traditional operating companies and Southern Power may
    not be able to obtain adequate fuel supplies, which could limit
    their ability to operate their facilities.

The traditional operating companies and Southern Power purchase
    fuel, including coal, natural gas, uranium and fuel oil, from a
    number of suppliers. Disruption in the delivery of fuel,
    including disruptions as a result of, among other things,
    transportation delays, weather, labor relations, force majuere
    events or environmental regulations affecting any of these fuel
    suppliers, could limit the ability of the traditional operating
    companies and Southern Power to operate their respective
    facilities, and thus reduce the net income of the affected
    traditional operating company or Southern Power and Southern
    Company.

The traditional operating companies are dependent on coal for
    much of their electric generating capacity. Each traditional
    operating company has coal supply contracts in place; however,
    there can be no assurance that the counterparties to these
    agreements will fulfill their obligations to supply coal to the
    traditional operating companies. The suppliers under these
    agreements may experience financial or technical problems which
    inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to the
    traditional operating companies. In addition, the suppliers
    under these agreements may not be required to supply coal to the
    traditional operating companies under certain circumstances,
    such as in the event of a natural disaster. If the traditional
    operating companies are unable to obtain their coal requirements
    under these contracts, the traditional operating companies may
    be required to purchase their coal requirements at higher
    prices, which may not be fully recoverable through rates.

In addition, Southern Power in particular, and the traditional
    operating companies to a lesser extent, are dependent on natural
    gas for a portion of their electric generating capacity. Natural
    gas supplies can be subject to disruption in the event
    production or distribution is curtailed. For example, in
    connection with the 2005 hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico,
    production and distribution of natural gas was limited for a
    period of time, resulting in shortages and significant increases
    in the price of natural gas. In addition, world market
    conditions for fuels, including the policies of the Organization
    of Petroleum Exporting Countries, can impact the price and
    availability of natural gas.

Demand for power could exceed supply capacity, resulting in
    increased costs for purchasing capacity in the open market or
    building additional generation capabilities.

Through the traditional operating companies and Southern Power,
    Southern Company is currently obligated to supply power to
    retail customers and wholesale customers under long-term PPAs.
    At peak times, the demand for power required to meet this
    obligation could exceed Southern Company’s available
    generation capacity. Market or competitive forces may require
    that the traditional operating companies or Southern Power
    purchase capacity on the open market or build additional
    generation capabilities. Because regulators may not permit the
    traditional operating companies to pass all of these purchase or
    construction costs on to their customers, the traditional
    operating companies may not be able to recover any of these
    costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the
    time between the incurrence of costs of purchased or constructed
    capacity and the traditional operating companies’ recovery
    in customers’ rates. Under Southern Power’s long-term
    fixed price PPAs, Southern Power would not have the ability to
    recover any of these costs. These situations could have negative
    impacts on net income and cash flows for the

I-18


affected traditional operating company or Southern Power and
    Southern Company.

The operating results of Southern Company, the traditional
    operating companies and Southern Power are affected by weather
    conditions and may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly
    basis.

Electric power generation is generally a seasonal business. In
    many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot
    summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time. In
    other areas, power demand peaks during the winter. As a result,
    the overall operating results of Southern Company, the
    traditional operating companies and Southern Power in the future
    may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. In addition,
    Southern Company, the traditional operating companies and
    Southern Power have historically sold less power, and
    consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are
    milder. Unusually mild weather in the future could reduce the
    revenues, net income, available cash and borrowing ability of
    Southern Company, the traditional operating companies and
    Southern Power.

Mirant and The Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of
    Mirant Corporation have filed a claim against Southern Company
    seeking substantial monetary damages in connection with
    transfers made by Mirant to Southern Company prior to the Mirant
    spin-off.

In July 2003, Mirant filed for voluntary reorganization under
    Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. In January 2006,
    Mirant’s plan of reorganization became effective, and
    Mirant emerged from bankruptcy.

In 2005, Mirant, as debtor in possession, and The Official
    Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Mirant Corporation filed a
    complaint against Southern Company in the U.S. Bankruptcy
    Court for the Northern District of Texas, which was amended in
    July 2005, February 2006 and May 2006. The third amended
    complaint (the complaint) alleges that Southern Company caused
    Mirant to engage in certain fraudulent transfers and to pay
    illegal dividends to Southern Company prior to the spin-off. The
    complaint also seeks to recharacterize certain advances from
    Southern Company to Mirant for investments in energy facilities
    from debt to equity. The complaint further alleges that Southern
    Company is liable to Mirant’s creditors for the full amount
    of Mirant’s liability and that Southern Company breached
    its fiduciary duties to Mirant and its creditors, caused Mirant
    to breach fiduciary duties to its creditors, and aided and
    abetted breaches of fiduciary duties by Mirant’s directors
    and officers. The complaint also seeks recoveries under theories
    of restitution, unjust enrichment, and alter ego. The complaint
    seeks monetary damages in excess of $2 billion plus
    interest, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs.
    Finally, the complaint includes an objection to Southern
    Company’s pending claims against Mirant in the Bankruptcy
    Court (which relate to reimbursement under the separation
    agreements of payments such as income taxes, interest, legal
    fees, and other guarantees described in Note 7 to the
    financial statements of Southern Company in Item 8 herein)
    and seeks equitable subordination of Southern Company’s
    claims to the claims of all other creditors. Southern Company
    served an answer to the complaint in June 2006.

On January 10, 2006, the U.S. District Court for the
    Northern District of Texas granted Southern Company’s
    motion to withdraw this action from the Bankruptcy Court and, on
    February 15, 2006, granted Southern Company’s motion
    to transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the
    Northern District of Georgia. On May 19, 2006, Southern
    Company filed a motion for summary judgment seeking entry of
    judgment against the plaintiff as to all counts of the
    complaint. On December 11, 2006, the U.S. District
    Court for the Northern District of Georgia granted in part and
    denied in part the motion. As a result, certain breach of
    fiduciary duty claims are barred; all other claims in the
    complaint may proceed. Southern Company believes there is no
    meritorious basis for the claims in the complaint and is
    vigorously defending itself in this action. However, the final
    outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

IRS challenges to Southern Company’s income tax
    deductions taken in connection with four international leveraged
    lease transactions could result in the payment of substantial
    additional interest and penalties and could materially impact
    Southern Company’s cash flow and net income.

Southern Company participates in four international leveraged
    lease transactions and receives federal income tax deductions
    for depreciation and amortization, as well as interest on
    related debt. In connection with its audit of Southern
    Company’s tax returns for 1996 through 2001, the IRS
    proposed to disallow Southern Company’s tax losses related
    to one international leveraged lease (a

lease-in-lease-out,

or LILO) transaction. In February 2005, Southern Company reached
    a negotiated settlement with the IRS relating to this matter,
    which is now final.

In connection with its audit of 2000 and 2001, the IRS also
    challenged Southern Company’s deductions related to three
    other international lease

(sale-in-lease-out,

or SILO) transactions. In the third quarter 2006, Southern
    Company paid the full amount of the disputed tax and the
    applicable interest on the SILO issue for tax years

2000-2001

and filed a claim for refund which has been denied by the IRS.
    The disputed tax amount is $79 million and the related
    interest is approximately $24 million for these tax years.
    This payment, and the subsequent IRS disallowance of the refund
    claim, closed the issue with

I-19


the IRS and Southern Company plans to proceed with litigation.
    The IRS has also raised the SILO issues for tax years 2002 and
    2003. The estimated amount of disputed tax and interest for
    these years is approximately $83 million and
    $15 million, respectively. The tax and interest for these
    tax years was paid to the IRS in the fourth quarter 2006.
    Southern Company has accounted for both payments in 2006 as
    deposits, as management believes no additional tax or interest
    liabilities have been incurred.

Although the payment of the tax liability did not affect
    Southern Company’s results of operations under accounting
    standards in effect through December 31, 2006, it did
    impact cash flow. For tax years 2000 through 2006, Southern
    Company has claimed $284 million in tax benefits related to
    these SILO transactions challenged by the IRS. Southern Company
    believes these transactions are valid leases for U.S. tax
    purposes and thus the related deductions are allowable. Southern
    Company will continue to defend this position through
    administrative appeals or litigation. The ultimate outcome of
    these matters cannot now be determined.

In July 2006, the FASB released new interpretations for the
    accounting for both leveraged leases and uncertain tax positions
    that were adopted January 1, 2007. For the LILO transaction
    settled with the IRS in February 2005, the leveraged leases
    accounting interpretation requires that Southern Company
    recognize a cumulative effect reduction to beginning 2007
    retained earnings of approximately $17 million at adoption
    and change the timing of income recognized under the lease.

For the SILO transactions which are the subject of pending
    litigation, Southern Company is continuing to evaluate the
    impact of the new interpretations but estimates that the
    reduction to retained earnings in 2007 could be approximately
    $115 million to $135 million. The impact on Southern
    Company’s net income of these accounting interpretations
    would also be dependent on the outcome of the pending litigation
    or changes in assumptions related to uncertain tax positions but
    could be significant and potentially material.

Risks
    Related to Market and Economic Volatility

The business of Southern Company, the traditional operating
    companies and Southern Power is dependent on their ability to
    successfully access capital markets. The inability of Southern
    Company, any traditional operating company or Southern Power to
    access capital may limit its ability to execute its business
    plan or pursue improvements and make acquisitions that Southern
    Company, the traditional operating companies or Southern Power
    may otherwise rely on for future growth.

Southern Company, the traditional operating companies and
    Southern Power rely on access to both short-term money markets
    and longer-term capital markets as a significant source of
    liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash
    flow from their respective operations. If Southern Company, any
    traditional operating company or Southern Power is not able to
    access capital at competitive rates, its ability to implement
    its business plan or pursue improvements and make acquisitions
    that Southern Company, the traditional operating companies or
    Southern Power may otherwise rely on for future growth will be
    limited. Each of Southern Company, the traditional operating
    companies and Southern Power believes that it will maintain
    sufficient access to these financial markets based upon current
    credit ratings. However, certain market disruptions or a
    downgrade of the credit rating of Southern Company, any
    traditional operating company or Southern Power may increase its
    cost of borrowing or adversely affect its ability to raise
    capital through the issuance of securities or other borrowing
    arrangements. Such disruptions could include:

•

an economic downturn;

•

the bankruptcy of an unrelated energy company;

•

capital market conditions generally;

•

market prices for electricity and gas;

•

terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on Southern
    Company’s facilities or unrelated energy companies;

•

war or threat of war; or

•

the overall health of the utility industry.

Southern Company, the traditional operating companies and
    Southern Power are subject to risks associated with a changing
    economic environment, including their ability to obtain
    insurance, the financial stability of their respective customers
    and their ability to raise capital.

The threat of terrorism and the related military action by the
    United States continue to affect the nation’s economy and
    financial markets. The insurance industry has also been
    disrupted by these events as well as recent hurricane activity
    on the Gulf Coast. The availability of insurance covering risks
    Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, Southern
    Power and their respective competitors typically insure against
    may decrease, and the insurance that Southern Company, the
    traditional operating companies and Southern Power are able to
    obtain may have higher deductibles, higher premiums and more
    restrictive policy terms. Any economic downturn or disruption of
    financial markets could constrain the capital available to
    Southern Company’s, the traditional operating
    companies’ and Southern Power’s industry and could
    reduce access to funding for the respective operations of
    Southern

I-20


Company, the traditional operating companies and Southern Power,
    as well as the financial stability of their respective customers
    and counterparties. These factors could adversely affect
    Southern Company’s subsidiaries’ ability to achieve
    energy sales growth, thereby decreasing Southern Company’s
    level of future net income.

Certain of the traditional operating companies have
    substantial investments in the Gulf Coast region which can be
    subject to major storm activity. The ability of the traditional
    operating companies to recover costs and replenish reserves in
    the event of a major storm, other natural disaster, terrorist
    attack or other catastrophic event generally will require
    regulatory action. Additionally, storm damage may affect the
    availability and cost of insurance to these traditional
    operating companies.

Each traditional operating company maintains a reserve for
    property damage to cover the cost of damages from major storms
    to its transmission and distribution lines and the cost of
    uninsured damages to its generating facilities and other
    property. In September 2004, Hurricane Ivan hit the Gulf coast
    of Florida and Alabama, causing significant damage to the
    service areas of Alabama Power and Gulf Power. In July and
    August 2005, Hurricanes Dennis and Katrina, respectively, hit
    the Gulf coast of the United States and caused significant
    damage in the service areas of Gulf Power, Alabama Power and
    Mississippi Power. In each case, costs to the respective
    traditional operating companies exceeded their respective storm
    cost reserves and insurance coverage and were subsequently
    approved for recovery by their respective state PSCs. In the
    event a traditional operating company experiences a natural
    disaster, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event, recovery
    of costs in excess of reserves and insurance coverage is subject
    to the approval of its state PSC. While the traditional
    operating companies generally are entitled to recover prudently
    incurred costs incurred in connection with such an event, any
    denial by the applicable state PSC or delay in recovery of any
    portion of such costs could have a material negative impact on a
    traditional operating company’s results of operations

and/or

cash
    flows.

Notes:

Except as discussed below under “Titles to Property,”
    the principal plants and other important units of the
    traditional operating companies, Southern Power and SEGCO are
    owned in fee by the respective companies. It is the opinion of
    management of each such company that its operating properties
    are adequately maintained and are substantially in good
    operating condition.

Mississippi Power owns a

79-mile

length of

500-kilovolt

transmission line which is leased to Entergy Gulf States. The
    line, completed in 1984, extends from Plant Daniel to the
    Louisiana state line. Entergy Gulf States is paying a use fee
    over a

40-year

period covering all expenses and the amortization of the
    original $57 million cost of the line. At December 31,
    2006, the unamortized portion of this cost was approximately
    $26.2 million.

The all-time maximum demand on the traditional operating
    companies, Southern Power and SEGCO was 35,889,900 kilowatts and
    occurred on August 7, 2006. This amount excludes demand
    served by capacity retained by MEAG, OPC and SEPA. The reserve
    margin for the traditional operating companies, Southern Power
    and SEGCO at that time was 17.1%. See SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA in
    Item 6 herein for additional information on peak demands.

Jointly-Owned

Alabama Power and Georgia Power have contracted to operate and
    maintain the respective units in which each has an interest
    (other than Rocky Mountain and Intercession City) as agent for
    the joint owners. SCS provides operation and maintenance
    services for Plant Stanton A.

In addition, Georgia Power has commitments regarding a portion
    of a five percent interest in Plant Vogtle owned by MEAG that
    are in effect until the later of retirement of the plant or the
    latest stated maturity date of MEAG’s bonds issued to
    finance such ownership interest. The payments for capacity are
    required whether any capacity is available. The energy cost is a
    function of each unit’s variable operating costs. Except
    for the portion of the capacity payments related to the Georgia
    PSC’s disallowances of Plant Vogtle costs, the cost of such
    capacity and energy is included in purchased power from
    non-affiliates in Georgia Power’s statements of income in
    Item 8 herein.

Titles to
    Property

The traditional operating companies’, Southern Power’s
    and SEGCO’s interests in the principal plants (other than
    certain pollution control facilities, one small hydroelectric
    generating station leased by Georgia Power, combined cycle units
    at Plant Daniel leased by Mississippi Power and the land on
    which five combustion turbine generators of Mississippi Power
    are located, which is held by easement) and other important
    units of the respective companies are owned in fee by such
    companies, subject only to the liens pursuant to pollution
    control bonds of Alabama Power and Gulf Power and to excepted
    encumbrances as defined therein. At December 31, 2006, Gulf
    Power’s interest in its principal plants was subject to a
    lien under a mortgage indenture. The mortgage indenture and the
    lien were discharged effective January 26, 2007. See
    Note 6 to the financial statements of Southern Company,
    Alabama Power and Gulf Power under “Assets Subject to
    Lien” and Note 7 to the financial statements of
    Mississippi Power under “Operating Leases – Plant
    Daniel Combined Cycle Generating Units” in Item 8
    herein for additional information. The traditional operating
    companies own the fee interests in certain of their principal
    plants as tenants in common. See “Jointly-Owned
    Facilities” herein for additional information. Properties
    such as electric transmission and distribution lines and steam
    heating mains are constructed principally on

rights-of-way

which are maintained under franchise or are held by easement
    only. A substantial portion of lands submerged by reservoirs is
    held under flood right easements.

    Controls And Procedures.

As of the end of the period covered by this annual report,
    Southern Company, the traditional operating companies and
    Southern Power conducted separate evaluations under the

    management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and
    operation of the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
    in

Sections 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

of
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon these
    evaluations, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial
    Officer, in each case, concluded that the disclosure controls
    and procedures are effective in alerting them in a timely manner
    to material information relating to their company (including its
    consolidated subsidiaries, if any) required to be included in

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Southern Company and
    Subsidiary Companies 2006 Annual Report

Southern Company’s management is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal
    control over financial reporting as required by the
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and as defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

A control system can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
    assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.

Under management’s supervision, an evaluation of the design
    and effectiveness of Southern Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting was conducted based on the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that
    Southern Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting was effective as of December 31, 2006.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as auditors of Southern Company’s
    financial statements, has issued an attestation report on
    management’s assessment of the effectiveness of Southern
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006. Deloitte & Touche LLP’s
    report, which expresses unqualified opinions on
    management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of
    Southern Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting, is included herein.

Internal
    Control Over Financial Reporting

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Southern Company

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting

(page II-7),

that Southern Company (the “Company”) maintained
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material
    respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal
    Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our
    opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 of the Company and our report dated
    February 26, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
    financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph
    regarding a change in the method of accounting for the funded
    status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans.

Consolidated
    Financial Statements

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Southern Company

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
    consolidated statements of capitalization of Southern Company
    and Subsidiary Companies (the “Company”) as of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, comprehensive income, common
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2006. These
    financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements
    (pages II-38 to II-79) present fairly, in all material
    respects, the financial position of Southern Company and
    Subsidiary Companies at December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the
    results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
    three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America.

As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, in 2006
    the Company changed its method of accounting for the funded
    status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the
    criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
    February 26, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on
    management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting and an
    unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

Southern Company and Subsidiary
    Companies 2006 Annual Report

OVERVIEW

Business
    Activities

The primary business of Southern Company (the Company) is
    electricity sales in the Southeast by the traditional operating
    companies – Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power,
    and Mississippi Power – and Southern Power. Savannah
    Electric and Power Company (Savannah Electric) was also a
    traditional operating company subsidiary of Southern Company
    until being merged with and into Georgia Power effective
    July 1, 2006. Southern Power constructs, acquires, and
    manages generation assets and sells electricity at market-based
    rates in the wholesale market.

Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of
    Southern Company’s electricity business. These factors
    include the traditional operating companies’ ability to
    maintain a stable regulatory environment, to achieve energy
    sales growth, and to effectively manage and secure timely
    recovery of rising costs. These costs include those related to
    growing demand, increasingly stringent environmental standards,
    fuel prices, and storm restoration following multiple
    hurricanes. Since the beginning of 2004, each of the traditional
    operating companies completed successful retail base rate
    proceedings. These regulatory actions have provided earnings
    stability and enabled the recovery of substantial capital
    investments to facilitate the continued reliability of the
    transmission and distribution network and to continue
    environmental improvements at the generating plants. During 2005
    and 2006, each of the traditional operating companies completed
    proceedings as necessary to address fuel and storm damage cost
    recovery. Appropriately balancing environmental expenditures
    with customer prices will continue to challenge the Company for
    the foreseeable future.

Another major factor is the profitability of the competitive
    market-based wholesale generating business and federal
    regulatory policy, which may impact Southern Company’s
    level of participation in this market. Southern Power continued
    executing its regional strategy in 2006 through the acquisition
    of power plants in North Carolina and Florida. Consistent with
    prior acquisitions, the newly acquired plants have associated
    power purchase agreements (PPAs) in place. The Company continues
    to face regulatory challenges related to transmission and market
    power issues at the national level.

Southern Company’s other business activities include an
    investment in a synthetic fuel producing entity (which claims
    federal income tax credits designed to offset its operating
    losses), leveraged lease projects, telecommunications, and
    energy-related services. Management continues to evaluate the
    contribution of each of these activities to total shareholder
    return and may pursue acquisitions and dispositions accordingly.
    The synthetic fuel tax credits will no longer be available after
    December 31, 2007. In January 2006, the sale of the
    Company’s natural gas marketing business was completed.

Key
    Performance Indicators

In striving to maximize shareholder value while providing
    cost-effective energy to more than four million customers,
    Southern Company continues to focus on several key indicators.
    These indicators include customer satisfaction, plant
    availability, system reliability, and earnings per share (EPS),
    excluding earnings from synthetic fuel investments. Southern
    Company’s financial success is directly tied to the
    satisfaction of its customers. Key elements of ensuring customer
    satisfaction include outstanding service, high reliability, and
    competitive prices. Management uses customer satisfaction
    surveys and reliability indicators to evaluate the
    Company’s results.

Peak season equivalent forced outage rate (Peak Season EFOR) is
    an indicator of fossil/hydro plant availability and efficient
    generation fleet operations during the months when generation
    needs are greatest. The rate is calculated by dividing the
    number of hours of forced outages by total generation hours. The
    2006 Peak Season EFOR of 1.11 percent is better than the
    target and a significant improvement over 2005 Peak Season EFOR.
    Transmission and distribution system reliability performance is
    measured by the frequency and duration of outages. Performance
    targets for reliability are set internally based on historical
    performance, expected weather conditions, and expected capital
    expenditures. The performance for 2006 exceeded most targets on
    these reliability measures.

Southern Company’s synthetic fuel investments generate tax
    credits as a result of synthetic fuel production. Due to higher
    oil prices in 2006, these tax credits were partially phased out
    and one synfuel investment was terminated. As a result, Southern
    Company’s synthetic fuel investments did not contribute
    significantly to earnings and EPS during 2006. These tax credits
    will no longer be available after December 31, 2007.
    Southern Company management uses EPS, excluding synfuel
    earnings, to evaluate the performance

of Southern Company’s ongoing business activities. Southern
    Company believes the presentation of earnings and EPS excluding
    the results of the synthetic fuel investments also is useful for
    investors because it provides investors with additional
    information for purposes of comparing Southern Company’s
    performance for such periods. The presentation of this
    additional information is not meant to be considered a
    substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles.

Southern Company’s 2006 results compared with its targets
    for some of these key indicators are reflected in the following

    performance achieved in 2006 reflects the continued emphasis
    that management places on these indicators as well as the
    commitment shown by employees in achieving or exceeding
    management’s expectations.

Earnings

Southern Company’s net income was $1.57 billion in
    2006, a decrease of 1.1 percent from the prior year. The
    lower earnings compared with the prior year were primarily the
    result of a reduction of tax credits related to the production
    of synthetic fuels. This decrease was largely offset by
    continued economic strength and a growing customer base. Net
    income was $1.59 billion in 2005 and $1.53 billion in
    2004, reflecting increases over the prior year of
    3.8 percent and 4.0 percent, respectively. Basic EPS,
    including discontinued operations, was $2.12 in 2006, $2.14 in
    2005, and $2.07 in 2004. Diluted EPS, which factors in
    additional shares related to stock options, was 2 cents lower
    than basic EPS for 2006 and 1 cent lower for each of 2005 and
    2004.

Dividends

Southern Company has paid dividends on its common stock since
    1948. Dividends paid per share of common stock were $1.535 in
    2006, $1.475 in 2005, and $1.415 in 2004. In January 2007,
    Southern Company declared a quarterly dividend of 38.75 cents
    per share. This is the 237th consecutive quarter that
    Southern Company has paid a dividend equal to or higher than the
    previous quarter. The Company targets a dividend payout ratio of
    approximately 70 to 75 percent of net income, excluding
    earnings from synthetic fuel businesses. For 2006, the actual
    payout ratio was 73 percent, excluding synthetic fuel
    earnings, and 72.5 percent overall.

Retail revenues increased $636 million, $1.4 billion,
    and $857 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The
    significant factors driving these changes are shown in the
    preceding table. The increase in base rates in 2005 is primarily
    due to approval by the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC)
    of a retail base rate increase at Georgia Power. Electric rates
    for the traditional operating companies include provisions to
    adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the
    energy component of purchased power costs. Under these
    provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses,
    including the fuel component of purchased power, and do not
    affect net income. Certain of the traditional operating
    companies also have clauses to recover other costs, such as
    environmental, storm damage, new plants, and PPAs.

Sales for resale revenues consist of PPAs with investor-owned
    utilities and electric cooperatives, short-term opportunity
    sales, and unit power sales contracts. Southern Company’s
    average wholesale contract extends more than 10 years and,
    as a result, the Company has significantly limited its
    remarketing risk. Short-term opportunity sales are made at
    market-based rates that generally provide a margin above the
    Company’s variable cost to produce the energy. Revenues
    associated with PPAs and opportunity sales were as follows:

Capacity revenues under unit power sales contracts, principally
    sales to Florida utilities, reflect the recovery of fixed costs
    and a return on investment, and energy is generally sold at
    variable cost. Unit power kilowatt-hour (KWH) sales increased
    0.2 percent, 1.7 percent, and 1.9 percent in
    2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Fluctuations in oil and
    natural gas prices, which are the primary fuel sources for unit
    power sales customers, influence changes in these sales.
    However, because the energy is generally sold at variable cost,
    these fluctuations have a minimal effect on earnings. The
    capacity and energy components of the unit power sales contracts
    were as follows:

In 2006, sales for resale revenues increased $155 million
    as a result of a 10.5 percent increase in the average cost
    of fuel per net KWH generated, as well as revenues resulting
    from new PPAs in 2006. In addition, Southern Company assumed
    four PPAs through the acquisitions of Plants DeSoto and Rowan in
    June and September 2006, respectively. The 2006 increase was
    partially offset by a decrease in opportunity sales.

In 2005, sales for resale revenues increased $326 million
    primarily due to a 26.5 percent increase in the average
    cost of fuel per net KWH generated. In addition, Southern
    Company entered into new PPAs with 30 electric membership
    cooperatives (EMCs) and Flint EMC, both beginning in January
    2005, and assumed two PPAs in June 2005 in connection with the
    acquisition of Plant Oleander.

In 2004, sales for resale revenues decreased $17 million
    primarily due to a lower price differential between market
    prices and the Company’s marginal cost that reduced the
    availability of short-term opportunity sales. Milder summer
    weather throughout the Southeast also reduced demand.

Retail energy sales in 2006 increased 2.3 billion KWH as a
    result of customer growth of 1.7 percent, sustained
    economic growth primarily in the residential and commercial
    customer classes, and warmer weather in 2006 when compared to
    2005. Retail energy sales in 2005 increased 1.9 billion KWH
    as a result of sustained economic growth and customer growth of
    1.2 percent. Hurricane Katrina dampened customer growth
    from previous years and was the primary contributor to the
    decrease in industrial sales in 2005. In addition, in 2005, some
    Georgia Power industrial customers were reclassified from
    industrial to commercial to be consistent with the rate
    structure approved by the Georgia PSC resulting in higher
    commercial sales and lower industrial sales in 2005 when
    compared with 2004. Retail energy sales in 2004 were strong
    across all customer classes as a result of an improved economy
    in the Southeast and customer growth of 1.5 percent.

Energy sales for resale increased by 2.3 billion KWH in
    2006, increased by 2.6 billion KWH in 2005, and decreased
    by 5.3 billion KWH in 2004. The increases in sales for
    resale in 2006 and 2005 are related primarily to the new PPAs
    discussed above. The decrease in 2004 compared with 2003 is
    primarily due to a lower price differential between market
    prices and the Company’s marginal cost that reduced the
    availability of short-term opportunity sales. Milder summer
    weather throughout the Southeast also reduced demand.

Fuel
    and Purchased Power Expenses

Fuel costs constitute the single largest expense for the
    electric utilities. The mix of fuel sources for generation of
    electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of
    fuel consumed, and the availability of generating units. Details
    of Southern Company’s generation, fuel, and purchased power
    are as follows:

Fuel and purchased power expenses were $5.7 billion in
    2006, an increase of $467 million or 8.9 percent above
    the prior year costs. This increase was the result of a
    $319 million increase in the cost of fuel and purchased
    power and $148 million related to an increase in total KWH
    generated and purchased.

In 2005, fuel and purchased power expenses were
    $5.2 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion or
    29.1 percent above 2004 costs. This increase was the result
    of a $1.2 billion increase in the cost of fuel and
    purchased power, partially offset by $47 million related to
    a decrease in total KWH generated and purchased.

Fuel and purchased power expenses were $4.0 billion in
    2004, an increase of $570 million or 16.4 percent
    above 2003 costs. This increase was the result of a
    $473 million increase in the cost of fuel and purchased
    power and $97 million related to an increase in total KWH
    generated and purchased.

While prices have moderated somewhat in 2006, a significant
    upward trend in the cost of coal and natural gas has emerged
    since 2003, and volatility in these markets is expected to
    continue. Increased coal prices have been influenced by a
    worldwide increase in demand as a result of rapid economic
    growth in China, as well as by increases in mining and fuel
    transportation costs. Higher natural gas prices in the United
    States are the result of increased demand and slightly lower gas
    supplies despite increased drilling activity. Natural gas
    production

and supply interruptions, such as those caused by the 2004 and
    2005 hurricanes, result in an immediate market response;
    however, the long-term impact of this price volatility may be
    reduced by imports of liquefied natural gas if new liquefied gas
    facilities are built. Fuel expenses generally do not affect net
    income, since they are offset by fuel revenues under the
    traditional operating companies’ fuel cost recovery
    provisions. Likewise, Southern Power’s PPAs generally
    provide that the purchasers are responsible for substantially
    all of the cost of fuel.

Other
    Operations and Maintenance Expenses

Other operations and maintenance expenses were
    $3.3 billion, $3.2 billion, and $3.0 billion,
    increasing $70 million, $215 million, and
    $148 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Other
    production expenses at fossil, hydro, and nuclear plants
    increased $3 million, $58 million, and
    $53 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.
    Production expenses fluctuate from year to year due to
    variations in outage schedules, flexible spending projects, and
    normal increases in costs.

Administrative and general expenses increased $29 million
    in 2006 as a result of a $17 million increase in salaries
    and wages and a $24 million increase in pension expense,
    partially offset by a $16 million reduction in medical
    expenses. Administrative and general expenses increased
    $73 million in 2005 related to a $33 million increase
    in employee benefits; a $22 million increase in shared
    service expenses, primarily increases in Sarbanes-Oxley Act
    compliance costs, legal costs, and other corporate expenses; and
    a $9 million increase in property damage. Administrative
    and general expenses increased $106 million in 2004
    primarily related to a $41 million increase in employee
    benefits, a $23 million increase in shared service
    expenses, primarily nuclear security, and a $13 million
    increase in property insurance.

Transmission and distribution expenses increased
    $30 million, $60 million, and $49 million in
    2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Transmission and
    distribution expenses increased in 2006 primarily due to
    expenses associated with recovery of prior year storm costs
    through natural disaster recovery clauses and additional
    investment in distribution to meet customer growth. Transmission
    and distribution expenses increased in 2005 primarily as a
    result of $48 million of expenses recorded by Alabama Power
    in accordance with an accounting order approved by the Alabama
    PSC primarily to offset the costs of Hurricane Ivan and restore
    the natural disaster reserve. In accordance with the accounting
    order, Alabama Power also returned certain regulatory
    liabilities related to deferred income taxes to its retail
    customers; therefore, the combined effect of the accounting
    order had no impact on net income. See Note 3 to the
    financial statements under “Storm Damage Cost
    Recovery” for additional information. Transmission and
    distribution expenses fluctuate from year to year due to
    variations in maintenance schedules, flexible spending projects,
    and normal increases in costs and are the primary basis for the
    2004 increase.

The 2004 increase in other operations and maintenance expenses
    was partially offset by a $60 million regulatory liability
    related to Plant Daniel that was expensed in 2003.

Depreciation
    and Amortization Expenses

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased
    $27 million in 2006 as a result of the acquisitions of
    Plants DeSoto, Rowan, and Oleander in June 2006, September 2006,
    and June 2005, respectively, and a reduction in the amortization
    of the Plant Daniel regulatory liability. An increase in
    depreciation rates at Southern Power associated with adoption of
    a new depreciation study also contributed to the 2006 increase.
    Partially offsetting the 2006 increase was the amortization of a
    Georgia Power regulatory liability related to the levelization
    of certain purchased power capacity costs as ordered by the
    Georgia PSC under the terms of the retail rate order effective
    January 1, 2005. See Note 3 to the financial
    statements under “Georgia Power Retail Regulatory
    Matters” for additional information.

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased
    $229 million in 2005 as a result of additional plant in
    service and from the expiration in 2004 of certain provisions in
    Georgia Power’s retail rate plan for the three years ended
    December 31, 2004 (2001 Retail Rate Plan). In accordance
    with the 2001 Retail Rate Plan, Georgia Power amortized an
    accelerated cost recovery liability as a credit to amortization
    expense and recognized new Georgia PSC-certified purchased power
    capacity costs in rates evenly over the three years ended
    December 31, 2004. See Note 3 to the financial
    statements under “Georgia Power Retail Regulatory
    Matters” for additional information.

Depreciation and amortization expenses declined by
    $64 million in 2004 primarily as a result of amortization
    of the Plant Daniel regulatory liability and a Georgia Power
    regulatory liability related to the levelization of certain
    purchased power capacity costs that reduced amortization expense
    by $17 million and $90 million, respectively, from the
    prior year. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “PSC
    Matters – Mississippi Power” herein and

under “Georgia Power Retail Regulatory Matters” for
    more information on these regulatory adjustments. These
    reductions were partially offset by a higher depreciable plant
    base.

Taxes
    Other Than Income Taxes

Taxes other than income taxes increased by $39 million in
    2006 primarily as a result of increases in franchise and
    municipal gross receipts taxes associated with increases in
    revenues from energy sales as well as increases in property
    taxes associated with additional plant in service. Taxes other
    than income taxes increased by $52 million in 2005
    primarily as a result of increases in franchise and municipal
    gross receipts taxes associated with increases in revenues from
    energy sales. In 2004, taxes other than income taxes increased
    by $40 million primarily as a result of additional plant in
    service and a higher property tax base.

Interest
    Expenses

Total interest charges and other financing costs increased by
    $75 million in 2006 due to a $78 million increase
    associated with $708 million in additional debt outstanding
    at December 31, 2006 compared to December 31, 2005 and
    a $7 million increase associated with an increase in
    average interest rates on variable rate debt, partially offset
    by a $6 million increase in capitalized interest associated
    with construction projects and a $3 million reduction in
    other interest costs. Total interest charges and other financing
    costs increased by $62 million in 2005 associated with an
    additional $863 million in debt outstanding at
    December 31, 2005 as compared to December 31, 2004 and
    an increase in average interest rates on variable rate debt.
    Variable rates on pollution control bonds are highly correlated
    with the Bond Market Association (BMA) Municipal Swap Index,
    which averaged 2.5 percent in 2005 and 1.2 percent in
    2004. Variable rates on commercial paper and senior notes are
    highly correlated with the one-month London Interbank Offer Rate
    (LIBOR), which averaged 3.4 percent in 2005 and
    1.5 percent in 2004. An additional $17 million
    increase in 2005 was the result of a lower percentage of
    interest costs capitalized as construction projects reached
    completion. The $19 million increase in interest charges
    and other financing costs in 2004 was also the result of a lower
    percentage of interest costs capitalized as construction
    projects reached completion.

Other
    Business Activities

Southern Company’s other business activities include the
    parent company (which does not allocate operating expenses to
    business units), investments in synthetic fuels and leveraged
    lease projects, telecommunications, and energy-related services.
    These businesses are classified in general categories and may
    comprise one or more of the following subsidiaries: Southern
    Company Holdings invests in various energy-related projects,
    including synthetic fuels and leveraged lease projects that
    receive tax benefits, which contribute significantly to the
    economic results of these investments; SouthernLINC Wireless
    provides digital wireless communications services to the
    traditional operating companies and also markets these services
    to the public within the Southeast; Southern Telecom provides
    fiber optics services in the Southeast; and Southern Company Gas
    was a retail gas marketer serving customers in the State of
    Georgia. On January 4, 2006, Southern Company Gas completed
    the sale of substantially all of its assets and is reflected in
    the condensed income statement below as discontinued operations.

Southern Company’s non-electric operating revenues
    decreased $8 million in 2006 primarily as a result of a
    $21 million decrease in revenues at SouthernLINC Wireless
    related to lower average revenue per subscriber and lower
    equipment and accessory sales. The 2006 decrease was partially
    offset by a $12 million increase in

    Companies 2006 Annual Report

fuel procurement service revenues. Higher production and
    increased fees in the synthetic fuel business contributed to the
    $12 million increase in 2005. The $7 million decrease
    in 2004 was primarily due to lower operating revenues in one of
    the Company’s energy-related services businesses, partially
    offset by an increase in SouthernLINC Wireless revenues as a
    result of increased wireless subscribers.

Other operations and maintenance expenses for these other
    businesses declined $59 million in 2006 primarily as a
    result of $32 million of lower production expenses related
    to the termination of Southern Company’s membership
    interest in one of the synthetic fuel entities, $13 million
    attributed to the wind-down of one of the Company’s
    energy-related services businesses, and $7 million of lower
    expenses resulting from the March 2006 sale of a subsidiary that
    provided rail car maintenance services. Other operations and
    maintenance expenses increased by $12 million in 2005 as a
    result of $9 million of higher losses for property damage,
    $2 million in higher network costs at SouthernLINC
    Wireless, and an $11 million increase in shared service
    expenses, partially offset by the $12.5 million bad debt
    reserve in 2004 discussed below. Other operations and
    maintenance expenses increased $28 million in 2004
    primarily due to a $3 million increase in advertising, a
    $5 million increase in shared services expenses, and a
    $12.5 million bad debt reserve related to additional
    federal income taxes and interest Southern Company paid on
    behalf of Mirant Corporation (Mirant). See FUTURE EARNINGS
    POTENTIAL – “Mirant Matters” herein and
    Note 3 to the financial statements under “Mirant
    Matters – Mirant Bankruptcy” for additional
    information.

The 2006 and 2005 decreases in depreciation and amortization
    expenses when compared to the prior years were not material.
    Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased $9 million
    in 2004 primarily as a result of $10 million of expenses
    associated with the repurchase of debt at Southern Company
    Holdings in 2003.

Southern Company made investments in two synthetic fuel
    production facilities that generate operating losses. These
    investments also allow Southern Company to claim federal income
    tax credits that offset these operating losses and make the
    projects profitable. The decrease in equity in losses of
    unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2006 reflects the result of
    terminating Southern Company’s membership interest in one
    of the synthetic fuel entities which reduced the amount of
    Southern Company’s share of the losses and, therefore, the
    funding obligation for the year. The decrease also resulted from
    lower operating expenses while the production facilities at the
    other synthetic fuel entity were idled from May to September
    2006 due to higher oil prices. The increase in equity in losses
    of unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2005 reflects the results of
    additional production expenses at the synthetic fuel production
    facilities. The 2004 decrease in equity in losses of
    unconsolidated subsidiaries when compared to the prior year was
    not material. The federal income tax credits resulting from
    these investments totaled $65 million in 2006,
    $177 million in 2005, and $146 million in 2004. In
    2004, a $37 million reserve related to these tax credits
    was reversed following the settlement of an Internal Revenue
    Service (IRS) audit. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL –
    “Income Tax Matters – Synthetic Fuel Tax
    Credits” herein for further information.

The $18 million decrease in other income in 2006 as
    compared with 2005 resulted from a $25 million decrease
    related to changes in the value of derivative transactions in
    the synthetic fuel business and a $16 million decrease
    related to the impairment of investments in the synthetic fuel
    entities, partially offset by the release of $6 million in
    certain contractual obligations associated with these
    investments. The 2005 decrease in other income when compared to
    the prior year was not material. The decrease in other income in
    2004 as compared with 2003 reflects a $15 million gain for
    a Southern Telecom contract settlement during 2003.

Total interest charges and other financing costs increased by
    $48 million in 2006 due to a $19 million increase
    associated with $149 million in additional debt outstanding
    at December 31, 2006 as compared to December 31, 2005,
    a $12 million increase associated with an increase in
    average interest rates on variable rate debt, a $6 million
    loss on the early redemption of long-term debt payable to
    affiliated trusts in January 2006, and a $16 million loss
    on the repayment of long-term debt payable to affiliated trusts
    in December 2006. The 2006 increase is partially offset by a
    $4 million reduction in other interest costs. Interest
    expense increased by $18 million in 2005 associated with an
    additional $283 million in debt outstanding and a
    164 basis point increase in average interest rates on
    variable rate debt. Interest expense decreased $21 million
    in 2004 as a result of the parent company’s redemption of
    preferred securities in 2003. This decrease was partially offset
    by an increase in outstanding long-term debt in 2004.

The $136 million increase in income taxes in 2006 as
    compared with 2005 resulted from an $80 million decrease in
    synthetic fuel tax credits as a result of terminating the
    Company’s membership interest in one of the synthetic fuel
    entities and curtailing production at the other synthetic fuel
    entity from May to September 2006. In addition, $32 million
    of tax credit reserves were

recorded in 2006 due to an anticipated phase-out of synthetic
    fuel tax credits due to higher oil prices. See FUTURE EARNINGS
    POTENTIAL – “Income Tax Matters –
    Synthetic Fuel Tax Credits” herein for further information.
    The 2005 decrease in income taxes when compared to the prior
    year was not material. The $63 million decrease in income
    taxes in 2004 as compared with 2003 resulted from a
    $19 million increase in synthetic fuel tax credits as a
    result of increased production and a $44 million change in
    a reserve recorded related to these tax credits.

Effects
    of Inflation

The traditional operating companies and Southern Power are
    subject to rate regulation and party to long-term contracts that
    are generally based on the recovery of historical costs. When
    historical costs are included, or when inflation exceeds
    projected costs used in rate regulation, the effects of
    inflation can create an economic loss since the recovery of
    costs could be in dollars that have less purchasing power. In
    addition, the income tax laws are based on historical costs.
    While the inflation rate has been relatively low in recent
    years, it continues to have an adverse effect on Southern
    Company because of the large investment in utility plant with
    long economic lives. Conventional accounting for historical cost
    does not recognize this economic loss nor the partially
    offsetting gain that arises through financing facilities with
    fixed-money obligations such as long-term debt and preferred
    securities. Any recognition of inflation by regulatory
    authorities is reflected in the rate of return allowed in the
    traditional operating companies’ approved electric rates.

FUTURE
    EARNINGS POTENTIAL

General

The four traditional operating companies operate as vertically
    integrated utilities providing electricity to customers within
    their service areas in the southeastern United States. Prices
    for electricity provided to retail customers are set by state
    PSCs under cost-based regulatory principles. Retail rates and
    earnings are reviewed and may be adjusted periodically within
    certain limitations. Southern Power continues to focus on
    long-term capacity contracts, optimized by limited energy
    trading activities. The level of future earnings depends on
    numerous factors including the Federal Energy Regulatory
    Commission’s (FERC) market-based rate investigation,
    creditworthiness of customers, total generating capacity
    available in the Southeast, and the successful remarketing of
    capacity as current contracts expire. See ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES – “Application of Critical Accounting
    Policies and Estimates – Electric Utility
    Regulation” herein and Note 3 to the financial
    statements for additional information about regulatory matters.

The results of operations for the past three years are not
    necessarily indicative of future earnings potential. The level
    of Southern Company’s future earnings depends on numerous
    factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of
    Southern Company’s primary business of selling electricity.
    These factors include the traditional operating companies’
    ability to maintain a stable regulatory environment that
    continues to allow for the recovery of all prudently incurred
    costs during a time of increasing costs. Another major factor is
    the profitability of the competitive market-based wholesale
    generating business and federal regulatory policy, which may
    impact Southern Company’s level of participation in this
    market. Future earnings for the electricity business in the near
    term will depend, in part, upon growth in energy sales, which is
    subject to a number of factors. These factors include weather,
    competition, new energy contracts with neighboring utilities,
    energy conservation practiced by customers, the price of
    electricity, the price elasticity of demand, and the rate of
    economic growth in the service area.

Southern Company system generating capacity increased 1,276
    megawatts in 2006. The acquisition by Southern Power of Plants
    DeSoto and Rowan added 1,330 megawatts to the fleet while
    generating capacity was reduced by 54 megawatts due to the
    retirement of two fossil units and the re-rating of one hydro
    unit. In general, Southern Company has constructed or acquired
    new generating capacity only after entering into long-term
    capacity contracts for the new facilities or to meet
    requirements of Southern Company’s regulated retail
    markets, both of which are optimized by limited energy trading
    activities.

To adapt to a less regulated, more competitive environment,
    Southern Company continues to evaluate and consider a wide array
    of potential business strategies. These strategies may include
    business combinations, acquisitions involving other utility or
    non-utility businesses or properties, internal restructuring,
    disposition of certain assets, or some combination thereof.
    Furthermore, Southern Company may engage in new business
    ventures that arise from competitive and regulatory changes in
    the utility industry. Pursuit of any of the above strategies, or
    any combination thereof, may significantly affect the business
    operations and financial condition of Southern Company.

Environmental
    Matters

Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other
    environmental regulations could affect earnings if such costs
    cannot be fully recovered in rates on a timely basis.
    Environmental compliance spending over the next several years
    may exceed amounts estimated. Some of the factors driving the
    potential for such an increase are higher commodity costs,
    market demand for labor, and scope additions and clarifications.
    The timing, specific requirements, and estimated costs could
    also change as environmental regulations are modified. See
    Note 3 to the financial statements under
    “Environmental Matters” for additional information.

New
    Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
    brought a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the
    Northern District of Georgia against certain Southern Company
    subsidiaries, including Alabama Power and Georgia Power,
    alleging that these subsidiaries had violated the New Source
    Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act and related state
    laws at certain coal-fired generating facilities. Through
    subsequent amendments and other legal procedures, the EPA filed
    a separate action in January 2001 against Alabama Power in the
    U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama
    after Alabama Power was dismissed from the original action. In
    these lawsuits, the EPA alleged that NSR violations occurred at
    eight coal-fired generating facilities operated by Alabama Power
    and Georgia Power (including a facility formerly owned by
    Savannah Electric). The civil actions request penalties and
    injunctive relief, including an order requiring the installation
    of the best available control technology at the affected units.

On June 19, 2006, the U.S. District Court for the
    Northern District of Alabama entered a consent decree between
    Alabama Power and the EPA, resolving the alleged NSR violations
    at Plant Miller. The consent decree required Alabama Power to
    pay $100,000 to resolve the government’s claim for a civil
    penalty and to donate $4.9 million of sulfur dioxide
    emission allowances to a nonprofit charitable organization and
    formalized specific emissions reductions to be accomplished by
    Alabama Power, consistent with other Clean Air Act programs that
    require emissions reductions. On August 14, 2006, the
    district court in Alabama granted Alabama Power’s motion
    for summary judgment and entered final judgment in favor of
    Alabama Power on the EPA’s claims related to Plants Barry,
    Gaston, Gorgas, and Greene County. The plaintiffs have appealed
    this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
    Circuit and, on November 14, 2006, the Eleventh Circuit
    granted plaintiffs’ request to stay the appeal, pending the
    U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in a similar NSR case
    filed by the EPA against Duke Energy. The action against Georgia
    Power has been administratively closed since the spring of 2001,
    and none of the parties has sought to reopen the case.

Southern Company believes that the traditional operating
    companies complied with applicable laws and the EPA regulations
    and interpretations in effect at the time the work in question
    took place. The Clean Air Act authorizes maximum civil penalties
    of $25,000 to $32,500 per day, per violation at each
    generating unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation.
    An adverse outcome in any one of these cases could require
    substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at
    this time and could possibly require payment of substantial
    penalties. Such expenditures could affect future results of
    operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such costs
    are not recovered through regulated rates.

The EPA has issued a series of proposed and final revisions to
    its NSR regulations under the Clean Air Act, many of which have
    been subject to legal challenges by environmental groups and
    states. On June 24, 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals
    for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld, in part, the
    EPA’s revisions to NSR regulations that were issued in
    December 2002 but vacated portions of those revisions addressing
    the exclusion of certain pollution control projects. These
    regulatory revisions have been adopted by each of the states
    within Southern Company’s service territory. On
    March 17, 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
    District of Columbia Circuit also vacated an EPA rule which
    sought to clarify the scope of the existing Routine Maintenance,
    Repair, and Replacement exclusion. In October 2005 and September
    2006, the EPA also published proposed rules clarifying the test
    for determining when an emissions increase subject to the NSR
    permitting requirements has occurred. The impact of these
    proposed rules will depend on adoption of the final rules by the
    EPA and the individual state implementation of such rules, as
    well as the outcome of any additional legal challenges, and,
    therefore, cannot be determined at this time.

Carbon
    Dioxide Litigation

In July 2004, attorneys general from eight states, each outside
    of Southern Company’s service territory, and the
    corporation counsel for New York City filed a complaint in the
    U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York
    against Southern Company and four other electric power
    companies. A nearly identical complaint was filed

II-18


MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

(continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary
    Companies 2006 Annual Report

by three environmental groups in the same court. The complaints
    allege that the companies’ emissions of carbon dioxide, a
    greenhouse gas, contribute to global warming, which the
    plaintiffs assert is a public nuisance. Under common law public
    and private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs seek a judicial
    order (1) holding each defendant jointly and severally
    liable for creating, contributing to,

and/or

maintaining global warming and (2) requiring each of the
    defendants to cap its emissions of carbon dioxide and then
    reduce those emissions by a specified percentage each year for
    at least a decade. Plaintiffs have not, however, requested that
    damages be awarded in connection with their claims. Southern
    Company believes these claims are without merit and notes that
    the complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis for the
    claims. In September 2005, the U.S. District Court for the
    Southern District of New York granted Southern Company’s
    and the other defendants’ motions to dismiss these cases.
    The plaintiffs filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals
    for the Second Circuit in October 2005. The ultimate outcome of
    these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Plant
    Wansley Environmental Litigation

In December 2002, the Sierra Club, Physicians for Social
    Responsibility, Georgia Forestwatch, and one individual filed a
    civil suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
    District of Georgia against Georgia Power for alleged violations
    of the Clean Air Act at four of the units at Plant Wansley. The
    civil action requested injunctive and declaratory relief, civil
    penalties, a supplemental environmental project, and
    attorneys’ fees. In January 2007, following the March 2006
    reversal and remand by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
    Eleventh Circuit, the district court ruled for Georgia Power on
    all remaining allegations in this case. The only issue remaining
    for resolution by the district court is the appropriate remedy
    for two isolated, short-term, technical violations of the
    plant’s Clean Air Act operating permit. The court has asked
    the parties to submit a joint proposed remedy or individual
    proposals in the event the parties cannot agree. Although the
    ultimate outcome of this matter cannot currently be determined,
    the resulting liability associated with the two events is not
    expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
    financial statements.

Environmental
    Statutes and Regulations

General

Southern Company’s operations are subject to extensive
    regulation by state and federal environmental agencies under a
    variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental
    media, including air, water, and land resources. Applicable
    statutes include the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the
    Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
    Liability Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the
    Toxic Substances Control Act; the Emergency Planning &
    Community

Right-to-Know

Act; and the Endangered Species Act. Compliance with these
    environmental requirements involves significant capital and
    operating costs, a major portion of which is expected to be
    recovered through existing ratemaking provisions. Through 2006,
    Southern Company had invested approximately $3.1 billion in
    capital projects to comply with these requirements, with annual
    totals of $661 million, $423 million, and
    $300 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The
    Company expects that capital expenditures to assure compliance
    with existing and new regulations will be an additional
    $1.66 billion, $1.65 billion, and $1.27 billion
    for 2007, 2008, and 2009, respectively. Because the
    Company’s compliance strategy is impacted by changes to
    existing environmental laws and regulations, the cost,
    availability, and existing inventory of emission allowances, and
    the Company’s fuel mix, the ultimate outcome cannot be
    determined at this time. Environmental costs that are known and
    estimable at this time are included in capital expenditures
    discussed under FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY –
    “Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations”
    herein.

Compliance with possible additional federal or state legislation
    or regulations related to global climate change, air quality, or
    other environmental and health concerns could also significantly
    affect Southern Company. New environmental legislation or
    regulations, or changes to existing statutes or regulations,
    could affect many areas of Southern Company’s operations;
    however, the full impact of any such changes cannot be
    determined at this time.

Air
    Quality

Compliance with the Clean Air Act and resulting regulations has
    been and will continue to be a significant focus for Southern
    Company. Through 2006, the Company had spent approximately
    $2.5 billion in reducing sulfur dioxide
    (SO


)
    and nitrogen oxide
    (NO

x

)
    emissions and in monitoring emissions pursuant to the Clean Air
    Act. Additional controls have been announced and are currently
    being installed at several plants to further reduce
    SO


,
    NO

x

,
    and mercury emissions, maintain compliance with existing
    regulations, and meet new requirements.

Approximately $1.3 billion of the expenditures related to
    reducing
    NO

x

emissions pursuant to state and federal requirements were in
    connection with the EPA’s

one-hour

ozone air quality standard and the 1998 regional

reduction rules. In addition, in 2006, Gulf Power completed
    implementation of the terms of a 2002 agreement with the State
    of Florida to help ensure attainment of the ozone standard in
    the Pensacola, Florida area. The conditions of the agreement,
    which required installing additional controls on certain units
    and retiring three older units at a plant near Pensacola,
    totaled approximately $133.8 million, and have been
    approved under Gulf Power’s environmental cost recovery
    clause.

In 2005, the EPA revoked the

one-hour

ozone air quality standard and published the second of two sets
    of final rules for implementation of the new, more stringent

eight-hour

ozone standard. Areas within Southern Company’s service
    area that were designated as nonattainment under the

eight-hour

ozone standard included Macon (Georgia), Jefferson and Shelby
    Counties, near and including Birmingham (Alabama), and a

20-county

area within metropolitan Atlanta. Macon is in the process of
    seeking redesignation by the EPA as an attainment area and is
    preparing a maintenance plan for approval. The Birmingham area
    was redesignated to attainment with the

eight-hour

ozone standard by the EPA on June 12, 2006, and the EPA
    subsequently approved a maintenance plan for the area to address
    future exceedances of the standard. On December 22, 2006,
    the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
    Circuit vacated the first set of implementation rules adopted in
    2004 and remanded the rules to the EPA for further refinement.
    The impact of this decision, if any, cannot be determined at
    this time and will depend on subsequent legal action

and/or

rulemaking activity. State implementation plans, including new
    emission control regulations necessary to bring ozone
    nonattainment areas into attainment, are currently required for
    most areas by June 2007. These state implementation plans could
    require further reductions in
    NO

x

emissions from power plants.

During 2005, the EPA’s fine particulate matter
    nonattainment designations became effective for several areas
    within Southern Company’s service area in Alabama and
    Georgia, and the EPA proposed a rule for the implementation of
    the fine particulate matter standard. The EPA is expected to
    publish its final rule for implementation of the existing fine
    particulate matter standard in early 2007. State plans for
    addressing the nonattainment designations under the existing
    standard are required by April 2008 and could require further
    reductions in
    SO


and
    NO

x

emissions from power plants. On September 21, 2006, the EPA
    published a final rule lowering the

24-hour

fine
    particulate matter air quality standard even further and plans
    to designate nonattainment areas based on the new standard by
    December 2009. The final outcome of this matter cannot be
    determined at this time.

The EPA issued the final Clean Air Interstate Rule in March
    2005. This

cap-and-trade

rule addresses power plant
    SO


and
    NO

x

emissions that were found to contribute to nonattainment of the

eight-hour

ozone and fine particulate matter standards in downwind states.
    Twenty-eight eastern states, including each of the states within
    Southern Company’s service area, are subject to the
    requirements of the rule. The rule calls for additional
    reductions of
    NO

x

and/or

SO


to be achieved in two phases, 2009/2010 and 2015. These
    reductions will be accomplished by the installation of
    additional emission controls at Southern Company’s
    coal-fired facilities or by the purchase of emission allowances
    from a

cap-and-trade

program.

The Clean Air Visibility Rule (formerly called the Regional Haze
    Rule) was finalized in July 2005. The goal of this rule is to
    restore natural visibility conditions in certain areas
    (primarily national parks and wilderness areas) by 2064. The
    rule involves (1) the application of Best Available
    Retrofit Technology (BART) to certain sources built between 1962
    and 1977 and (2) the application of any additional
    emissions reductions which may be deemed necessary for each
    designated area to achieve reasonable progress toward the
    natural conditions goal by 2018. Thereafter, for each

10-year

planning period, additional emissions reductions will be
    required to continue to demonstrate reasonable progress in each
    area during that period. For power plants, the Clean Air
    Visibility Rule allows states to determine that the Clean Air
    Interstate Rule satisfies BART requirements for
    SO


and
    NO

x

.
    However, additional BART requirements for particulate matter
    could be imposed, and the reasonable progress provisions could
    result in requirements for additional
    SO


controls. By December 17, 2007, states must submit
    implementation plans that contain strategies for BART and any
    other control measures required to achieve the first phase of
    reasonable progress.

In March 2005, the EPA published the final Clean Air Mercury
    Rule, a

cap-and-trade

program for the reduction of mercury emissions from coal-fired
    power plants. The rule sets caps on mercury emissions to be
    implemented in two phases, 2010 and 2018, and provides for an
    emission allowance trading market. The Company anticipates that
    emission controls installed to achieve compliance with the Clean
    Air Interstate Rule and the

eight-hour

ozone and fine-particulate air quality standards will also
    result in mercury emission reductions. However, the long-term
    capability of emission control equipment to reduce mercury
    emissions is still being evaluated, and the

installation of additional control technologies may be required.

The impacts of the

eight-hour

ozone and the fine particulate matter nonattainment
    designations, the Clean Air Interstate Rule, the Clean Air
    Visibility Rule, and the Clean Air Mercury Rule on the Company
    will depend on the development and implementation of rules at
    the state level. States implementing the Clean Air Mercury Rule
    and the Clean Air Interstate Rule, in particular, have the
    option not to participate in the national

cap-and-trade

programs and could require reductions greater than those
    mandated by the federal rules. Impacts will also depend on
    resolution of pending legal challenges to these rules.
    Therefore, the full effects of these regulations on the Company
    cannot be determined at this time. The Company has developed and
    continually updates a comprehensive environmental compliance
    strategy to comply with the continuing and new environmental
    requirements discussed above. As part of this strategy, the
    Company plans to install additional
    SO


,
    NO

x

,
    and mercury emission controls within the next several years to
    assure continued compliance with applicable air quality
    requirements.

Water
    Quality

In July 2004, the EPA published its final technology-based
    regulations under the Clean Water Act for the purpose of
    reducing impingement and entrainment of fish, shellfish, and
    other forms of aquatic life at existing power plant cooling
    water intake structures. The rules require baseline biological
    information and, perhaps, installation of fish protection
    technology near some intake structures at existing power plants.
    On January 25, 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
    Second Circuit overturned and remanded several provisions of the
    rule to the EPA for revisions. Among other things, the court
    rejected the EPA’s use of “cost-benefit” analysis
    and suggested some ways to incorporate cost considerations. The
    full impact of these regulations will depend on subsequent legal
    proceedings, further rulemaking by the EPA, the results of
    studies and analyses performed as part of the rules’
    implementation, and the actual requirements established by state
    regulatory agencies and, therefore, cannot now be determined.

Georgia Power is retrofitting a closed-loop recirculating
    cooling tower at one facility under the Clean Water Act to cool
    water prior to discharge and is considering undertaking similar
    work at an additional facility. The total estimated capital cost
    for this project is $96 million. Southern Company is also
    considering similar projects at other facilities.

Environmental
    Remediation

Southern Company must comply with other environmental laws and
    regulations that cover the handling and disposal of waste and
    release of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and
    regulations, the traditional operating companies could incur
    substantial costs to clean up properties. The traditional
    operating companies conduct studies to determine the extent of
    any required cleanup and have recognized in their respective
    financial statements the costs to clean up known sites. Amounts
    for cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs were not material for
    any year presented. The traditional operating companies may be
    liable for some or all required cleanup costs for additional
    sites that may require environmental remediation. See
    Note 3 to the financial statements under
    “Environmental Matters – Environmental
    Remediation” for additional information.

Global
    Climate Issues

Domestic efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions have been
    spurred by international negotiations under the Framework
    Convention on Climate Change and specifically the Kyoto
    Protocol, which proposes a binding limitation on the emissions
    of greenhouse gases for industrialized countries. The Bush
    Administration has not supported U.S. ratification of the
    Kyoto Protocol or other mandatory carbon dioxide reduction
    legislation; however, in 2002, it did announce a goal to reduce
    the greenhouse gas intensity of the U.S. economy, the ratio
    of greenhouse gas emissions to the value of U.S. economic
    output, by 18 percent by 2012. Southern Company is
    participating in the voluntary electric utility sector climate
    change initiative, known as Power Partners, under the Bush
    Administration’s Climate VISION program. The utility sector
    pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions rate by
    3 percent to 5 percent by

2010-2012.

The Company continues to evaluate future energy and emission
    profiles relative to the Power Partners program and is
    participating in voluntary programs to support the industry
    initiative. In addition, the Company is participating in the
    Bush Administration’s Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean
    Development and Climate, a public/private partnership to work
    together to meet goals for energy security, national air
    pollution reduction, and climate change in ways that promote
    sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction. Legislative
    proposals that would impose mandatory restrictions on carbon
    dioxide emissions continue to be considered in Congress. The
    ultimate outcome cannot be determined at this time; however,
    mandatory restrictions on the Company’s carbon dioxide
    emissions could result in significant additional compliance
    costs that could affect future results of operations, cash

flows, and financial condition if such costs are not recovered
    through regulated rates.

FERC
    Matters

Market-Based
    Rate Authority

Each of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power
    has authorization from the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates,
    including short-term opportunity sales, at market-based prices.
    Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a
    market-based contract with an affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess
    Southern Company’s generation dominance within its retail
    service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in
    other markets is not an issue in that proceeding. Any new
    market-based rate sales by any subsidiary of Southern Company in
    Southern Company’s retail service territory entered into
    during a

15-month

refund period beginning February 27, 2005 could be subject
    to refund to the level of the default cost-based rates, pending
    the outcome of the proceeding. Such sales through May 27,
    2006, the end of the refund period, were approximately
    $19.7 million for the Southern Company system. In the event
    that the FERC’s default mitigation measures for entities
    that are found to have market power are ultimately applied, the
    traditional operating companies and Southern Power may be
    required to charge cost-based rates for certain wholesale sales
    in the Southern Company retail service territory, which may be
    lower than negotiated market-based rates. The final outcome of
    this matter will depend on the form in which the final
    methodology for assessing generation market power and mitigation
    rules may be ultimately adopted and cannot be determined at this
    time.

In addition, in May 2005, the FERC started an investigation to
    determine whether Southern Company satisfies the other three
    parts of the FERC’s market-based rate analysis:
    transmission market power, barriers to entry, and affiliate
    abuse or reciprocal dealing. The FERC established a new

15-month

refund period related to this expanded investigation. Any new
    market-based rate sales involving any Southern Company
    subsidiary could be subject to refund to the extent the FERC
    orders lower rates as a result of this new investigation. Such
    sales through October 19, 2006, the end of the refund
    period, were approximately $55.4 million for the Southern
    Company system, of which $15.5 million relates to sales
    inside the retail service territory discussed above. The FERC
    also directed that this expanded proceeding be held in abeyance
    pending the outcome of the proceeding on the Intercompany
    Interchange Contract (IIC) discussed below. On
    January 3, 2007, the FERC issued an order noting settlement
    of the IIC proceeding and seeking comment identifying any
    remaining issues and the proper procedure for addressing any
    such issues.

Southern Company and its subsidiaries believe that there is no
    meritorious basis for these proceedings and are vigorously
    defending themselves in this matter. However, the final outcome
    of this matter, including any remedies to be applied in the
    event of an adverse ruling in these proceedings, cannot now be
    determined.

Intercompany
    Interchange Contract

The Company’s generation fleet in its retail service
    territory is operated under the IIC, as approved by the
    FERC. In May 2005, the FERC initiated a new proceeding to
    examine (1) the provisions of the IIC among Alabama
    Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, Savannah
    Electric, Southern Power, and Southern Company Services, Inc.
    (SCS), as agent, under the terms of which the power pool of
    Southern Company is operated, and, in particular, the propriety
    of the continued inclusion of Southern Power as a party to
    the IIC, (2) whether any parties to the IIC have
    violated the FERC’s standards of conduct applicable to
    utility companies that are transmission providers, and
    (3) whether Southern Company’s code of conduct
    defining Southern Power as a “system company” rather
    than a “marketing affiliate” is just and reasonable.
    In connection with the formation of Southern Power, the FERC
    authorized Southern Power’s inclusion in the IIC in
    2000. The FERC also previously approved Southern Company’s
    code of conduct.

On October 5, 2006, the FERC issued an order accepting a
    settlement resolving the proceeding subject to Southern
    Company’s agreement to accept certain modifications to the
    settlement’s terms. On October 20, 2006, Southern
    Company notified the FERC that it accepted the modifications.
    The modifications largely involve functional separation and
    information restrictions related to marketing activities
    conducted on behalf of Southern Power. Southern Company filed
    with the FERC on November 6, 2006 an implementation plan to
    comply with the modifications set forth in the order. The impact
    of the modifications is not expected to have a material impact
    on Southern Company’s financial statements.

Generation
    Interconnection Agreements

In July 2003, the FERC issued its final rule on the
    standardization of generation interconnection agreements and
    procedures (Order 2003). Order 2003 shifts much of the financial
    burden of new transmission investment from

II-22


MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

(continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary
    Companies 2006 Annual Report

the generator to the transmission provider. The FERC has
    indicated that Order 2003, which was effective January 20,
    2004, is to be applied prospectively to new generating
    facilities interconnecting to a transmission system. Order 2003
    was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
    Columbia Circuit on January 12, 2007. The cost impact
    resulting from Order 2003 will vary on a

case-by-case

basis for each new generator interconnecting to the transmission
    system.

On November 22, 2004, generator company subsidiaries of
    Tenaska, Inc. (Tenaska), as counterparties to three previously
    executed interconnection agreements with subsidiaries of
    Southern Company, filed complaints at the FERC requesting that
    the FERC modify the agreements and that those Southern Company
    subsidiaries refund a total of $19 million previously paid
    for interconnection facilities, with interest. Southern Company
    has also received requests for similar modifications from other
    entities, though no other complaints are pending with the FERC.
    On January 19, 2007, the FERC issued an order granting
    Tenaska’s requested relief. Although the FERC’s order
    requires the modification of Tenaska’s interconnection
    agreements, the order reduces the amount of the refund that had
    been requested by Tenaska. As a result, Southern Company
    estimates indicate that no refund is due Tenaska. Southern
    Company has requested rehearing of the FERC’s order. The
    final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Transmission

In December 1999, the FERC issued its final rule on Regional
    Transmission Organizations (RTOs). Since that time, there have
    been a number of additional proceedings at the FERC designed to
    encourage further voluntary formation of RTOs or to mandate
    their formation. However, at the current time, there are no
    active proceedings that would require Southern Company to
    participate in an RTO. Current FERC efforts that may potentially
    change the regulatory

and/or

operational structure of transmission include rules related to
    the standardization of generation interconnection, as well as an
    inquiry into, among other things, market power by vertically
    integrated utilities. See “Market-Based Rate
    Authority” and “Generation Interconnection
    Agreements” above for additional information. The final
    outcome of these proceedings cannot now be determined. However,
    Southern Company’s financial condition, results of
    operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected by future
    changes in the federal regulatory or operational structure of
    transmission.

PSC
    Matters

Alabama
    Power

In October 2005, the Alabama PSC approved a revision to the Rate
    Stabilization and Equalization Plan (Rate RSE) requested by
    Alabama Power. Effective January 2007, Rate RSE adjustments are
    based on forward-looking information for the applicable upcoming
    calendar year. Rate adjustments for any two-year period, when
    averaged together, cannot exceed 4 percent per year and any
    annual adjustment is limited to 5 percent. Rates remain
    unchanged when the projected return on common equity (ROE)
    ranges between 13 percent and 14.5 percent. If Alabama
    Power’s actual retail ROE is above the allowed equity
    return range, customer refunds will be required; however, there
    is no provision for additional customer billings should the
    actual retail return on common equity fall below the allowed
    equity return range. Alabama Power made its initial submission
    of projected data for calendar year 2007 on December 1,
    2006. The Rate RSE increase for 2007 is 4.76 percent, or
    $193 million annually and, became effective in January
    2007. See Note 3 to the financial statements under
    “Alabama Power Retail Regulatory Matters” for further
    information.

Georgia
    Power

In December 2004, the Georgia PSC approved the three-year retail
    rate plan ending December 31, 2007 (2004 Retail Rate Plan)
    for Georgia Power. Under the terms of the 2004 Retail Rate Plan,
    Georgia Power’s earnings are evaluated against a retail ROE
    range of 10.25 percent to 12.25 percent. Two-thirds of
    any earnings above 12.25 percent are applied to rate
    refunds, with the remaining one-third retained by Georgia Power.
    Retail rates and customer fees were increased by approximately
    $203 million in January 2005 to cover the higher costs of
    purchased power, operations and maintenance expenses,
    environmental compliance, and continued investment in new
    generation, transmission, and distribution facilities to support
    growth and ensure reliability.

Georgia Power is required to file a general rate case on or
    about July 1, 2007, in response to which the Georgia PSC
    would be expected to determine whether the 2004 Retail Rate Plan
    should be continued, modified, or discontinued. See Note 3
    to the financial statements under “Georgia Power Retail
    Regulatory Matters” for additional information.

Effective July 1, 2006, Savannah Electric was merged into
    Georgia Power. See “Fuel Cost Recovery” herein for
    additional information.

    Companies 2006 Annual Report

Mississippi
    Power

In February 2007, Mississippi Power filed with the
    Mississippi PSC its annual Environmental Compliance Overview
    (ECO) Plan evaluation for 2007. Mississippi Power requested an
    86 cent per 1,000 KWH increase for retail customers. This
    increase represents approximately $7.5 million per year in
    annual revenues for Mississippi Power. Hearings with the
    Mississippi PSC are expected to be held in April 2007. The
    outcome of the 2007 filing cannot now be determined. In April
    2006, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power’s 2006
    ECO Plan, which included a 12 cent per 1,000 KWH reduction for
    retail customers. This decrease represented a reduction of
    approximately $1.3 million per year in annual revenues for
    Mississippi Power. The new rates were effective in April 2006.

In December 2006, Mississippi Power submitted its annual
    Performance Evaluation Plan (PEP) filing for 2007, which
    resulted in no rate change. Pursuant to the rate schedule, an
    order is not required from the Mississippi PSC for Mississippi
    Power to continue to bill the filed rate in effect. In March
    2006, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power’s 2006
    PEP filing, which included an annual retail base rate increase
    of 5 percent, or $32 million that was effective in
    April 2006. Ordinarily, PEP limits annual rate increases to
    4 percent; however, Mississippi Power had requested that
    the Mississippi PSC approve a temporary change to allow it to
    exceed this cap as a result of the ongoing effects of Hurricane
    Katrina.

In May 2004, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi
    Power’s request to reclassify to jurisdictional cost of
    service the 266 megawatts of Plant Daniel unit 3 and 4 capacity,
    effective January 1, 2004. The Mississippi PSC authorized
    Mississippi Power to include the related costs and revenue
    credits in jurisdictional rate base, cost of service, and
    revenue requirement calculations for purposes of retail rate
    recovery. Mississippi Power is amortizing the regulatory
    liability established pursuant to the Mississippi PSC’s
    order to earnings as follows: $16.5 million in 2004,
    $25.1 million in 2005, $13.0 million in 2006, and
    $5.7 million in 2007, resulting in expense reductions in
    each of those years.

Fuel
    Cost Recovery

The traditional operating companies each have established fuel
    cost recovery rates approved by their respective state PSCs.
    Over the past two years, the traditional operating companies
    have continued to experience higher than expected fuel costs for
    coal, natural gas, and uranium. These higher fuel costs have
    increased the under recovered fuel costs included in the balance
    sheets to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2006. The
    traditional operating companies continuously monitor the under
    recovered fuel cost balance in light of these higher fuel costs.
    Each of the traditional operating companies received approval in

and/or

2006 to increase its fuel cost recovery factors to recover
    existing under recovered amounts as well as projected future
    costs.

Alabama Power fuel costs are recovered under Rate ECR (Energy
    Cost Recovery), which provides for the addition of a fuel and
    energy cost factor to base rates. In December 2005, the Alabama
    PSC approved an increase that allows for the recovery of
    approximately $227 million in existing under recovered fuel
    costs over a two-year period. As of December 31, 2006,
    Alabama Power had an under recovered fuel balance of
    approximately $301 million.

In March 2006, Georgia Power and Savannah Electric filed a
    combined request for fuel cost recovery rate changes with the
    Georgia PSC to be effective July 1, 2006, the effective
    date of the merger of Savannah Electric into Georgia Power. On
    June 15, 2006, the Georgia PSC ruled on the request and
    approved an increase in Georgia Power’s total annual fuel
    billings of approximately $400 million. The Georgia PSC
    order provided for a combined ongoing fuel forecast but reduced
    the requested increase related to such forecast by
    $200 million. The order also required Georgia Power to file
    for a new fuel cost recovery rate on a semi-annual basis,
    beginning in September 2006. Accordingly, on September 15,
    2006, Georgia Power filed a request to recover fuel costs
    incurred through August 2006 by increasing the fuel cost
    recovery rate.

On November 13, 2006, under an agreement with the Georgia
    PSC staff, Georgia Power filed a supplementary request
    reflecting a forecast of annual fuel costs, as well as updated
    information for previously incurred fuel costs. On
    February 6, 2007, the Georgia PSC ruled on the request and
    approved an increase in Georgia Power’s total annual
    billings of approximately $383 million. The Georgia PSC
    order reduced Georgia Power’s requested increase in the
    forecast of annual fuel costs by $40 million and disallowed
    $4 million of previously incurred fuel costs. The order
    also requires Georgia Power to file for a

II-24


MANAGEMENT’S

    Companies 2006 Annual Report

new fuel cost recovery rate no later than March 1, 2008.
    The new rates will become effective on March 1, 2007.
    Estimated under recovered fuel costs are to be recovered through
    May 2009 for customers in the former Georgia Power territory and
    through November 2009 for customers in the former Savannah
    Electric territory. As of December 31, 2006, Georgia Power
    had an under recovered fuel balance of approximately
    $898 million.

Fuel cost recovery revenues as recorded on the financial
    statements are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable
    costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates.
    Accordingly, changing the billing factor has no significant
    effect on the Company’s revenues or net income, but does
    impact annual cash flow. Based on their respective state PSC
    orders, a portion of the under recovered regulatory clause
    revenues for Alabama Power and Georgia Power was reclassified
    from current assets to deferred charges and other assets in the
    balance sheet. See Note 1 to the financial statements under
    “Revenues” and Note 3 to the financial statements
    under “Alabama Power Retail Regulatory Matters” and
    “Georgia Power Retail Regulatory Matters” for
    additional information.

Storm
    Damage Cost Recovery

In July 2005 and August 2005, Hurricanes Dennis and Katrina,
    respectively, hit the Gulf Coast of the United States and caused
    significant damage within Southern Company’s service area,
    including portions of the service areas of Gulf Power, Alabama
    Power, and Mississippi Power. In addition, Hurricane Ivan hit
    the Gulf Coast of Florida and Alabama in September 2004, causing
    significant damage to the service areas of both Gulf Power and
    Alabama Power. Each retail operating company maintains a reserve
    to cover the cost of damages from major storms to its
    transmission and distribution lines and the cost of uninsured
    damages to its generation facilities and other property. In
    addition, each of the affected traditional operating companies
    has been authorized by its state PSC to defer the portion of the
    hurricane restoration costs that exceeded the balance in its
    storm damage reserve account. As of December 31, 2006, the
    under recovered balance in Southern Company’s storm damage
    reserve accounts totaled approximately $89 million, of
    which approximately $57 million and $32 million,
    respectively, are included in the balance sheets herein under
    “Other Current Assets” and “Other Regulatory
    Assets.”

In June 2006, the Mississippi PSC issued an order based upon a
    stipulation between Mississippi Power and the Mississippi Public
    Utilities Staff. The stipulation and the associated order
    certified actual storm restoration costs relating to Hurricane
    Katrina through April 30, 2006 of $267.9 million and
    affirmed estimated additional costs through December 31,
    2007 of $34.5 million, for total storm restoration costs of
    $302.4 million which was net of insurance proceeds of
    approximately $77 million, without offset for the property
    damage reserve of $3.0 million. Of the total amount,
    $292.8 million applies to Mississippi Power’s retail
    jurisdiction. The order directed Mississippi Power to file an
    application with the Mississippi Development Authority (MDA) for
    a Community Development Block Grant (CDBG). Mississippi Power
    filed the CDBG application with the MDA in September 2006. On
    October 30, 2006, Mississippi Power received from the MDA a
    CDBG in the amount of $276.4 million. Mississippi Power has
    appropriately allocated and applied these CDBG proceeds to both
    retail and wholesale storm restoration cost recovery.

Mississippi Power filed an application for a financing order
    with the Mississippi PSC on July 3, 2006 for restoration
    costs under the state bond program. On October 27, 2006,
    the Mississippi PSC issued a financing order that authorizes the
    issuance of $121.2 million of system restoration bonds.
    This amount includes $25.2 million for the retail storm
    recovery costs not covered by the CDBG, $60 million for a
    property damage reserve, and $36 million for the retail
    portion of the construction of the storm operations facility.
    The bonds will be issued by the Mississippi Development Bank on
    behalf of the State of Mississippi and will be reported as
    liabilities by the State of Mississippi. Periodic

true-up

mechanisms will be structured to comply with terms and
    requirements of the legislation. Details regarding the issuance
    of the bonds have not been finalized. The final outcome of this
    matter cannot now be determined.

As of December 31, 2006, Mississippi Power’s under
    recovered balance in the property damage reserve account totaled
    approximately $4.7 million which is included in the balance
    sheets herein under “Current Assets.”

In July 2006, the Florida PSC issued its order approving a
    stipulation and settlement between Gulf Power and several
    consumer groups that resolved all matters relating to Gulf
    Power’s request for recovery of incurred costs for
    storm-recovery activities and the replenishment of Gulf
    Power’s property damage reserve. The order provides for an
    extension of the storm-recovery surcharge currently being
    collected by Gulf Power for an additional 27 months,
    expiring in June 2009. According to the stipulation, the funds
    resulting from the extension of the current surcharge will first
    be credited to the unrecovered balance of storm-recovery costs
    associated with Hurricane Ivan until these costs have been fully
    recovered. The funds will then be credited to the property

reserve for recovery of the storm-recovery costs of
    $52.6 million associated with Hurricanes Dennis and Katrina
    that were previously charged to the reserve. Should revenues
    collected by Gulf Power through the extension of the
    storm-recovery surcharge exceed the storm-recovery costs
    associated with Hurricanes Dennis and Katrina, the excess
    revenues will be credited to the reserve. The annual accrual to
    the reserve of $3.5 million and Gulf Power’s limited
    discretionary authority to make additional accruals to the
    reserve will continue as previously approved by the Florida PSC.
    Gulf Power made discretionary accruals to the reserve of
    $3 million, $6 million, and $15 million in 2006,
    2005, and 2004, respectively. As part of a March 2005 agreement
    regarding Hurricane Ivan costs that established the existing
    surcharge, Gulf Power agreed that it would not seek any
    additional increase in its base rates and charges to become
    effective on or before March 1, 2007. The terms of the
    stipulation do not alter or affect that portion of the prior
    agreement. According to the order, in the case of future storms,
    if Gulf Power incurs cumulative costs for storm-recovery
    activities in excess of $10 million during any calendar
    year, Gulf Power will be permitted to file a streamlined formal
    request for an interim surcharge. Any interim surcharge would
    provide for the recovery, subject to refund, of up to
    80 percent of the claimed costs for storm-recovery
    activities. Gulf Power would then petition the Florida PSC for
    full recovery through an additional surcharge or other cost
    recovery mechanism.

As of December 31, 2006, Gulf Power’s unrecovered
    balance in the property damage reserve totaled approximately
    $45.7 million, of which approximately $28.8 million
    and $16.9 million, respectively, are included in the
    balance sheets herein under “Current Assets” and
    “Deferred Charges and Other Assets.”

At Alabama Power, operation and maintenance expenses associated
    with Hurricane Ivan were $57.8 million. In 2005, Alabama
    Power received Alabama PSC approvals to return certain
    regulatory liabilities to the retail customers. These orders
    also allowed Alabama Power to simultaneously recover from
    customers accruals of approximately $48 million primarily
    to offset the costs of Hurricane Ivan and restore a positive
    balance in the natural disaster reserve. The combined effect of
    these orders had no impact on net income in 2005.

In December 2005, the Alabama PSC approved a separate rate rider
    to recover Alabama Power’s $51 million of deferred
    Hurricane Dennis and Katrina operation and maintenance costs
    over a two-year period and to replenish its reserve to a target
    balance of $75 million over a five-year period.

As of December 31, 2006, Alabama Power had recovered
    $49.5 million of the costs allowed for storm-recovery
    activities, of which $34.5 million was a reduction in the
    deficit balance in the natural disaster reserve account related
    to costs deferred from previous storms. The remaining under
    recovered balance in the property damage reserve account totaled
    approximately $16.8 million at December 31, 2006 and
    is included in the balance sheets herein under “Current
    Assets.” The remaining $15.0 million collected was
    used to establish the target reserve for future storms. The
    balance in the target reserve, reduced for current year
    activity, was $13.2 million at December 31, 2006 and
    is included in the balance sheets herein under “Other
    Regulatory Liabilities.”

See Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements under
    “Storm Damage Reserves” and “Storm Damage Cost
    Recovery,” respectively, for additional information on
    these reserves. The final outcome of these matters cannot now be
    determined.

Mirant
    Matters

Mirant was an energy company with businesses that included
    independent power projects and energy trading and risk
    management companies in the U.S. and selected other countries.
    It was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Company until its
    initial public offering in October 2000. In April 2001, Southern
    Company completed a spin-off to its shareholders of its
    remaining ownership and Mirant became an independent corporate
    entity.

In July 2003, Mirant and certain of its affiliates filed for
    voluntary reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy
    Code. In January 2006, Mirant’s plan of reorganization
    became effective, and Mirant emerged from bankruptcy. As part of
    the plan, Mirant transferred substantially all of its assets and
    its restructured debt to a new corporation that adopted the name
    Mirant Corporation (Reorganized Mirant). Southern Company has
    certain contingent liabilities associated with guarantees of
    contractual commitments made by Mirant’s subsidiaries
    discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements under
    “Guarantees” and with various lawsuits discussed in
    Note 3 to the financial statements under “Mirant
    Matters.”

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

(continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary
    Companies 2006 Annual Report

In December 2004, as a result of concluding an IRS audit for the
    tax years 2000 and 2001, Southern Company paid $39 million
    in additional tax and interest for issues related to Mirant tax
    items. Under the terms of the separation agreements entered into
    in connection with the spin-off, Mirant agreed to indemnify
    Southern Company for costs associated with these tax items and
    additional IRS assessments. However, as a result of
    Mirant’s bankruptcy, Southern Company sought reimbursement
    as an unsecured creditor in the Chapter 11 proceeding.
    Based on management’s assessment of the collectibility of
    the $39 million receivable, Southern Company has reserved
    approximately $13.7 million. In December 2006, Southern
    Company received approximately $23 million in tax refunds
    from the IRS related to Mirant tax items. Additional refunds are
    expected. The amount of any unsecured claim ultimately allowed
    with respect to Mirant tax items is expected to be reduced

dollar-for-dollar

by the amount of all refunds received from the IRS by Southern
    Company.

If Southern Company is ultimately required to make any
    additional payments either with respect to the IRS audit or its
    contingent obligations under guarantees of Mirant subsidiaries,
    Mirant’s indemnification obligation to Southern Company for
    these additional payments, if allowed, would constitute
    unsecured claims against Mirant, entitled to stock in
    Reorganized Mirant. See Note 3 to the financial statements
    under “Mirant Matters – Mirant Bankruptcy.”

In June 2005, Mirant, as a debtor in possession, and The
    Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Mirant Corporation
    filed a complaint against Southern Company in the
    U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas,
    which was amended in July 2005, February 2006, and May 2006. The
    third amended complaint (the complaint) alleges that Southern
    Company caused Mirant to engage in certain fraudulent transfers
    and to pay illegal dividends to Southern Company prior to the
    spin-off. The complaint also seeks to recharacterize certain
    advances from Southern Company to Mirant for investments in
    energy facilities from debt to equity. The complaint further
    alleges that Southern Company is liable to Mirant’s
    creditors for the full amount of Mirant’s liability and
    that Southern Company breached its fiduciary duties to Mirant
    and its creditors, caused Mirant to breach fiduciary duties to
    its creditors, and aided and abetted breaches of fiduciary
    duties by Mirant’s directors and officers. The complaint
    also seeks recoveries under theories of restitution, unjust
    enrichment, and alter ego. The complaint seeks monetary damages
    in excess of $2 billion plus interest, punitive damages,
    attorneys’ fees, and costs. Finally, the complaint includes
    an objection to Southern Company’s pending claims against
    Mirant in the Bankruptcy Court (which relate to reimbursement
    under the separation agreements of payments such as income
    taxes, interest, legal fees, and other guarantees described in
    Note 7 to the financial statements) and seeks equitable
    subordination of Southern Company’s claims to the claims of
    all other creditors. Southern Company served an answer to the
    complaint in June 2006.

In January 2006, MC Asset Recovery, a special purpose subsidiary
    of Reorganized Mirant, was substituted as plaintiff. In February
    2006, the Company’s motion to transfer the case to the
    U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia
    was granted. On May 19, 2006, Southern Company filed a
    motion for summary judgment seeking entry of judgment against
    the plaintiff as to all counts in the complaint. On
    December 11, 2006, the U.S. District Court for the
    Northern District of Georgia granted in part and denied in part
    the motion. As a result, certain breach of fiduciary duty claims
    were barred; all other claims in the complaint may proceed.
    Southern Company believes there is no meritorious basis for the
    claims in the complaint and is vigorously defending itself in
    this action. See Note 3 to the financial statements under
    “Mirant Matters – MC Asset Recovery
    Litigation” for additional information. The ultimate
    outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Income
    Tax Matters

Leveraged
    Lease Transactions

Southern Company undergoes audits by the IRS for each of its tax
    years. The IRS has completed its audits of Southern
    Company’s consolidated federal income tax returns for all
    years through 2003. Southern Company participates in four
    international leveraged lease transactions and receives federal
    income tax deductions for depreciation and amortization, as well
    as interest on related debt. The IRS proposed to disallow the
    tax losses for one of these leases (a

lease-in-lease-out,

or LILO) in connection with its audit of 1997 through 2001. In
    October 2004, Southern Company submitted the issue to the IRS
    appeals division and in February 2005 reached a negotiated
    settlement with the IRS, which is now final.

In connection with its audit of 2000 and 2001, the IRS also
    challenged Southern Company’s deductions related to three
    other international lease

(sale-in-lease-out,

or SILO) transactions. In the third quarter 2006, Southern
    Company paid the full amount of the disputed tax and the
    applicable interest on the SILO issue for tax years

2000-2001

and filed a claim for refund which has been denied by the IRS.
    The disputed tax amount is $79 million

II-27


MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

(continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary
    Companies 2006 Annual Report

and the related interest is approximately $24 million for
    these tax years. This payment, and the subsequent IRS
    disallowance of the refund claim, closed the issue with the IRS
    and Southern Company plans to proceed with litigation. The IRS
    has also raised the SILO issues for tax years 2002 and 2003. The
    estimated amount of disputed tax and interest for these years is
    approximately $83 million and $15 million,
    respectively. The tax and interest for these tax years was paid
    to the IRS in the fourth quarter 2006. Southern Company has
    accounted for both payments in 2006 as deposits, as management
    believes no additional tax or interest liabilities have been
    incurred.

Although the payment of the tax liability did not affect
    Southern Company’s results of operations under accounting
    standards in effect through December 31, 2006, it did
    impact cash flow. For tax years 2000 through 2006, Southern
    Company has claimed $284 million in tax benefits related to
    these SILO transactions challenged by the IRS. See Note 1
    to the financial statements under “Leveraged Leases”
    for additional information. Southern Company believes these
    transactions are valid leases for U.S. tax purposes and
    thus the related deductions are allowable. The Company will
    continue to defend this position through administrative appeals
    or litigation. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot now
    be determined.

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    released new interpretations for the accounting for both
    leveraged leases and uncertain tax positions that were adopted
    January 1, 2007. For the LILO transaction settled with the
    IRS in February 2005, the leveraged leases accounting
    interpretation requires that Southern Company recognize a
    cumulative effect reduction to beginning 2007 retained earnings
    of approximately $17 million at adoption and change the
    timing of income recognized under the lease.

For the SILO transactions which are the subject of pending
    litigation, Southern Company is continuing to evaluate the
    impact of the new interpretations but estimates that the
    reduction to retained earnings in 2007 could be approximately
    $115 million to $135 million. The impact on Southern
    Company’s net income of these accounting interpretations
    would also be dependent on the outcome of the pending litigation
    or changes in assumptions related to uncertain tax positions but
    could be significant, and potentially material.

Synthetic
    Fuel Tax Credits

Southern Company had investments in two entities that produce
    synthetic fuel and receive tax credits under Section 45K
    (formerly Section 29) of the Internal Revenue Code of
    1986, as amended (Internal Revenue Code). During 2006, as
    discussed below, Southern Company’s interest in one of the
    synthetic fuel entities was terminated. In accordance with
    Section 45K of the Internal Revenue Code, these tax credits
    are subject to limitation as the annual average price of oil (as
    determined by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE))
    increases over a specified, inflation-adjusted dollar amount
    published in the spring of the subsequent year. Southern
    Company, along with its partners in these investments, has
    continued to monitor oil prices. Reserves against these tax
    credits of $32 million were recorded in 2006 due to
    projected phase-outs of the credits in 2006 as a result of
    higher oil prices. Synthetic fuel tax credits will end
    December 31, 2007.

In May 2006, production at one of the synthetic fuel investments
    was idled due to continued uncertainty over the value of tax
    credits. In addition, Southern Company entered into an agreement
    in June 2006 which terminated its ownership interest in its
    other synthetic fuel investment, effective July 1, 2006.
    Also, during 2006, Southern Company entered into derivative
    transactions designed to reduce its exposure to changes in the
    value of tax credits associated with its synthetic fuel
    investments. These derivative transactions were marked to market
    through other income (expense), net. As a result of these
    actions and the projected continued phase out of tax credits
    because of high oil prices, the investments in these two
    synthetic fuel entities were considered fully impaired and
    approximately $16 million was written off and is reflected
    in the line item “Impairment loss on equity method
    investments” on the statements of income herein. In
    September 2006, due to reduced oil prices in the third quarter,
    production was restarted at the synthetic fuel facility in which
    Southern Company still has an ownership interest. In October
    2006, Southern Company entered into additional derivative
    transactions to reduce its exposure to the potential phase-out
    of these income tax credits in 2007. Subsequent to
    December 31, 2006, the Company entered into additional
    derivative transactions to further reduce its exposure to
    potential phase-out of tax credits in 2007. See Note 6 to
    the financial statements under “Financial Instruments”
    for additional information regarding the impact of these
    derivatives. The final outcome of these matters cannot now be
    determined.

Construction
    Projects

Integrated
    Coal Gasification Combined Cycle

In December 2005, Southern Power and the Orlando Utilities
    Commission (OUC) executed definitive agreements for development
    of an integrated coal gasification combined cycle (IGCC)
    285-megawatt project in Orlando, Florida. The definitive
    agreements provide that Southern Power will own at least
    65 percent of the gasifier portion of the IGCC project. OUC
    will own the remainder of the gasifier portion and
    100 percent of the combined cycle portion of the IGCC
    project. OUC will purchase all of the gasifier capacity from
    Southern Power once the plant is in commercial operation.
    Southern Power will construct the project and manage its
    operation after construction is completed. In February 2006,
    Southern Power signed a cooperative agreement with the DOE that
    provides up to $235 million in grant funding for the
    gasification portion of this project. The IGCC project is
    subject to National Environmental Policy Act review as well as
    state environmental review, requires certain regulatory
    approvals, and is expected to begin commercial operation in
    2010. The total cost related to the IGCC project is currently
    being reviewed, and may be higher than earlier estimates due to
    increases in commodity costs and increased market demand for
    labor. Southern Power had spent $7.8 million as of
    December 31, 2006. Southern Power has the option under the
    agreements to end its participation in the IGCC project at the
    end of the project definition phase which is expected to be
    during 2007.

In June 2006, Mississippi Power filed an application with the
    DOE for certain tax credits available to projects using clean
    coal technologies under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The
    proposed project is an advanced coal gasification facility
    located in Kemper County, Mississippi that would use locally
    mined lignite coal. The proposed 693 megawatt plant, excluding
    the mine cost, is expected to require an approximate investment
    of $1.5 billion and is expected to be completed in 2013.
    The DOE subsequently certified the project and in November 2006
    the IRS allocated Internal Revenue Code Section 48A tax
    credits to Mississippi Power of $133 million. The
    utilization of these credits is dependent upon meeting the
    certification requirements for the project under the Internal
    Revenue Code. The plant would use an air-blown IGCC technology
    that generates power from low-rank coals and coals with high
    moisture or high ash content. These coals, which include
    lignite, make up half the proven U.S. and worldwide coal
    reserves. Mississippi Power is still undergoing a feasibility
    assessment of the project which could take up to two years.
    Approval by various regulatory agencies, including the
    Mississippi PSC, will also be required if the project proceeds.

The final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.

Nuclear

On August 15, 2006, as part of a potential expansion of
    Plant Vogtle, Georgia Power and Southern Nuclear Operating
    Company, Inc. (SNC) filed an application with the Nuclear
    Regulatory Commission (NRC) for an early site permit (ESP) on
    behalf of the owners of Plant Vogtle. In addition, Georgia Power
    and SNC notified the NRC of their intent to apply for a combined
    construction and operating license (COL) in 2008. Ownership
    agreements have been signed with each of the existing Plant
    Vogtle co-owners. See Note 4 to the financial statements
    for additional information on these co-owners. In June 2006, the
    Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power’s request to establish
    an accounting order that would allow Georgia Power to defer for
    future recovery the ESP and COL costs, of which Georgia
    Power’s portion is estimated to total approximately
    $51 million over the next four years. At this point, no
    final decision has been made regarding actual construction. Any
    new generation resource must be certified by the Georgia PSC in
    a separate proceeding.

On March 16, 2006, a subsidiary of Southern Company entered
    into a development agreement with Duke Energy Corporation (Duke
    Energy) to evaluate the potential construction of a new

two-unit

nuclear plant at a jointly owned site in Cherokee County, South
    Carolina. If constructed, Southern Company would own an interest
    in Unit 1, representing approximately 500 megawatts. Duke
    Energy will be the developer and licensed operator of any plant
    built at the site.

Southern Company also is participating in NuStart Energy
    Development, LLC (NuStart Energy), a broad-based nuclear
    industry consortium formed to share the cost of developing a COL
    and the related NRC review. NuStart Energy plans to complete
    detailed engineering design work and to prepare COL applications
    for two advanced reactor designs, then to choose one of the
    applications and file it for NRC review and approval. The COL
    ultimately is expected to be transferred to one or more of the
    consortium companies; however, at this time, none of them have
    committed to build a new nuclear plant.

Southern Company is also exploring other possibilities relating
    to nuclear power projects, both on its own or in partnership
    with other utilities. The final outcome of these matters cannot
    now be determined.

Southern Company and Subsidiary
    Companies 2006 Annual Report

Other
    Matters

Southern Company is involved in various other matters being
    litigated, regulatory matters, and certain tax-related issues
    that could affect future earnings. See Note 3 to the
    financial statements for information regarding material issues.

ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES

Application
    of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Southern Company prepares its consolidated financial statements
    in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
    the United States. Significant accounting policies are described
    in Note 1 to the financial statements. In the application
    of these policies, certain estimates are made that may have a
    material impact on Southern Company’s results of operations
    and related disclosures. Different assumptions and measurements
    could produce estimates that are significantly different from
    those recorded in the financial statements. Senior management
    has discussed the development and selection of the critical
    accounting policies and estimates described below with the Audit
    Committee of Southern Company’s Board of Directors.

Electric
    Utility Regulation

Southern Company’s traditional operating companies, which
    comprise approximately 93 percent of Southern
    Company’s total earnings for 2006, are subject to retail
    regulation by their respective state PSCs and wholesale
    regulation by the FERC. These regulatory agencies set the rates
    the traditional operating companies are permitted to charge
    customers based on allowable costs. As a result, the traditional
    operating companies apply FASB Statement No. 71,
    “Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
    Regulation” (SFAS No. 71), which requires the
    financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation.
    Through the ratemaking process, the regulators may require the
    inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when
    they would be recognized by a non-regulated company. This
    treatment may result in the deferral of expenses and the
    recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated
    future recovery through rates or the deferral of gains or
    creation of liabilities and the recording of related regulatory
    liabilities. The application of SFAS No. 71 has a
    further effect on the Company’s financial statements as a
    result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the
    ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from those
    actually incurred by the traditional operating companies;
    therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in specific costs
    such as depreciation, nuclear decommissioning, and pension and
    postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on the
    Company’s results of operations than they would on a
    non-regulated company.

As reflected in Note 1 to the financial statements,
    significant regulatory assets and liabilities have been
    recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of
    these regulatory assets and liabilities based on applicable
    regulatory guidelines and accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States. However, adverse legislative,
    judicial, or regulatory actions could materially impact the
    amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could
    adversely impact the Company’s financial statements.

Contingent
    Obligations

Southern Company and its subsidiaries are subject to a number of
    federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other factors
    and conditions that potentially subject them to environmental,
    litigation, income tax, and other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS
    POTENTIAL herein and Note 3 to the financial statements for
    more information regarding certain of these contingencies.
    Southern Company periodically evaluates its exposure to such
    risks and records reserves for those matters where a loss is
    considered probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. The adequacy of
    reserves can be significantly affected by external events or
    conditions that can be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome
    of such matters could materially affect Southern Company’s
    financial statements. These events or conditions include the
    following:

•

Changes in existing state or federal regulation by governmental
    authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality,
    control of toxic substances, hazardous and solid wastes, and
    other environmental matters.

•

Changes in existing income tax regulations or changes in IRS or
    state revenue department interpretations of existing regulations.

•

Identification of additional sites that require environmental
    remediation or the filing of other complaints in which Southern
    Company or its subsidiaries may be asserted to be a potentially
    responsible party.

•

Identification and evaluation of other potential lawsuits or
    complaints in which Southern Company or its subsidiaries may be
    named as a defendant.

    Companies 2006 Annual Report

•

Resolution or progression of existing matters through the
    legislative process, the court systems, the IRS, or the EPA.

Unbilled
    Revenues

Revenues related to the sale of electricity are recorded when
    electricity is delivered to customers. However, the
    determination of KWH sales to individual customers is based on
    the reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic
    basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of
    electricity delivered to customers, but not yet metered and
    billed, are estimated. Components of the unbilled revenue
    estimates include total KWH territorial supply, total KWH
    billed, estimated total electricity lost in delivery, and
    customer usage. These components can fluctuate as a result of a
    number of factors including weather, generation patterns, and
    power delivery volume and other operational constraints. These
    factors can be unpredictable and can vary from historical
    trends. As a result, the overall estimate of unbilled revenues
    could be significantly affected, which could have a material
    impact on the Company’s results of operations.

New
    Accounting Standards

Stock
    Options

On January 1, 2006, Southern Company adopted FASB Statement
    No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” using the
    modified prospective method. This statement requires that
    compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions
    be recognized in financial statements. That cost is measured
    based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability
    instruments issued. Although the compensation expense required
    under the revised statement differs slightly, the impacts on the
    Company’s financial statements are similar to the pro forma
    disclosures included in Note 1 to the financial statements
    under “Stock Options.”

Pensions
    and Other Postretirement Plans

On December 31, 2006, Southern Company adopted FASB
    Statement No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans”
    (SFAS No. 158), which requires recognition of the
    funded status of its defined benefit postretirement plans in its
    balance sheet. With the adoption of SFAS No. 158,
    Southern Company recorded an additional prepaid pension asset of
    $520 million with respect to its overfunded defined benefit
    plan and additional liabilities of $45 million and
    $553 million, respectively, related to its underfunded
    non-qualified pension plans and retiree benefit plans.
    Additionally, SFAS No. 158 will require Southern
    Company to change the measurement date for its defined benefit
    postretirement plan assets and obligations from
    September 30 to December 31 beginning with the year
    ending December 31, 2008. See Note 2 to the financial
    statements for additional information.

Guidance
    on Considering the Materiality of Misstatements

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
    issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,
    “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when
    Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
    Statements” (SAB 108). SAB 108 addresses how the
    effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be
    considered when quantifying misstatements in current year
    financial statements. SAB 108 requires companies to
    quantify misstatements using both a balance sheet and an income
    statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach
    results in quantifying an error that is material in light of
    relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. When the effect
    of initial adoption is material, companies will record the
    effect as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year
    retained earnings. The provisions of SAB 108 were effective
    for the Southern Company for the year ended December 31,
    2006. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material
    impact on Southern Company’s financial statements.

Income
    Taxes

In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”
    (FIN 48). This interpretation requires that tax benefits
    must be “more likely than not” of being sustained in
    order to be recognized. Southern Company adopted FIN 48
    effective January 1, 2007. The impact on Southern
    Company’s financial statements is estimated to be a
    reduction to retained earnings of $15 million to
    $25 million.

Leveraged
    Leases

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position

No. FAS 13-2,

“Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing
    of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged
    Lease Transaction” (FSP

13-2).

This
    staff position amends FASB Statement No. 13,
    “Accounting for Leases” to require recalculation of
    the rate of return and the allocation of income whenever the
    projected timing of the income tax cash flows generated by a
    leveraged lease is revised. Southern Company adopted FSP

13-2

effective January 1, 2007. This adoption required Southern
    Company to recognize a cumulative effect of an approximate
    $17 million decrease

II-31


MANAGEMENT’S

    Companies 2006 Annual Report

to retained earnings related to the LILO transaction settled
    with the IRS in February 2005. The estimated impact of the
    adoption related to the SILO transactions is a reduction to
    retained earnings of approximately $100 million to
    $115 million. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL —
    “Income Tax Matters — Leveraged Lease
    Transactions” above and Note 3 to the financial
    statements under “Income Tax Matters” herein for
    further details about the effect of FSP

13-2.

Fair
    Value Measurement

The FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157, “Fair Value
    Measurements” (SFAS No. 157) in September
    2006. SFAS No. 157 provides guidance on how to measure
    fair value where it is permitted or required under other
    accounting pronouncements. SFAS No. 157 also requires
    additional disclosures about fair value measurements. Southern
    Company plans to adopt SFAS No. 157 on January 1,
    2008 and is currently assessing its impact.

Fair
    Value Option

In February 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 159,
    “Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115” (SFAS No. 159). This standard
    permits an entity to choose to measure many financial
    instruments and certain other items at fair value. Southern
    Company plans to adopt SFAS No. 159 on January 1,
    2008 and is currently assessing its impact.

FINANCIAL
    CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

Southern Company’s financial condition remained stable at
    December 31, 2006. Net cash flow from operations increased
    from 2005 by $290 million. The increase was primarily the
    result of decreases in under recovered fuel cost receivables due
    to higher allowed fuel recovery rates, decreases in under
    recovered storm restoration costs, and decreases in accounts
    payable from year-end 2005 amounts that included substantial
    hurricane-related expenditures, partially offset by increases in
    fossil fuel inventory. The $165 million decrease from 2005
    to 2004 resulted primarily from higher fuel costs at the
    traditional operating companies, partially offset by increases
    in base rates and fuel recovery rates. See FUTURE EARNINGS
    POTENTIAL — “PSC Matters — Fuel Cost
    Recovery” and “Storm Damage Cost Recovery” for
    additional information.

Significant balance sheet changes include an increase in notes
    payable of $683 million primarily to meet Southern
    Company’s short-term financing needs until longer term
    financing is secured, an increase in securities due within one
    year of $517 million for debt maturing within the next
    year, and an increase in property, plant, and equipment of
    $1.6 billion. The majority of funds needed for property
    additions were provided from operating activities. The
    implementation of SFAS No. 158 resulted in significant
    balance sheet changes and accounts for a large portion of the
    increases in prepaid pension assets of $527 million, other
    regulatory assets of $417 million, employee benefit
    obligations of $637 million, and other regulatory
    liabilities of $471 million.

At the close of 2006, the closing price of Southern
    Company’s common stock was $36.86 per share, compared
    with book value of $15.24 per share. The

market-to-book

value ratio was 242 percent at the end of 2006, compared
    with 240 percent at year-end 2005.

Southern Company, each of the traditional operating companies,
    and Southern Power, have received investment grade ratings from
    the major rating agencies with respect to debt, preferred
    securities, preferred stock, and/or preference stock. SCS has an
    investment grade corporate credit rating.

Sources
    of Capital

Southern Company intends to meet its future capital needs
    through internal cash flow and external security issuances.
    Equity capital can be provided from any combination of the
    Company’s stock plans, private placements, or public
    offerings. The amount and timing of additional equity capital to
    be raised in 2007, as well as in subsequent years, will be
    contingent on Southern Company’s investment opportunities.
    The Company does not currently anticipate any equity offerings
    in 2007 outside of its existing stock option plan, the employee
    savings plan, and the Southern Investment Plan.

The traditional operating companies and Southern Power plan to
    obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes
    from sources similar to those used in the past, which were
    primarily from operating cash flows, security issuances, term
    loans, and short-term borrowings. See Note 3 to the
    financial statements under “Storm Damage Cost
    Recovery” for information regarding additional options that
    Mississippi Power may pursue for recovering storm damage costs.
    However, the type and timing of any financings, if needed, will
    depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory approval,
    and other factors. The issuance of securities by the traditional
    operating companies is generally subject to the approval of the
    applicable state PSC. In addition, the issuance of all
    securities by Mississippi Power and Southern Power

II-32


MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

(continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary
    Companies 2006 Annual Report

and short-term securities by Georgia Power is generally subject
    to regulatory approval by the FERC. Additionally, with respect
    to the public offering of securities, Southern Company and
    certain of its subsidiaries file registration statements with
    the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
    (1933 Act). The amounts of securities authorized by the
    appropriate regulatory authorities, as well as the amounts, if
    any, registered under the 1933 Act, are continuously
    monitored and appropriate filings are made to ensure flexibility
    in the capital markets.

Southern Company, each traditional operating company, and Southern
Power obtain
    financing separately without credit support from any affiliate.
    See Note 6 to the financial statements under “Bank
    Credit Arrangements” for additional information. The
    Southern Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or
    money pool. Therefore, funds of each company are not commingled
    with funds of any other company.

Southern Company’s current liabilities frequently exceed
    current assets because of the continued use of short-term debt
    as a funding source to meet cash needs as well as scheduled
    maturities of long-term debt. To meet short-term cash needs and
    contingencies, Southern Company has substantial cash flow from
    operating activities and access to the capital markets,
    including commercial paper programs, to meet liquidity needs.

At December 31, 2006, Southern Company and its subsidiaries
    had approximately $167 million of cash and cash equivalents
    and $3.3 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks,
    of which $656 million expire in 2007 and $2.7 billion
    expire in 2008 and beyond. Of the $2.7 billion expiring in
    2008 and beyond, $2.4 billion does not expire until 2011.
    Approximately $79 million of the credit facilities expiring
    in 2007 allow for the execution of term loans for an additional
    two-year period, and $343 million allow for the execution
    of one-year term loans. Most of these arrangements contain
    covenants that limit debt levels and typically contain cross
    default provisions that are restricted only to the indebtedness
    of the individual company. Southern Company and its subsidiaries
    are currently in compliance with all such covenants. See
    Note 6 to the financial statements under “Bank Credit
    Arrangements” for additional information.

Financing
    Activities

During 2006, Southern Company and its subsidiaries issued
    $1.4 billion of senior notes, $154 million of
    obligations related to pollution control revenue bonds, and
    $150 million of preference stock. Interest rate hedges of
    $1.1 billion notional amount were settled at a gain of
    $2.7 million related to the issuances. The security
    issuances were used to redeem or extinguish $1.2 billion of
    long-term debt, to redeem $169 million of obligations
    related to pollution control revenue bonds, to redeem
    $15 million of preferred stock, to fund Southern
    Company’s ongoing construction program, and for general
    corporate purposes. In the second and fourth quarters of 2006,
    Alabama Power issued to Southern Company a total of
    3 million shares of Alabama Power common stock at
    $40.00 per share. The proceeds of $120 million were
    used by Alabama Power to repay short-term indebtedness and for
    other general corporate purposes.

Subsequent to December 31, 2006, Southern Company issued
    $500 million of senior notes. The proceeds from the sale of
    the senior notes were used by the Company to repay a portion of
    its outstanding short-term indebtedness, a portion of which was
    incurred to extinguish the 8.19% and 8.14% Southern Company
    Capital Funding Junior Subordinated Notes, and for other general
    corporate purposes. Also subsequent to December 31, 2006,
    Georgia Power entered into interest rate swap transactions with
    a notional amount of $375 million, in order to reduce
    exposure to interest rate risk. The transactions will be settled
    over the next two years as the underlying debt is issued, and
    any resulting gain or loss will be amortized over a

10-year

period.

On January 19, 2007, Gulf Power issued to Southern Company
    800,000 shares of Gulf Power’s common stock, without
    par value, for $80 million. The proceeds were used by Gulf
    Power to repay short-term indebtedness and for other general
    corporate purposes. On February 6, 2007, Alabama Power
    issued $200 million in senior notes. The proceeds from the
    sale of the senior notes were used to repay a portion of Alabama
    Power’s outstanding short-term debt and for other general
    corporate purposes.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Financing Arrangements

In 2001, Mississippi Power began the initial

10-year

term
    of a lease agreement for a combined cycle generating facility
    built at Plant Daniel for approximately $370 million. In
    2003, the generating facility was acquired by Juniper Capital
    L.P. (Juniper), a limited partnership whose investors are
    unaffiliated with Mississippi Power. Simultaneously, Juniper
    entered into a restructured lease agreement with Mississippi
    Power. Juniper has also entered into leases with other parties
    unrelated to Mississippi Power. The assets leased by Mississippi
    Power comprise less than 50 percent of Juniper’s
    assets. Mississippi Power is not required to consolidate the
    leased assets and related liabilities, and the lease with
    Juniper is considered an operating lease. The lease also
    provides for a residual value guarantee, approximately
    73 percent of the acquisition cost, by

    Companies 2006 Annual Report

Mississippi Power that is due upon termination of the lease in
    the event that Mississippi Power does not renew the lease or
    purchase the assets and that the fair market value is less than
    the unamortized cost of the assets. See Note 7 to the
    financial statements under “Operating Leases” for
    additional information.

Credit
    Rating Risk

Southern Company does not have any credit arrangements that
    would require material changes in payment schedules or
    terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. There are
    certain contracts that could require collateral, but not
    accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change to
    BBB- or Baa3 or below. These contracts are primarily for
    physical electricity purchases and sales. At December 31,
    2006, the maximum potential collateral requirements at a BBB- or
    Baa3 rating were approximately $291 million. The maximum
    potential collateral requirements at a rating below BBB- or Baa3
    were approximately $711 million. Generally, collateral may
    be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or
    cash. Southern Company’s operating subsidiaries are also
    party to certain derivative agreements that could require
    collateral

and/or

accelerated payment in the event of a credit rating change to
    below investment grade for Alabama Power and/or Georgia Power.
    These agreements are primarily for natural gas and power price
    risk management activities. At December 31, 2006, Southern
    Company’s total exposure to these types of agreements was
    approximately $27.4 million.

Market
    Price Risk

Southern Company is exposed to market risks, primarily commodity
    price risk and interest rate risk. To manage the volatility
    attributable to these exposures, the Company nets the exposures
    to take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various
    derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to
    the Company’s policies in areas such as counterparty
    exposure and risk management practices. Company policy is that
    derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and
    mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management
    policies. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques
    including, but not limited to, market valuation, value at risk,
    stress testing, and sensitivity analysis.

To mitigate future exposure to change in interest rates, the
    Company enters into forward starting interest rate swaps that
    have been designated as hedges. The swaps outstanding at
    December 31, 2006 have a notional amount of
    $725 million and are related to anticipated debt issuances
    over the next year. The weighted average interest rate on
    $1.7 billion of long-term variable interest rate exposure
    that has not been hedged at January 1, 2007 was
    5.1 percent. If Southern Company sustained a 100 basis
    point change in interest rates for all unhedged variable rate
    long-term debt, the change would affect annualized interest
    expense by approximately $17.9 million at January 1,
    2007. For further information, see Notes 1 and 6 to the
    financial statements under “Financial Instruments.”

Due to cost-based rate regulations, the traditional operating
    companies have limited exposure to market volatility in interest
    rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity. In
    addition, Southern Power’s exposure to market volatility in
    commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity is limited
    because its long-term sales contracts generally shift
    substantially all fuel cost responsibility to the purchaser. To
    mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity
    prices, the traditional operating companies and Southern Power
    enter into fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of
    electricity through the wholesale electricity market and, to a
    lesser extent, into similar contracts for natural gas purchases.
    The traditional operating companies have implemented
    fuel-hedging programs at the instruction of their respective
    state PSCs.

The changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts
    and year-end valuations were as follows at December 31:

(continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary
    Companies 2006 Annual Report

Unrealized gains and losses from

mark-to-market

adjustments on derivative contracts related to the traditional
    operating companies’ fuel hedging programs are recorded as
    regulatory assets and liabilities. Realized gains and losses
    from these programs are included in fuel expense and are
    recovered through the traditional operating companies’ fuel
    cost recovery clauses. In addition, unrealized gains and losses
    on energy-related derivatives used by Southern Power to hedge
    anticipated purchases and sales are deferred in other
    comprehensive income. Gains and losses on derivative contracts
    that are not designated as hedges are recognized in the
    statements of income as incurred. At December 31, 2006, the
    fair value gains/(losses) of energy-related derivative contracts
    was reflected in the financial statements as follows:

Unrealized pre-tax gains and losses from energy-related
    derivative contracts recognized in income were not material for
    any year presented.

Southern Company is exposed to market price risk in the event of
    nonperformance by counterparties to the energy-related
    derivative contracts. Southern Company’s policy is to enter
    into agreements with counterparties that have investment grade
    credit ratings by Moody’s and Standard &
    Poor’s or with counterparties who have posted collateral to
    cover potential credit exposure. Therefore, Southern Company
    does not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by
    the counterparties. For additional information, see Notes 1
    and 6 to the financial statements under “Financial
    Instruments.”

To reduce Southern Company’s exposure to changes in the
    value of synthetic fuel tax credits, which are impacted by
    changes in oil prices, the Company has entered into derivative
    transactions indexed to oil prices. Because these transactions
    are not designated as hedges, the gains and losses are
    recognized in the statements of income as incurred. For 2006 and
    2005, the fair value losses recognized in income to mark the
    transactions to market were $32 million and
    $7 million, respectively. In January 2007, Southern Company
    entered into additional derivative transactions with net initial
    premiums paid of $3 million to further reduce its exposure
    to the potential phase-out of these income tax credits in 2007.
    For further information, see Notes 1 and 6 to the
    financial statements under “Financial Instruments.”

Capital
    Requirements and Contractual Obligations

The construction program of Southern Company is currently
    estimated to be $3.9 billion for 2007, $4.5 billion
    for 2008, and $4.8 billion for 2009. Environmental
    expenditures included in these amounts are $1.66 billion,
    $1.65 billion, and $1.27 billion for 2007, 2008, and
    2009, respectively. Actual construction costs may vary from this
    estimate because of changes in such factors as: business
    conditions; environmental regulations; nuclear plant
    regulations; FERC rules and regulations; load projections; the
    cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and
    materials; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no
    assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be
    fully recovered.

As a result of NRC requirements, Alabama Power and Georgia Power
    have external trust funds for nuclear decommissioning costs;
    however, Alabama Power currently has no additional funding
    requirements. For additional information, see Note 1 to the
    financial statements under “Nuclear Decommissioning.”

In addition, as discussed in Note 2 to the financial
    statements, Southern Company provides postretirement benefits to
    substantially all employees and funds trusts to the extent
    required by the traditional operating companies’ respective
    regulatory commissions.

Other funding requirements related to obligations associated
    with scheduled maturities of long-term debt and preferred
    securities, as well as the related interest, derivative
    obligations, preferred and preference stock dividends, leases,
    and other purchase commitments are as follows. See
    Notes 1, 6, and 7 to the financial statements for
    additional information.

NOTES TO
    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Southern Company and
    Subsidiary Companies 2006 Annual Report

1.
    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General

Southern Company (the Company) is the parent company of four
    traditional operating companies, Southern Power Company
    (Southern Power), Southern Company Services (SCS), Southern
    Communications Services (SouthernLINC Wireless), Southern
    Company Holdings (Southern Holdings), Southern Nuclear Operating
    Company (Southern Nuclear), Southern Telecom, and other direct
    and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional operating companies,
    Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, and Mississippi Power
    are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service
    in four Southeastern states. Southern Power constructs,
    acquires, and manages generation assets and sells electricity at
    market-based rates in the wholesale market. SCS, the system
    service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to
    Southern Company and the subsidiary companies. SouthernLINC
    Wireless provides digital wireless communications services to
    the traditional operating companies and also markets these
    services to the public within the Southeast. Southern Telecom
    provides fiber cable services within the Southeast. Southern
    Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary for
    Southern Company’s investments in synthetic fuels and
    leveraged leases and various other energy-related businesses.
    Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to Southern
    Company’s nuclear power plants.

On January 4, 2006, Southern Company completed the sale of
    substantially all of the assets of Southern Company Gas, its
    competitive retail natural gas marketing subsidiary, including
    natural gas inventory, accounts receivable, and customer list,
    to Gas South, LLC, an affiliate of Cobb Electric Membership
    Corporation. As a result of the sale, Southern Company’s
    financial statements and related information reflect Southern
    Company Gas as discontinued operations for all periods
    presented. For additional information, see Note 3 under
    “Southern Company Gas Sale.”

The financial statements reflect Southern Company’s
    investments in the subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. The
    equity method is used for subsidiaries in which the Company has
    significant influence but does not control and for variable
    interest entities where the Company is not the primary
    beneficiary. All material intercompany items have been
    eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior years’ data
    presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to
    conform with the current year presentation.

The traditional operating companies, Southern Power, and certain
    of their subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the Federal
    Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the traditional
    operating companies are also subject to regulation by their
    respective state public service commissions (PSC). The companies
    follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States and comply with the accounting policies and practices
    prescribed by their respective commissions. The preparation of
    financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States requires the use of
    estimates, and the actual results may differ from those
    estimates.

Related
    Party Transactions

Alabama Power and Georgia Power purchase synthetic fuel from
    Alabama Fuel Products, LLC (AFP), an entity in which Southern
    Holdings held a 30 percent ownership interest until July
    2006, when its ownership interest was terminated. Total fuel
    purchases through June 2006 and for the years 2005 and 2004 were
    $354 million, $507 million, and $409 million,
    respectively. Synfuel Services, Inc. (SSI), another subsidiary
    of Southern Holdings, provided fuel transportation services to
    AFP that were ultimately reflected in the cost of the synthetic
    fuel billed to Alabama Power and Georgia Power. In connection
    with these services, the related revenues of approximately
    $62 million, $83 million, and $82 million through
    June 2006 and for the years 2005 and 2004, respectively, have
    been eliminated against fuel expense in the financial
    statements. SSI also provided additional services to AFP, as
    well as to a related party of AFP. Revenues from these
    transactions totaled approximately $24 million,
    $40 million, and $24 million through June 2006 and for
    the years 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Subsequent to the termination of Southern Company’s
    membership interest in AFP, Alabama Power and Georgia Power
    continued to purchase an additional $384 million in fuel
    from AFP in 2006. SSI continued to provide fuel transportation
    services of $62 million, which were eliminated against fuel
    expense in the financial statements. In 2006, SSI also provided
    other additional services to AFP and a related party of AFP
    totaling $21 million.

Regulatory
    Assets and Liabilities

The traditional operating companies are subject to the
    provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    Statement No. 71, “Accounting for the Effects of
    Certain Types of Regulation” (SFAS No. 71).
    Regulatory assets represent probable future revenues associated
    with

    that are expected to be credited to customers through the
    ratemaking process. Regulatory assets and (liabilities)

    company’s operations is no longer subject to the provisions
    of SFAS No. 71, such company would be required to
    write off related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not
    specifically recoverable through regulated rates. In addition,
    the traditional operating company would be required to determine
    if any impairment to other assets, including plant, exists and
    write down the assets, if impaired, to their fair value. All
    regulatory assets and liabilities are to be reflected in rates.
    See Note 3 under “Alabama Power Retail Regulatory
    Matters,” “Georgia Power Retail Regulatory
    Matters,” and “Storm Damage Cost Recovery” for
    additional information.

Revenues

Wholesale capacity revenues are generally recognized on a
    levelized basis over the appropriate contract periods. Energy
    and other revenues are recognized as services are provided.
    Unbilled revenues related to retail sales are accrued at the end
    of each fiscal period. Electric rates for the traditional
    operating companies include provisions to adjust billings for
    fluctuations in fuel costs, fuel hedging, the energy component
    of purchased power costs, and certain other costs. Revenues are
    adjusted for differences between these actual costs and amounts
    billed in current regulated rates. Under or over recovered
    regulatory clause revenues are recorded in the balance sheets
    and are recovered or returned to customers through adjustments
    to the billing factors.

Retail fuel cost recovery mechanisms vary by each retail
    operating company, but in general, the process requires periodic
    filings with the appropriate state PSC. Alabama Power
    continuously monitors the under/over recovered balance and files
    for a revised fuel rate when management deems appropriate.
    Georgia Power is required to file a new fuel case no later than
    March 1, 2008. Gulf Power is required to notify the Florida
    PSC if the projected fuel revenue over or under recovery exceeds
    10 percent of the projected fuel costs for the period and
    indicate if an adjustment to the fuel cost recovery factor is
    being requested. Mississippi Power is required to file for an
    adjustment to the fuel cost recovery factor annually. See
    “Alabama Power Retail Regulatory Matters” and
    “Georgia Power Retail Regulatory Matters” in
    Note 3 for additional information.

Southern Company has a diversified base of customers. No single
    customer or industry comprises 10 percent or more of
    revenues. For all periods presented, uncollectible accounts
    averaged less than 1 percent of revenues.

Fuel
    Costs

Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is used. Fuel expense
    generally includes the cost of purchased emission allowances as
    they are used. Fuel expense also includes the amortization of
    the cost of nuclear fuel and a charge, based on nuclear
    generation, for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel.
    Total charges for nuclear fuel included in fuel expense amounted
    to $137 million in 2006, $134 million in 2005, and
    $134 million in 2004.

Nuclear
    Fuel Disposal Costs

Alabama Power and Georgia Power have contracts with the
    U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) that provide for the
    permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to
    begin disposing of spent nuclear fuel in 1998 as required by the
    contracts, and Alabama Power and Georgia Power are pursuing
    legal remedies against the government for breach of contract.
    Sufficient pool storage capacity for spent fuel is available at
    Plant Vogtle to maintain full-core discharge capability for both
    units into 2014. Construction of an

on-site

dry
    storage facility at Plant Vogtle is expected to begin in
    sufficient time to maintain pool full-core discharge capability.
    At Plants Hatch and Farley,

on-site

dry
    storage facilities are operational and can be expanded to
    accommodate spent fuel through the expected life of each plant.

Also, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 established a Uranium
    Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund, which has
    been funded in part by a special assessment on utilities with
    nuclear plants. This assessment was paid over a

15-year

period; the final installment occurred in 2006. This fund will
    be used by the DOE for the decontamination and decommissioning
    of its nuclear fuel enrichment facilities. The law provides that
    utilities will recover these payments in the same manner as any
    other fuel expense.

Property,
    Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost less
    regulatory disallowances and impairments. Original cost
    includes: materials; labor; minor items of property; appropriate
    administrative and general costs; payroll-related costs such as
    taxes, pensions, and other benefits; and the interest
    capitalized and/or cost of funds used during construction.

Southern Company’s property, plant, and equipment consisted

The cost of replacements of property, exclusive of minor items
    of property, is capitalized. The cost of maintenance, repairs,
    and replacement of minor items of property is charged to
    maintenance expense as incurred or performed with the exception
    of nuclear refueling costs, which are recorded in accordance
    with specific state PSC orders. Alabama Power accrues estimated
    nuclear refueling costs in advance of the unit’s next
    refueling outage. Georgia Power defers and amortizes nuclear
    refueling costs over the unit’s operating cycle before the
    next refueling. The refueling cycles for Alabama Power and
    Georgia Power range from 18 to 24 months for each unit. In
    accordance with a Georgia PSC order, Georgia Power also defers
    the costs of certain significant inspection costs for the
    combustion turbines at Plant McIntosh and amortizes such costs
    over 10 years, which approximates the expected maintenance
    cycle.

Income
    and Other Taxes

Southern Company uses the liability method of accounting for
    deferred income taxes and provides deferred income taxes for all
    significant income tax temporary differences. Investment tax
    credits utilized are deferred and amortized to income over the
    average life of the related property. Taxes that are collected
    from customers on behalf of governmental agencies to be remitted
    to these agencies are presented net on the statements of income.

Depreciation
    and Amortization

Depreciation of the original cost of utility plant in service is
    provided primarily by using composite straight-line rates, which
    approximated 3.0 percent in 2006, 2.9 percent

II-47


NOTES

(continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary
    Companies 2006 Annual Report

in 2005, and 3.0 percent in 2004. Depreciation studies are
    conducted periodically to update the composite rates. These
    studies are filed with the respective state PSC for the
    traditional operating companies. Accumulated depreciation for
    utility plant in service totaled $16.2 billion and
    $15.3 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. When property subject to composite depreciation is
    retired or otherwise disposed of in the normal course of
    business, its original cost, together with the cost of removal,
    less salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation. For other
    property dispositions, the applicable cost and accumulated
    depreciation is removed from the balance sheet accounts and a
    gain or loss is recognized. Minor items of property included in
    the original cost of the plant are retired when the related
    property unit is retired.

Under the three-year retail rate plan for Georgia Power ending
    December 31, 2007 (2004 Retail Rate Plan), Georgia Power
    was ordered to recognize Georgia PSC-certified capacity costs in
    rates evenly over the three years covered by the 2004 Retail
    Rate Plan. As a result of the regulatory adjustment, Georgia
    Power recognized $33 million in increased depreciation and
    amortization expense in 2005. Georgia Power recorded a credit to
    amortization of $14 million in 2006. Under its 2001 rate
    order, the Georgia PSC ordered Georgia Power to amortize
    $333 million, the cumulative balance of accelerated
    depreciation and amortization previously expensed, equally over
    three years as a credit to depreciation and amortization expense
    beginning January 2002. Georgia Power also was ordered to
    recognize new certified capacity costs in rates evenly over the
    same three-year period under the 2001 rate order. As a result of
    this regulatory adjustment, Georgia Power recorded a reduction
    in depreciation and amortization expense of $77 million in
    2004. See Note 3 under “Georgia Power Retail
    Regulatory Matters” for additional information.

In May 2004, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi
    Power’s request to reclassify 266 megawatts of Plant Daniel
    units 3 and 4 capacity to jurisdictional cost of service
    effective January 1, 2004 and authorized Mississippi Power
    to include the related costs and revenue credits in
    jurisdictional rate base, cost of service, and revenue
    requirement calculations for purposes of retail rate recovery.
    Mississippi Power is amortizing the related regulatory liability
    pursuant to the Mississippi PSC’s order as follows:
    $17 million in 2004, $25 million in 2005,
    $13 million in 2006, and $6 million in 2007, resulting
    in increases to earnings in each of those years.

Depreciation of the original cost of other plant in service is
    provided primarily on a straight-line basis over estimated
    useful lives ranging from 3 to 25 years. Accumulated
    depreciation for other plant in service totaled
    $405 million and $378 million at December 31,
    2006 and 2005, respectively.

Asset
    Retirement Obligations

and Other Costs of Removal

Effective January 1, 2003, Southern Company adopted FASB
    Statement No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
    Obligations” (SFAS No. 143), which established
    new accounting and reporting standards for legal obligations
    associated with the ultimate costs of retiring long-lived
    assets. The present value of the ultimate costs for an
    asset’s future retirement is recorded in the period in
    which the liability is incurred. The costs are capitalized as
    part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the
    asset’s useful life. In addition, effective
    December 31, 2005, Southern Company adopted the provisions
    of FASB Interpretation No. 47, “Conditional Asset
    Retirement Obligations” (FIN 47), which requires that
    an asset retirement obligation be recorded even though the
    timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on future
    events. Prior to December 2005, the Company did not recognize
    asset retirement obligations for asbestos removal and disposal
    of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers because the
    timing of their retirements was dependent on future events. The
    Company has received accounting guidance from the various state
    PSCs allowing the continued accrual of other future retirement
    costs for long-lived assets that the Company does not have a
    legal obligation to retire. Accordingly, the accumulated removal
    costs for these obligations will continue to be reflected in the
    balance sheets as a regulatory liability. Therefore, the Company
    had no cumulative effect to net income resulting from the
    adoption of SFAS No. 143 or FIN 47.

The liability recognized to retire long-lived assets primarily
    relates to the Company’s nuclear facilities, Plants Farley,
    Hatch, and Vogtle. The fair value of assets legally restricted
    for settling retirement obligations related to nuclear
    facilities as of December 31, 2006 was $1.1 billion.
    In addition, the Company has retirement obligations related to
    various landfill sites and underground storage tanks. In
    connection with the adoption of FIN 47, Southern Company
    also recorded additional asset retirement obligations (and
    assets) of approximately $153 million, primarily related to
    asbestos removal and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in
    certain transformers. The Company also has identified retirement
    obligations related to certain transmission and distribution
    facilities, co-generation facilities, certain

wireless communication towers, and certain structures authorized
    by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. However,
    liabilities for the removal of these assets have not been
    recorded because the range of time over which the Company may
    settle these obligations is unknown and cannot be reasonably
    estimated. The Company will continue to recognize in the
    statements of income allowed removal costs in accordance with
    its regulatory treatment. Any differences between costs
    recognized under SFAS No. 143 and FIN 47 and
    those reflected in rates are recognized as either a regulatory
    asset or liability, as ordered by the various state PSCs, and
    are reflected in the balance sheets. See “Nuclear
    Decommissioning” herein for further information on amounts
    included in rates.

Nuclear
    Decommissioning

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requires licensees of
    commercial nuclear power reactors to establish a plan for
    providing reasonable assurance of funds for future
    decommissioning. Alabama Power and Georgia Power have external
    trust funds to comply with the NRC’s regulations. Use of
    the funds is restricted to nuclear decommissioning activities
    and the funds are managed and invested in accordance with
    applicable requirements of various regulatory bodies, including
    the NRC, the FERC, and state PSCs, as well as the Internal
    Revenue Service (IRS). The trust funds are invested in a
    tax-efficient manner in a diversified mix of equity and fixed
    income securities and are classified as

available-for-sale.

The trust funds are included in the balance sheets at fair
    value, as obtained from quoted market prices for the same or
    similar investments. As the external trust funds are actively
    managed by unrelated parties with limited direction from the
    Company, the Company does not have the ability to choose to hold
    securities with unrealized losses until recovery. Through 2005,
    the Company considered other-than-temporary impairments to be
    immaterial. However, since the January 1, 2006 effective
    date of FASB Staff Position

FAS 115-1/124-1,

“The Meaning of

Other-Than-Temporary

Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments” (FSP

No. 115-1),

the Company considers all unrealized losses to represent

other-than-temporary

impairments. The adoption of FSP

No. 115-1

had no impact on the results of operations, cash flows, or
    financial condition of the Company as all losses have been and
    continue to be recorded through a regulatory liability, whether
    realized, unrealized, or identified as other-than-temporary.

    $30.3 million, respectively, in 2006. Net realized gains
    were $22.5 million and $21.6 million in 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. Realized gains and

other-than-temporary

impairment losses are determined on a specific identification
    basis. In accordance with regulatory guidance, all realized and
    unrealized gains and losses are included in the regulatory
    liability for Asset Retirement Obligations in the balance sheets
    and are not included in net income or other comprehensive
    income. Unrealized gains and

other-than-temporary

impairment losses are considered non-cash transactions for
    purposes of the statements of cash flow.

Southern Company and Subsidiary
    Companies 2006 Annual Report

Amounts previously recorded in internal reserves are being
    transferred into the external trust funds over periods approved
    by the respective state PSCs. The NRC’s minimum external
    funding requirements are based on a generic estimate of the cost
    to decommission only the radioactive portions of a nuclear unit
    based on the size and type of reactor. Alabama Power and Georgia
    Power have filed plans with the NRC designed to ensure that,
    over time, the deposits and earnings of the external trust funds
    will provide the minimum funding amounts prescribed by the NRC.
    At December 31, 2006, the accumulated provisions for

    decommissioning based on the most current studies, which were
    performed in 2003 for Plant Farley and in 2006 for the Georgia
    Power plants, were as follows for Alabama Power’s Plant

The decommissioning cost estimates are based on prompt
    dismantlement and removal of the plant from service. The actual
    decommissioning costs may vary from the above estimates because
    of changes in the assumed date of decommissioning, changes in
    NRC requirements, or changes in the assumptions used in making
    these estimates.

For ratemaking purposes, Alabama Power’s decommissioning
    costs are based on the site study and Georgia Power’s
    decommissioning costs are based on the NRC generic estimate to
    decommission the radioactive portion of the facilities as of
    2003. Georgia Power will include the 2006 study estimates as
    part of the retail base rate case to be filed with the Georgia
    PSC by July 2007. The estimates used in current rates are
    $421 million and $326 million for Plants Hatch and
    Vogtle, respectively. Amounts expensed in 2006, 2005, and 2004
    totaled $7 million, $7 million, and $27 million,
    respectively. Significant assumptions used to determine these
    costs for ratemaking were an inflation rate of 4.5 percent
    and 3.1 percent for Alabama Power and Georgia Power,
    respectively, and a trust earnings rate of 7.0 percent and
    5.1 percent for Alabama Power and Georgia Power,
    respectively. Another significant assumption used was the change
    in the operating licenses for Plants Farley and Hatch. In
    January 2002, the NRC granted Georgia Power a

20-year

extension of the licenses for both units at Plant Hatch, which
    permits the operation of units 1 and 2 until 2034 and 2038,
    respectively. In May 2005, the NRC granted Alabama Power a
    similar

20-year

extension of the operating license for both units at Plant
    Farley. As a result of the license extensions, amounts
    previously contributed to the external trust funds for Plants
    Hatch and Farley are currently projected to be adequate to meet
    the decommissioning obligations.

Allowance
    for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) and Interest
    Capitalized

In accordance with regulatory treatment, the traditional
    operating companies record AFUDC, which represents the estimated
    debt and equity costs of capital funds that are necessary to
    finance the construction of new regulated facilities. While cash
    is not realized currently from such allowance, it increases the
    revenue requirement over the service life of the plant through a
    higher rate base and higher depreciation expense. Interest
    related to the construction of new facilities not included in
    the traditional operating companies’ regulated rates is
    capitalized in accordance with standard interest capitalization
    requirements.

Cash payments for interest totaled $875 million,
    $661 million, and $551 million in 2006, 2005, and
    2004, respectively, net of amounts capitalized of
    $27 million, $21 million, and $36 million,
    respectively.

Impairment
    of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles

Southern Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination
    of whether an impairment has occurred is based on either a
    specific regulatory

II-50


NOTES

(continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary
    Companies 2006 Annual Report

disallowance or an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows
    attributable to the assets, as compared with the carrying value
    of the assets. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the
    impairment recognized is determined by either the amount of
    regulatory disallowance or by estimating the fair value of the
    assets and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater
    than the fair value. For assets identified as held for sale, the
    carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value less the
    cost to sell in order to determine if an impairment loss is
    required. Until the assets are disposed of, their estimated fair
    value is re-evaluated when circumstances or events change.

Storm
    Damage Reserves

Each traditional operating company maintains a reserve for
    property damage to cover the cost of uninsured damages from
    major storms to transmission and distribution facilities and to
    generation facilities and other property. In accordance with
    their respective state PSC orders, the traditional operating
    companies accrued $26 million in 2006 that is recoverable
    through base rates. Alabama Power, Gulf Power, and Mississippi
    Power also have discretionary authority from their state PSCs to
    accrue certain additional amounts as circumstances warrant. In
    2006, 2005, and 2004, such additional accruals totaled
    $3 million, $6 million, and $25 million,
    respectively. In October 2006, the Mississippi PSC ordered
    Mississippi Power to suspend all accruals to its retail property
    damage reserve pending the establishment of a new reserve limit.
    Mississippi Power made no discretionary accruals in 2006 as a
    result of the order. See Note 3 under “Storm Damage
    Cost Recovery” for additional information regarding the
    depletion of these reserves following Hurricanes Ivan, Dennis,
    and Katrina and the deferral of additional costs, as well as
    additional rate riders or other cost recovery mechanisms which
    have been or may be approved by the respective state PSCs to
    replenish these reserves.

Environmental
    Remediation Cost Recovery

Southern Company must comply with other environmental laws and
    regulations that cover the handling and disposal of waste and
    releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and
    regulations, the subsidiaries may also incur substantial costs
    to clean up properties. Alabama Power, Gulf Power, and
    Mississippi Power have each received authority from their
    respective state PSCs to recover approved environmental
    compliance costs through specific retail rate clauses. Within
    limits approved by the state PSCs, these rates are adjusted
    annually.

Georgia Power continues to recover environmental costs through
    its base rates. Beginning in 2005, such rates include an annual
    accrual of $5.4 million for environmental remediation.
    Environmental remediation expenditures will be charged against
    the reserve as they are incurred. The annual accrual amount will
    be reviewed and adjusted in future regulatory proceedings. Under
    Georgia PSC ratemaking provisions, $22 million had
    previously been deferred in a regulatory liability account for
    use in meeting future environmental remediation costs of Georgia
    Power and is being amortized over a three-year period that began
    in January 2005.

Gulf Power’s environmental remediation liability includes
    estimated costs of environmental remediation projects of
    approximately $57.2 million as of December 31, 2006.
    These estimated costs relate to new regulations and more
    stringent site closure criteria by the Florida Department of
    Environmental Protection (FDEP) for impacts to groundwater
    from herbicide applications at Gulf Power substations. The
    schedule for completion of the remediation projects will be
    subject to FDEP approval. The projects have been approved by the
    Florida PSC for recovery, as expended, through Gulf Power’s
    environmental cost recovery clause; therefore, there was no
    impact on net income as a result of these estimates.

For Southern Company, the undiscounted environmental remediation
    liabilities balances as of December 31, 2006 and 2005
    totaled $63 million and $62 million, respectively.

Leveraged
    Leases

Southern Company has several leveraged lease agreements, ranging
    up to 45 years, which relate to international and domestic
    energy generation, distribution, and transportation assets.
    Southern Company receives federal income tax deductions for
    depreciation and amortization, as well as interest on long-term
    debt related to these investments. The Company reviews all
    important lease assumptions at least annually, or more
    frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that a
    change in assumptions has occurred or may occur. These
    assumptions include the effective tax rate, the residual value,
    and the credit quality of the lessees.

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash
    investments are considered cash equivalents. Temporary cash
    investments are securities with original maturities of
    90 days or less.

Materials
    and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include the average costs of
    transmission, distribution, and generating plant materials.
    Materials are charged to inventory when purchased and then
    expensed or capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when installed.

Fuel
    Inventory

Fuel inventory includes the average costs of oil, coal, natural
    gas, and emission allowances. Fuel is charged to inventory when
    purchased and then expensed as used and recovered by the
    traditional operating companies through fuel cost recovery rates
    approved by each state PSC. Emission allowances granted by the
    Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are included in inventory
    at zero cost.

Stock
    Options

Prior to January 1, 2006, Southern Company accounted for
    options granted in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
    Opinion No. 25; thus, no compensation expense was
    recognized because the exercise price of all options granted
    equaled the fair market value on the date of the grant.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair
    value recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123(R),
    “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123(R)),
    using the modified prospective method. Under that method,
    compensation cost for the year ended December 31, 2006 is
    recognized as the requisite service is rendered and includes:
    (a) compensation cost for the portion of share-based awards
    granted prior to and that are outstanding as of January 1,
    2006, for which the requisite service had not been rendered,
    based on the grant-date fair value of those awards as calculated
    in accordance with the original provisions of FASB Statement
    No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-based
    Compensation” (SFAS No. 123), and
    (b) compensation cost for all share-based awards granted
    subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair
    value estimated in accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123(R). Results for prior periods have not
    been restated.

For Southern Company, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)
    has resulted in a reduction in earnings from continuing
    operations before income taxes and net income of
    $28 million and $17 million, respectively, for the
    year ended December 31, 2006. Additionally,
    SFAS No. 123(R) requires the gross excess tax benefit
    from stock option exercises to be reclassified as a

financing cash flow as opposed to an operating cash flow; the
    reduction in operating cash flows and increase in financing cash
    flows for the year ended December 31, 2006 was
    $10 million.

The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) has also resulted in a
    reduction in basic and diluted earnings per share from
    continuing operations of $0.02 and $0.03, respectively, for the
    year ended December 31, 2006.

For the years prior to the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R), the pro forma impact of fair-value
    accounting for options granted on earnings from continuing
    operations and basic and diluted earnings per share from
    continuing operations is as follows:

Because historical forfeitures have been insignificant and are
    expected to remain insignificant, no forfeitures are assumed in
    the calculation of compensation expense; rather they are
    recognized when they occur.

The estimated fair values of stock options granted in 2006,
    2005, and 2004 were derived using the Black-Scholes stock option
    pricing model. Expected volatility is based on historical
    volatility of the Company’s stock over a period equal to
    the expected term. Southern Company uses historical exercise
    data to estimate the expected term that represents the period of
    time that options granted to employees are expected to be
    outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on the
    U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant
    that covers the expected term of the stock options. The
    following table shows the assumptions used in the pricing model
    and the weighted average grant-date fair value of stock options

Financial
    Instruments

Southern Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit
    exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, the prices of
    certain fuel purchases, and electricity purchases and sales. All
    derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets
    or liabilities (categorized in “Other”) and are
    measured at fair value. Substantially all of Southern
    Company’s bulk energy purchases and sales contracts that
    meet the definition of a derivative are exempt from fair value
    accounting requirements and are accounted for under the accrual
    method. Other derivative contracts qualify as cash flow hedges
    of anticipated transactions or are recoverable through the
    traditional operating companies’ fuel hedging programs.
    This results in the deferral of related gains and losses in
    other comprehensive income or regulatory assets and liabilities,
    respectively, until the hedged transactions occur. Any
    ineffectiveness arising from cash flow hedges is recognized
    currently in net income. Other derivative contracts, including
    derivatives related to synthetic fuel investments, are marked to
    market through current period income and are recorded on a net
    basis in the statements of income.

Southern Company is exposed to losses related to financial
    instruments in the event of counterparties’ nonperformance.
    The Company has established controls to determine and monitor
    the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate the
    Company’s exposure to counterparty credit risk.

Comprehensive
    Income

The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of
    all changes in common stock equity of an enterprise that result
    from transactions and other economic events of the period other
    than transactions with owners. Comprehensive income consists of
    net income, changes in the fair value of qualifying cash flow
    hedges and marketable securities, and changes in additional
    minimum pension liability, less income taxes and
    reclassifications for amounts included in net income.

Variable
    Interest Entities

The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity must
    consolidate the related assets and liabilities. Southern Company
    has established certain wholly-owned trusts to issue preferred
    securities. See Note 6 under “Mandatorily Redeemable
    Preferred Securities/Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated
    Trusts” for additional information. However, Southern
    Company and the traditional operating companies are not
    considered the primary beneficiaries of the trusts. Therefore,
    the investments in these trusts are reflected as Other
    Investments, and the related loans from the trusts are reflected
    as Long-term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts in the balance
    sheets.

In addition, Southern Company holds an 85 percent limited
    partnership investment in an energy/technology venture capital
    fund that is consolidated in the financial statements. During
    the third quarter of 2004, Southern Company terminated new
    investments in this fund; however, additional contributions to
    existing investments will still occur. Southern Company has
    committed to a maximum investment of $46 million, of which
    $43 million has been funded. Southern Company’s
    investment in the fund at December 31, 2006 totaled
    $25.6 million.

RETIREMENT
    BENEFITS

Southern Company has a defined benefit, trusteed, pension plan
    covering substantially all employees. The plan is funded in
    accordance with requirements of the Employee Retirement Income
    Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). No contributions to
    the plan are expected for the year ending December 31,
    2007. Southern Company also provides certain defined benefit
    pension plans for a selected group of management and highly
    compensated employees. Benefits under these non-qualified plans
    are funded on a cash basis. In addition, Southern Company
    provides certain medical care and life insurance benefits for
    retired employees through other postretirement benefit plans.
    The traditional operating companies fund related trusts to the
    extent required by their respective regulatory commissions. For
    the year ending December 31, 2007, postretirement trust
    contributions are expected to total approximately
    $41 million.

On December 31, 2006, Southern Company adopted FASB
    Statement No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans”
    (SFAS No. 158), which requires recognition of the
    funded status of its defined benefit postretirement plans in its
    balance sheet. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 158,
    Southern Company generally recognized only the difference
    between the benefit expense recognized and employer
    contributions to the plan as either a prepaid asset or as a
    liability. With respect to each of its underfunded non-qualified
    pension plans, Southern Company recognized an additional minimum
    liability representing the difference between each plan’s
    accumulated benefit obligation and its assets.

With the adoption of SFAS No. 158, Southern Company
    was required to recognize on its balance sheet previously
    unrecognized assets and liabilities related to unrecognized
    prior service cost, unrecognized gains or losses (from changes
    in actuarial assumptions and the difference between actual and
    expected returns on plan assets), and any unrecognized
    transition amounts (resulting from the change from cash-basis
    accounting to accrual accounting). These amounts will continue
    to be amortized as a component of expense over the
    employees’ remaining average service life as
    SFAS No. 158 did not change the recognition of pension
    and other postretirement benefit expense in the statements of
    income. With the adoption of SFAS No. 158, Southern
    Company recorded an additional prepaid pension asset of
    $520 million with respect to its overfunded defined benefit
    plan and additional liabilities of $45 million and
    $553 million, respectively, related to its underfunded non-

Because the recovery of postretirement benefit expense through
    rates is considered probable, Southern Company recorded
    offsetting regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities under the
    provisions of SFAS No. 71 with respect to the prepaid
    assets and the liabilities associated with the Company’s
    traditional operating companies. With respect to its unregulated
    subsidiaries, Southern Company recorded the resulting offset as
    a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of
    tax.

The measurement date for plan assets and obligations is
    September 30 for each year presented. Pursuant to
    SFAS No. 158, Southern Company will be required to
    change the measurement date for its defined benefit
    postretirement plans from September 30 to December 31
    beginning with the year ending December 31, 2008.

At December 31, 2006, the projected benefit obligations for
    the qualified and non-qualified pension plans were

    assets are related to the qualified pension plan.

Pension plan assets are managed and invested in accordance with
    all applicable requirements, including ERISA and the Internal
    Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Internal Revenue Code). The
    Company’s investment policy covers a diversified mix of
    assets, including equity and fixed income securities, real
    estate, and private equity. Derivative instruments are used
    primarily as hedging tools but may also be used to gain
    efficient exposure to the various asset classes. The Company

    diversification but also monitors and manages other aspects of
    risk. The actual composition of the

Net periodic pension cost (income) is the sum of service cost,
    interest cost, and other costs netted against the expected
    return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets is
    determined by multiplying the expected rate of return on plan
    assets and the market-related value of plan assets. In
    determining the market-related value of plan assets, the Company
    has elected to amortize changes in the market value of all plan
    assets over five years rather than recognize the changes
    immediately. As a result, the accounting value of plan assets
    that is used to calculate the expected return on plan assets
    differs from the current fair value of the plan assets.

Future benefit payments reflect expected future service and are
    estimated based on assumptions used to measure the projected
    benefit obligation for the pension plans. At December 31,
    2006, estimated benefit payments were as follows:

In the third quarter 2004, Southern Company prospectively
    adopted FASB Staff Position

106-2,

“Accounting and Disclosure Requirements” (FSP

106-2),

related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and
    Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act). The Medicare Act
    provides a 28 percent prescription drug subsidy for
    Medicare eligible retirees. FSP

106-2

requires recognition of the impacts of the Medicare Act in the
    APBO and future cost of service for postretirement medical plan.
    The effect of the subsidy reduced Southern Company’s
    expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2004 and for
    the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006 by approximately
    $11 million, $26 million, and $39 million,
    respectively, and is expected to have a similar impact on future
    expenses.

Future benefit payments, including prescription drug benefits,
    reflect expected future service and are estimated based on
    assumptions used to measure the APBO for the postretirement
    plans. Estimated benefit payments are reduced by drug subsidy
    receipts expected as a result of the Medicare Act as follows:

Actuarial
    Assumptions

The weighted average rates assumed in the actuarial calculations
    used to determine both the benefit obligations as of the
    measurement date and the net periodic costs for the pension and
    other postretirement benefit plans for the following year are
    presented below. Net periodic benefit costs for 2004 were
    calculated using a discount rate of 6.00 percent.

The Company determined the long-term rate of return based on
    historical asset class returns and current market conditions,
    taking into account the diversification benefits of investing in
    multiple asset classes.

An additional assumption used in measuring the APBO was a
    weighted average medical care cost trend rate of
    9.56 percent for 2007, decreasing gradually to
    5.00 percent through the year 2015 and remaining at that
    level thereafter. An annual increase or decrease in the assumed
    medical care cost trend rate of 1 percent would affect the
    APBO and the service and interest cost components at

Southern Company also sponsors a 401(k) defined contribution
    plan covering substantially all employees. The Company provides
    an 85 percent matching contribution up to 6 percent of
    an employee’s base salary. Prior to November 2006, the
    Company matched employee contributions at a rate of
    75 percent up to 6 percent of the employee’s base
    salary. Total matching contributions made to the plan for 2006,
    2005, and 2004 were $62 million, $58 million, and
    $56 million, respectively.

    AND REGULATORY MATTERS

General
    Litigation Matters

Southern Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions
    arising in the ordinary course of business. In addition,
    Southern Company’s business activities are subject to
    extensive governmental regulation related to public health and
    the environment. Litigation over environmental issues and claims
    of various types, including property damage, personal injury,
    and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements such as
    opacity and other air quality standards, has increased

Southern Company and Subsidiary
    Companies 2006 Annual Report

generally throughout the United States. In particular, personal
    injury claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to
    hazardous materials have become more frequent. The ultimate
    outcome of such pending or potential litigation against Southern
    Company and its subsidiaries cannot be predicted at this time;
    however, for current proceedings not specifically reported
    herein, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if
    any, arising from such current proceedings would have a material
    adverse effect on Southern Company’s financial statements.

Mirant
    Matters

Mirant Corporation (Mirant) was an energy company with
    businesses that included independent power projects and energy
    trading and risk management companies in the U.S. and selected
    other countries. It was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern
    Company until its initial public offering in October 2000. In
    April 2001, Southern Company completed a spin-off to its
    shareholders of its remaining ownership, and Mirant became an
    independent corporate entity.

Mirant
    Bankruptcy

In July 2003, Mirant and certain of its affiliates filed
    voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the
    Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the
    Northern District of Texas. The Bankruptcy Court entered an
    order confirming Mirant’s plan of reorganization on
    December 9, 2005, and Mirant announced that this plan
    became effective on January 3, 2006. As part of the plan,
    Mirant transferred substantially all of its assets and its
    restructured debt to a new corporation that adopted the name
    Mirant Corporation (Reorganized Mirant).

Southern Company has certain contingent liabilities associated
    with guarantees of contractual commitments made by Mirant’s
    subsidiaries discussed in Note 7 under
    “Guarantees” and with various lawsuits related to
    Mirant discussed below. Southern Company has paid approximately
    $1.4 million in connection with the guarantees. Also,
    Southern Company has joint and several liability with Mirant
    regarding the joint consolidated federal income tax returns
    through 2001, as discussed in Note 5. In December 2004, as
    a result of concluding an IRS audit for the tax years 2000 and
    2001, Southern Company paid $39 million in additional tax
    and interest for issues related to Mirant tax items. Based on
    management’s assessment of the collectibility of the
    $39 million receivable, Southern Company has reserved
    approximately $13.7 million. In December 2006, Southern
    Company received approximately $23 million in tax refunds
    from the IRS related to Mirant tax items. Additional refunds are
    expected. The amount of any unsecured claim ultimately allowed
    with respect to Mirant tax items is expected to be reduced

dollar-for-dollar

by the amount of all refunds received from the IRS by Southern
    Company.

Under the terms of the separation agreements entered into in
    connection with the spin-off, Mirant agreed to indemnify
    Southern Company for costs associated with these guarantees,
    lawsuits, and additional IRS assessments. However, as a result
    of Mirant’s bankruptcy, Southern Company sought
    reimbursement as an unsecured creditor in Mirant’s
    Chapter 11 proceeding. As part of a complaint filed against
    Southern Company in June 2005 and amended thereafter, Mirant and
    The Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Mirant
    Corporation (Unsecured Creditors’ Committee) objected to
    and sought equitable subordination of Southern Company’s
    claims, and Mirant moved to reject the separation agreements
    entered into in connection with the spin-off. MC Asset Recovery,
    a special purpose subsidiary of Reorganized Mirant, has been
    substituted as plaintiff in the complaint. If Southern
    Company’s claims for indemnification with respect to these,
    or any additional future payments, are allowed, then
    Mirant’s indemnity obligations to Southern Company would
    constitute unsecured claims against Mirant entitled to stock in
    Reorganized Mirant. The final outcome of this matter cannot now
    be determined.

MC
    Asset Recovery Litigation

In June 2005, Mirant, as a debtor in possession, and the
    Unsecured Creditors’ Committee filed a complaint against
    Southern Company in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the
    Northern District of Texas, which was amended in July 2005,
    February 2006, and May 2006. The third amended complaint (the
    complaint) alleges that Southern Company caused Mirant to engage
    in certain fraudulent transfers and to pay illegal dividends to
    Southern Company prior to the spin-off. The alleged fraudulent
    transfers and illegal dividends include without limitation:
    (1) certain dividends from Mirant to Southern Company in
    the aggregate amount of $668 million, (2) the
    repayment of certain intercompany loans and accrued interest in
    an aggregate amount of $1.035 billion, and (3) the
    dividend distribution of one share of Series B Preferred
    Stock and its subsequent redemption in exchange for
    Mirant’s 80 percent interest in a holding company that
    owned SE Finance Capital Corporation and Southern Company
    Capital Funding, Inc., which transfer plaintiff asserts is
    valued at over $200 million. The complaint also seeks to
    recharacterize certain advances from Southern Company

II-59


NOTES

Southern Company and Subsidiary
    Companies 2006 Annual Report

to Mirant for investments in energy facilities from debt to
    equity. The complaint further alleges that Southern Company is
    liable to Mirant’s creditors for the full amount of
    Mirant’s liability under an alter ego theory of recovery
    and that Southern Company breached its fiduciary duties to
    Mirant and its creditors, caused Mirant to breach its fiduciary
    duties to creditors, and aided and abetted breaches of fiduciary
    duties by Mirant’s directors and officers. The complaint
    also seeks recoveries under the theories of restitution and
    unjust enrichment. The complaint seeks monetary damages in
    excess of $2 billion plus interest, punitive damages,
    attorneys’ fees, and costs. Finally, the complaint includes
    an objection to Southern Company’s pending claims against
    Mirant in the Bankruptcy Court (which relate to reimbursement
    under the separation agreements of payments such as income
    taxes, interest, legal fees, and other guarantees described in
    Note 7) and seeks equitable subordination of Southern
    Company’s claims to the claims of all other creditors.
    Southern Company served an answer to the complaint in June 2006.

On December 29, 2005, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order
    authorizing the transfer of this proceeding, along with certain
    other actions, to MC Asset Recovery, a special purpose
    subsidiary of Reorganized Mirant. Under that order, Reorganized
    Mirant is obligated to fund up to $20 million in
    professional fees in connection with the lawsuits, as well as
    certain additional amounts. Any net recoveries from these
    lawsuits will be distributed to and shared equally by certain
    unsecured creditors and the original equity holders. In January
    2006, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
    Texas substituted MC Asset Recovery as plaintiff.

On January 10, 2006, the U.S. District Court for the
    Northern District of Texas granted Southern Company’s
    motion to withdraw this action from the Bankruptcy Court and, on
    February 15, 2006, granted Southern Company’s motion
    to transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the
    Northern District of Georgia. On May 19, 2006, Southern
    Company filed a motion for summary judgment seeking entry of
    judgment against the plaintiff as to all counts of the
    complaint. On December 11, 2006, the U.S. District
    Court for the Northern District of Georgia granted in part and
    denied in part the motion. As a result, certain breach of
    fiduciary duty claims are barred; all other claims in the
    complaint may proceed. Southern Company believes there is no
    meritorious basis for the claims in the complaint and is
    vigorously defending itself in this action. However, the final
    outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Mirant
    Securities Litigation

In November 2002, Southern Company, certain former and current
    senior officers of Southern Company, and 12 underwriters of
    Mirant’s initial public offering were added as defendants
    in a class action lawsuit that several Mirant shareholders
    originally filed against Mirant and certain Mirant officers in
    May 2002. Several other similar lawsuits filed subsequently were
    consolidated into this litigation in the U.S. District
    Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The amended
    complaint is based on allegations related to alleged improper
    energy trading and marketing activities involving the California
    energy market, alleged false statements and omissions in
    Mirant’s prospectus for its initial public offering and in
    subsequent public statements by Mirant, and accounting-related
    issues previously disclosed by Mirant. The lawsuit purports to
    include persons who acquired Mirant securities between
    September 26, 2000 and September 5, 2002.

In July 2003, the court dismissed all claims based on
    Mirant’s alleged improper energy trading and marketing
    activities involving the California energy market. The remaining
    claims do not allege any improper trading and marketing
    activity, accounting errors, or material misstatements or
    omissions on the part of Southern Company but seek to impose
    liability on Southern Company based on allegations that Southern
    Company was a “control person” as to Mirant prior to
    the spin-off date. Southern Company filed an answer to the
    consolidated amended class action complaint in September 2003.
    Plaintiffs have also filed a motion for class certification.

During Mirant’s Chapter 11 proceeding, the securities
    litigation was stayed, with the exception of limited discovery.
    Since Mirant’s plan of reorganization has become effective,
    the stay has been lifted. On March 24, 2006, the plaintiffs
    filed a motion for reconsideration requesting that the court
    vacate that portion of its July 14, 2003 order dismissing
    the plaintiffs’ claims based upon Mirant’s alleged
    improper energy trading and marketing activities involving the
    California energy market. Southern Company and the other
    defendants have opposed the plaintiffs’ motion. The
    plaintiffs have also stated that they intend to request that the
    court grant leave for them to amend the complaint to add
    allegations based upon claims asserted against Southern Company
    in the MC Asset Recovery litigation.

Under certain circumstances, Southern Company will be obligated
    under its Bylaws to indemnify the four current and/or former
    Southern Company officers who served as directors of Mirant at
    the time of its initial

public offering through the date of the spin-off and who are
    also named as defendants in this lawsuit. The final outcome of
    this matter cannot now be determined.

Southern
    Company Employee Savings Plan Litigation

In June 2004, an employee of a Southern Company subsidiary filed
    a complaint, which was amended in December 2004 and November
    2005 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District
    of Georgia on behalf of a purported class of participants in or
    beneficiaries of The Southern Company Employee Savings Plan
    (Plan) at any time since April 2, 2001 and whose Plan
    accounts included investments in Mirant common stock. The
    complaint asserts claims under ERISA against defendants Southern
    Company, SCS, the Employee Savings Plan Committee, the Pension
    Fund Investment Review Committee, individual members of
    such committees, and the SCS Board of Directors during the
    putative class period. The plaintiff alleges that the various
    defendants had certain fiduciary duties under ERISA regarding
    the Mirant shares distributed to Southern Company shareholders
    in the spin-off and held in the Mirant Stock Fund in the Plan.
    The plaintiff alleges that the various defendants breached
    purported fiduciary duties by, among other things, failing to
    adequately determine whether Mirant stock was appropriate to
    hold in the Plan and failing to adequately inform Plan
    participants that Mirant stock was not an appropriate investment
    for their retirement assets based on Mirant’s alleged
    improper energy trading and accounting practices, mismanagement,
    and business conditions. The plaintiff also alleges that certain
    defendants failed to monitor Plan fiduciaries and that certain
    defendants had conflicting interests regarding Mirant, which
    prevented them from acting solely in the interests of Plan
    participants and beneficiaries. The plaintiff seeks

class-wide

equitable relief and an unspecified amount of monetary damages.

On October 4, 2005, the court dismissed the
    plaintiff’s claims for certain types of equitable relief,
    but allowed the remainder of the ERISA claims to proceed. The
    defendants filed answers to the second amended complaint in
    January 2006 and filed motions for summary judgment and to stay
    discovery in February 2006. In April 2006, the
    U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia
    granted summary judgment in favor of Southern Company and all
    other defendants in the case. The plaintiff filed an appeal of
    the ruling. On December 19, 2006, the parties executed a
    written settlement term sheet, to be followed by a formal
    settlement agreement. On the same day, the parties waived oral
    argument in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
    Circuit, where the case was pending, and moved to remand the
    matter to the district court. The motion was granted on
    December 20, 2006.

The settlement term sheet admits no liability and provides for a
    payment of $15 million, to be made by the Company’s
    insurance carrier, to the Plan, after deduction of any award for
    plaintiff’s attorneys fees and certain other expenses if
    approved by the district court. Because the case is a putative
    class action, the settlement requires court approval. The
    district court will consider all matters related to the
    settlement. Pending the settlement approval, the ultimate
    outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Environmental
    Matters

New
    Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the EPA brought a civil action in the
    U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia
    against certain Southern Company subsidiaries, including Alabama
    Power and Georgia Power, alleging that these subsidiaries had
    violated the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air
    Act and related state laws at certain coal-fired generating
    facilities. Through subsequent amendments and other legal
    procedures, the EPA filed a separate action in January 2001
    against Alabama Power in the U.S. District Court for the
    Northern District of Alabama after Alabama Power was dismissed
    from the original action. In these lawsuits, the EPA alleged
    that NSR violations occurred at eight coal-fired generating
    facilities operated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power
    (including a facility formerly owned by Savannah Electric). The
    civil actions request penalties and injunctive relief, including
    an order requiring the installation of the best available
    control technology at the affected units.

On June 19, 2006, the U.S. District Court for the
    Northern District of Alabama entered a consent decree between
    Alabama Power and the EPA, resolving the alleged NSR violations
    at Plant Miller. The consent decree required Alabama Power to
    pay $100,000 to resolve the government’s claim for a civil
    penalty and to donate $4.9 million of sulfur dioxide
    emission allowances to a nonprofit charitable organization and
    formalized specific emissions reductions to be accomplished by
    Alabama Power, consistent with other Clean Air Act programs that
    require emissions reductions. On August 14, 2006, the
    district court in Alabama granted Alabama Power’s motion
    for summary judgment and entered final judgment in favor of
    Alabama Power on the EPA’s claims related to Plants Barry,
    Gaston, Gorgas, and Greene

County. The plaintiffs have appealed this decision to the
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, and on
    November 14, 2006, the Eleventh Circuit granted
    plaintiffs’ request to stay the appeal, pending the
    U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in a similar NSR case
    filed by the EPA against Duke Energy. The action against Georgia
    Power has been administratively closed since the spring of 2001,
    and none of the parties has sought to reopen the case.

Southern Company believes that the traditional operating
    companies complied with applicable laws and the EPA regulations
    and interpretations in effect at the time the work in question
    took place. The Clean Air Act authorizes maximum civil penalties
    of $25,000 to $32,500 per day, per violation at each
    generating unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation.
    An adverse outcome in any one of these cases could require
    substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at
    this time and could possibly require payment of substantial
    penalties. Such expenditures could affect future results of
    operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such costs
    are not recovered through regulated rates.

Plant
    Wansley Environmental Litigation

In December 2002, the Sierra Club, Physicians for Social
    Responsibility, Georgia Forestwatch, and one individual filed a
    civil suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
    District of Georgia against Georgia Power for alleged violations
    of the Clean Air Act at four of the units at Plant Wansley. The
    civil action requested injunctive and declaratory relief, civil
    penalties, a supplemental environmental project, and
    attorneys’ fees. In January 2007, following the March 2006
    reversal and remand by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
    Eleventh Circuit, the district court ruled for Georgia Power on
    all remaining allegations in this case. The only issue remaining
    for resolution by the district court is the appropriate remedy
    for two isolated, short-term, technical violations of the
    plant’s Clean Air Act operating permit. The court has asked
    the parties to submit a joint proposed remedy or individual
    proposals in the event the parties cannot agree. Although the
    ultimate outcome of this matter cannot currently be determined,
    the resulting liability associated with the two events is not
    expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
    financial statements.

Environmental
    Remediation

Georgia Power has been designated as a potentially responsible
    party at sites governed by the Georgia Hazardous Site Response
    Act and/or by the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response,
    Compensation, and Liability Act. In 1995, the EPA designated
    Georgia Power and four other unrelated entities as potentially
    responsible parties at a site in Brunswick, Georgia, that is
    listed on the federal National Priorities List. As of
    December 31, 2006, Georgia Power had recorded approximately
    $6 million in cumulative expenses associated with its

agreed-upon

share of the removal and remedial investigation and feasibility
    study costs for the Brunswick site. Additional claims for
    recovery of natural resource damages at the site are
    anticipated. Georgia Power has also recognized $36 million
    in cumulative expenses through December 31, 2006 for the
    assessment and anticipated cleanup of other sites on the Georgia
    Hazardous Sites Inventory.

The final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.
    However, based on the currently known conditions at these sites
    and the nature and extent of activities relating to these sites,
    management does not believe that additional liabilities, if any,
    at these sites would be material to the financial statements.

FERC
    Matters

Market-Based
    Rate Authority

Each of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power
    has authorization from the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates,
    including short-term opportunity sales, at market-based prices.
    Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a
    market-based contract with an affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess
    Southern Company’s generation dominance within its retail
    service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in
    other markets is not an issue in that proceeding. Any new
    market-based rate sales by any subsidiary of Southern Company in
    Southern Company’s retail service territory entered into
    during a

15-month

refund period beginning February 27, 2005 could be subject
    to refund to the level of the default cost-based rates, pending
    the outcome of the proceeding. Such sales through May 27,
    2006, the end of the refund period, were approximately
    $19.7 million for the Southern Company system. In the event
    that the FERC’s default mitigation measures for entities
    that are found to have market power are ultimately applied, the
    traditional operating companies and Southern Power may be
    required to charge cost-based rates for certain wholesale sales
    in the Southern Company retail service territory, which may be
    lower than negotiated market-based rates. The final outcome of
    this matter will depend on the form in which the final

II-62


NOTES

(continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary
    Companies 2006 Annual Report

methodology for assessing generation market power and mitigation
    rules may be ultimately adopted and cannot be determined at this
    time.

In addition, in May 2005, the FERC started an investigation to
    determine whether Southern Company satisfies the other three
    parts of the FERC’s market-based rate analysis:
    transmission market power, barriers to entry, and affiliate
    abuse or reciprocal dealing. The FERC established a new

15-month

refund period related to this expanded investigation. Any new
    market-based rate sales involving any Southern Company
    subsidiary could be subject to refund to the extent the FERC
    orders lower rates as a result of this new investigation. Such
    sales through October 19, 2006, the end of the refund
    period, were approximately $55.4 million for the Southern
    Company system, of which $15.5 million relates to sales
    inside the retail service territory discussed above. The FERC
    also directed that this expanded proceeding be held in abeyance
    pending the outcome of the proceeding on the Intercompany
    Interchange Contract (IIC) discussed below. On
    January 3, 2007, the FERC issued an order noting settlement
    of the IIC proceeding and seeking comment identifying any
    remaining issues and the proper procedure for addressing any
    such issues.

Southern Company and its subsidiaries believe that there is no
    meritorious basis for these proceedings and are vigorously
    defending themselves in this matter. However, the final outcome
    of this matter, including any remedies to be applied in the
    event of an adverse ruling in these proceedings, cannot now be
    determined.

Intercompany
    Interchange Contract

The Company’s generation fleet in its retail service
    territory is operated under the IIC, as approved by the
    FERC. In May 2005, the FERC initiated a new proceeding to
    examine (1) the provisions of the IIC among Alabama
    Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, Savannah
    Electric, Southern Power, and SCS, as agent, under the terms of
    which the power pool of Southern Company is operated, and, in
    particular, the propriety of the continued inclusion of Southern
    Power as a party to the IIC, (2) whether any parties
    to the IIC have violated the FERC’s standards of
    conduct applicable to utility companies that are transmission
    providers, and (3) whether Southern Company’s code of
    conduct defining Southern Power as a “system company”
    rather than a “marketing affiliate” is just and
    reasonable. In connection with the formation of Southern Power,
    the FERC authorized Southern Power’s inclusion in
    the IIC in 2000. The FERC also previously approved Southern
    Company’s code of conduct.

On October 5, 2006, the FERC issued an order accepting a
    settlement resolving the proceeding subject to Southern
    Company’s agreement to accept certain modifications to the
    settlement’s terms. On October 20, 2006, Southern
    Company notified the FERC that it accepted the modifications.
    The modifications largely involve functional separation and
    information restrictions related to marketing activities
    conducted on behalf of Southern Power. Southern Company filed
    with the FERC on November 6, 2006 an implementation plan to
    comply with the modifications set forth in the order. The impact
    of the modifications is not expected to have a material impact
    on Southern Company’s financial statements.

Generation
    Interconnection Agreements

In July 2003, the FERC issued its final rule on the
    standardization of generation interconnection agreements and
    procedures (Order 2003). Order 2003 shifts much of the financial
    burden of new transmission investment from the generator to the
    transmission provider. The FERC has indicated that Order 2003,
    which was effective January 20, 2004, is to be applied
    prospectively to new generating facilities interconnecting to a
    transmission system. Order 2003 was affirmed by the U.S. Court
    of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on
    January 12, 2007. The cost impact resulting from Order 2003
    will vary on a

case-by-case

basis for each new generator interconnecting to the transmission
    system.

On November 22, 2004, generator company subsidiaries of
    Tenaska, Inc. (Tenaska), as counterparties to three previously
    executed interconnection agreements with subsidiaries of
    Southern Company, filed complaints at the FERC requesting that
    the FERC modify the agreements and that those Southern Company
    subsidiaries refund a total of $19 million previously paid
    for interconnection facilities, with interest. Southern Company
    has also received requests for similar modifications from other
    entities, though no other complaints are pending with the FERC.
    On January 19, 2007, the FERC issued an order granting
    Tenaska’s requested relief. Although the FERC’s order
    requires the modification of Tenaska’s interconnection
    agreements, the order reduces the amount of the refund that had
    been requested by Tenaska. As a result, Southern Company
    estimates indicate that no refund is due Tenaska. Southern
    Company has requested rehearing of the FERC’s order. The
    final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Right of
    Way Litigation

Southern Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including
    Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern
    Telecom, have been named as defendants in numerous lawsuits
    brought by landowners since 2001. The plaintiffs’ lawsuits
    claim that defendants may not use, or sublease to third parties,
    some or all of the fiber optic communications lines on the
    rights of way that cross the plaintiffs’ properties and
    that such actions exceed the easements or other property rights
    held by defendants. The plaintiffs assert claims for, among
    other things, trespass and unjust enrichment and seek
    compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief.
    Management of Southern Company and its subsidiaries believe that
    they have complied with applicable laws and that the
    plaintiffs’ claims are without merit.

In November 2003, the Second Circuit Court in Gadsden County,
    Florida, ruled in favor of the plaintiffs on their motion for
    partial summary judgment concerning liability in one such
    lawsuit brought by landowners regarding the installation and use
    of fiber optic cable over Gulf Power rights of way located on
    the landowners’ property. Subsequently, the plaintiffs
    sought to amend their complaint and asked the court to enter a
    final declaratory judgment and to enter an order enjoining Gulf
    Power from allowing expanded general telecommunications use of
    the fiber optic cables that are the subject of this litigation.
    In January 2005, the trial court granted in part the
    plaintiffs’ motion to amend their complaint and denied the
    requested declaratory and injunctive relief. In November 2005,
    the trial court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and against
    Gulf Power on their respective motions for partial summary
    judgment. In that same order, the trial court also denied Gulf
    Power’s motion to dismiss certain claims. The court’s
    ruling allowed for an immediate appeal to the Florida First
    District Court of Appeal, which Gulf Power filed in December
    2005. On October 26, 2006, the Florida First District Court
    of Appeal issued an order dismissing Gulf Power’s December
    2005 appeal on the basis that the trial court’s order was a
    non-final order and therefore not subject to review on appeal at
    this time. The case is once again pending in the trial court for
    further proceedings. The final outcome of this matter cannot now
    be determined. In the event of an adverse verdict in this case,
    Gulf Power could appeal the issues of both liability and damages
    or other relief granted.

In January 2005, the Superior Court of Decatur County, Georgia
    granted partial summary judgment in another such lawsuit brought
    by landowners against Georgia Power based on the
    plaintiffs’ declaratory judgment claim that the easements
    do not permit general telecommunications use. The court also
    dismissed Southern Telecom from this case. Georgia Power
    appealed this ruling to the Georgia Court of Appeals. The
    Georgia Court of Appeals reversed, in part, the trial
    court’s order and remanded the case to the trial court for
    the determination of further issues. After the Court of
    Appeals’ decision, the plaintiffs filed a motion for
    reconsideration, which was denied, and a petition for certiorari
    to the Georgia Supreme Court, which was denied. On
    October 10, 2006, the Superior Court of Decatur County,
    Georgia granted Georgia Power’s motion for summary
    judgment. The period during which the plaintiff could have
    appealed has expired. This matter is now concluded.

To date, Mississippi Power has entered into agreements with
    plaintiffs in approximately 90 percent of the actions
    pending against Mississippi Power to clarify its easement rights
    in the State of Mississippi. These agreements have been approved
    by the Circuit Courts of Harrison County and Jasper County,
    Mississippi (First Judicial Circuit), and dismissals of the
    related cases are in progress. These agreements have not
    resulted in any material effects on Mississippi Power’s
    financial statements.

In addition, in late 2001, certain subsidiaries of Southern
    Company, including Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power,
    Mississippi Power, Savannah Electric, and Southern Telecom, were
    named as defendants in a lawsuit brought by a telecommunications
    company that uses certain of the defendants’ rights of way.
    This lawsuit alleges, among other things, that the defendants
    are contractually obligated to indemnify, defend, and hold
    harmless the telecommunications company from any liability that
    may be assessed against it in pending and future right of way
    litigation. The Company believes that the plaintiff’s
    claims are without merit. In the fall of 2004, the trial court
    stayed the case until resolution of the underlying landowner
    litigation discussed above. In January 2005, the Georgia Court
    of Appeals dismissed the telecommunications company’s
    appeal of the trial court’s order for lack of jurisdiction.
    An adverse outcome in this matter, combined with an adverse
    outcome against the telecommunications company in one or more of
    the right of way lawsuits, could result in substantial
    judgments; however, the final outcome of these matters cannot
    now be determined.

Southern Company’s consolidated federal income tax returns
    for all years through 2003. Southern Company participates in
    four international leveraged lease transactions and receives
    federal income tax deductions for depreciation and amortization,
    as well as interest on related debt. The IRS proposed to
    disallow the tax losses for one of these leases (a

lease-in-lease-out,

or LILO) in connection with its audit of 1997 through 2001. In
    October 2004, Southern Company submitted the issue to the IRS
    appeals division and in February 2005 reached a negotiated
    settlement with the IRS which is now final.

In connection with its audits of tax years 2000 – 2001
    and 2002 – 2003 the IRS also challenged Southern
    Company’s deductions related to three other international
    lease

(sale-in-lease-out,

or SILO) transactions. In the third quarter 2006, Southern
    Company paid the full amount of the disputed tax and the
    applicable interest on the SILO issue for tax years
    2000 – 2001 and filed a claim for refund which has now
    been denied by the IRS. The disputed tax amount is
    $79 million and the related interest is approximately
    $24 million for these tax years. This payment, and the
    subsequent IRS disallowance of the refund claim, closed the
    issue with the IRS and Southern Company plans to proceed with
    litigation. The IRS has also raised the SILO issues for tax
    years 2002 and 2003. The estimated amount of disputed tax and
    interest for these years is approximately $83 million and
    $15 million, respectively. The tax and interest for these
    tax years was paid to the IRS in the fourth quarter 2006.
    Southern Company has accounted for both payments in 2006 as
    deposits, as management believes no additional tax or interest
    liabilities have been incurred. For tax years 2000 through 2006,
    Southern Company has claimed $284 million in tax benefits
    related to these SILO transactions challenged by the IRS. The
    ultimate outcome of this matter cannot now be determined. See
    Note 1 under “Leveraged Leases” for additional
    information.

Alabama
    Power Retail Regulatory Matters

Alabama Power operates under a Rate Stabilization and
    Equalization Plan (Rate RSE) approved by the Alabama PSC. Rate
    RSE provides for periodic annual adjustments based upon Alabama
    Power’s earned return on

end-of-period

retail common equity; however, in October 2005, Alabama Power
    and the Alabama PSC agreed to a moratorium on any rate increase
    under Rate RSE until January 2007. In October 2005, the Alabama
    PSC approved a revision to Rate RSE requested by Alabama Power.
    Effective January 2007, Rate RSE adjustments are based on
    forward-looking information for the applicable upcoming calendar
    year. Rate adjustments for any two-year period, when averaged
    together, cannot exceed 4 percent per year and any annual
    adjustment is limited to 5 percent. Rates remain unchanged
    when the projected return on common equity (ROE) ranges between
    13 percent and 14.5 percent. If Alabama Power’s
    actual retail ROE is above the allowed equity return range,
    customer refunds will be required; however, there is no
    provision for additional customer billings should the actual
    retail return on common equity fall below the allowed equity
    return range. Alabama Power made its initial submission of
    projected data for calendar year 2007 on December 1, 2006.
    The Rate RSE increase for 2007 is 4.76 percent, or
    $193 million annually, and was effective in January 2007.
    The ratemaking procedures will remain in effect until the
    Alabama PSC votes to modify or discontinue them.

The Alabama PSC has also approved a rate mechanism that provides
    for adjustments to recognize the placing of new generating
    facilities in retail service and for the recovery of retail
    costs associated with certificated purchased power agreements
    (Rate CNP). An increase of 0.8 percent in retail rates, or
    $25 million annually, was effective July 2004 under Rate
    CNP for new certificated power purchase agreements. In April
    2005, an adjustment to Rate CNP decreased retail rates by
    approximately 0.5 percent, or $19 million annually.
    The annual

true-up

adjustment effective in April 2006 increased retail rates by
    0.5 percent, or $19 million annually. The request
    filed in February 2007 did not require any adjustment beginning
    in April 2007.

In October 2004, the Alabama PSC approved a request by Alabama
    Power to amend Rate CNP to also provide for the recovery of
    retail costs associated with environmental laws and regulations,
    effective in January 2005. The rate mechanism began operation in
    January 2005 and provides for the recovery of these costs
    pursuant to a factor that will be calculated annually.
    Environmental costs to be recovered include operation and
    maintenance expenses, depreciation, and a return on invested
    capital. Retail rates increased approximately 1.0 percent
    in January 2005, 1.2 percent in January 2006, and
    0.6 percent in January 2007.

Alabama Power fuel costs are recovered under Rate ECR (Energy
    Cost Recovery), which provides for the addition of a fuel and
    energy cost factor to base rates. In December 2005, the Alabama
    PSC approved an increase that allows for the recovery of
    approximately $227 million in existing under recovered fuel
    costs over a two-year period. Based on the order, a portion of
    the under recovered regulatory clause revenues was reclassified

Georgia
    Power Retail Regulatory Matters

In December 2004, the Georgia PSC approved a three-year retail
    rate plan ending December 31, 2007 (2004 Retail Rate Plan)
    for Georgia Power. Under the terms of the 2004 Retail Rate Plan,
    Georgia Power’s earnings are evaluated against a retail ROE
    range of 10.25 percent to 12.25 percent. Two-thirds of
    any earnings above 12.25 percent will be applied to rate
    refunds, with the remaining one-third retained by Georgia Power.
    Retail rates and customer fees were increased by approximately
    $203 million effective January 1, 2005. In 2007,
    Georgia Power will refund 2005 retail earnings in excess of a
    12.25 percent retail ROE. The refund amount is not expected
    to be material. No refund is anticipated for 2006. Georgia Power
    is required to file a general rate case by July 1, 2007 in
    response to which the Georgia PSC would be expected to determine
    whether the rate order should be continued, modified, or
    discontinued.

In December 2001, the Georgia PSC approved a three-year retail
    rate plan (2001 Retail Rate Plan) for Georgia Power ending
    December 31, 2004. Under the terms of the 2001 Retail Rate
    Plan, earnings were evaluated against a retail return on common
    equity range of 10 percent to 12.95 percent. Georgia
    Power’s earnings in all three years were within the common
    equity range. Under the 2001 Retail Rate Plan, Georgia Power
    amortized a regulatory liability of $333 million, related
    to previously recorded accelerated amortization expenses,
    equally over three years beginning in 2002. Also, the 2001
    Retail Rate Plan required Georgia Power to recognize capacity
    and operating and maintenance costs related to certified
    purchase power contracts evenly into rates over a three-year
    period ended December 31, 2004.

In May 2005, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power’s
    request to increase customer fuel rates by approximately
    9.5 percent to recover under recovered fuel costs of
    approximately $508 million existing as of May 31, 2005
    over a four-year period that began June 1, 2005. The
    Georgia PSC’s order instructed that under recovered fuel
    amounts be reviewed semi-annually beginning February 2006. If
    the amount under or over recovered exceeded $50 million at
    any evaluation date, Georgia Power was required to file for a
    temporary fuel rate change. Under recovered fuel amounts for the
    period subsequent to June 1, 2005 totaled
    $327.5 million through December 31, 2005. In addition,
    in accordance with a separate Georgia PSC order, Savannah
    Electric was scheduled to file an additional request for a fuel
    cost recovery increase in January 2006. In connection with the
    merger of Georgia Power and Savannah Electric, Georgia Power
    agreed with a Georgia PSC staff recommendation to forego the
    temporary fuel rate process, and Savannah Electric postponed its
    scheduled filing. Instead, Georgia Power and Savannah Electric
    filed a combined request in March 2006 to increase the fuel cost
    recovery rate.

On June 15, 2006, the Georgia PSC ruled on the request and
    approved an increase in Georgia Power’s total annual fuel
    billings of approximately $400 million. The Georgia PSC
    order provided for a combined ongoing fuel forecast but reduced
    the requested increase related to such forecast by
    $200 million. The order also required Georgia Power to file
    for a new fuel cost recovery rate on a semi-annual basis,
    beginning in September 2006. Accordingly, on September 15,
    2006, Georgia Power filed a request to recover fuel costs
    incurred through August 2006 by increasing the fuel cost
    recovery rate.

On November 13, 2006, under an agreement with the Georgia
    PSC staff, Georgia Power filed a supplementary request
    reflecting a forecast of annual fuel costs, as well as updated
    information for previously incurred fuel costs. On
    February 6, 2007, the Georgia PSC ruled on the request and
    approved an increase in Georgia Power’s total annual
    billings of approximately $383 million. The Georgia PSC
    order reduced Georgia Power’s requested increase in the
    forecast of annual fuel costs by $40 million and disallowed
    $4 million of previously incurred fuel costs. The order
    also requires Georgia Power to file for a new fuel cost recovery
    rate no later than March 1, 2008. The new rates will become
    effective on March 1, 2007. Estimated under recovered fuel
    costs are to be recovered through May 2009 for customers in the
    former Georgia Power territory and through November 2009 for
    customers in the former Savannah Electric territory. As of
    December 31, 2006, Georgia Power had an under recovered
    fuel balance of approximately $898 million.

Storm
    Damage Cost Recovery

Each traditional operating company maintains a reserve to cover
    the cost of damages from major storms to its transmission and
    distribution facilities and the cost of uninsured damages to its
    generation facilities and other property. Following Hurricanes
    Ivan, Dennis, and Katrina in September 2004, July 2005, and
    August 2005, respectively, each of the affected traditional
    operating companies has been authorized by its respective state
    PSC to defer the portion of the storm restoration costs incurred
    that exceeded the balance in its storm damage reserve account.
    As of December 31, 2006, the under recovered balance in
    Southern Company’s storm damage reserve

II-66


NOTES

(continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary
    Companies 2006 Annual Report

accounts totaled approximately $89 million, of which
    approximately $57 million and $32 million,
    respectively, is included in the balance sheets herein under
    “Other Current Assets” and “Other Regulatory
    Assets.” Approximately $63 million of the under
    recovered balances are being recovered through separate
    surcharges or rate riders approved by the Florida and Alabama
    PSCs, as discussed further below. The recovery of the remaining
    deferred costs is subject to the approval of the respective
    state PSC.

In June 2006, the Mississippi PSC issued an order based upon a
    stipulation between Mississippi Power and the Mississippi Public
    Utilities Staff. The stipulation and the associated order
    certified actual storm restoration costs relating to Hurricane
    Katrina through April 30, 2006 of $267.9 million and
    affirmed estimated additional costs through December 31,
    2007 of $34.5 million, for total storm restoration costs of
    $302.4 million which was net of insurance proceeds of
    approximately $77 million, without offset for the property
    damage reserve of $3.0 million. Of the total amount,
    $292.8 million applies to Mississippi Power’s retail
    jurisdiction. The order directed Mississippi Power to file an
    application with the Mississippi Development Authority (MDA) for
    a Community Development Block Grant (CDBG). Mississippi Power
    filed the CDBG application with the MDA in September 2006. On
    October 30, 2006, Mississippi Power received from the MDA a
    CDBG in the amount of $276.4 million. Mississippi Power has
    appropriately allocated and applied these CDBG proceeds to both
    retail and wholesale storm restoration cost recovery.

Mississippi Power filed an application for a financing order
    with the Mississippi PSC on July 3, 2006 for restoration
    costs under the state bond program. On October 27, 2006,
    the Mississippi PSC issued a financing order that authorizes the
    issuance of $121.2 million of system restoration bonds.
    This amount includes $25.2 million for the retail storm
    recovery costs not covered by the CDBG, $60 million for a
    property damage reserve, and $36 million for the retail
    portion of the construction of the storm operations facility.
    The bonds will be issued by the Mississippi Development Bank on
    behalf of the State of Mississippi and will be reported as
    liabilities by the State of Mississippi. Periodic

true-up

mechanisms will be structured to comply with terms and
    requirements of the legislation. Details regarding the issuance
    of the bonds have not been finalized. The final outcome of this
    matter cannot now be determined.

As of December 31, 2006, Mississippi Power’s under
    recovered balance in the property damage reserve account totaled
    approximately $4.7 million which is included in the balance
    sheets herein under “Current Assets.”

In July 2006, the Florida PSC issued its order approving a
    stipulation and settlement between Gulf Power and several
    consumer groups that resolved all matters relating to Gulf
    Power’s request for recovery of incurred costs for
    storm-recovery activities and the replenishment of Gulf
    Power’s property damage reserve. The order provides for an
    extension of the storm-recovery surcharge currently being
    collected by Gulf Power for an additional 27 months,
    expiring in June 2009. According to the stipulation, the funds
    resulting from the extension of the current surcharge will first
    be credited to the unrecovered balance of storm-recovery costs
    associated with Hurricane Ivan until these costs have been fully
    recovered. The funds will then be credited to the property
    reserve for recovery of the storm-recovery costs of
    $52.6 million associated with Hurricanes Dennis and Katrina
    that were previously charged to the reserve. Should revenues
    collected by Gulf Power through the extension of the
    storm-recovery surcharge exceed the storm-recovery costs
    associated with Hurricanes Dennis and Katrina, the excess
    revenues will be credited to the reserve. The annual accrual to
    the reserve of $3.5 million and Gulf Power’s limited
    discretionary authority to make additional accruals to the
    reserve will continue as previously approved by the Florida PSC.
    Gulf Power made discretionary accruals to the reserve of
    $3 million, $6 million, and $15 million in 2006,
    2005, and 2004, respectively. As part of the March 2005
    agreement regarding Hurricane Ivan costs that established the
    existing surcharge, Gulf Power agreed that it would not seek any
    additional increase in its base rates and charges to become
    effective on or before March 1, 2007. The terms of the
    stipulation do not alter or affect that portion of the prior
    agreement. According to the order, in the case of future storms,
    if Gulf Power incurs cumulative costs for storm-recovery
    activities in excess of $10 million during any calendar
    year, Gulf Power will be permitted to file a streamlined formal
    request for an interim surcharge. Any interim surcharge would
    provide for the recovery, subject to refund, of up to
    80 percent of the claimed costs for storm-recovery
    activities. Gulf Power would then petition the Florida PSC for
    full recovery through an additional surcharge or other cost
    recovery mechanism.

As of December 31, 2006, Gulf Power’s unrecovered
    balance in the property damage reserve totaled approximately
    $45.7 million, of which approximately $28.8 million
    and $16.9 million, respectively, are included in the
    balance sheets herein under “Current Assets” and
    “Deferred Charges and Other Assets.”

At Alabama Power, operation and maintenance expenses associated
    with Hurricane Ivan were $57.8 million. In 2005, Alabama
    Power received Alabama PSC approvals to return certain
    regulatory liabilities to the retail customers. These orders
    also allowed Alabama Power to simultaneously recover from
    customers accruals of approximately $48 million primarily
    to offset the costs of Hurricane Ivan and restore a positive
    balance in the natural disaster reserve. The combined effect of
    these orders had no impact on net income in 2005.

In December 2005, the Alabama PSC approved a separate rate rider
    to recover Alabama Power’s $51 million of deferred
    Hurricane Dennis and Katrina operation and maintenance costs
    over a two-year period and to replenish its reserve to a target
    balance of $75 million over a five-year period.

As of December 31, 2006, Alabama Power had recovered
    $49.5 million of the costs allowed for storm-recovery
    activities, of which $34.5 million was a reduction in the
    deficit balance in the property damage reserve account related
    to costs deferred from previous storms. The remaining under
    recovered balance in the property damage reserve account totaled
    approximately $16.8 million at December 31, 2006 and
    is included in the balance sheets herein under “Current
    Assets.” The remaining $15.0 million of the recovered
    amount was used to establish the target reserve for future
    storms. The balance in the target reserve for future storms was
    $13.2 million at December 31, 2006, and is included in
    the balance sheets herein under “Other Regulatory
    Liabilities.”

Southern
    Company Gas Sale

On January 4, 2006, Southern Company completed the sale of
    substantially all the assets of Southern Company Gas, its
    competitive retail natural gas marketing subsidiary, including
    natural gas inventory, accounts receivable, and customer list,
    to Gas South, LLC, an affiliate of Cobb Electric Membership
    Corporation. Southern Company Gas’ sale of such assets was
    pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement dated
    November 18, 2005 between Southern Company Gas and Gas
    South. The gross proceeds from the sale were approximately
$126 million. This sale had
    no material impact on Southern Company’s net income. As a
    result of the sale, Southern Company’s financial statements
    and related information reflect Southern Company Gas as
    discontinued operations for all periods presented.

INCOME
    TAXES

Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return
    and combined state income tax returns for the States of Alabama,
    Georgia, and Mississippi. Under a joint consolidated income tax
    allocation agreement, each subsidiary’s current and
    deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis. In
    accordance with IRS regulations, each company is jointly and
    severally liable for the tax liability.

Mirant was included in the consolidated federal tax return
    through April 2, 2001. In December 2004, the IRS concluded
    its audit for the tax years 2000 and 2001, and Southern Company
    paid $39 million in additional tax and interest for issues
    related to Mirant tax items. Under the terms of the separation
    agreements, Mirant agreed to indemnify Southern Company for
    subsequent assessment of any additional taxes related to its
    transactions prior to the spin off. However, as a result of
    Mirant’s bankruptcy, Southern Company sought reimbursement
    as an unsecured creditor. Based on management’s assessment
    of the collectibility of this $39 million receivable,
    Southern Company has reserved approximately $13.7 million.
    In December 2006, Southern Company received approximately
    $23 million in tax refunds from the IRS related to Mirant
    tax items. For additional information, see Note 3 under
    “Mirant Matters – Mirant Bankruptcy.”

At December 31, 2006, the tax-related regulatory assets and
    liabilities were $896 million and $293 million,
    respectively. These assets are attributable to tax benefits
    flowed through to customers in prior years and to taxes
    applicable to capitalized interest. These liabilities are
    attributable to deferred taxes previously recognized at rates
    higher than the current enacted tax law and to unamortized
    investment tax credits.

    income tax benefits of $59 million, if utilized. These
    deductions will expire between 2007 and 2021. During 2006,
    Southern Company utilized $10 million in available net
    operating losses, which resulted in a $0.6 million state
    income tax benefit. Beginning in 2002, the State of Georgia
    allowed the filing of a combined return, which should
    substantially reduce any additional net operating loss
    carryforwards.

In September 2006, Georgia Power filed its 2005 income tax
    returns, which included certain state income tax credits that
    resulted in a lower effective income tax rate for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 when compared to 2005. Georgia Power has
    also filed similar claims for the years 2001 through 2004.
    Amounts recorded in Southern Company’s financial statements
    for the year ended December 31, 2006 related to these
    claims are not material. The Georgia Department of Revenue is
    currently reviewing these claims. If approved as filed, such
    claims could have a significant, and possibly material, effect
    on Southern Company’s net income. The ultimate outcome of
    this matter cannot now be determined.

In accordance with regulatory requirements, deferred investment
    tax credits are amortized over the lives of the related property
    with such amortization normally applied as a credit to reduce
    depreciation in the statements of income. Credits amortized in
    this manner amounted to $23 million in 2006,
    $25 million in 2005, and $27 million in 2004. At
    December 31, 2006, all investment tax credits available to
    reduce federal income taxes payable had been utilized.

The provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income
    taxes determined by applying the applicable U.S. federal
    statutory rate to earnings before income taxes and preferred
    dividends of subsidiaries, as a result of the following:

FINANCING

Mandatorily
    Redeemable Preferred Securities/ Long-Term Debt Payable to
    Affiliated Trusts

Southern Company and the traditional operating companies have
    each formed certain wholly-owned trust subsidiaries for the
    purpose of issuing preferred securities. The proceeds of the
    related equity investments and preferred security sales were
    loaned back to Southern Company or the applicable traditional
    operating company through the issuance of junior subordinated
    notes totaling $1.6 billion, which constitute substantially
    all of the assets of these trusts and are reflected in the
    balance sheets as Long-term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts
    (including Securities Due Within One Year). Southern Company and
    the traditional operating companies each consider that the
    mechanisms and obligations relating to the preferred securities
    issued for its benefit, taken together, constitute a full and
    unconditional guarantee by it of the respective trusts’
    payment obligations with respect to these securities. At
    December 31, 2006, preferred securities of
    $1.5 billion were outstanding. Southern Company guarantees
    $206 million of notes related to these securities issued on
    its behalf. See Note 1 under “Variable Interest
    Entities” for additional information on the accounting
    treatment for these trusts and the related securities.

    $499 million in 2008; $604 million in 2009;
    $286 million in 2010, and $329 million in 2011. On
    February 1, 2007, $400 million of the 2007 long-term
    debt principal amount matured. The maturity was funded with
    short-term borrowings.

Assets
    Subject to Lien

Each of Southern Company’s subsidiaries is organized as a
    legal entity, separate and apart from Southern Company and its
    other subsidiaries. At January 1, 2006, Alabama Power and
    Gulf Power had mortgages that secured first mortgage bonds they
    had issued and constituted a direct first lien on substantially
    all of their respective fixed property and franchises. Alabama
    Power discharged its remaining outstanding first mortgage bond
    obligations and the first mortgage lien was removed in May 2006.
    Following the maturity of Gulf Power’s remaining
    outstanding first mortgage bonds in November 2006, the first
    mortgage lien was removed on January 26, 2007. The
    Mississippi Power and Georgia Power first mortgage liens were
    removed in 2005 and 2002, respectively. Alabama Power and Gulf
    Power have granted one or more liens on certain of their
    respective property in connection with the issuance of certain
    pollution control bonds with an outstanding principal amount of $194 million. There are no agreements or other
    arrangements among the subsidiary companies under which the
    assets of one company have been pledged or otherwise made
    available to satisfy obligations of Southern Company or any of
    its other subsidiaries.

Bank
    Credit Arrangements

At the beginning of 2007, unused credit arrangements with banks
    totaled $3.35 billion, of which $656 million expires
    during 2007 and $2.7 billion expires in 2008 and beyond. Of
    the $2.7 billion expiring in 2008 and beyond,
    $2.4 billion does not expire until 2011. The following

Approximately $79 million of the credit facilities expiring
    in 2007 allow the execution of term loans for an additional
    two-year period, and $343 million allow execution of
    one-year term loans. Most of these agreements include stated
    borrowing rates.

II-71


NOTES

(continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary
    Companies 2006 Annual Report

All of the credit arrangements require payment of commitment
    fees based on the unused portion of the commitments or the
    maintenance of compensating balances with the banks. Commitment
    fees are one-eighth of 1 percent or less for Southern
    Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern
    Power. Compensating balances are not legally restricted from
    withdrawal.

Most of the credit arrangements with banks have covenants that
    limit debt levels to 65 percent of total capitalization, as
    defined in the agreements. For purposes of these definitions,
    debt excludes the long-term debt payable to affiliated trusts.
    At December 31, 2006, Southern Company, Southern Power, and
    the traditional operating companies were each in compliance with
    their respective debt limit covenants.

In addition, the credit arrangements typically contain cross
    default provisions that would be triggered if the borrower
    defaulted on other indebtedness above a specified threshold. The
    cross default provisions are restricted only to the
    indebtedness, including any guarantee obligations, of the
    company that has such credit arrangements. Southern Company and
    its subsidiaries are currently in compliance with all such
    covenants. In the event of a material adverse change, as defined
    in Gulf Power’s credit agreements, Gulf Power would be
    prohibited from borrowing against unused credit arrangements
    totaling $10 million.

A portion of the $3.35 billion unused credit with banks is
    allocated to provide liquidity support to the traditional
    operating companies’ variable rate pollution control bonds.
    The amount of variable rate pollution control bonds requiring
    liquidity support as of December 31, 2006 was
    $719 million.

Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and
    Southern Power borrow primarily through commercial paper
    programs that have the liquidity support of committed bank
    credit arrangements. Southern Company and the traditional
    operating companies may also borrow through various other
    arrangements with banks and extendible commercial note programs.
    The amount of commercial paper outstanding and included in notes
    payable in the balance sheets at December 31, 2006 and
    December 31, 2005 was $1.8 billion and
    $944 million, respectively. In addition, the Company and
    the traditional operating companies had $30 million of
    extendible commercial notes and $140 million of short-term
    bank loans outstanding at December 31, 2006.

During 2006, the peak amount outstanding for short-term debt was
    $2.1 billion, and the average amount outstanding was
    $1.6 billion. The average annual interest rate on
    short-term debt was 5.2 percent for 2006 and
    3.5 percent for 2005.

Financial
    Instruments

The traditional operating companies and Southern Power enter
    into energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to
    electricity, gas, and other fuel price changes. However, due to
    cost-based rate regulations, the traditional operating companies
    have limited exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel
    prices and prices of electricity. In addition, Southern
    Power’s exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel
    prices and prices of electricity is limited because its
    long-term sales contracts generally shift substantially all fuel
    cost responsibility to the purchaser. Each of the traditional
    operating companies has implemented fuel-hedging programs at the
    instruction of their respective state PSCs. Together with
    Southern Power, the traditional operating companies may enter
    into hedges of forward electricity sales.

At December 31, 2006, the fair value gains/(losses) of
    energy-related derivative contracts was reflected in the
    financial statements as follows:

Amounts

(in millions)

(82

The fair value gains or losses for hedges that are recoverable
    through the regulatory fuel clauses are recorded as regulatory
    assets and liabilities and are recognized in earnings at the
    same time the hedged items affect earnings. For other hedges
    qualifying as cash flow hedges, including those of Southern
    Power, the fair value gains or losses are recorded in other
    comprehensive income and are reclassified into earnings at the
    same time the hedged items affect earnings. For 2006, 2005, and
    2004, the pre-tax gains (losses) reclassified from other
    comprehensive income from continuing operations to fuel expense
    or revenues was not material. For the year 2007, approximately
    $3 million of gains are expected to be reclassified from
    other comprehensive income to revenues. There was no significant
    ineffectiveness recorded in earnings for any period presented.
    Southern Company has energy-related hedges in place up to and
    including 2009.

During 2006, Southern Company entered into derivative
    transactions with net initial premiums paid of $20 million
    to reduce its exposure to a potential phase-out of certain
    income tax credits in 2006 and 2007. In

II-72

    Companies 2006 Annual Report

accordance with Section 45K of the Internal Revenue Code,
    these tax credits are subject to limitation as the annual
    average price of oil increases. At December 31, 2006, the
    fair value of the derivatives was a $12 million net
    liability. For 2006 and 2005, the fair value loss recognized in
    other income (expense) to mark the transactions to market was
    $32 million and $7 million, respectively.

Southern Company and certain subsidiaries also enter into
    derivatives to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates.
    Derivatives related to fixed-rate securities are accounted for
    as fair value hedges. Derivatives related to variable rate
    securities or forecasted transactions are accounted for as cash
    flow hedges. The derivatives employed as hedging instruments are
    structured to minimize ineffectiveness. As such, no material
    ineffectiveness has been recorded in earnings.

At December 31, 2006, Southern Company had
    $2.4 billion notional amount of interest rate swaps and
    options outstanding with net fair value losses of
    $2 million as follows:

For fair value hedges where the hedged item is an asset,
    liability, or firm commitment, the changes in the fair value of
    the hedging derivatives are recorded in earnings and are offset
    by the changes in the fair value of the hedged item.

The fair value gain or loss for cash flow hedges is recorded in
    other comprehensive income and is reclassified into earnings at
    the same time the hedged items affect earnings. In 2006, 2005,
    and 2004, the Company incurred net losses of $1 million,
    $19 million, and $7 million, respectively, upon
    termination of certain interest derivatives at the same time it
    issued debt. These losses have been deferred in other
    comprehensive income and will be amortized to interest expense
    over the life of the original interest derivative. For 2006,
    2005, and 2004, approximately $1 million, $10 million,
    and $23 million, respectively, of pre-tax losses were
    reclassified from other comprehensive income to interest
    expense. For 2007, pre-tax losses of approximately
    $15 million are expected to be reclassified from other
    comprehensive income to interest expense.

COMMITMENTS

Construction
    Program

Southern Company is engaged in continuous construction programs,
    currently estimated to total $3.9 billion in 2007,
    $4.5 billion in 2008, and $4.8 billion in 2009. These
    amounts include $120 million, $109 million, and
    $122 million in 2007, 2008, and 2009, respectively, for
    construction expenditures related to contractual purchase
    commitments for uranium and nuclear fuel conversion, enrichment,
    and fabrication services included herein under “Fuel and
    Purchased Power Commitments.” The construction programs are
    subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction
    costs may vary from the above estimates because of numerous
    factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions;
    acquisition of additional generating assets; revised load growth
    estimates; changes in environmental regulations; changes in
    existing nuclear plants to meet new regulatory requirements;
    changes in FERC rules and regulations; increasing costs of
    labor, equipment, and materials; and cost of capital. At
    December 31, 2006, significant purchase commitments were
    outstanding in connection with the ongoing construction program,
    which includes new facilities and capital improvements to
    transmission, distribution, and generation facilities, including
    those to meet environmental standards.

Long-Term
    Service Agreements

The traditional operating companies and Southern Power have
    entered into Long-Term Service Agreements (LTSAs) with General
    Electric (GE) for the purpose of securing maintenance support
    for the combined cycle and combustion turbine generating
    facilities owned by the subsidiaries, with the exception of
    newly acquired Plants DeSoto and Rowan. The LTSAs provide that
    GE will perform all planned inspections on the covered
    equipment, which includes the cost of all labor and materials.
    GE is also obligated to cover the costs of unplanned maintenance
    on the covered equipment subject to a limit specified in each
    contract.

In general, except for Southern Power’s Plant Dahlberg,
    these LTSAs are in effect through two major inspection cycles
    per unit. The Dahlberg agreement is in effect through the first
    major inspection of each unit. Scheduled payments to GE are made
    at various intervals based on actual operating hours of the
    respective units. Total remaining payments to GE under these
    agreements for facilities owned are currently estimated at
    $1.6 billion over the remaining life of the agreements,
    which are currently estimated to range up to 30 years.
    However, the LTSAs contain various cancellation provisions at
    the option of the purchasers.

Georgia Power has also entered into an LTSA with GE through 2014
    for neutron monitoring system parts and electronics at Plant
    Hatch. Total remaining payments to GE under this agreement are
    currently estimated at $12.2 million. The contract contains
    cancellation provisions at the option of Georgia Power.

Payments made to GE prior to the performance of any work are
    recorded as a prepayment in the balance sheets. All work
    performed by GE is capitalized or charged to expense (net of any
    joint owner billings), as appropriate based on the nature of the
    work.

Fuel and
    Purchased Power Commitments

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of the generating
    plants, Southern Company has entered into various long-term
    commitments for the procurement of fossil and nuclear fuel. In
    most cases, these contracts contain provisions for price
    escalations, minimum purchase levels, and other financial
    commitments. Coal commitments include forward contract purchases
    for sulfur dioxide emission allowances. Natural gas purchase
    commitments contain fixed volumes with prices based on various
    indices at the time of delivery. Amounts included in the chart
    below represent estimates based on New York Mercantile Exchange
    future prices at December 31, 2006. Also, Southern Company
    has entered into various long-term commitments for the purchase
    of electricity. Total estimated minimum long-term obligations at
    December 31, 2006 were as follows:

Operating
    Leases

In May 2001, Mississippi Power began the initial

10-year

term
    of a lease agreement for a combined cycle generating facility
    built at Plant Daniel for approximately $370 million. In
    2003, the generating facility was acquired by Juniper Capital
    L.P. (Juniper), whose partners are unaffiliated with Mississippi
    Power. Simultaneously, Juniper entered into a restructured lease
    agreement with Mississippi Power. Juniper has also entered into
    leases with other parties unrelated to Mississippi Power. The
    assets leased by Mississippi Power comprise less than
    50 percent of Juniper’s assets. Mississippi Power is
    not required to consolidate the leased assets and related
    liabilities, and the lease with Juniper is considered an
    operating lease. The initial lease term ends in 2011, and the
    lease includes a purchase and renewal option based on the cost
    of the facility at the inception of the lease. Mississippi Power
    is required to amortize approximately 4 percent of the
    initial acquisition cost over the initial lease term. Eighteen
    months prior to the end of the initial lease, Mississippi Power
    may elect to renew for 10 years. If the lease is renewed,
    the agreement calls for Mississippi Power to amortize an
    additional 17 percent of the initial completion cost over
    the renewal period. Upon termination of the lease, at
    Mississippi Power’s option, it may either exercise its
    purchase option or the facility can be sold to a third party.

The lease provides for a residual value guarantee, approximately
    73 percent of the acquisition cost, by Mississippi Power
    that is due upon termination of the

II-74


NOTES

(continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary
    Companies 2006 Annual Report

lease in the event that Mississippi Power does not renew the
    lease or purchase the assets and that the fair market value is
    less than the unamortized cost of the asset. A liability of
    approximately $9 million for the fair market value of this
    residual value guarantee is included in the balance sheet as of
    December 31, 2006.

Southern Company also has other operating lease agreements with
    various terms and expiration dates. Total operating lease
    expenses were $161 million, $150 million, and
    $156 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.
    Southern Company includes any step rents, escalations, and lease
    concessions in its computation of minimum lease payments, which
    are recognized on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease
    term. At December 31, 2006, estimated minimum lease
    payments for noncancelable operating leases were as follows:

For the traditional operating companies, the barge and rail car
    lease expenses are recoverable through fuel cost recovery
    provisions. In addition to the above rental commitments, Alabama
    Power and Georgia Power have obligations upon expiration of
    certain leases with respect to the residual value of the leased
    property. These leases expire in 2009, 2010, and 2011, and the
    maximum obligations are $20 million, $62 million, and
    $64 million, respectively. At the termination of the
    leases, the lessee may either exercise its purchase option, or
    the property can be sold to a third party. Alabama Power and
    Georgia Power expect that the fair market value of the leased
    property would substantially reduce or eliminate the payments
    under the residual value obligations.

Guarantees

Prior to the spin-off, Southern Company made separate guarantees
    to certain counterparties regarding performance of contractual
    commitments by Mirant’s trading and marketing subsidiaries.
    The total notional amount of guarantees outstanding at
    December 31, 2006 is less than $20 million, all of
    which will expire by 2009.

As discussed earlier in this Note under “Operating
    Leases,” Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi
    Power have entered into certain residual value guarantees.

COMMON
    STOCK

Stock
    Issued

In 2006, Southern Company raised $1 million (53,000 shares)
    from the issuance of new common shares and $136 million
    (5 million shares) from the issuance of treasury stock
    under the Company’s various stock programs. In 2005, the
    Company raised $213 million (10 million shares) from
    the issuance of new common shares under the Company’s
    various stock programs.

Stock
    Repurchased

In early January 2006, Southern Company discontinued the common
    stock repurchase program begun in 2005 which was designed
    primarily to offset the shares of common stock issued under the
    Company’s various stock programs. In January 2006, prior to
    the discontinuance of the program, Southern Company repurchased
    approximately 3,000 shares of common stock at a total cost
    of $0.1 million. During 2005, Southern Company repurchased
    10 million shares of common stock at a total cost of
    $352 million.

Shares Reserved

At December 31, 2006, a total of 88.9 million shares
    was reserved for issuance pursuant to the Southern Investment
    Plan, the Employee Savings Plan, the Outside Directors Stock
    Plan, and the Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (stock option
    plan).

Stock
    Option Plan

Southern Company provides non-qualified stock options to a large
    segment of its employees ranging from line management to
    executives. As of December 31, 2006, 6,509 current and
    former employees participated in the stock option plan. The
    maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued
    under these programs may not exceed 57 million. The prices
    of options granted to date have been at the fair market value of
    the shares on the dates of grant. Options granted to date become
    exercisable pro rata over a maximum period of three years from
    the date of grant. Southern Company generally recognizes stock
    option expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period
    which equates to the requisite

    Companies 2006 Annual Report

service period; however, for employees who are eligible for
    retirement the total cost is expensed at the grant date. Options
    outstanding will expire no later than 10 years after the
    date of grant, unless terminated earlier by the Southern Company
    Board of Directors in accordance with the stock option plan. For
    certain stock option awards, a change in control will provide
    accelerated vesting. As part of the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R), as discussed in Note 1 under
    “Stock Options,” Southern Company has not modified its
    stock option plan or outstanding stock options, nor has it
    changed the underlying valuation assumptions used in valuing the
    stock options that were used under SFAS No. 123.

The number of stock options vested, and expected to vest in the
    future, as of December 31, 2006 is not significantly
    different from the number of stock options outstanding at
    December 31, 2006 as stated above.

As of December 31, 2006, the weighted average remaining
    contractual term for the options outstanding and options
    exercisable is 6.4 years and 5.2 years, respectively,
    and the aggregate intrinsic value for the options outstanding
    and options exercisable is $283 million and
    $231 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2006, there was $10 million of
    total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option
    awards not yet vested. That cost is expected to be recognized
    over a weighted-average period of approximately 11 months.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years
    ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 was
    $36 million, $130 million, and $81 million,
    respectively.

The actual tax benefit realized by the Company for the tax
    deductions from stock option exercises totaled $14 million,
    $50 million, and $31 million, respectively, for the
    years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004.

Southern Company has a policy of issuing shares to satisfy share
    option exercises. In January 2006, the Company started reissuing
    treasury shares that it had previously repurchased. The
    repurchase program ended in January 2006. Cash received from
    issuances related to option exercises under the share-based
    payment arrangements for the years ended December 31, 2006,
    2005, and 2004 was $77 million, $213 million, and
    $119 million, respectively.

Diluted
    Earnings Per Share

For Southern Company, the only difference in computing basic and
    diluted earnings per share is attributable to outstanding
    options under the stock option plan. The effect of the stock
    options was determined using the treasury stock method. Shares
    used to compute diluted earnings per share are as follows:

Common
    Stock Dividend Restrictions

The income of Southern Company is derived primarily from equity
    in earnings of its subsidiaries. At December 31, 2006,
    consolidated retained earnings included $4.8 billion of
    undistributed retained earnings of the subsidiaries. Southern
    Power’s credit facility contains potential limitations on
    the payment of common stock dividends; as of December 31,
    2006, Southern Power was in compliance with all such
    requirements.

NUCLEAR
    INSURANCE

Under the Price-Anderson Amendments Act (Act), Alabama Power and
    Georgia Power maintain agreements of indemnity with the NRC
    that, together with private insurance, cover third-party
    liability arising from any nuclear incident occurring at the
    companies’ nuclear power plants. The Act provides funds up
    to $10.76 billion for public liability claims that could
    arise from a single nuclear incident. Each nuclear plant is
    insured against this liability to a maximum of $300 million
    by American Nuclear Insurers (ANI), with the remaining coverage
    provided by a mandatory program of deferred premiums

that could be assessed, after a nuclear incident, against all
    owners of nuclear reactors. A company could be assessed up to
    $101 million per incident for each licensed reactor it
    operates but not more than an aggregate of $15 million per
    incident to be paid in a calendar year for each reactor. Such
    maximum assessment, excluding any applicable state premium
    taxes, for Alabama Power and Georgia Power, based on its
    ownership and buyback interests, is $201 million and
    $203 million, respectively, per incident, but not more than
    an aggregate of $30 million per company to be paid for each
    incident in any one year.

Alabama Power and Georgia Power are members of Nuclear Electric
    Insurance Limited (NEIL), a mutual insurer established to
    provide property damage insurance in an amount up to
    $500 million for members’ nuclear generating
    facilities.

Additionally, both companies have policies that currently
    provide decontamination, excess property insurance, and
    premature decommissioning coverage up to $2.25 billion for
    losses in excess of the $500 million primary coverage. This
    excess insurance is also provided by NEIL.

NEIL also covers the additional costs that would be incurred in
    obtaining replacement power during a prolonged accidental outage
    at a member’s nuclear plant. Members can purchase this
    coverage, subject to a deductible waiting period of up to
    26 weeks, with a maximum per occurrence per unit limit of
    $490 million. After the deductible period, weekly indemnity
    payments would be received until either the unit is operational
    or until the limit is exhausted in approximately three years.
    Alabama Power and Georgia Power each purchase the maximum limit
    allowed by NEIL, subject to ownership limitations. Each facility
    has elected a

12-week

waiting period.

Under each of the NEIL policies, members are subject to
    assessments if losses each year exceed the accumulated funds
    available to the insurer under that policy. The current maximum
    annual assessments for Alabama Power and Georgia Power under the
    NEIL policies would be $38 million and $49 million,
    respectively.

Following the terrorist attacks of September 2001, both ANI and
    NEIL confirmed that terrorist acts against commercial nuclear
    power plants would, subject to the normal policy limits, be
    covered under their insurance. Both companies, however, revised
    their policy terms on a prospective basis to include an industry
    aggregate for all “non-certified” terrorist acts,
    i.e., acts that are not certified acts of terrorism pursuant to
    the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, which was renewed in
    2005. The aggregate for all NEIL policies, which applies to
    non-certified property claims stemming from terrorism within a

12-month

duration, is $3.24 billion plus any amounts available
    through reinsurance or indemnity from an outside source. The
    non-certified ANI nuclear liability cap is a $300 million
    shared industry aggregate during the normal ANI policy period.

For all

on-site

property damage insurance policies for commercial nuclear power
    plants, the NRC requires that the proceeds of such policies
    shall be dedicated first for the sole purpose of placing the
    reactor in a safe and stable condition after an accident. Any
    remaining proceeds are to be applied next toward the costs of
    decontamination and debris removal operations ordered by the
    NRC, and any further remaining proceeds are to be paid either to
    the company or to its bond trustees as may be appropriate under
    the policies and applicable trust indentures.

All retrospective assessments, whether generated for liability,
    property, or replacement power, may be subject to applicable
    state premium taxes.

SEGMENT
    AND RELATED INFORMATION

Southern Company’s reportable business segment is the sale
    of electricity in the Southeast by the traditional operating
    companies and Southern Power. Net income and total assets for
    discontinued operations are included in the reconciling
    eliminations column. The “All Other” column includes
    parent Southern Company, which does not allocate operating
    expenses to business segments. Also, this category includes
    segments below the quantitative threshold for separate
    disclosure. These segments include investments in synthetic
    fuels and leveraged lease projects, telecommunications, and
    energy-related services. Southern Power’s revenues from
    sales to the traditional operating companies were
    $492 million, $557 million, and $425 million in
    2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. In addition, see Note 1
    under “Related Party Transactions” for information
    regarding revenues from services for synthetic fuel production
    that are included in the cost of fuel purchased by Alabama Power
    and Georgia Power. All other intersegment revenues are not
    material. Financial data for business segments and products and
    services are as follows:

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Alabama
    Power Company

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements
    of capitalization of Alabama Power Company (the
    “Company”) (a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern
    Company) as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related
    statements of income, comprehensive income, common
    stockholder’s equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2006. These
    financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to
    have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
    control over financial reporting. Our audits included
    consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a
    basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
    circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
    on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An
    audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
    supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
    the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
    our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements

(pages II-104

to II-134) present fairly, in all material respects, the
    financial position of Alabama Power Company at December 31,
    2006 and 2005, and the results of its operations and its cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2006, in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America.

As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, in 2006
    Alabama Power Company changed its method of accounting for the
    funded status of defined benefit pension and other
    postretirement plans.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

Alabama Power Company 2006
    Annual Report

OVERVIEW

Business
    Activities

Alabama Power Company (the Company) operates as a vertically
    integrated utility providing electricity to retail customers
    within its traditional service area located within the State of
    Alabama and to wholesale customers in the Southeast.

Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of
    the Company’s primary business of selling electricity.
    These factors include the ability to maintain a stable
    regulatory environment, to achieve energy sales growth, and to
    effectively manage and secure timely recovery of rising costs.
    These costs include those related to growing demand,
    increasingly stringent environmental standards, fuel prices, and
    restoration following major storms.

In December 2006, the Company filed for an increase in retail
    base rates under Rate Stabilization and Equalization Plan (Rate
    RSE) based on a forward-looking test period. This increase
    became effective with billings beginning in January 2007. This
    and other regulatory actions are expected to assist the
    Company’s continued focus on providing reliable electrical
    service to customers while maintaining a stable financial
    position.

Key
    Performance Indicators

In striving to maximize shareholder value while providing
    cost-effective energy to customers, the Company continues to
    focus on several key indicators. These indicators include
    customer satisfaction, plant availability, system reliability,
    and net income. The Company’s financial success is directly
    tied to the satisfaction of its customers. Key elements of
    ensuring customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high
    reliability, and competitive prices. Management uses customer
    satisfaction surveys and reliability indicators to evaluate the
    Company’s results.

Peak season equivalent forced outage rate (Peak Season EFOR) is
    an indicator of fossil/hydro plant availability and efficient
    generation fleet operations during the months when generation
    needs are greatest. The rate is calculated by dividing the
    number of hours of forced outages by total generation hours.
    Transmission and distribution system reliability performance is
    measured by the frequency and duration of outages. Performance
    targets for reliability are set internally based on historical
    performance, expected weather conditions, and expected capital
    expenditures. The performance for 2006 exceeded all targets on
    these reliability measures. Net income is the primary component
    of the Company’s contribution to Southern Company’s
    earnings per share goal. The Company’s 2006 results
    compared with its targets for each of these indicators are
    reflected in the following chart.

See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for additional information on
    the Company’s financial performance. The financial
    performance achieved in 2006 reflects the continued emphasis
    that management places on these indicators, as well as the
    commitment shown by employees in achieving or exceeding
    management’s expectations.

Earnings

The Company’s financial performance remained strong in 2006
    despite the challenges of rising costs. The Company’s net
    income after dividends on preferred and preference stock of
    $518 million in 2006 increased $10 million
    (1.9 percent) over the prior year. This improvement is
    primarily due to retail and wholesale revenue growth offset by
    higher non-fuel operating expenses and increased interest
    expense.

The Company’s 2005 net income after dividends on
    preferred stock was $508 million, representing a
    $27 million (5.6 percent) increase from the prior
    year. This improvement was primarily due to retail and wholesale
    revenue growth and increases in transmission revenues, partially
    offset by higher non-fuel operating expenses.

The Company’s 2004 net income after dividends on
    preferred stock was $481 million, representing an
    $8 million (1.8 percent) increase from the prior year.
    This improvement was primarily due to retail sales growth,
    increases in other revenues, and lower interest expense,
    partially offset by higher non-fuel operating expenses.

Retail revenues in 2006 were $4.0 billion. These revenues
    increased $375 million (10.3 percent) in 2006,
    $328 million (10.0 percent) in 2005, and
    $242 million (7.9 percent) in 2004. These increases
    were primarily due to increased fuel revenue and retail base
    rate increases of 2.6 percent in January 2006,
    1.0 percent in January 2005, and 0.8 percent in July
    2004. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “PSC
    Matters” herein and Note 3 to the financial statements
    under “Retail Regulatory Matters” for additional
    information.

Fuel rates billed to customers are designed to fully recover
    fluctuating fuel and purchased power costs over a period of
    time. Fuel revenues generally have no effect on net income
    because they represent the recording of revenues to offset fuel
    and purchased power expenses. See FUTURE EARNINGS
    POTENTIAL – “PSC Matters – Retail Fuel
    Cost Recovery” herein and Note 3 to the financial
    statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters –
    Fuel Cost Recovery” for additional information.

Sales for resale to non-affiliates are predominantly unit power
    sales under long-term contracts to Florida utilities. Capacity
    revenues under unit power sales contracts reflect the recovery
    of fixed costs and a return on investment, and under these
    contracts, energy is generally sold at variable cost.
    Fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices, which are the
    primary fuel sources for unit power sales customers, influence
    changes in these

II-85

sales. However, because energy is generally sold at variable
    cost, these fluctuations have a minimal effect on earnings.
    These capacity and energy components of the unit power sales
    contracts were as follows:

Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in sales
    for resale to non-affiliates. These opportunity sales are made
    at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above the
    Company’s variable cost to produce the energy. Revenues
    associated with other power sales to non-affiliates were as

Revenues from sales to affiliated companies within the Southern
    Company system will vary from year to year depending on demand
    and the availability and cost of generating resources at each
    company. These affiliated sales and purchases are made in
    accordance with the Intercompany Interchange Contract
    (IIC) as approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory
    Commission (FERC). In 2006, sales for resale revenues decreased
    $72.9 million primarily due to a 16.7 percent decrease
    in price and a 10.3 percent decrease in

kilowatt-hour

(KWH) sales to affiliates as a result of a decrease in the
    availability of the Company’s generating resources because
    of an increase in customer demand within the Company’s
    service territory. In 2005, sales for resale revenues decreased
    $19.4 million primarily due to a 20.7 percent decrease
    in KWH sales to affiliates as a result of a decrease in the
    availability of the Company’s generating resources due to
    an increase in customer demand within the Company’s service
    territory. Sales for resale revenues increased
    $31.1 million in 2004 due to increases in fuel-related
    expenses. Excluding the capacity revenues, these transactions do
    not have a significant impact on earnings since the energy is
    generally sold at marginal cost and energy purchases are
    generally offset by energy revenues through the Company’s
    energy cost recovery clause.

Other operating revenues in 2006 decreased $17.6 million
    (9.5 percent) from 2005 primarily due to a decrease of
    $14.6 million in revenues from gas-fueled co-generation
    steam facilities primarily as a result of lower gas prices. In
    2005, other operating revenues increased $35.0 million
    (23.2 percent) from 2004 due to an increase of
    $20 million in revenues from gas-fueled co-generation steam
    facilities primarily as a result of higher gas prices, a
    $7.7 million increase in transmission revenues, and a
    $3.9 million increase from rent from associated companies
    primarily related to leased transmission facilities. Other
    operating revenues in 2004 increased $7.0 million
    (4.9 percent) from 2003 due to an increase of
    $7.7 million in revenues from gas-fueled co-generation
    steam facilities primarily as a result of higher gas prices, and
    a $2.4 million increase in revenues from rent from electric
    property offset by a $2.0 million decrease in transmission
    revenues. Since co-generation steam revenues are generally
    offset by fuel expense, these revenues did not have a
    significant impact on earnings for any year reported.

Energy
    Sales

Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in
    volume of energy sold from year to year. KWH sales for 2006 and
    the percent change by year were as follows:

Retail energy sales in 2006 were 1.2 percent higher than in
    2005. Energy sales in the residential and commercial sectors led
    the growth with a 3.1 percent and a 2.1 percent
    increase, respectively, in 2006 due primarily to weather-driven
    increased demand. Industrial sales decreased 0.7 percent
    during the year as several large textile facilities discontinued
    or substantially reduced their operations in 2006. In addition,
    industrial sales decreased due to pulp and paper customers
    utilizing self-generation

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

    Annual Report

as a result of lower gas prices during the year compared to 2005.

Retail energy sales in 2005 were 2.7 percent higher than
    2004 despite interruptions during Hurricanes Dennis and Katrina.
    Energy sales in the residential sector led the growth with a
    4.1 percent increase in 2005 due primarily to increased
    demand. Commercial sales increased 1.7 percent in 2005
    primarily due to continued customer growth. Industrial sales
    increased 2.2 percent during the year with chemical,
    primary metals and automotive leading the growth in industrial
    energy consumption. In addition, the paper sector chose to
    purchase rather than self-generate which contributed to
    increased sales.

Retail energy sales in the residential sector grew by
    2.4 percent in 2004 primarily due to continued customer
    growth and a return to normal summer temperatures. Commercial
    sales increased 2.8 percent in 2004 primarily due to
    continued customer growth. Industrial sales rebounded
    5.8 percent during the year with primary metals, chemical,
    and paper sectors leading the growth.

Expenses

Fuel
    and Purchased Power

Fuel costs constitute the single largest expense for the
    Company. The mix of fuel sources for generation of electricity
    is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel
    consumed, and the availability of generating units. Details of
    the Company’s generation, fuel, and purchased power are as
    follows:

Fuel and purchased power expenses were $2.1 billion in
    2006, an increase of $184.1 million (9.6 percent)
    above the prior year costs. This increase was the result of a
    $128.7 million increase in the cost of fuel and a
    $55.4 million increase related to total KWH generated and
    purchased.

Fuel and purchased power expenses were $1.9 billion in
    2005, an increase of $315.4 million (19.7 percent)
    above the prior year costs. This increase was the result of a
    $367.4 million increase in the cost of fuel offset by a
    $52.0 million decrease related to total KWH generated and
    purchased.

Fuel and purchased power expenses were $1.6 billion in
    2004, an increase of $216.3 million (15.6 percent)
    above the prior year costs. This increase was the result of a
    $218.4 million increase in the cost of fuel offset by a
    $2.1 million decrease related to total KWH generated and
    purchased.

Purchased power consists of purchases from affiliates in the
    Southern Company system and non-affiliated companies. Purchased
    power transactions among the Company, its affiliates, and
    non-affiliates will vary from period to period depending on
    demand and the availability and variable production cost of
    generating resources at each company. Purchased power from
    non-affiliates decreased $64.7 million (34.3 percent)
    in 2006. This decrease was due to a 26.8 percent decrease
    in the amount of energy purchased and a 10.3 percent
    decrease in purchased power prices over the previous year. In
    2005, purchased power from non-affiliates increased
    $2.5 million (1.0 percent) due to a 14.3 percent
    increase in purchased power prices over the previous year. In
    2004, purchased power from non-affiliates increased
    $75 million (68.0 percent) due to a 71.7 percent
    increase in energy purchased offset by a 1.9 percent
    decrease in purchased power prices compared to 2003.

While prices have moderated somewhat in 2006, a significant
    upward trend in the cost of coal and natural gas has emerged
    since 2003, and volatility in these markets is expected to
    continue. Increased coal prices have been influenced by a
    worldwide increase in demand as a result of rapid economic
    growth in China, as well as by increases in mining and fuel
    transportation costs. Higher natural gas prices in the United
    States are the result of increased demand and slightly lower gas
    supplies despite increased drilling activity. Natural gas
    production and supply interruptions, such as those caused by the
    2004 and 2005 hurricanes, result in an immediate market
    response; however, the long-term impact of this price volatility
    may be reduced by imports of liquefied natural gas if new
    liquefied gas facilities are built. Fuel expenses

generally do not affect net income, since they are offset by
    fuel revenues under the Company’s energy cost recovery
    clause. The Company continuously monitors the under/over
    recovered balance and files for a revised fuel rate when
    management deems appropriate. See FUTURE EARNINGS
    POTENTIAL – “PSC Matters – Retail Fuel
    Cost Recovery” herein and Note 3 to the financial
    statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters –
    Fuel Cost Recovery” for additional information.

Other
    Operating Expenses

Other
    Operations and Maintenance

In 2006, other operations and maintenance expenses increased
    $52.8 million (5.1 percent) primarily due to an
    $18.8 million increase in administrative and general
    expenses related to employee benefits, a $10.1 million
    increase in nuclear production expense related to both routine
    operation and scheduled outage costs, a $9.8 million
    increase in transmission and distribution expense related to
    overhead and underground line costs, and a $5.4 million
    increase in steam production expense related to environmental
    costs. In 2005, other operations and maintenance expenses
    increased $96.7 million (10.2 percent). This increase
    was primarily due to an increase in transmission and
    distribution expense of $37.3 million as a result of the
    Alabama Public Service Commission (PSC) accounting order to
    offset the costs of the damage from Hurricane Ivan in September
    2004 and to restore a balance in the natural disaster reserve.
    See Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements under
    “Natural Disaster Reserve” and “Natural Disaster
    Cost Recovery,” respectively, for additional information.
    In addition, steam production expense increased
    $28.1 million related to scheduled outage costs and
    administrative and general expenses increased $20.7 million
    related to employee benefits. In 2004, other operations and
    maintenance expenses increased $26.6 million
    (2.9 percent) primarily due to an increase in
    administrative and general expenses related to employee benefits.

Depreciation
    and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased
    $24.5 million (5.7 percent) in 2006 primarily due to
    additions to property, plant, and equipment. In 2005,
    depreciation and amortization expenses remained relatively flat
    compared to the prior year, increasing only $0.6 million
    (0.1 percent). During 2005, the depreciation rates used by
    the Company were adjusted based on a periodic study conducted by
    external experts that is used to determine the appropriateness
    of the rates utilized. Also in 2005, additions to property,
    plant, and equipment, which resulted in increased depreciation
    expense, were offset by the suspension of $18 million in
    nuclear decommissioning costs by the Alabama PSC due to the
    extension of the operating license for both units at Plant
    Farley. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “Nuclear
    Relicensing” and Note 1 to the financial statements
    under “Nuclear Decommissioning” for additional
    information. In 2004, depreciation and amortization expenses
    increased $13 million (3.1 percent) primarily due to
    an increase in utility plant in service. This increase reflects
    the impact of additions to property, plant, and equipment.

Taxes
    other than Income Taxes

Taxes other than income taxes increased $9.3 million
    (3.7 percent) in 2006, $6.0 million (2.5 percent)
    in 2005, and $14.4 million (6.3 percent) in 2004,
    primarily due to increases in state and municipal public utility
    license taxes which are directly related to the increase in
    retail revenues.

Other
    Income and (Expense)

Allowance
    for Equity Funds Used During Construction

Allowance for equity funds used during construction (AFUDC)
    decreased $2.0 million (10.0 percent) in 2006
    primarily due to the timing of construction expenditures
    compared to the prior year. AFUDC increased $4.1 million
    (25.6 percent) and $3.5 million (28.2 percent) in
    2005 and 2004, respectively, primarily due to increases in the
    amount of construction work in progress over the prior year. See
    Note 1 to the financial statements under “Allowance
    for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC)” for additional
    information.

Interest

Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased
    $38.7 million (19.6 percent) in 2006 primarily due to
    higher interest rates and an increase in the average debt
    outstanding during the year. Interest expense, net of amounts
    capitalized, increased $3.8 million (2.0 percent) in
    2005 due to an increase in average debt outstanding during the
    year. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, decreased
    $20.7 million (9.7 percent) in 2004 due to refinancing
    activities.

Effects
    of Inflation

The Company is subject to rate regulation that is based on the
    recovery of costs. Rate RSE is based on annual projected costs,
    including estimates for inflation. When historical costs are
    included, or when inflation exceeds the projected costs used in
    rate regulation, the effects of

II-88


MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

(continued)

Alabama Power Company 2006
    Annual Report

inflation can create an economic loss since the recovery of
    costs could be in dollars that have less purchasing power. In
    addition, the income tax laws are based on historical costs. The
    inflation rate has been relatively low in recent years and any
    adverse effect of inflation on the Company has not been
    substantial.

FUTURE
    EARNINGS POTENTIAL

General

The Company operates as a vertically integrated utility
    providing electricity to retail customers within its traditional
    service area located in the State of Alabama and to wholesale
    customers in the Southeast. Prices for electricity provided by
    the Company to retail customers are set by the Alabama PSC under
    cost-based regulatory principles. Prices for electricity
    relating to purchased power agreements (PPAs), interconnecting
    transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power are
    regulated by the FERC. Retail rates and earnings are reviewed
    and may be adjusted periodically within certain limitations. See
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES – “Application of Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates – Electric Utility
    Regulation” herein and Note 3 to the financial
    statements under “FERC Matters” and “Retail
    Regulatory Matters” for additional information about
    regulatory matters.

The results of operations for the past three years are not
    necessarily indicative of future earnings potential. The level
    of the Company’s future earnings depends on numerous
    factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of
    the Company’s primary business of selling electricity.
    These factors include the Company’s ability to maintain a
    stable regulatory environment that continues to allow for the
    recovery of all prudently incurred costs during a time of
    increasing costs. Future earnings in the near term will depend,
    in part, upon growth in energy sales, which is subject to a
    number of factors. These factors include weather, competition,
    new energy contracts with neighboring utilities, energy
    conservation practiced by customers, the price of electricity,
    the price elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic growth
    in the Company’s service area.

Assuming normal weather, sales to retail customers are projected
    to grow approximately 1.1 percent annually on average
    during 2007 through 2011.

Environmental
    Matters

Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other
    environmental regulations could affect earnings if such costs
    cannot be fully recovered in rates on a timely basis.
    Environmental compliance spending over the next several years
    may exceed amounts estimated. Some of the factors driving the
    potential for such an increase are higher commodity costs,
    market demand for labor, and scope additions and clarifications.
    The timing, specific requirements, and estimated costs could
    also change as environmental regulations are modified. See
    Note 3 to the financial statements under
    “Environmental Matters” for additional information.

New
    Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
    brought a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the
    Northern District of Georgia against certain Southern Company
    subsidiaries, including the Company, alleging that it had
    violated the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air
    Act and related state laws at certain coal-fired generating
    facilities. Through subsequent amendments and other legal
    procedures, the EPA filed a separate action in January 2001
    against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the
    Northern District of Alabama after the Company was dismissed
    from the original action. In these lawsuits, the EPA alleged
    that NSR violations occurred at five coal-fired generating
    facilities operated by the Company. The civil actions request
    penalties and injunctive relief, including an order requiring
    the installation of the best available control technology at the
    affected units.

On June 19, 2006, the U.S. District Court for the
    Northern District of Alabama entered a consent decree between
    the Company and the EPA, resolving the alleged NSR violations at
    Plant Miller. The consent decree required the Company to pay
    $100,000 to resolve the government’s claim for a civil
    penalty and to donate $4.9 million of sulfur dioxide
    emission allowances to a nonprofit charitable organization and
    formalized specific emissions reductions to be accomplished by
    the Company, consistent with other Clean Air Act programs that
    require emissions reductions. On August 14, 2006, the
    district court in Alabama granted the Company’s motion for
    summary judgment and entered final judgment in favor of the
    Company on the EPA’s claims related to Plants Barry,
    Gaston, Gorgas, and Greene County. The plaintiffs have appealed
    this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
    Circuit and, on November 14, 2006, the Eleventh Circuit
    granted the plaintiffs’ request to stay the appeal, pending
    the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in a similar NSR case
    filed by the EPA against Duke Energy.

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and
    the EPA regulations and interpretations in effect at the time
    the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act authorizes
    maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $32,500 per day, per
    violation at

each generating unit, depending on the date of the alleged
    violation. An adverse outcome in this matter could require
    substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at
    this time and could possibly require payment of substantial
    penalties. Such expenditures could affect future results of
    operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such costs
    are not recovered through regulated rates.

The EPA has issued a series of proposed and final revisions to
    its NSR regulations under the Clean Air Act, many of which have
    been subject to legal challenges by environmental groups and
    states. On June 24, 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals
    for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld, in part, the
    EPA’s revisions to NSR regulations that were issued in
    December 2002 but vacated portions of those revisions addressing
    the exclusion of certain pollution control projects. These
    regulatory revisions have been adopted by the State of Alabama.
    On March 17, 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
    District of Columbia Circuit also vacated an EPA rule which
    sought to clarify the scope of the existing Routine Maintenance,
    Repair and Replacement exclusion. In October 2005 and September
    2006, the EPA also published proposed rules clarifying the test
    for determining when an emissions increase subject to the NSR
    permitting requirements has occurred. The impact of these
    proposed rules will depend on adoption of the final rules by the
    EPA and the State of Alabama’s implementation of such
    rules, as well as the outcome of any additional legal
    challenges, and, therefore, cannot be determined at this time.

Carbon
    Dioxide Litigation

In July 2004, attorneys general from eight states, each outside
    of Southern Company’s service territory, and the
    corporation counsel for New York City filed a complaint in the
    U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York
    against Southern Company and four other electric power
    companies. A nearly identical complaint was filed by three
    environmental groups in the same court. The complaints allege
    that the companies’ emissions of carbon dioxide, a
    greenhouse gas, contribute to global warming, which the
    plaintiffs assert is a public nuisance. Under common law public
    and private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs seek a judicial
    order (1) holding each defendant jointly and severally
    liable for creating, contributing to,

and/or

maintaining global warming and (2) requiring each of the
    defendants to cap its emissions of carbon dioxide and then
    reduce those emissions by a specified percentage each year for
    at least a decade. Plaintiffs have not, however, requested that
    damages be awarded in connection with their claims. Southern
    Company believes these claims are without merit and notes that
    the complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis for the
    claims. In September 2005, the U.S. District Court for the
    Southern District of New York granted Southern Company’s
    and the other defendants’ motions to dismiss these cases.
    The plaintiffs filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals
    for the Second Circuit in October 2005. The ultimate outcome of
    these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Environmental
    Statutes and Regulations

General

The Company’s operations are subject to extensive
    regulation by state and federal environmental agencies under a
    variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental
    media, including air, water, and land resources. Applicable
    statutes include the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the
    Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
    Liability Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the
    Toxic Substances Control Act; the Emergency Planning &
    Community

Right-to-Know

Act, and the Endangered Species Act. Compliance with these
    environmental requirements involves significant capital and
    operating costs, a major portion of which is expected to be
    recovered through existing ratemaking provisions. Through 2006,
    the Company had invested approximately $1.2 billion in
    capital projects to comply with these requirements, with annual
    totals of $260 million, $256 million, and
    $177 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The
    Company expects that capital expenditures to assure compliance
    with existing and new regulations will be an additional
    $505 million, $533 million, and $549 million for
    2007, 2008, and 2009, respectively. Because the Company’s
    compliance strategy is impacted by changes to existing
    environmental laws and regulations, the cost, availability, and
    existing inventory of emission allowances, and the
    Company’s fuel mix, the ultimate impact of compliance
    cannot be determined at this time. Environmental costs that are
    known and estimable at this time are included in capital
    expenditures discussed under FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    LIQUIDITY – “Capital Requirements and Contractual
    Obligations” herein.

Compliance with possible additional federal or state legislation
    or regulations related to global climate change, air quality, or
    other environmental and health concerns could also significantly
    affect the Company. New environmental legislation or
    regulations, or changes to existing statutes or regulations
    could affect many areas of the Company’s operations;
    however, the full impact of any such changes cannot be
    determined at this time.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

(continued)

Alabama Power Company 2006
    Annual Report

Air
    Quality

Compliance with the Clean Air Act and resulting regulations has
    been and will continue to be a significant focus for the
    Company. Through 2006, the Company had spent approximately
    $1.0 billion in reducing sulfur dioxide
    (SO


)
    and nitrogen oxide
    (NO

x

)
    emissions and in monitoring emissions pursuant to the Clean Air
    Act. Additional controls have been announced and are currently
    being installed at several plants to further reduce
    SO


,
    NO

x

,
    and mercury emissions, maintain compliance with existing
    regulations, and meet new requirements.

Approximately $638 million of these expenditures related to
    reducing
    NO

x

emissions pursuant to state and federal requirements were in
    connection with the EPA’s

one-hour

ozone standard and the 1998 regional
    NO

x

reduction rules. In 2004, the regional
    NO

x

reduction rules were implemented for the northern two-thirds of
    Alabama. See Note 3 to the financial statements under
    “Retail Regulatory Matters” for information regarding
    the Company’s recovery of costs associated with
    environmental laws and regulations.

In 2005, the EPA revoked the

one-hour

ozone air quality standard and published the second of two sets
    of final rules for implementation of the new, more stringent

eight-hour

ozone standard. Areas within the Company’s service area
    that were designated as nonattainment under the

eight-hour

ozone standard included Jefferson and Shelby Counties, near and
    including Birmingham. The Birmingham area was redesignated to
    attainment with the

eight-hour

ozone standard by the EPA on June 12, 2006, and the EPA
    subsequently approved a maintenance plan for the area to address
    future exceedances of the standard. On December 22, 2006,
    the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
    Circuit vacated the first set of implementation rules adopted in
    2004 and remanded the rules to the EPA for further refinement.
    The impact of this decision, if any, cannot be determined at
    this time and will depend on subsequent legal action

and/or

rulemaking activity. State implementation plans, including new
    emission control regulations necessary to bring ozone
    nonattainment areas into attainment are currently required for
    most areas by June 2007. These state implementation plans could
    require further reductions in
    NO

x

emissions from power plants.

During 2005, the EPA’s fine particulate matter
    nonattainment designations became effective for several areas
    within the Company’s service area, and the EPA proposed a
    rule for the implementation of the fine particulate matter
    standard. The EPA is expected to publish its final rule for
    implementation of the existing fine particulate matter standard
    in early 2007. State plans for addressing the nonattainment
    designations under the existing standard are required by April
    2008 and could require further reductions in
    SO


and
    NO

x

emissions from power plants. On September 21, 2006, the EPA
    published a final rule lowering the

24-hour

fine
    particulate matter air quality standard even further and plans
    to designate nonattainment areas based on the new standard by
    December 2009. The final outcome of this matter cannot be
    determined at this time.

The EPA issued the final Clean Air Interstate Rule in March
    2005. This

cap-and-trade

rule addresses power plant
    SO


and
    NO

x

emissions that were found to contribute to nonattainment of the

eight-hour

ozone and fine particulate matter standards in downwind states.
    Twenty-eight eastern states, including the State of Alabama, are
    subject to the requirements of the rule. The rule calls for
    additional reductions of
    NO

x

and/or

SO


to be achieved in two phases, 2009/2010 and 2015. These
    reductions will be accomplished by the installation of
    additional emission controls at the Company’s coal-fired
    facilities or by the purchase of emission allowances from a

cap-and-trade

program.

The Clean Air Visibility Rule (formerly called the Regional Haze
    Rule) was finalized in July 2005. The goal of this rule is to
    restore natural visibility conditions in certain areas
    (primarily national parks and wilderness areas) by 2064. The
    rule involves (1) the application of Best Available
    Retrofit Technology (BART) to certain sources built between 1962
    and 1977 and (2) the application of any additional
    emissions reductions which may be deemed necessary for each
    designated area to achieve reasonable progress toward the
    natural conditions goal by 2018. Thereafter, for each

10-year

planning period, additional emissions reductions will be
    required to continue to demonstrate reasonable progress in each
    area during that period. For power plants, the Clean Air
    Visibility Rule allows states to determine that the Clean Air
    Interstate Rule satisfies BART requirements for
    SO


and
    NO

x

.
    However, additional BART requirements for particulate matter
    could be imposed, and the reasonable progress provisions could
    result in requirements for additional
    SO


controls. By December 17, 2007, states must submit
    implementation plans that contain strategies for BART and any
    other control measures required to achieve the first phase of
    reasonable progress.

In March 2005, the EPA published the final Clean Air Mercury
    Rule, a

cap-and-trade

program for the reduction of mercury emissions from coal-fired
    power plants. The rule sets caps on mercury emissions to be
    implemented in two phases, 2010 and 2018, and provides for an
    emission allowance trading market. The Company anticipates that
    emission controls installed to achieve

II-91


MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

(continued)

Alabama Power Company 2006
    Annual Report

compliance with the Clean Air Interstate Rule and the

eight-hour

ozone and fine-particulate air quality standards will also
    result in mercury emission reductions. However, the long-term
    capability of emission control equipment to reduce mercury
    emissions is still being evaluated, and the installation of
    additional control technologies may be required.

The impacts of the

eight-hour

ozone and the fine particulate matter nonattainment
    designations, the Clean Air Interstate Rule, the Clean Air
    Visibility Rule, and the Clean Air Mercury Rule on the Company
    will depend on the development and implementation of rules at
    the state level. States implementing the Clean Air Mercury Rule
    and the Clean Air Interstate Rule, in particular, have the
    option not to participate in the national

cap-and-trade

programs and could require reductions greater than those
    mandated by the federal rules. Impacts will also depend on
    resolution of pending legal challenges to these rules.
    Therefore, the full effects of these regulations on the Company
    cannot be determined at this time. The Company has developed and
    continually updates a comprehensive environmental compliance
    strategy to comply with the continuing and new environmental
    requirements discussed above. As part of this strategy, the
    Company plans to install additional
    SO


,
    NO

x

,
    and mercury emission controls within the next several years to
    assure continued compliance with applicable air quality
    requirements.

Water
    Quality

In July 2004, the EPA published its final technology-based
    regulations under the Clean Water Act for the purpose of
    reducing impingement and entrainment of fish, shellfish, and
    other forms of aquatic life at existing power plant cooling
    water intake structures. The rules require baseline biological
    information and, perhaps, installation of fish protection
    technology near some intake structures at existing power plants.
    On January 25, 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
    Second Circuit overturned and remanded several provisions of the
    rule to the EPA for revisions. Among other things, the court
    rejected the EPA’s use of “cost-benefit” analysis
    and suggested some ways to incorporate cost considerations. The
    full impact of these regulations will depend on subsequent legal
    proceedings, further rulemaking by the EPA, the results of
    studies and analyses performed as part of the rules’
    implementation, and the actual requirements established by state
    regulatory agencies and, therefore, cannot now be determined.

Environmental
    Remediation

The Company must comply with other environmental laws and
    regulations that cover the handling and disposal of waste and
    release of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and
    regulations, the Company could incur substantial costs to clean
    up properties. The Company conducts studies to determine the
    extent of any required cleanup and has recognized in its
    financial statements the costs to clean up known sites. Amounts
    for cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs were not material for
    any year presented. The Company may be liable for some or all
    required cleanup costs for additional sites that may require
    environmental remediation.

Global
    Climate Issues

Domestic efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions have been
    spurred by international negotiations under the Framework
    Convention on Climate Change, and specifically the Kyoto
    Protocol, which proposes a binding limitation on the emissions
    of greenhouse gases for industrialized countries. The Bush
    Administration has not supported U.S. ratification of the
    Kyoto Protocol or other mandatory carbon dioxide reduction
    legislation; however, in 2002, it did announce a goal to reduce
    the greenhouse gas intensity of the U.S. economy, the ratio
    of greenhouse gas emissions to the value of U.S. economic
    output, by 18 percent by 2012. Southern Company is
    participating in the voluntary electric utility sector climate
    change initiative, known as Power Partners, under the Bush
    Administration’s Climate VISION program. The utility sector
    pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions rate by
    3 percent to 5 percent by 2010 - 2012. Southern
    Company continues to evaluate future energy and emission
    profiles relative to the Power Partners program and is
    participating in voluntary programs to support the industry
    initiative. In addition, Southern Company is participating in
    the Bush Administration’s Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean
    Development and Climate, a public/private partnership to work
    together to meet goals for energy security, national air
    pollution reduction, and climate change in ways that promote
    sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction. Legislative
    proposals that would impose mandatory restrictions on carbon
    dioxide emissions continue to be considered in Congress. The
    ultimate outcome cannot be determined at this time; however,
    mandatory restrictions on the Company’s carbon dioxide
    emissions could result in significant additional compliance
    costs that could affect future results of operations, cash
    flows, and financial condition if such costs are not recovered
    through regulated rates.

II-92


MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

(continued)

Alabama Power Company 2006
    Annual Report

FERC
    Matters

Market-Based
    Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to
    non-affiliates, including short-term opportunity sales, at
    market-based prices. Specific FERC approval must be obtained
    with respect to a market-based contract with an affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess
    Southern Company’s generation dominance within its retail
    service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in
    other markets is not an issue in that proceeding. Any new
    market-based rate sales by the Company in Southern
    Company’s retail service territory entered into during a

15-month

refund period beginning February 27, 2005 could be subject
    to refund to the level of the default cost-based rates, pending
    the outcome of the proceeding. Such sales through May 27,
    2006, the end of the refund period, were approximately
    $3.9 million for the Company. In the event that the
    FERC’s default mitigation measures for entities that are
    found to have market power are ultimately applied, the Company
    may be required to charge cost-based rates for certain wholesale
    sales in the Southern Company retail service territory, which
    may be lower than negotiated market-based rates. The final
    outcome of this matter will depend on the form in which the
    final methodology for assessing generation market power and
    mitigation rules may be ultimately adopted and cannot be
    determined at this time.

In addition, in May 2005, the FERC started an investigation to
    determine whether Southern Company satisfies the other three
    parts of the FERC’s market-based rate analysis:
    transmission market power, barriers to entry, and affiliate
    abuse or reciprocal dealing. The FERC established a new

15-month

refund period related to this expanded investigation. Any new
    market-based rate sales involving any Southern Company
    subsidiary, including the Company, could be subject to refund to
    the extent the FERC orders lower rates as a result of this new
    investigation. Such sales through October 19, 2006, the end
    of the refund period, were approximately $14.6 million for
    the Company, of which $3.1 million relates to sales inside
    the retail service territory discussed above. The FERC also
    directed that this expanded proceeding be held in abeyance
    pending the outcome of the proceeding on the IIC discussed
    below. On January 3, 2007, the FERC issued an order noting
    settlement of the IIC proceeding and seeking comment
    identifying any remaining issues and the proper procedure for
    addressing any such issues.

The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for
    these proceedings and is vigorously defending itself in this
    matter. However, the final outcome of this matter, including any
    remedies to be applied in the event of an adverse ruling in
    these proceedings, cannot now be determined.

Intercompany
    Interchange Contract

The Company’s generation fleet is operated under
    the IIC, as approved by the FERC. In May 2005, the FERC
    initiated a new proceeding to examine (1) the provisions of
    the IIC among the Company, Georgia Power, Gulf Power,
    Mississippi Power, Savannah Electric, Southern Power, and
    Southern Company Services, Inc. (SCS), as agent, under the terms
    of which the power pool of Southern Company is operated, and, in
    particular, the propriety of the continued inclusion of Southern
    Power as a party to the IIC, (2) whether any parties
    to the IIC have violated the FERC’s standards of
    conduct applicable to utility companies that are transmission
    providers, and (3) whether Southern Company’s code of
    conduct defining Southern Power as a “system company”
    rather than a “marketing affiliate” is just and
    reasonable. In connection with the formation of Southern Power,
    the FERC authorized Southern Power’s inclusion in
    the IIC in 2000. The FERC also previously approved Southern
    Company’s code of conduct.

On October 5, 2006, the FERC issued an order accepting a
    settlement resolving the proceeding subject to Southern
    Company’s agreement to accept certain modifications to the
    settlement’s terms. On October 20, 2006, Southern
    Company notified the FERC that it accepted the modifications.
    The modifications largely involve functional separation and
    information restrictions related to marketing activities
    conducted on behalf of Southern Power. Southern Company filed
    with the FERC on November 6, 2006 an implementation plan to
    comply with the modifications set forth in the order. The impact
    of the modifications is not expected to have a material impact
    on the Company’s financial statements.

Generation
    Interconnection Agreements

In July 2003, the FERC issued its final rule on the
    standardization of generation interconnection agreements and
    procedures (Order 2003). Order 2003 shifts much of the financial
    burden of new transmission investment from the generator to the
    transmission provider. The FERC has indicated that Order 2003,
    which was effective January 20, 2004, is to be applied
    prospectively to new generating facilities interconnecting to a
    transmission system. Order 2003 was affirmed by the
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
    on January 12, 2007. The

II-93


MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Alabama Power Company 2006
    Annual Report

cost impact resulting from Order 2003 will vary on a

case-by-case

basis for each new generator interconnecting to the transmission
    system.

On November 22, 2004, generator company subsidiaries of
    Tenaska, Inc. (Tenaska), as counterparties to two previously
    executed interconnection agreements with the Company, filed
    complaints at the FERC requesting that the FERC modify the
    agreements and that the Company refund a total of
    $11 million previously paid for interconnection facilities,
    with interest. The Company has also received requests for
    similar modifications from other entities, though no other
    complaints are pending with the FERC. On January 19, 2007,
    the FERC issued an order granting Tenaska’s requested
    relief. Although the FERC’s order requires the modification
    of Tenaska’s interconnection agreements, the order reduces
    the amount of the refund that had been requested by Tenaska. As
    a result, the Company estimates indicate that no refund is due
    Tenaska. Southern Company has requested rehearing of the
    FERC’s order. The final outcome of this matter cannot now
    be determined.

Transmission

In December 1999, the FERC issued its final rule on Regional
    Transmission Organizations (RTOs). Since that time, there have
    been a number of additional proceedings at the FERC designed to
    encourage further voluntary formation of RTOs or to mandate
    their formation. However, at the current time, there are no
    active proceedings that would require the Company to participate
    in an RTO. Current FERC efforts that may potentially change the
    regulatory

and/or

operational structure of transmission include rules related to
    the standardization of generation interconnection, as well as an
    inquiry into, among other things, market power by vertically
    integrated utilities. See “Market-Based Rate
    Authority” and “Generation Interconnection
    Agreements” above for additional information. The final
    outcome of these proceedings cannot now be determined. However,
    the Company’s financial condition, results of operations,
    and cash flows could be adversely affected by future changes in
    the federal regulatory or operational structure of transmission.

Hydro
    Relicensing

In July 2005, the Company filed two applications with the FERC
    for new

50-year

licenses for the Company’s seven hydroelectric developments
    on the Coosa River (Weiss, Henry, Logan Martin, Lay, Mitchell,
    Jordan, and Bouldin) and for the Lewis Smith and Bankhead
    developments on the Warrior River. The FERC licenses for all of
    these nine projects expire in July and August of 2007.

In 2006, the Company initiated the process of developing an
    application to relicense the Martin hydroelectric project
    located on the Tallapoosa River. The current Martin license will
    expire in 2013 and the application for a new license will be
    filed with the FERC in 2011.

Upon or after the expiration of each license, the United States
    Government, by act of Congress, may take over the project or the
    FERC may relicense the project either to the original licensee
    or to a new licensee. The FERC may grant relicenses subject to
    certain requirements that could result in additional costs to
    the Company. If the FERC does not act on the Company’s new
    license application prior to the expiration of the existing
    license, then the FERC is required by law to issue annual
    licenses to the Company, under the terms and conditions of the
    existing license, until a new license is issued.

The timing and final outcome of the Company’s relicense
    applications cannot now be determined.

Nuclear
    Relicensing

The Company filed an application with the Nuclear Regulatory
    Commission (NRC) in September 2003 to extend the operating
    license for Plant Farley for an additional 20 years. In May
    2005, the NRC granted the Company a

20-year

extension of the operating license for both units at Plant
    Farley. As a result of the license extension, amounts previously
    contributed to the external trust are currently projected to be
    adequate to meet the decommissioning obligations. Therefore, in
    June 2005, the Alabama PSC approved the Company’s request
    to suspend, effective January 1, 2005, the inclusion in its
    annual cost of service of $18 million in decommissioning
    costs and to also suspend the associated obligation to make
    semi-annual contributions to the external trust. See Note 1
    to the financial statements under “Nuclear
    Decommissioning” for additional information.

PSC
    Matters

Retail
    Rate Adjustments

In October 2005, the Alabama PSC approved a revision to the Rate
    RSE requested by the Company. Effective January 2007 and
    thereafter, Rate RSE adjustments are based on forward-looking
    information for the applicable upcoming calendar year. Rate
    adjustments for any two-year period, when averaged together,
    cannot exceed 4 percent per year and any annual adjustment
    is limited to

II-94

    Annual Report

5 percent. Rates remain unchanged when the projected return
    on retail common equity ranges between 13.0 percent and
    14.5 percent. If the Company’s actual retail return on
    common equity is above the allowed equity return range, customer
    refunds will be required; however, there is no provision for
    additional customer billings should the actual retail return on
    common equity fall below the allowed equity return range. The
    Company made its initial submission of projected data for
    calendar year 2007 on December 1, 2006. The Rate RSE
    increase for 2007, effective in January, is 4.76 percent,
    or $193 million annually. Under terms of Rate RSE, the
    maximum increase for 2008 cannot exceed 3.24 percent. See
    Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail
    Regulatory Matters – Rate RSE” for further
    information.

The Company’s retail rates, approved by the Alabama PSC,
    also provide for adjustments to recognize the placing of new
    generating facilities into retail service and the recovery of
    retail costs associated with certificated PPAs under Rate
    Certificated New Plant (Rate CNP). In October 2004, the Alabama
    PSC amended Rate CNP to also allow for the recovery of the
    Company’s retail costs associated with environmental laws,
    regulations, or other such mandates. The rate mechanism began
    operation in January 2005 and provides for the recovery of these
    costs pursuant to a factor that is calculated annually.
    Environmental costs to be recovered include operation and
    maintenance expenses, depreciation, and a return on invested
    capital. Retail rates increased due to environmental costs
    approximately 1.0 percent in January 2005, 1.2 percent
    in January 2006, and 0.6 percent in January 2007. It is
    currently anticipated that retail rates will increase
    approximately 2.5 percent in 2008.

Effective July 2004, the Company’s retail rates were
    increased by approximately 0.8 percent, or $25 million
    annually, under Rate CNP for new certificated PPAs. In April
    2005, an annual adjustment to Rate CNP decreased retail rates by
    approximately 0.5 percent, or $19 million annually.
    The annual

true-up

adjustment effective in April 2006 increased retail rates by
    0.5 percent, or $19 million annually. Based on the
    Company’s February 2007 filing, there will be no rate
    adjustment associated with the annual

true-up

adjustment in April 2007. See Note 3 to the financial
    statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters –
    Rate CNP” for additional information.

Retail
    Fuel Cost Recovery

The Company has established fuel cost recovery rates approved by
    the Alabama PSC. As a result of increased fuel costs for coal,
    gas, and uranium, the Company filed a fuel cost recovery
    increase under the provisions of its energy cost recovery rate
    (Rate ECR). In December 2005, the Alabama PSC approved an
    increase of the energy billing factor for retail customers from
    1.788 cents per KWH to 2.400 cents per KWH, effective with
    billings beginning January 2006 for the

24-month

period ending December 31, 2007. Thereafter, the Rate ECR
    factor will increase absent a contrary order by the Alabama PSC.
    This change to the billing factor in 2006 represents on average
    an increase of approximately $6.12 per month for a customer
    billing of 1,000 KWH. This approved increase was intended to
    allow for the recovery of energy costs based on an estimate of
    future energy costs, as well as the collection of the existing
    under recovered energy costs by the end of 2007. In addition,
    during 2007, the Company will be allowed to include a carrying
    charge associated with the under recovered fuel costs in the
    fuel expense calculation.

The Company’s under recovered fuel costs as of
    December 31, 2006 totaled $301.0 million as compared
    to $285.1 million at December 31, 2005. As a result of
    the Alabama PSC order, the Company reclassified
    $301.0 million and $186.9 million of the
    under-recovered regulatory clause revenues from current assets
    to deferred charges and other assets in the balance sheets as of
    December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively.
    See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail
    Regulatory Matters – Fuel Cost Recovery” for
    additional information.

Rate ECR revenues, as recorded on the financial statements, are
    adjusted for the difference in actual recoverable costs and
    amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, this
    approved increase in the billing factor will have no significant
    effect on the Company’s revenues or net income, but will
    increase annual cash flow.

Natural
    Disaster Cost Recovery

The Company maintains a reserve for operations and maintenance
    expense to cover the cost of damages from major storms to its
    transmission and distribution facilities. On July 10, 2005
    and August 29, 2005, Hurricanes Dennis and Katrina,
    respectively, hit the coast of Alabama and continued north
    through the state, causing significant damage in parts of the
    service territory of the Company. Approximately 241,000 and
    637,000 of the Company’s 1.4 million customers were
    without electrical service immediately after Hurricanes Dennis
    and Katrina, respectively. The Company sustained significant
    damage to its distribution and transmission facilities during
    these storms.

In August 2005, the Company received approval from the Alabama
    PSC to defer the Hurricane Dennis

II-95


MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

(continued)

Alabama Power Company 2006
    Annual Report

storm-related operations and maintenance costs (approximately
    $28 million), which resulted in a negative balance in the
    natural disaster reserve (NDR). In October 2005, the Company
    also received similar approval from the Alabama PSC to defer the
    Hurricane Katrina storm-related operations and maintenance costs
    (approximately $30 million). See Note 1 and
    Note 3 to the financial statements under “Natural
    Disaster Reserve” and “Natural Disaster Cost
    Recovery,” respectively, for additional information on
    these reserves. The natural disaster reserve deficit balance at
    December 31, 2005 was $50.6 million.

In December 2005, the Alabama PSC approved a request by the
    Company to replenish the depleted NDR and allow for recovery of
    future natural disaster costs. The Alabama PSC order gives the
    Company authority to record a deficit balance in the NDR when
    costs of uninsured storm damage exceed any established reserve
    balance. The order also approved a separate monthly NDR charge
    consisting of two components beginning in January 2006. The
    first component is intended to establish and maintain a target
    reserve balance of $75 million for future storms and is an
    on-going part of customer billing. Assuming no additional
    storms, the Company currently expects that the target reserve
    balance could be achieved within five years. The second
    component of the NDR charge is intended to allow recovery of the
    existing deferred hurricane related operations and maintenance
    costs and any future reserve deficits over a

24-month

period. Absent further Alabama PSC approval, the maximum total
    NDR charge consisting of both components is $10 per month
    per non-residential customer account and $5 per month per
    residential customer account.

As of December 31, 2006, the Company had recovered
    $49.5 million of the costs allowed for storm-recovery
    activities and the deficit balance in the natural disaster
    reserve account totaled approximately $16.8 million, which
    is included in the balance sheets under “Current
    Assets.” Absent any new storm related damages, the Company
    expects to fully recover the deferred storm costs by the middle
    of 2007. As a result, customer rates would be decreased by this
    portion of the NDR charge. At December 31, 2006, the
    Company had accumulated a balance of $13.2 million in the
    target reserve for future storms, which is included in the
    balance sheets under “Other Regulatory Liabilities.”

As revenue from the NDR charge is recognized, an equal amount of
    operation and maintenance expense related to the NDR will also
    be recognized. As a result, this increase in revenue and expense
    will not have an impact on net income but will increase annual
    cash flow.

Other
    Matters

In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    Statement No. 87, Employers’ Accounting for Pensions,
    the Company recorded non-cash pre-tax pension income of
    approximately $13 million, $21 million, and
    $36 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.
    Postretirement benefit costs for the Company were
    $28 million, $28 million, and $22 million in
    2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Postretirement benefit costs
    are expected to trend upward. Such amounts are dependent on
    several factors including trust earnings and changes to the
    plans. A portion of pension and postretirement benefit costs is
    capitalized based on construction-related labor charges. Pension
    and postretirement benefit costs are a component of the
    regulated rates and generally do not have a long-term effect on
    net income. For more information regarding pension and
    postretirement benefits, see Note 2 to the financial
    statements.

The Company is involved in various other matters being litigated
    and regulatory matters that could affect future earnings. See
    Note 3 to the financial statements for information
    regarding material issues.

ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES

Application
    of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
    Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to
    the financial statements. In the application of these policies,
    certain estimates are made that may have a material impact on
    the Company’s results of operations and related
    disclosures. Different assumptions and measurements could
    produce estimates that are significantly different from those
    recorded in the financial statements. Senior management has
    reviewed and discussed critical accounting policies and
    estimates described below with the Audit Committee of Southern
    Company’s Board of Directors.

Electric
    Utility Regulation

The Company is subject to retail regulation by the Alabama PSC
    and wholesale regulation by the FERC. These regulatory agencies
    set the rates the Company is permitted to charge customers based
    on allowable costs. As a result, the Company applies FASB
    Statement No. 71, “Accounting for the Effects of
    Certain Types of Regulation” (SFAS No. 71), which
    requires the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate
    regulation. Through the ratemaking process, the regulators may

II-96


MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Alabama Power Company 2006
    Annual Report

require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different
    than when they would be recognized by a non-regulated company.
    This treatment may result in the deferral of expenses and the
    recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated
    future recovery through rates or the deferral of gains or
    creation of liabilities and the recording of related regulatory
    liabilities. The application of SFAS No. 71 has a
    further effect on the Company’s financial statements as a
    result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the
    ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from those
    actually incurred by the Company; therefore, the accounting
    estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation,
    nuclear decommissioning, and pension and postretirement benefits
    have less of a direct impact on the Company’s results of
    operations than they would on a non-regulated company.

As reflected in Note 1 to the financial statements under
    “Regulatory Assets and Liabilities,” significant
    regulatory assets and liabilities have been recorded. Management
    reviews the ultimate recoverability of these regulatory assets
    and liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines and
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
    However, adverse legislative, judicial, or regulatory actions
    could materially impact the amounts of such regulatory assets
    and liabilities and could adversely impact the Company’s
    financial statements.

Contingent
    Obligations

The Company is subject to a number of federal and state laws and
    regulations, as well as other factors and conditions that
    potentially subject it to environmental, litigation, income tax,
    and other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and
    Note 3 to the financial statements for more information
    regarding certain of these contingencies. The Company
    periodically evaluates its exposure to such risks and records
    reserves for those matters where a loss is considered probable
    and reasonably estimable in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles. The adequacy of reserves can be
    significantly affected by external events or conditions that can
    be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters
    could materially affect the Company’s financial statements.
    These events or conditions include the following:

•

Changes in existing state or federal regulation by governmental
    authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality,
    control of toxic substances, hazardous and solid wastes, and
    other environmental matters.

•

Changes in existing income tax regulations or changes in
    Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or Alabama Department of Revenue
    interpretations of existing regulations.

•

Identification of additional sites that require environmental
    remediation or the filing of other complaints in which the
    Company may be asserted to be a potentially responsible party.

•

Identification and evaluation of other potential lawsuits or
    complaints in which the Company may be named as a defendant.

•

Resolution or progression of existing matters through the
    legislative process, the court systems, the IRS, or the EPA.

Unbilled
    Revenues

Revenues related to the sale of electricity are recorded when
    electricity is delivered to customers. However, the
    determination of KWH sales to individual customers is based on
    the reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic
    basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of
    electricity delivered to customers, but not yet metered and
    billed, are estimated. Components of the unbilled revenue
    estimates include total KWH territorial supply, total KWH
    billed, estimated total electricity lost in delivery, and
    customer usage. These components can fluctuate as a result of a
    number of factors including weather, generation patterns, power
    delivery volume, and other operational constraints. These
    factors can be unpredictable and can vary from historical
    trends. As a result, the overall estimate of unbilled revenues
    could be significantly affected, which could have a material
    impact on the Company’s results of operations.

New
    Accounting Standards

Stock
    Options

On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted FASB Statement
    No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” using the
    modified prospective method. This statement requires that
    compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions
    be recognized in financial statements. That cost is measured
    based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability
    instruments issued. Although the compensation expense required
    under the revised statement differs slightly, the impacts on the
    Company’s financial statements are similar to the pro forma
    disclosures included in Note 1 to the financial statements
    under “Stock Options.”

Pensions
    and Other Postretirement Plans

On December 31, 2006, the Company adopted FASB Statement
    No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined
    Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans”
    (SFAS No. 158), which requires recognition of the
    funded status of its defined benefit postretirement plans in its
    balance sheet. With the adoption of SFAS No. 158, the
    Company recorded an additional prepaid pension asset of
    $183 million with respect to its overfunded defined benefit
    plan and additional liabilities of $10 million and
    $147 million, respectively, related to its underfunded
    non-qualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit
    plans. Additionally, SFAS No. 158 will require the
    Company to change the measurement date for its defined benefit
    postretirement plan assets and obligations from
    September 30 to December 31 beginning with the year
    ending December 31, 2008. See Note 2 to the financial
    statements for additional information.

Guidance
    on Considering the Materiality of Misstatements

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
    issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,
    “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when
    Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
    Statements” (SAB 108). SAB 108 addresses how the
    effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be
    considered when quantifying misstatements in current year
    financial statements. SAB 108 requires companies to
    quantify misstatements using both a balance sheet and an income
    statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach
    results in quantifying an error that is material in light of
    relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. When the effect
    of initial adoption is material, companies will record the
    effect as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year
    retained earnings. The provisions of SAB 108 were effective
    for the Company for the year ended December 31, 2006. The
    adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s financial statements.

Income
    Taxes

In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”
    (FIN 48). This interpretation requires that tax benefits
    must be “more likely than not” of being sustained in
    order to be recognized. The Company adopted FIN 48
    effective January 1, 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 did
    not have a material impact on the Company’s financial
    statements.

Fair
    Value Measurement

The FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157, “Fair Value
    Measurements” (SFAS No. 157) in September
    2006. SFAS No. 157 provides guidance on how to measure
    fair value where it is permitted or required under other
    accounting pronouncements. SFAS No. 157 also requires
    additional disclosures about fair value measurements. The
    Company plans to adopt SFAS No. 157 on January 1,
    2008 and is currently assessing its impact.

Fair
    Value Option

In February 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 159,
    “Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115” (SFAS No. 159). This standard
    permits an entity to choose to measure many financial
    instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company
    plans to adopt SFAS No. 159 on January 1, 2008
    and is currently assessing its impact.

FINANCIAL
    CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

The Company’s financial condition remained stable at
    December 31, 2006. Net cash flow from operating activities
    totaled $956 million, $908 million, and
    $1,014 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The
    $48 million increase for 2006 in operating activities
    primarily relates to higher recovery rates for fuel and
    purchased power partially offset by the timing of payments for
    operation expenses. The $106 million decrease for 2005 in
    operating activities primarily relates to an increase in under
    recovered fuel cost and storm damage costs related to Hurricanes
    Dennis and Katrina. These increases were partially offset by the
    deferral of income tax liabilities arising from accelerated
    depreciation deductions. Fuel and storm damage costs are
    recoverable in future periods. Under recovered fuel cost is
    included in the balance sheets as under recovered regulatory
    clause revenue and deferred under recovered regulatory clause
    revenues. Under recovered storm damage cost is included in the
    balance sheets as other current assets and other regulatory
    assets. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “Retail
    Fuel Cost Recovery” and “Natural Disaster Cost
    Recovery” for additional information.

Significant balance sheet changes for 2006 include an increase
    of $697 million in gross plant and an increase of
    $279 million in long-term debt. In 2005, significant
    balance sheet changes included an increase of $668 million
    in gross plant.

II-98


MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

(continued)

Alabama Power Company 2006
    Annual Report

The Company’s ratio of common equity to total
    capitalization, including short-term debt, was 42.1 percent
    in 2006, 42.2 percent in 2005, and 42.6 percent in
    2004. See Note 6 to the financial statements for additional
    information.

The Company has maintained investment grade ratings from the
    major rating agencies with respect to debt, preferred
    securities, preferred stock, and preference stock.

Sources
    of Capital

The Company plans to obtain the funds required for construction
    and other purposes from sources similar to those used in the
    past, which were primarily from operating cash flows. In recent
    years, the Company has primarily utilized unsecured debt, common
    stock, preferred and preference stock, and preferred securities.
    However, the type and timing of any financings, if needed, will
    depend on market conditions, regulatory approval, and other
    factors.

Security issuances are subject to regulatory approval by the
    Alabama PSC. Additionally, with respect to the public offering
    of securities, the Company files registration statements with
    the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
    (1933 Act). The amounts of securities authorized by the
    Alabama PSC, as well as the amounts, if any, registered under
    the 1933 Act, are continuously monitored and appropriate
    filings are made to ensure flexibility in the capital markets.

The Company obtains financing separately without credit support
    from any affiliate. See Note 6 to the financial statements
    under “Bank Credit Arrangements” for additional
    information. The Southern Company system does not maintain a
    centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of the Company
    are not commingled with funds of any other company.

The Company’s current liabilities frequently exceed current
    assets because of the continued use of short-term debt as a
    funding source to meet scheduled maturities of long-term debt as
    well as cash needs which can fluctuate significantly due to the
    seasonality of the business.

To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the Company has
    various internal and external sources of liquidity. At the
    beginning of 2007, the Company had approximately
    $16 million of cash and cash equivalents and
    $965 million of unused credit arrangements with banks, as
    described below. In addition, the Company has substantial cash
    flow from operating activities and access to the capital
    markets, including commercial paper programs, to meet liquidity
    needs.

The Company maintains committed lines of credit in the amount of
    $965 million, of which $365 million will expire at
    various times during 2007. $198 million of the credit
    facilities expiring in 2007 allow for the execution of term
    loans for an additional one-year period. The remaining
    $600 million of credit facilities expire in 2011. See
    Note 6 to the financial statements under “Bank Credit
    Arrangements” for additional information.

The Company may also meet short-term cash needs through a
    Southern Company subsidiary organized to issue and sell
    commercial paper and extendible commercial notes at the request
    and for the benefit of the Company and the other traditional
    operating companies. Proceeds from such issuances for the
    benefit of the Company are loaned directly to the Company and
    are not commingled with proceeds from such issuances for the
    benefit of any other traditional operating company. The
    obligations of each company under these arrangements are several
    and there is no cross affiliate credit support.

As of December 31, 2006, the Company had $120 million
    in commercial paper outstanding, and no extendible commercial
    notes outstanding. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had
    $136 million in commercial paper outstanding,
    $55 million in extendible commercial notes outstanding, and
    $125 million in loans outstanding under an uncommitted
    credit arrangement.

Financing
    Activities

During 2006, the Company issued $950 million of long-term
    debt and six million new shares of preference stock at
    $25.00 stated capital per share and realized proceeds of
    $150 million. In addition, the Company issued three million
    new shares of common stock to Southern Company at
    $40.00 per share and realized proceeds of
    $120 million. The proceeds of these issuances were used to
    repay $546.5 million of senior notes and $3.0 million
    of obligations related to pollution control bonds, to repay
    short-term indebtedness, and for other general corporate
    purposes.

On February 6, 2007, the Company issued $200 million
    of long-term senior notes. The proceeds were used to repay
    short-term indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes.

Credit
    Rating Risk

The Company does not have any credit arrangements that would
    require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as
    a result of a credit rating downgrade. However, the Company,
    along with all members of the Southern Company power pool, is
    party to certain derivative agreements that could require
    collateral

    and power price risk management activities. At December 31,
    2006, the Company’s total exposure to these types of
    agreements was approximately $27.4 million.

Market
    Price Risk

Due to cost-based rate regulations, the Company has limited
    exposure to market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel
    prices, and prices of electricity. To manage the volatility
    attributable to these exposures, the Company nets the exposures
    to take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various
    derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to
    the Company’s policies in areas such as counterparty
    exposure and risk management practices. Company policy is that
    derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and
    mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management
    policies. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques
    including, but not limited to, market valuation, value at risk,
    stress testing, and sensitivity analysis.

To mitigate future exposure to changes in interest rates, the
    Company enters into forward starting interest rate swaps that
    have been designated as hedges. The weighted average interest
    rate on $440 million of long-term variable interest rate
    exposure that has not been hedged at January 1, 2007 was
    5.50 percent. If the Company sustained a 100 basis
    point change in interest rates for all unhedged variable rate
    long-term debt, the change would affect annualized interest
    expense by approximately $4.4 million at January 1,
    2007. Subsequent to December 31, 2006, interest rate swaps
    hedging approximately $536 million of floating rate
    pollution control bonds matured, increasing the Company’s
    variable rate exposure by $536 million. As a result, the
    effect of a 100 basis point change in interest rates for
    all currently unhedged variable rate long-term debt increased to
    approximately $9.8 million. For further information, see
    Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements under
    “Financial Instruments.”

To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity
    prices, the Company enters into fixed-price contracts for the
    purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale
    electricity market and, to a lesser extent, into similar
    contracts for gas purchases. The Company has implemented fuel
    hedging programs at the instruction of the Alabama PSC.

In addition, the Company’s Rate ECR allows the recovery of
    specific costs associated with the sales of natural gas that
    become necessary due to operating considerations at the
    Company’s electric generating facilities. Rate ECR also
    allows recovery of the cost of financial instruments used for
    hedging market price risk up to 75 percent of the budgeted
    annual amount of natural gas purchases. The Company may not
    engage in natural gas hedging activities that extend beyond a
    rolling

42-month

window. Also, the premiums paid for natural gas financial
    options may not exceed 5 percent of the Company’s
    natural gas budget for that year.

At December 31, 2006, exposure from these activities was
    not material to the Company’s financial position, results
    of operations, or cash flows. The changes in fair value of
    energy-related derivative contracts and year-end valuations were
    as follows at December 31:

Unrealized pre-tax gains and losses from energy-related
    derivative contracts recognized in income were not material for
    any year presented.

The Company is exposed to market price risk in the event of
    nonperformance by counterparties to the energy-related
    derivative contracts. The Company’s policy is to enter into
    agreements with counterparties that have investment grade credit
    ratings by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s or
    with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover
    potential credit exposure. Therefore, the Company does not
    anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the
    counterparties. For additional information, see Notes 1 and
    6 to the financial statements under “Financial
    Instruments.”

Capital
    Requirements and Contractual Obligations

The construction program of the Company is currently estimated
    to be $1.2 billion for 2007, $1.3 billion for 2008,
    and $1.3 billion for 2009. Environmental expenditures
    included in these amounts are $505 million,
    $533 million, and $549 million for 2007, 2008, and
    2009, respectively (including $202 million on selective
    catalytic reduction facilities and $1.2 billion on
    scrubbers, which reduce
    SO


emissions). In addition, over the next three years, the Company
    estimates spending $317 million on Plant Farley (including
    $211 million for nuclear fuel), $941 million on
    distribution facilities, and $405 million on transmission
    additions. See Note 7 to the financial statements under
    “Construction Program” for additional details.

Actual construction costs may vary from this estimate because of
    changes in such factors as: business conditions; environmental
    regulations; nuclear plant regulations; FERC rules and
    regulations; load projections; the cost and efficiency of
    construction labor, equipment, and materials; and the cost of
    capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs
    related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered. As a
    result of NRC requirements, the Company and Georgia Power have
    external trust funds for nuclear decommissioning costs; however,
    the Company currently has no additional funding requirements.
    For additional information, see Note 1 to the financial
    statements under “Nuclear Decommissioning.”

In addition to the funds required for the Company’s
    construction program, approximately $1.3 billion will be
    required by the end of 2009 for maturities of long-term debt.
    The Company plans to continue, when economically feasible, to
    retire higher cost securities and replace these obligations with
    lower-cost capital if market conditions permit.

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements under
    “Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs,” in 1993 the
    U.S. Department of Energy implemented a special assessment
    over a

15-year

period on utilities with nuclear plants to be used for the
    decontamination and decommissioning of its nuclear fuel
    enrichment facilities. The final installment occurred in 2006.

The Company has also established an external trust fund for
    postretirement benefits as ordered by the Alabama PSC. The
    cumulative effect of funding these items over a long period will
    diminish internally funded capital for other purposes and may
    require the Company to seek capital from other sources. For
    additional information, see Note 2 to the financial
    statements under “Postretirement Benefits.”

Other funding requirements related to obligations associated
    with scheduled maturities of long-term debt and preferred
    securities, as well as the related interest, derivative
    obligations, preferred and preference stock dividends, leases,
    and other purchase commitments, are as follows. See
    Notes 1, 6, and 7 to the financial statements for
    additional information.

NOTES TO

Alabama Power Company 2006
    Annual Report

1.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General

Alabama Power Company (the Company) is a wholly owned subsidiary
    of Southern Company, which is the parent company of four
    traditional operating companies, Southern Power Company
    (Southern Power), Southern Company Services (SCS), Southern
    Communications Services (SouthernLINC Wireless), Southern
    Company Holdings (Southern Holdings), Southern Nuclear Operating
    Company (Southern Nuclear), Southern Telecom, and other direct
    and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional operating
    companies – the Company, Georgia Power Company, Gulf
    Power Company, and Mississippi Power Company – are
    vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in
    four Southeastern states. The Company provides electricity to
    retail customers within its traditional service area located
    within the State of Alabama and to wholesale customers in the
    Southeast. Southern Power constructs, acquires, and manages
    generation assets, and sells electricity at market-based rates
    in the wholesale market. SCS, the system service company,
    provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and
    its subsidiary companies. SouthernLINC Wireless provides digital
    wireless communications services to the traditional operating
    companies and also markets these services to the public within
    the Southeast. Southern Telecom provides fiber cable services
    within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate
    holding company subsidiary for Southern Company’s
    investments in synthetic fuels and leveraged leases and various
    other energy-related businesses. Southern Nuclear operates and
    provides services to Southern Company’s nuclear power
    plants, including the Company’s Plant Farley. On
    January 4, 2006, Southern Company completed the sale of
    substantially all the assets of Southern Company Gas, its
    competitive retail natural gas marketing subsidiary.

The equity method is used for subsidiaries in which the Company
    has significant influence but does not control and for variable
    interest entities where the Company is not the primary
    beneficiary. Certain prior years’ data presented in the
    financial statements have been reclassified to conform with
    current year presentation.

The Company is subject to regulation by the Federal Energy
    Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Alabama Public Service
    Commission (PSC). The Company follows accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States and complies with the
    accounting policies and practices prescribed by its regulatory
    commissions. The preparation of financial statements in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States requires the use of estimates, and the actual
    results may differ from those estimates.

Affiliate
    Transactions

The Company has an agreement with SCS under which the following
    services are rendered to the Company at direct or allocated
    cost: general and design engineering, purchasing, accounting and
    statistical analysis, finance and treasury, tax, information
    resources, marketing, auditing, insurance and pension
    administration, human resources, systems and procedures, and
    other services with respect to business and operations and power
    pool transactions. Costs for these services amounted to
    $266 million, $246 million, and $224 million
    during 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Cost allocation
    methodologies used by SCS were approved by the Securities and
    Exchange Commission prior to the repeal of the Public Utility
    Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended, and management believes
    they are reasonable. The FERC permits services to be rendered at
    cost by system service companies.

The Company has an agreement with Southern Nuclear under which
    Southern Nuclear operates the Company’s Plant Farley and
    provides the following nuclear-related services at cost: general
    executive and advisory services, general operations, management
    and technical services, administrative services including
    procurement, accounting, statistical analysis, employee
    relations, and other services with respect to business and
    operations. Costs for these services amounted to
    $162 million, $157 million, and $169 million
    during 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

The Company jointly owns Plant Greene County with Mississippi
    Power. The Company has an agreement with Mississippi Power under
    which the Company operates Plant Greene County, and Mississippi
    Power reimburses the Company for its proportionate share of
    expenses which were $8.6 million in 2006, $8.2 million
    in 2005, and $7.2 million in 2004. See Note 4 for
    additional information.

Southern Company held a 30 percent ownership interest in
    Alabama Fuel Products, LLC (AFP), which produces synthetic fuel,
    until July 2006, when the ownership interest was terminated. The
    Company purchases synthetic fuel from AFP for use at several of
    the Company’s plants. Total fuel purchases through June
    2006 and for the years ended 2005 and 2004 were
    $202.2 million, $265.7 million, and
    $236.9 million, respectively. Subsequent to the termination
    of the

II-111


NOTES

(continued)

Alabama Power Company 2006
    Annual Report

membership interest in AFP, the Company continued to purchase
    fuel from AFP in the amount of $244.4 million in 2006. In
    addition, the Company has an agreement with an indirect
    subsidiary of Southern Company that provides services for AFP.
    Under this agreement, the Company provides certain accounting
    functions, including processing and paying fuel transportation
    invoices, and the Company is reimbursed for its expenses.
    Amounts billed under this agreement totaled approximately
    $56.5 million, $31.5 million, and $28.7 million
    in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

In June 2003, the Company entered into an agreement with
    Southern Power under which the Company operates and maintains
    Plant Harris at cost. In 2006, 2005, and 2004, the Company
    billed Southern Power $2.2 million, $1.9 million, and
    $1.8 million, respectively, for operation and maintenance.
    Under a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Southern Power, the
    Company’s purchased power costs from Plant Harris in 2006,
    2005, and 2004 totaled $61.7 million, $63.6 million,
    and $59.0 million, respectively. The Company also provides
    the fuel, at cost, associated with the PPA and the fuel cost
    recognized by the Company was $77.8 million in 2006,
    $81.3 million in 2005, and $65.7 million in 2004.
    Additionally, the Company recorded $8.3 million of prepaid
    capacity expenses included in other deferred charges and other
    assets in the balance sheets at December 31, 2006 and 2005.
    See Note 3 under “Retail Regulatory Matters” and
    Note 7 under “Purchased Power Commitments” for
    additional information.

The Company has an agreement with SouthernLINC Wireless to
    provide digital wireless communications services to the Company.
    Costs for these services amounted to $4.9 million,
    $5.7 million, and $5.3 million during 2006, 2005, and
    2004, respectively.

Also, see Note 4 for information regarding the
    Company’s ownership in and PPA with Southern Electric
    Generating Company (SEGCO) and Note 5 for information on
    certain deferred tax liabilities due to affiliates.

The Company provides incidental services to, and receives such
    services from, other Southern Company subsidiaries which are
    generally minor in duration

and/or

amount. However, with the hurricane damage experienced by
    Georgia Power, Gulf Power and Mississippi Power in 2004 and
    2005, assistance provided to aid in storm restoration, including
    Company labor, contract labor, and materials, has caused an
    increase in these activities. The total amount of storm
    restoration provided to Georgia Power and Gulf Power in 2004 and
    to Mississippi Power in 2005 was $2.4 million,
    $2.3 million, and $8.0 million, respectively. In 2004
    and 2005, the Company received assistance from affiliated
    companies in the amount of $5.6 million and
    $5.0 million, respectively, for aid in major storm
    restoration. These activities were billed at cost.

The traditional operating companies, including the Company, and
    Southern Power jointly enter into various types of wholesale
    energy, natural gas, and certain other contracts, either
    directly or through SCS as agent. Each participating company may
    be jointly and severally liable for the obligations incurred
    under these agreements. See Note 7 under “Fuel
    Commitments” for additional information.

Revenues

Energy and other revenues are recognized as services are
    provided. Capacity revenues are generally recognized on a
    levelized basis over the appropriate contract periods. Unbilled
    revenues are accrued at the end of each fiscal period. Electric
    rates for the Company include provisions to adjust billings for
    fluctuations in fuel costs, fuel hedging, the energy component
    of purchased power costs, and certain other costs. Revenues are
    adjusted for differences between these actual costs and amounts
    billed in current regulated rates. Under or over recovered
    regulatory clause revenues are recorded in the balance sheets
    and are recovered or returned to customers through adjustments
    to the billing factors. The Company continuously monitors the
    under/over recovered balances and files for revised rates as
    required or when management deems appropriate depending on the
    rate. See “Retail Regulatory Matters – Fuel Cost
    Recovery” in Note 3 for additional information.

The Company has a diversified base of customers. No single
    customer comprises 10 percent or more of revenues. For all
    periods presented, uncollectible accounts averaged less than one
    percent of revenues.

Regulatory
    Assets and Liabilities

The Company is subject to the provisions of Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 71, “Accounting
    for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation”
    (SFAS No. 71). Regulatory assets represent probable
    future revenues associated with certain costs that are expected
    to be recovered from customers through the ratemaking process.
    Regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in
    revenues associated with

Note:

The recovery and amortization periods for these regulatory
    assets and (liabilities) are as follows:

In the event that a portion of the Company’s operations is
    no longer subject to the provisions of SFAS No. 71,
    the Company would be required to write off related regulatory
    assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable
    through regulated rates. In addition, the Company would be
    required to determine if any impairment to other assets,
    including plant, exists and write down the assets, if impaired,
    to their fair values. All regulatory assets and liabilities are
    to be reflected in rates.

Nuclear
    Fuel Disposal Costs

The Company has a contract with the U.S. Department of
    Energy (DOE) that provides for the permanent disposal of spent
    nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin disposing of spent nuclear
    fuel in 1998 as required by the contract, and the Company is
    pursuing legal remedies against the government for breach of
    contract. An

on-site

dry
    spent fuel storage facility at Plant Farley is operational and
    can be expanded to accommodate spent fuel through the expected
    life of the plant.

Also, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 established a Uranium
    Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund, which has
    been funded in part by a special assessment on utilities with
    nuclear plants. This assessment was paid over a

15-year

period; the final installment occurred in 2006. This fund will
    be used by the DOE for the decontamination and decommissioning
    of its nuclear fuel enrichment facilities. The law provides that
    utilities will recover these payments in the same manner as any
    other fuel expense.

Fuel
    Costs

Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is used. Fuel expense
    includes the cost of purchased emission allowances as they are
    used. Fuel expense also includes the amortization of the cost of
    nuclear fuel and a charge, based on nuclear generation, for the
    permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. Total charges for
    nuclear fuel included in fuel expense totaled $66 million
    in 2006, $64 million in 2005, and $61 million in 2004.

Income
    and Other Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred
    income taxes and provides deferred income taxes for all
    significant income tax temporary differences. Investment tax
    credits utilized are deferred and amortized to income over the
    average life of the related property.

    includes: materials; labor; minor items of property; appropriate
    administrative and general costs; payroll-related costs such as
    taxes, pensions, and other benefits; and the interest

The cost of replacements of property – exclusive of
    minor items of property – is capitalized. The cost of
    maintenance, repairs, and replacement of minor items of property
    is charged to maintenance expense as incurred or performed with
    the exception of nuclear refueling costs, which are recorded in
    accordance with specific Alabama PSC orders. The Company accrues
    estimated nuclear refueling costs in advance of the unit’s
    next refueling outage. The refueling cycle is 18 months for
    each unit. During 2006, the Company accrued $31.5 million
    and paid $26.7 million for an outage at Unit 1. At
    December 31, 2006, the reserve balance totaled
    $12.3 million and is included in the balance sheet in other
    regulatory liabilities.

Depreciation
    and Amortization

Depreciation of the original cost of utility plant in service is
    provided primarily by using composite straight-line rates, which
    approximated 3.1 percent in 2006, 2.9 percent in 2005,
    and 3.0 percent in 2004. Depreciation studies are conducted
    periodically to update the composite rates and the information
    is provided to the Alabama PSC. When property subject to
    depreciation is retired or otherwise disposed of in the normal
    course of business, its original cost, together with the cost of
    removal, less salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation.
    For other property dispositions, the applicable cost and
    accumulated depreciation is removed from the balance sheet
    accounts and a gain or loss is recognized. Minor items of
    property included in the original cost of the plant are retired
    when the related property unit is retired.

Asset
    Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of Removal

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted FASB
    Statement No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
    Obligations” (SFAS No. 143), which established
    new accounting and reporting standards for legal obligations
    associated with the ultimate costs of retiring long-lived
    assets. The present value of the ultimate costs of an
    asset’s future retirement is recorded in the period in
    which the liability is incurred. The costs are capitalized as
    part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the
    asset’s useful life. In addition, effective
    December 31, 2005, the Company adopted the provisions of
    FASB Interpretation No. 47, “Conditional Asset
    Retirement Obligations” (FIN 47), which requires that
    an asset retirement obligation be recorded even though the
    timing

and/or

method of settlement are conditional on future events. Prior to
    December 2005, the Company did not recognize asset retirement
    obligations for asbestos removal and disposal of polychlorinated
    biphenyls in certain transformers because the timing of their
    retirements was dependent on future events. The Company has
    received accounting guidance from the Alabama PSC allowing the
    continued accrual of other future retirement costs for
    long-lived assets that the Company does not have a legal
    obligation to retire. Accordingly, the accumulated removal costs
    for these obligations will continue to be reflected in the
    balance sheets as a regulatory liability. Therefore, the Company
    had no cumulative effect to net income resulting from the
    adoption of SFAS No. 143 or FIN 47.

The liability recognized to retire long-lived assets primarily
    relates to the Company’s nuclear facility, Plant Farley.
    The fair value of assets legally restricted for settling
    retirement obligations related to nuclear facilities as of
    December 31, 2006 was $513 million. In addition, the
    Company has retirement obligations related to various landfill
    sites and underground storage tanks. In connection with the
    adoption of FIN 47, the Company also recorded additional
    asset retirement obligations (and assets) of $35 million,
    related to asbestos removal and disposal of polychlorinated
    biphenyls in certain transformers. The Company also has
    identified retirement obligations related to certain
    transmission and distribution facilities and certain wireless
    communication towers. However, liabilities for the removal of
    these assets have not been

recorded because the range of time over which the Company may
    settle these obligations is unknown and cannot be reasonably
    estimated. The Company will continue to recognize in the
    statements of income allowed removal costs in accordance with
    its regulatory treatment. Any differences between costs
    recognized under SFAS No. 143 and FIN 47 and
    those reflected in rates are recognized as either a regulatory
    asset or liability, as ordered by the Alabama PSC, and are
    reflected in the balance sheets. See “Nuclear
    Decommissioning” for further information on amounts
    included in rates.

Nuclear
    Decommissioning

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requires licensees of
    commercial nuclear power reactors to establish a plan for
    providing reasonable assurance of funds for future
    decommissioning. The Company has external trust funds to comply
    with the NRC’s regulations. Use of the funds is restricted
    to nuclear decommissioning activities and the funds are managed
    and invested in accordance with applicable requirements of
    various regulatory bodies, including the NRC, the FERC, and the
    Alabama PSC, as well as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The
    trust funds are invested in a tax-efficient manner in a
    diversified mix of equity and fixed income securities and are
    classified as

available-for-sale.

The trust funds are included in the balance sheets at fair
    value, as obtained from quoted market prices for the same or
    similar investments. As the external trust funds are actively
    managed by unrelated parties with limited direction from the
    Company, the Company does not have the ability to choose to hold
    securities with unrealized losses until recovery. Through 2005,
    the Company considered other-than-temporary impairments to be
    immaterial. However, since the January 1, 2006 effective
    date of FASB Staff Position

FAS 115-1/124-1,

“The Meaning of

Other-Than-Temporary

Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments” (FSP

No. 115-1),

the Company considers all unrealized losses to represent

other-than-temporary

impairments. The adoption of FSP

No. 115-1

had no impact on the results of operations, cash flows, or
    financial condition of the Company as all losses have been and
    continue to be recorded through a regulatory liability, whether
    realized, unrealized, or identified as other-than-temporary.

Sales of the securities held in the trust funds resulted in
    proceeds of $285.7 million, $223.8 million, and
    $249.0 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, all
    of which were re-invested. Realized gains and

other-than-temporary

impairment losses were $22.0 million and
    $18.2 million, respectively, in 2006. Net realized gains
    were $9.9 million and $7.5 million in 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. Realized gains and

other-than-temporary

impairment losses are determined on a specific identification
    basis. In accordance with regulatory guidance, all realized and
    unrealized gains and losses are included in the regulatory
    liability for Asset Retirement Obligations in the balance sheets
    and are not included in net income or other comprehensive
    income. Unrealized gains and

other-than-temporary

impairment losses are considered non-cash transactions for
    purposes of the statements of cash flow.

approved by the Alabama PSC. The NRC’s minimum external
    funding requirements are based on a generic estimate of the cost
    to decommission only the radioactive portions of a nuclear unit
    based on the size and type of reactor. The Company has filed
    plans with the NRC designed to ensure that, over time, the
    deposits and earnings of the external trust funds will provide
    the minimum funding amounts prescribed by the NRC. At
    December 31, 2006, the accumulated provisions for
    decommissioning were as follows:

Total

$


The decommissioning cost estimates are based on prompt
    dismantlement and removal of the plant from service. The actual
    decommissioning costs may vary from the above estimates because
    of changes in the assumed date of decommissioning, changes in
    NRC requirements, or changes in the assumptions used in making
    these estimates.

All of the Company’s decommissioning costs for ratemaking
    are based on the site study. Significant assumptions used to
    determine these costs for ratemaking were an inflation rate of
    4.5 percent and a trust earnings rate of 7.0 percent.
    Another significant assumption used was the change in the
    operating license for Plant Farley.

In May 2005, the NRC granted the Company a

20-year

extension of the operating license for both units at Plant
    Farley. As a result of the license extension, amounts previously
    contributed to the external trust are currently projected to be
    adequate to meet the decommissioning obligations. Therefore, in
    June 2005, the Alabama PSC approved the Company’s request
    to suspend, effective January 1, 2005, the inclusion in its
    annual cost of service of $18 million in decommissioning
    costs and to also suspend the associated obligation to make
    semi-annual contributions to the external trust. The Company
    will continue to provide site specific estimates of the
    decommissioning costs and related projections of funds in the
    external trust to the Alabama PSC and, if necessary, would seek
    the Alabama PSC’s approval to address any changes in a
    manner consistent with the NRC and other applicable
    requirements. The approved suspension does not affect the
    transfer of internal reserves (less than $1 million
    annually) previously collected from customers prior to the
    establishment of the external trust.

Allowance
    for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC)

In accordance with regulatory treatment, the Company records
    AFUDC, which represents the estimated debt and equity costs of
    capital funds that are necessary to finance the construction of
    new regulated facilities. While cash is not realized currently
    from such allowance, it increases the revenue requirement over
    the service life of the plant through a higher rate base and
    higher depreciation expense. All current construction costs are
    included in retail rates. The composite rate used to determine
    the amount of AFUDC was 8.8 percent in 2006,
    8.8 percent in 2005, and 8.6 percent in 2004. AFUDC,
    net of income tax, as a percent of net income after dividends on
    preferred stock was 4.5 percent in 2006, 5.0 percent
    in 2005, and 4.2 percent in 2004.

Impairment
    of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles

The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination
    of whether an impairment has occurred is based on either a
    specific regulatory disallowance or an estimate of undiscounted
    future cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared with
    the carrying value of the assets. If an impairment has occurred,
    the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by either
    the amount of regulatory disallowance or by estimating the fair
    value of the assets and recording a loss if the carrying value
    is greater than the fair value. For assets identified as held
    for sale, the carrying value is compared to the estimated fair
    value less the cost to sell in order to determine if an
    impairment loss is required. Until the assets are disposed of,
    their estimated fair value is

re-evaluated

when circumstances or events change.

Natural
    Disaster Reserve

In accordance with an Alabama PSC order, the Company has
    established a natural disaster reserve (NDR) to cover

II-116


NOTES

(continued)

Alabama Power Company 2006
    Annual Report

the cost of uninsured damages from major storms to transmission
    and distribution facilities. The Company collects a monthly NDR
    charge per account that consists of two components which began
    on January 1, 2006. The first component is intended to
    establish and maintain a reserve for future storms and is an
    on-going part of customer billing. This plan has a target
    reserve balance of $75 million that could be achieved in
    five years assuming the Company experiences no additional
    storms. The second component of the NDR charge is intended to
    allow recovery of the deferred Hurricanes Dennis- and
    Katrina-related operations and maintenance costs and to set in
    place a mechanism to replenish the NDR should any future storms
    deplete the natural disaster reserve. The Alabama PSC order
    gives the Company authority to have a negative NDR balance when
    costs of uninsured storm damage exceed any established NDR
    balance. This second component allows for the recovery of a
    negative balance over a

24-month

period. Absent further Alabama PSC approval, the maximum total
    NDR charge consisting of both components is $10 per month
    per account for non-residential customers and $5 per month
    per account for residential customers.

At December 31, 2006, the Company had accumulated a balance
    of $13.2 million in the target reserve for future storms,
    which is included in the balance sheets under “Other
    Regulatory Liabilities.” Also the Company has recovered
    $33.8 million of deferred Hurricanes Dennis- and
    Katrina-related operations and maintenance costs and the deficit
    balance in the NDR account as of December 31, 2006 totaled
    approximately $16.8 million, which is included in the
    balance sheets under “Current Assets.” Absent any new
    storm-related damages, the Company expects to fully recover the
    deferred storm costs by the middle of 2007. As a result,
    customer rates would be decreased by this portion of the NDR
    charge.

As revenue from the NDR charge is recognized, an equal amount of
    operation and maintenance expense related to the NDR will also
    be recognized. As a result, this increase in revenue and expense
    will not have an impact on net income, but will increase annual
    cash flow.

Environmental
    Cost Recovery

The Company has received authority from the Alabama PSC to
    recover approved environmental compliance costs through specific
    retail rate clauses and are adjusted annually. See Note 3
    under “Retail Regulatory Matters – Rate CNP”
    for additional information.

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash
    investments are considered cash equivalents. Temporary cash
    investments are securities with original maturities of
    90 days or less.

Materials
    and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include the average cost of
    transmission, distribution, and generating plant materials.
    Materials are charged to inventory when purchased and then
    expensed or capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when installed.

Fuel
    Inventory

Fuel inventory includes the average costs of oil, coal, and
    natural gas. Fuel is charged to inventory when purchased and
    then expensed as used and recovered by the Company through fuel
    cost recovery rates approved by the Alabama PSC. Emission
    allowances granted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
    are included in inventory at zero cost.

Stock
    Options

Southern Company provides non-qualified stock options to a large
    segment of the Company’s employees ranging from line
    management to executives. Prior to January 1, 2006, the
    Company accounted for options granted in accordance with
    Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25; thus, no
    compensation expense was recognized because the exercise price
    of all options granted equaled the fair market value on the date
    of the grant.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair
    value recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123(R),
    “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123(R)),
    using the modified prospective method. Under that method,
    compensation cost for the year ended December 31, 2006 is
    recognized as the requisite service is rendered and includes:
    (a) compensation cost for the portion of share-based awards
    granted prior to and that were outstanding as at January 1,
    2006, for which the requisite service has not been rendered,
    based on the grant-date fair value of those awards as calculated
    in accordance with the original provisions of FASB Statement
    No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-based
    Compensation” (SFAS No. 123), and
    (b) compensation cost for all share-based awards granted
    subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair
    value estimated in accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123(R). Results for prior periods have not
    been restated.

Alabama Power Company 2006
    Annual Report

The compensation cost and tax benefits related to the grant and
    exercise of Southern Company stock options to the Company’s
    employees are recognized in the Company’s financial
    statements with a corresponding credit to equity, representing a
    capital contribution from Southern Company.

For the Company, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) has
    resulted in a reduction in earnings before income taxes and net
    income of $4.8 million and $3.0 million, respectively,
    for the year ended December 31, 2006. Additionally,
    SFAS No. 123(R) requires the gross excess tax benefit
    from stock option exercises be reclassified as a financing cash
    flow as opposed to an operating cash flow; the reduction in
    operating cash flows and increase in financing cash flows for
    the year ended December 31, 2006 was $1.3 million.

For the years prior to the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R), the pro forma impact on net income of
    fair-value accounting for options granted is as follows:

Because historical forfeitures have been insignificant and are
    expected to remain insignificant, no forfeitures are assumed in
    the calculation of compensation expense; rather they are
    recognized when they occur.

The estimated fair values of stock options granted in 2006,
    2005, and 2004 were derived using the Black-Scholes stock option
    pricing model. Expected volatility is based on historical
    volatility of Southern Company’s stock over a period equal
    to the expected term. The Company uses historical exercise data
    to estimate the expected term that represents the period of time
    that options granted to employees are expected to be
    outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on the
    U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant
    that covers the expected term of the stock options. The
    following table shows the assumptions used in the pricing model
    and the weighted average grant-date fair value of stock options

Financial
    Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit
    exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, the prices of
    certain fuel purchases, and electricity purchases and sales. All
    derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets
    or liabilities and are measured at fair value. Substantially all
    of the Company’s bulk energy purchases and sales contracts
    that meet the definition of a derivative are exempt from fair
    value accounting requirements and are accounted for under the
    accrual method. Other derivative contracts qualify as cash flow
    hedges of anticipated transactions or are recoverable through
    the Alabama PSC approved fuel-hedging program. This results in
    the deferral of related gains and losses in other comprehensive
    income or regulatory assets and liabilities, respectively, until
    the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness arising from
    cash flow hedges is recognized currently in net income. Other
    derivative contracts are marked to market through current period
    income and are recorded on a net basis in the statements of
    income.

The Company is exposed to losses related to financial
    instruments in the event of counterparties’ nonperformance.
    The Company has established controls to determine and monitor
    the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate the
    Company’s exposure to counterparty credit risk.

Comprehensive
    Income

The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of
    all changes in common stock equity of an enterprise that result
    from transactions and other economic events of the period other
    than transactions with owners. Comprehensive income consists of
    net income, changes in the fair value of qualifying cash flow
    hedges and marketable securities, and changes in additional
    minimum pension liability, less income taxes and
    reclassifications for amounts included in net income.

Variable
    Interest Entities

The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity must
    consolidate the related assets and liabilities. The Company has
    established certain wholly-owned trusts to issue preferred
    securities. See Note 6 under “Mandatorily Redeemable
    Preferred Securities/Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated
    Trusts” for additional information. However, the Company is
    not considered the primary beneficiary of the trusts. Therefore,
    the investments in these trusts are reflected as Other
    Investments, and the related loans from the trusts are reflected
    as Long-term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts in the balance
    sheets.

Investments

The Company maintains an investment in a debt security that
    matures in 2018 and is classified as

available-for-sale.

This security is included in the balance sheets under Other
    Property and Investments-Other and totaled $2.6 million and
    $4.4 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Because the interest rate resets weekly, the
    carrying value approximates the fair market value.

RETIREMENT
    BENEFITS

The Company has a defined benefit, trusteed, pension plan
    covering substantially all employees. The plan is funded in
    accordance with requirements of the Employee Retirement Income
    Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). No contributions to
    the plan are expected for the year ending December 31,
    2007. The Company also provides certain defined benefit pension
    plans for a selected group of management and highly-compensated
    employees. Benefits under these non-qualified plans are funded
    on a cash basis. In addition, the Company provides certain
    medical care and life insurance benefits for retired employees
    through other postretirement benefit plans. The Company funds
    trusts to the extent required by the Alabama PSC. For the year
    ending December 31, 2007, postretirement trust
    contributions are expected to total approximately
    $24.7 million.

On December 31, 2006, the Company adopted FASB Statement
    No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined
    Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans”
    (SFAS No. 158), which requires recognition of the
    funded status of its defined benefit postretirement plans in its
    balance sheet. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 158,
    the Company generally recognized only the difference between the
    benefit expense recognized and employer contributions to the
    plan as either a prepaid asset or as a liability. With respect
    to its underfunded non-qualified pension plan, the Company
    recognized an additional minimum liability representing the
    difference between each plan’s accumulated benefit
    obligation and its assets.

With the adoption of SFAS No. 158, the Company was
    required to recognize on its balance sheet previously
    unrecognized assets and liabilities related to unrecognized
    prior service cost, unrecognized gains or losses (from changes
    in actuarial assumptions and the difference between actual and
    expected returns on plan assets), and any unrecognized
    transition amounts (resulting from the change from cash-basis
    accounting to accrual accounting). These amounts will continue
    to be amortized as a component of expense over the
    employees’ remaining average service life as
    SFAS No. 158 did not change the recognition of pension
    and other postretirement benefit expense in the statements of
    income. With the adoption of SFAS No. 158, the Company
    recorded an additional prepaid pension asset of
    $183 million with respect to its overfunded defined benefit
    plan and additional liabilities of $10 million and
    $147 million, respectively, related to its underfunded
    non-qualified pension plans and retiree benefit plans. The
    incremental effect of applying

Because the recovery of postretirement benefit expense through

    of SFAS No. 71 with respect to the prepaid assets and
    the liabilities.

The measurement date for plan assets and obligations is

Net periodic pension cost (income) is the sum of service cost,
    interest cost, and other costs netted against the expected
    return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets is
    determined by multiplying the expected rate of return on plan
    assets and the market-related value of plan assets. In
    determining the market-related value of plan assets, the Company
    has elected to amortize changes in the market value of all plan
    assets over five years rather than recognize the changes
    immediately. As a result, the accounting value of plan assets
    that is used to calculate the expected return on plan assets
    differs from the current fair value of the plan assets.

Future benefit payments reflect expected future service and are
    estimated based on assumptions used to measure the projected
    benefit obligation for the pension plans. At December 31,
    2006, estimated benefit payments were as follows:

Alabama Power Company 2006
    Annual Report

In the third quarter 2004, the Company prospectively adopted
    FASB Staff Position

106-2,

“Accounting and Disclosure Requirements” (FSP

106-2),

related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and
    Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act). The Medicare Act
    provides a 28 percent prescription drug subsidy for
    Medicare eligible retirees. FSP

106-2

requires recognition of the impacts of the Medicare Act in the
    APBO and future cost of service for postretirement medical
    plans. The effect of the subsidy reduced the Company’s
    expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2004 and for
    the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006 by approximately
    $3.2 million, $8.7 million, and $11.1 million,
    respectively, and is expected to have a similar impact on future
    expenses.

Future benefit payments, including prescription drug benefits,
    reflect expected future service and are estimated based on
    assumptions used to measure the APBO for the postretirement
    plans. Estimated benefit payments are reduced by drug subsidy
    receipts expected as a result of the Medicare Act as follows:

Actuarial
    Assumptions

The weighted average rates assumed in the actuarial calculations
    used to determine both the benefit obligations as of the
    measurement date and the net periodic costs for the pension and
    other postretirement benefit plans for the following year are
    presented below. Net periodic benefit costs for 2004 were
    calculated using a discount rate of 6.00 percent.

The Company determined the long-term rate of return based on
    historical asset class returns and current market conditions,
    taking into account the diversification benefits of investing in
    multiple asset classes.

An additional assumption used in measuring the APBO was a
    weighted average medical care cost trend rate of
    9.56 percent for 2007, decreasing gradually to
    5.00 percent through the year 2015, and remaining at that
    level thereafter. An annual increase or decrease in the assumed
    medical care cost trend rate of 1 percent would affect the
    APBO and the service and interest cost components at

The Company also sponsors a 401(k) defined contribution plan
    covering substantially all employees. The Company provides an
    85 percent matching contribution up to 6 percent of an
    employee’s base salary. Prior to November 2006, the Company
    matched employee contributions at a rate of 75 percent up
    to 6 percent of the employee’s base salary. Total
    matching contributions made to the plan for 2006, 2005, and 2004
    were $14 million, $14 million, and $13 million,
    respectively.

CONTINGENCIES
    AND REGULATORY MATTERS

General
    Litigation Matters

The Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions
    arising in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the
    Company’s business activities are subject to extensive
    governmental regulation related to public health and the
    environment. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of
    various types, including property damage, personal injury, and
    citizen enforcement of environmental requirements such as
    opacity and other air quality standards, has increased generally
    throughout the United States. In particular, personal injury
    claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous
    materials have become more frequent. The ultimate outcome of
    such pending or potential litigation against the Company cannot
    be predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not
    specifically reported herein, management does not anticipate
    that the liabilities, if any, arising from such proceedings
    would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    financial statements.

Environmental
    Matters

New
    Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the EPA brought a civil action in the
    U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia
    against certain Southern Company subsidiaries, including the
    Company, alleging that it had violated the New Source Review
    (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act and related state laws at
    certain coal-fired generating facilities. Through subsequent
    amendments and other legal procedures, the EPA filed a separate
    action in January 2001 against the Company in the
    U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama,
    after it was dismissed from the original action. In these
    lawsuits, the EPA alleged that NSR violations occurred at five
    coal-fired generating facilities operated by the Company. The
    civil actions request penalties and injunctive relief, including
    an order requiring the installation of the best available
    control technology at the affected units. On June 19, 2006,
    the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
    Alabama entered a consent decree between the Company and the
    EPA, resolving the alleged NSR violations at Plant Miller. The
    consent decree required the Company to pay $100,000 to resolve
    the government’s claim for a civil penalty and to donate
    $4.9 million of sulfur dioxide emission allowances to a
    nonprofit charitable organization and formalized specific
    emissions reductions to be accomplished by the Company,
    consistent with other Clean Air Act programs that require
    emissions reductions. On August 14, 2006, the district
    court in Alabama granted the Company’s motion for summary
    judgment and entered final judgment in favor of the Company on
    the EPA’s claims related to Plants Barry, Gaston, Gorgas,
    and Greene County. The plaintiffs have appealed this decision to
    the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, and on
    November 14, 2006, the Eleventh Circuit granted the
    plaintiffs’ request to stay the appeal, pending the
    U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in a similar NSR case
    filed by the EPA against Duke Energy.

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and
    the EPA regulations and interpretations in effect at the time
    the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act authorizes
    maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $32,500 per day, per
    violation at each generating unit, depending on the date of the
    alleged violation. An adverse outcome in this matter could
    require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be
    determined at this time and could possibly require payment of
    substantial penalties. Such expenditures could affect future
    results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition if
    such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

FERC
    Matters

Market-Based
    Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to
    non-affiliates, including short-term opportunity sales, at
    market-based prices. Specific FERC approval must be obtained
    with respect to a market-based contract with an affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess
    Southern Company’s generation dominance within its retail
    service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in
    other markets is not an issue in that proceeding. Any new
    market-based rate sales by the Company in Southern
    Company’s retail service territory entered into during a

15-month

refund period beginning February 27, 2005 could be subject
    to refund to the level of the default cost-based rates, pending
    the outcome of the proceeding. Such sales through May 27,
    2006, the end of the refund period, were approximately
    $3.9 million for the Company. In the event that the
    FERC’s default mitigation measures for entities that are
    found to have market power are ultimately applied, the Company
    may be required to charge cost-based rates for certain wholesale
    sales in the Southern Company retail service territory, which
    may be lower than negotiated market-based rates. The final
    outcome of this matter will depend on the form in which the
    final methodology for assessing generation market power and
    mitigation rules may be ultimately adopted and cannot be
    determined at this time.

In addition, in May 2005, the FERC started an investigation to
    determine whether Southern Company satisfies the other three
    parts of the FERC’s market-based rate analysis:
    transmission market power, barriers to entry, and affiliate
    abuse or reciprocal dealing. The FERC established a new

15-month

refund period related to this expanded investigation. Any new
    market-based rate sales involving any Southern Company
    subsidiary, including the Company, could be subject to refund to
    the extent the FERC orders lower rates as a result of this new
    investigation. Such sales through October 19, 2006, the end
    of the refund period, were approximately $14.6 million for
    the Company, of which $3.1 million relates to sales inside
    the retail service territory discussed above. The FERC also
    directed that this expanded proceeding be held in abeyance
    pending the outcome of the proceeding on the Intercompany
    Interchange Contract (IIC) discussed below. On
    January 3, 2007, the FERC issued an order noting settlement
    of the IIC proceeding and seeking comment identifying any
    remaining issues and the proper procedure for addressing any
    such issues.

II-124


NOTES

(continued)

Alabama Power Company 2006
    Annual Report

The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for
    these proceedings and is vigorously defending itself in this
    matter. However, the final outcome of this matter, including any
    remedies to be applied in the event of an adverse ruling in
    these proceedings, cannot now be determined.

Intercompany
    Interchange Contract

The Company’s generation fleet is operated under
    the IIC, as approved by the FERC. In May 2005, the FERC
    initiated a new proceeding to examine (1) the provisions of
    the IIC among the Company, Georgia Power, Gulf Power,
    Mississippi Power, Savannah Electric, Southern Power, and SCS,
    as agent, under the terms of which the power pool of Southern
    Company is operated, and, in particular, the propriety of the
    continued inclusion of Southern Power as a party to
    the IIC, (2) whether any parties to the IIC have
    violated the FERC’s standards of conduct applicable to
    utility companies that are transmission providers, and
    (3) whether Southern Company’s code of conduct
    defining Southern Power as a “system company” rather
    than a “marketing affiliate” is just and reasonable.
    In connection with the formation of Southern Power, the FERC
    authorized Southern Power’s inclusion in the IIC in
    2000. The FERC also previously approved Southern Company’s
    code of conduct.

On October 5, 2006, the FERC issued an order accepting a
    settlement resolving the proceeding subject to Southern
    Company’s agreement to accept certain modifications to the
    settlement’s terms. On October 20, 2006, Southern
    Company notified the FERC that it accepted the modifications.
    The modifications largely involve functional separation and
    information restrictions related to marketing activities
    conducted on behalf of Southern Power. Southern Company filed
    with the FERC on November 6, 2006 an implementation plan to
    comply with the modifications set forth in the order. The impact
    of the modifications is not expected to have a material impact
    on the Company’s financial statements.

Generation
    Interconnection Agreements

In July 2003, the FERC issued its final rule on the
    standardization of generation interconnection agreements and
    procedures (Order 2003). Order 2003 shifts much of the financial
    burden of new transmission investment from the generator to the
    transmission provider. The FERC has indicated that Order 2003,
    which was effective January 20, 2004, is to be applied
    prospectively to new generating facilities interconnecting to a
    transmission system. Order 2003 was affirmed by the
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
    on January 12, 2007. The cost impact resulting from Order
    2003 will vary on a

case-by-case

basis for each new generator interconnecting to the transmission
    system.

On November 22, 2004, generator company subsidiaries of
    Tenaska, Inc. (Tenaska), as counterparties to two previously
    executed interconnection agreements with the Company, filed
    complaints at the FERC requesting that the FERC modify the
    agreements and that the Company refund a total of
    $11 million previously paid for interconnection facilities,
    with interest. The Company has also received requests for
    similar modifications from other entities totaling approximately
    $7 million, though no other complaints are pending with the
    FERC. On January 19, 2007, the FERC issued an order
    granting Tenaska’s requested relief. Although the
    FERC’s order requires the modification of Tenaska’s
    interconnection agreements, the order reduces the amount of the
    refund that had been requested by Tenaska. As a result, the
    Company estimates indicate that no refund is due Tenaska.
    Southern Company has requested rehearing of the FERC’s
    order. The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Retail
    Regulatory Matters

The following retail ratemaking procedures will remain in effect
    until the Alabama PSC votes to modify or discontinue them.

Rate
    RSE

The Alabama PSC has adopted a Rate Stabilization and
    Equalization plan (Rate RSE) that provides for periodic annual
    adjustments based upon the Company’s earned return on
    retail common equity. Prior to January 2007, annual adjustments
    were limited to 3 percent. Rates remain unchanged when the
    return on common equity ranges between 13.0 percent and
    14.5 percent. On October 4, 2005, the Alabama PSC
    approved a revision to Rate RSE. Effective January 2007 and
    thereafter, Rate RSE adjustments are made based on
    forward-looking information for the applicable upcoming calendar
    year. Rate adjustments for any two-year period, when averaged
    together, cannot exceed 4.0 percent per year and any annual
    adjustment is limited to 5.0 percent. The range of return
    on common equity, on which such adjustments are based, remains
    unchanged. If the Company’s actual retail return on common
    equity is above the allowed equity return range, customer
    refunds will be required; however, there is no provision for
    additional customer billings should the actual return on common
    equity fall below the allowed equity return range. The Company
    made its initial submission of projected data for calendar year

II-125


NOTES

(continued)

Alabama Power Company 2006
    Annual Report

on December 1, 2006. The Rate RSE increase for 2007,
    effective in January, is 4.76 percent, or $193 million
    annually. Under the terms of Rate RSE, the maximum increase for
    2008 cannot exceed 3.24 percent. See “Rate CNP”
    for additional information.

Rate
    CNP

The Alabama PSC has also approved a rate mechanism that provides
    for adjustments to recognize the placing of new generating
    facilities in retail service and for the recovery of retail
    costs associated with certificated purchased power agreements
    (Rate CNP). In October 2004, the Alabama PSC approved a request
    by the Company to amend Rate CNP to provide for the recovery of
    retail costs associated with environmental laws and regulations.
    Environmental costs to be recovered include operation and
    maintenance expenses, depreciation and a return on invested
    capital. This component of Rate CNP began operation in January
    2005.

To recover certificated purchased power costs under Rate CNP,
    increases of 0.8 percent in retail rates, or
    $25 million annually were effective July 2004. In April
    2005, an adjustment to Rate CNP decreased retail rates by
    approximately 0.5 percent, or $19 million annually. In
    April 2006, an annual

true-up

adjustment to Rate CNP increased retail rates by approximately
    0.5 percent, or $19 million annually.

The retail rates to recover retail costs associated with
    environmental laws and regulations under Rate CNP are adjusted
    annually in January. Retail rates increased approximately
    1.0 percent in 2005, or $33 million. In 2006, retail
    rates increased approximately 1.2 percent, or
    $43 million, and in 2007 retail rates increased
    approximately 0.6 percent, or $23 million.

Fuel
    Cost Recovery

The Company has established fuel cost recovery rates approved by
    the Alabama PSC. The Company can change the retail energy cost
    recovery rate after submitting to the Alabama PSC an estimate of
    future energy costs and the current over or under recovered
    balance. In response to such a request, the Alabama PSC may
    conduct a public hearing prior to its ruling. Alternatively, the
    retail energy cost recovery rates requested by the Company will
    become effective 45 days after the initial request.

In December 2005, the Alabama PSC approved the Company’s
    request to increase the retail energy cost recovery rate to
    2.400 cents per

kilowatt-hour,

effective with billings that began in January 2006 for the

24-month

period ending December 31, 2007. Thereafter, the energy
    cost recovery rate factor will increase absent a contrary order
    by the Alabama PSC.

The Company’s under recovered fuel costs as of
    December 31, 2006 is $301.0 million and is classified
    as deferred charges and other assets in the balance sheet as of
    December 31, 2006.

Natural
    Disaster Cost Recovery

In September 2004, Hurricane Ivan hit the Gulf Coast of Florida
    and Alabama and continued north through the Company’s
    service territory causing substantial damage. The related costs
    charged to the Company’s NDR were $57.8 million.
    During 2004, the Company accrued $9.9 million to the
    reserve and at December 31, 2004, the reserve balance was a
    regulatory asset of $37.7 million.

In February and December 2005, the Company requested and
    received Alabama PSC approval of an accounting order that
    allowed the Company to immediately return certain regulatory
    liabilities to the retail customers. These orders also allowed
    the Company to simultaneously recover from customers an accrual
    of approximately $48 million primarily to offset the costs
    of Hurricane Ivan and restore a positive balance in the NDR. The
    combined effect of these orders had no impact on the
    Company’s net income in 2005.

On July 10, 2005 and August 29, 2005, Hurricanes
    Dennis and Katrina, respectively, hit the coast of Alabama and
    continued north through the state, causing significant damage in
    parts of the service territory of the Company. Approximately
    241,000 and 637,000 of the Company’s 1.4 million
    customer accounts were without electrical service immediately
    after Hurricanes Dennis and Katrina, respectively. The Company
    sustained significant damage to its distribution and
    transmission facilities during these storms.

In August 2005, the Company received approval from the Alabama
    PSC to defer the Hurricane Dennis storm-related operation and
    maintenance costs (approximately $28 million). In October
    2005, the Company also received similar approval from the
    Alabama PSC to defer the Hurricane Katrina storm-related
    operation and maintenance costs (approximately
    $30 million). The NDR balance at December 31, 2005 was
    a regulatory asset of $50.6 million.

In December 2005, the Alabama PSC approved a request by the
    Company to replenish the depleted NDR and allow for recovery of
    future natural disaster costs. The Alabama PSC order gives the
    Company authority to record a deficit balance in the NDR when
    costs of

II-126


NOTES

(continued)

Alabama Power Company 2006
    Annual Report

uninsured storm damage exceed any established reserve balance.
    The order also approved a separate monthly NDR charge consisting
    of two components which began in January 2006. The first
    component is intended to establish and maintain a target reserve
    balance of $75 million for future storms and is an on-going
    part of customer billing. The Company currently expects that the
    target reserve balance could be achieved within five years. The
    second component of the NDR charge is intended to allow recovery
    of the existing deferred hurricane related operation and
    maintenance costs and any future reserve deficits over a

24-month

period. Absent further Alabama PSC approval, the maximum total
    NDR charge consisting of both components is $10 per month
    per non-residential customer account and $5 per month per
    residential customer account.

As of December 31, 2006, the Company had recovered
    $49.5 million of the costs allowed for storm-recovery
    activities and the deficit balance in the NDR account totaled
    approximately $16.8 million, which is included in the
    balance sheets under “Current Assets.” Absent any new
    storm-related damages, the Company expects to fully recover the
    deferred storm costs by the middle of 2007. As a result,
    customer rates would be decreased by this portion of NDR. At
    December 31, 2006, the Company had accumulated a balance of
    $13.2 million in the target reserve for future storms,
    which is included in the balance sheets under “Other
    Regulatory Liabilities.”

As revenue from the NDR charge is recognized, an equal amount of
    operation and maintenance expense related to the NDR will also
    be recognized. As a result, this increase in revenue and expense
    will not have an impact on net income, but will increase annual
    cash flow.

4. JOINT
    OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS

The Company and Georgia Power own equally all of the outstanding
    capital stock of SEGCO, which owns electric generating units
    with a total rated capacity of 1,020 megawatts, as well as
    associated transmission facilities. The capacity of these units
    is sold equally to the Company and Georgia Power under a
    contract which, in substance, requires payments sufficient to
    provide for the operating expenses, taxes, interest expense and
    a return on equity, whether or not SEGCO has any capacity and
    energy available. The term of the contract extends automatically
    for two-year periods, subject to either party’s right to
    cancel upon two year’s notice. The Company’s share of
    purchased power totaled $95 million in 2006,
    $90 million in 2005, and $86 million in 2004 and is
    included in “Purchased power from affiliates” in the
    statements of income. The Company accounts for SEGCO using the
    equity method.

In addition, the Company has guaranteed unconditionally the
    obligation of SEGCO under an installment sale agreement for the
    purchase of certain pollution control facilities at SEGCO’s
    generating units, pursuant to which $24.5 million principal
    amount of pollution control revenue bonds are outstanding. Also,
    the Company has guaranteed $50 million principal amount of
    unsecured senior notes issued by SEGCO for general corporate
    purposes. Georgia Power has agreed to reimburse the Company for
    the pro rata portion of such obligations corresponding to its
    then proportionate ownership of stock of SEGCO if the Company is
    called upon to make such payment under its guaranty.

At December 31, 2006, the capitalization of SEGCO consisted
    of $60 million of equity and $88 million of debt on
    which the annual interest requirement is $3.2 million.
    SEGCO paid dividends totaling $8.5 million in 2006,
    $7.7 million in 2005, and $12.0 million in 2004, of
    which one-half of each was paid to the Company. In addition, the
    Company recognizes 50 percent of SEGCO’s net income.

In addition to the Company’s ownership of SEGCO, the
    Company’s percentage ownership and investment in
    jointly-owned coal-fired generating plants at December 31,
    2006 is as follows:

5. INCOME
    TAXES

Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return
    and combined income tax returns for the State of Georgia and the
    State of Alabama. Under a joint consolidated income tax
    allocation agreement, each subsidiary’s current and
    deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis and no
    subsidiary is allocated more expense than would be paid if they
    filed a separate income tax return. In accordance with IRS
    regulations, each company is jointly and severally liable for
    the tax liability.

In 2004 and 2005, in order to avoid the loss of certain federal
    income tax credits related to the production of synthetic fuel,
    Southern Company chose to defer certain deductions otherwise
    available to the subsidiaries. The cash flow benefit associated
    with the utilization of the tax credits was allocated to the
    subsidiary that otherwise would have claimed the available
    deductions on a separate company basis without the deferral.
    This allocation concurrently reduced the tax benefit of the
    credits allocated to those subsidiaries that generated the
    credits. As the deferred expenses are deducted, the benefit of
    the tax credits will be repaid to the subsidiaries that
    generated the tax credits. At December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    the Company had $34.9 million and $20.4 million in
    accumulated deferred income taxes and $3.1 million and
    $2.0 million in accrued taxes – income taxes,
    respectively, payable to these subsidiaries, on the balance
    sheets.

At December 31, 2006, the Company’s tax-related
    regulatory assets and liabilities were $354 million and
    $99 million, respectively. These assets are attributable to
    tax benefits flowed through to customers in prior years and to
    taxes applicable to capitalized interest. These liabilities are
    attributable to deferred taxes previously recognized at rates
    higher than the current enacted tax law and to unamortized
    investment tax credits.

In accordance with regulatory requirements, deferred investment
    tax credits are amortized over the lives of the related property
    with such amortization normally applied as a credit to reduce
    depreciation in the statements of income. Credits amortized in
    this manner amounted to $8.0 million in 2006,
    $8.8 million in 2005, and $11.0 million in 2004. At
    December 31, 2006, all investment tax credits available to
    reduce federal income taxes payable had been utilized.

    “Difference in prior years’ deferred and current tax
    rates” in the table above. See Note 3 to the financial
    statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters –

6. FINANCING

Mandatorily
    Redeemable Preferred

Securities/Long-Term

Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts

The Company has formed certain wholly owned trust subsidiaries
    for the purpose of issuing preferred securities. The proceeds of
    the related equity investments and preferred security sales were
    loaned back to the Company through the issuance of junior
    subordinated notes totaling $309 million, which constitute
    substantially all assets of these trusts and are reflected in
    the balance sheets as Long-term Debt Payable to Affiliated
    Trusts. The Company considers that the mechanisms and
    obligations relating to the preferred securities issued for its
    benefit, taken together, constitute a full and unconditional
    guarantee by it of the respective trusts’ payment
    obligations with respect to these securities. At
    December 31, 2006, preferred securities of
    $300 million were outstanding. See Note 1 under
    “Variable Interest Entities” for additional
    information on the accounting treatment for these trusts and the
    related securities.

Pollution
    Control Bonds

Pollution control obligations represent installment purchases of
    pollution control facilities financed by funds derived from
    sales by public authorities of revenue bonds. The Company is
    required to make payments sufficient for the authorities to meet
    principal and interest requirements of such bonds.

Alabama Power Company 2006
    Annual Report

Senior
    Notes

The Company issued a total of $950 million of unsecured
    senior notes in 2006. The proceeds of these issuances were used
    to repay short-term indebtedness, and for other general
    corporate purposes.

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had
    $4.0 billion and $3.6 billion of senior notes
    outstanding, respectively. These senior notes are subordinate to
    all secured debt of the Company which amounted to approximately
    $153 million at December 31, 2006.

On February 6, 2007, the Company issued $200 million
    of long-term senior notes. The proceeds were used to repay
    short-term indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes.

Preference
    and Common Stock

In 2006, the Company issued six million new shares of preference
    stock at $25.00 stated capital per share and realized
    proceeds of $150 million. In addition, the Company issued
    three million new shares of common stock to Southern Company at
    $40.00 per share and realized proceeds of
    $120 million. The proceeds of these issuances were used to
    repay short-term indebtedness and for other general corporate
    purposes.

Outstanding
    Classes of Capital Stock

The Company currently has preferred stock, Class A
    preferred stock, preference stock, and common stock outstanding.
    The Company’s preferred stock and Class A preferred
    stock, without preference between classes, rank senior to the
    Company’s preference stock and common stock with respect to
    payment of dividends and voluntary or involuntary dissolution.
    The Company’s preference stock ranks senior to the common
    stock with respect to the payment of dividends and voluntary or
    involuntary dissolution. Certain series of the preferred stock,
    Class A preferred stock, and preference stock are subject
    to redemption at the option of the Company on or after a
    specified date.

Securities
    Due Within One Year

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had scheduled
    maturities and redemptions of senior notes due within one year
    totaling $669 million and $547 million, respectively.

Debt maturities through 2011 applicable to total long-term debt
    are as follows: $669 million in 2007; $410 million in
    2008; $250 million in 2009; $100 million in 2010; and
    $200 million in 2011.

Assets
    Subject to Lien

At January 1, 2006, the Company had a mortgage that secured
    first mortgage bonds they had issued and constituted a direct
    first lien on substantially all of its fixed property and
    franchises. In 2006, the Company discharged its remaining
    outstanding first mortgage bond obligations and the lien was
    removed in May 2006. The Company has granted liens on certain
    property in connection with the issuance of certain series of
    pollution control bonds with an outstanding principal amount of
$153 million.

Bank
    Credit Arrangements

The Company maintains committed lines of credit in the amount of
    $965 million (including $563 million of such lines
    which are dedicated to funding purchase obligations relating to
    variable rate pollution control bonds), of which
    $365 million will expire at various times during 2007.
    $198 million of the credit facilities expiring in 2007
    allow for the execution of one-year term loans. The remaining
    $600 million of credit facilities expire in 2011. All of
    the credit arrangements require payment of a commitment fee
    based on the unused portion of the commitment or the maintenance
    of compensating balances with the banks. Commitment fees are
    less than 1/4 of 1 percent for the Company. The Company
    does not consider any of its cash balances to be restricted as
    of any specific date.

Most of the Company’s credit arrangements with banks have
    covenants that limit the Company’s debt to 65 percent
    of total capitalization, as defined in the arrangements. For
    purposes of calculating these covenants, long-term notes payable
    to affiliated trusts are excluded from debt but included in
    capitalization. Exceeding this debt level would result in a
    default under the credit arrangements. At December 31,
    2006, the Company was in compliance with the debt limit
    covenants. In addition, the credit arrangements typically
    contain cross default provisions that would be triggered if the
    Company defaulted on other indebtedness (including guarantee
    obligations) above a specified threshold. None of the
    arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time
    of borrowings.

The Company borrows through commercial paper programs that have
    the liquidity support of committed bank credit arrangements. In
    addition, the Company borrows from time to time through
    extendible commercial note programs and uncommitted credit
    arrangements. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had
    $120 million in commercial paper outstanding and no
    extendible commercial notes outstanding. As of December 31,
    2005, the Company had $136 million in commercial paper

II-130


NOTES

    Annual Report

outstanding, $55 million in extendible commercial notes
    outstanding, and $125 million in loans outstanding under an
    uncommitted credit arrangement. During 2006 and 2005, the peak
    amount outstanding for short-term borrowings was
    $411 million and $315 million, respectively. The
    average amount outstanding in 2006 and 2005 was $45 million
    and $31 million, respectively. The average annual interest
    rate on short-term borrowings in 2006 was 4.76 percent and
    in 2005 was 4.04 percent. Short-term borrowings are
    included in notes payable in the balance sheets.

At December 31, 2006, the Company had regulatory approval
    to have outstanding up to $1.4 billion of short-term
    borrowings.

Financial
    Instruments

The Company enters into energy-related derivatives to hedge
    exposures to electricity, gas, and other fuel price changes.
    However, due to cost-based rate regulations, the Company has
    limited exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices
    and prices of electricity. The Company has implemented
    fuel-hedging programs at the instruction of the Alabama PSC. The
    Company also enters into hedges of forward electricity sales.
    There was no material ineffectiveness recorded in earnings in
    2006, 2005, and 2004.

At December 31, 2006, the fair value gains/(losses) of
    derivative energy contracts were reflected in the financial
    statements as follows:

The fair value gain or loss for hedges that are recoverable
    through the regulatory fuel clauses are recorded in the
    regulatory assets and liabilities and are recognized in earnings
    at the same time the hedged items affect earnings. The Company
    has energy-related hedges in place up to and including 2009.

The Company also enters into derivatives to hedge exposure to
    changes in interest rates. Derivatives related to variable rate
    securities or forecasted transactions are accounted for as cash
    flow hedges. The derivatives employed as hedging instruments are
    structured to minimize ineffectiveness. As such, no material
    ineffectiveness has been recorded in earnings.

At December 31, 2006, the Company had $736 million
    notional amount of interest rate derivatives outstanding with
    net fair value loss of $3.0 million as follows:

The fair value gain or loss for cash flow hedges is recorded in
    other comprehensive income and is reclassified into earnings at
    the same time the hedged items affect earnings. In 2006, 2005,
    and 2004, the Company settled gains (losses) of
    $18.0 million, $(21.4) million, and $5.5 million,
    respectively, upon termination of certain interest derivatives
    at the same time it issued debt. These gains (losses) have been
    deferred in other comprehensive income and will be amortized to
    interest expense over the life of the original interest
    derivative, which approximates to the related underlying debt.

For the years 2006, 2005, and 2004, approximately
    $9.8 million, $3.5 million, and $(6.3) million,
    respectively, of pre-tax gains (losses) were reclassified from
    other comprehensive income to interest expense. For 2007,
    pre-tax losses of approximately $0.1 million are expected
    to be reclassified from other comprehensive income to interest
    expense. The Company has interest-related hedges in place
    through 2017 and has gains (losses) that are being amortized
    through 2035.

7. COMMITMENTS

Construction
    Program

The Company is engaged in continuous construction programs,
    currently estimated to total $1.2 billion in 2007,
    $1.3 billion in 2008, and $1.3 billion in 2009. These
    amounts include $26 million, $35 million, and
    $34 million in 2007, 2008, and 2009, respectively, for
    construction expenditures related to contractual purchase
    commitments for uranium and nuclear fuel conversion, enrichment,
    and fabrication services included under “Fuel
    Commitments.” The construction programs are subject to
    periodic review

    Annual Report

and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from the
    above estimates because of numerous factors. These factors
    include: changes in business conditions; revised load growth
    estimates; changes in environmental regulations; changes in
    existing nuclear plants to meet new regulatory requirements;
    changes in FERC rules and regulations; increasing costs of
    labor, equipment, and materials; and cost of capital. At
    December 31, 2006, significant purchase commitments were
    outstanding in connection with the construction program. The
    Company has no generating plants under construction.
    Construction of new transmission and distribution facilities and
    capital improvements, including those needed to meet
    environmental standards for existing generation, transmission,
    and distribution facilities, will continue.

Long-Term
    Service Agreements

The Company has entered into Long-Term Service Agreements
    (LTSAs) with General Electric (GE) for the purpose of securing
    maintenance support for its combined cycle and combustion
    turbine generating facilities. The LTSAs provide that GE will
    perform all planned inspections on the covered equipment, which
    includes the cost of all labor and materials. GE is also
    obligated to cover the costs of unplanned maintenance on the
    covered equipment subject to a limit specified in each contract.

In general, these LTSAs are in effect through two major
    inspection cycles per unit. Scheduled payments to GE are made at
    various intervals based on actual operating hours of the
    respective units. Total remaining payments to GE under these
    agreements for facilities owned are currently estimated at
    $155 million over the remaining life of the agreements,
    which are currently estimated to range up to 10 years.
    However, the LTSAs contain various cancellation provisions at
    the option of the Company.

Payments made to GE prior to the performance of any planned
    maintenance are recorded as either prepayments or other deferred
    charges and assets in the balance sheets. Inspection costs are
    capitalized or charged to expense based on the nature of the
    work performed.

Purchased
    Power Commitments

The Company has entered into various long-term commitments for

    plants, the Company has entered into various long-term
    commitments for the procurement of fossil and nuclear fuel. In
    most cases, these contracts contain provisions for price
    escalations, minimum purchase levels, and other financial
    commitments. Coal commitments include forward contract purchases
    for sulfur dioxide emission allowances. Natural gas purchase
    commitments contain fixed volumes with prices based on various
    indices at the time of delivery. Amounts included in the chart
    below represent estimates based on New York Mercantile Exchange
    future prices at December 31, 2006. Total estimated minimum
    long-term commitments at December 31, 2006 were as follows:

SCS may enter into various types of wholesale energy and natural
    gas contracts acting as an agent for the Company and all of the
    other Southern Company traditional operating companies and
    Southern Power. Under these agreements, each of the traditional
    operating companies and Southern Power may be jointly and

severally liable. The creditworthiness of Southern Power is
    currently inferior to the creditworthiness of the traditional
    operating companies. Accordingly, Southern Company has entered
    into keep-well agreements with the Company and each of the other
    traditional operating companies to ensure the Company will not
    subsidize or be responsible for any costs, losses, liabilities,
    or damages resulting from the inclusion of Southern Power as a
    contracting party under these agreements.

Operating
    Leases

The Company has entered into rental agreements for coal rail
    cars, vehicles, and other equipment with various terms and
    expiration dates. These expenses totaled $30.3 million in
    2006, $27.3 million in 2005, and $28.3 million in
    2004. Of these amounts, $21.5 million, $17.8 million,
    and $16.3 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively,
    relate to the rail car leases and are recoverable through the
    Company’s Rate ECR. At December 31, 2006, estimated
    minimum rental commitments for noncancellable operating leases
    were as follows:

In addition to the rental commitments above, the Company has
    potential obligations upon expiration of certain leases with
    respect to the residual value of the leased property. These
    leases expire in 2009 and 2010, and the Company’s maximum
    obligations are $19.5 million and $62.3 million,
    respectively. At the termination of the leases, at the
    Company’s option, the Company may negotiate an extension,
    exercise its purchase option, or the property can be sold to a
    third party. The Company expects that the fair market value of
    the leased property would substantially eliminate the
    Company’s payments under the residual value obligations.

Guarantees

At December 31, 2006, the Company had outstanding
    guarantees related to SEGCO’s purchase of certain pollution
    control facilities and issuance of senior notes, as discussed in
    Note 4, and to certain residual values of leased assets as
    described above in “Operating Leases.”

STOCK
    OPTION PLAN

Southern Company provides non-qualified stock options to a large
    segment of the Company’s employees ranging from line
    management to executives. As of December 31, 2006, there
    were 1,108 current and former employees of the Company
    participating in the stock option plan. The maximum number of
    shares of Southern Company common stock that may be issued under
    these programs may not exceed 57 million. The prices of
    options granted to date have been at the fair market value of
    the shares on the dates of grant. Options granted to date become
    exercisable pro rata over a maximum period of three years from
    the date of grant. The Company generally recognizes stock option
    expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period which
    equates to the requisite service period; however, for employees
    who are eligible for retirement, the total cost is expensed at
    the grant date. Options outstanding will expire no later than
    10 years after the date of grant, unless terminated earlier
    by the Southern Company Board of Directors in accordance with
    the stock option plan. For certain stock option awards a change
    in control will provide accelerated vesting. As part of the
    adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), as discussed in
    Note 1 under “Stock Options,” Southern Company
    has not modified its stock option plan or outstanding stock
    options, nor has it changed the underlying valuation assumptions
    used in valuing the stock options that were used under
    SFAS No. 123.

The Company’s activity in the stock option plan for 2006 is
    summarized below:

The number of stock options vested and expected to vest in the
    future, as of December 31, 2006 is not significantly
    different from the number of stock options outstanding at
    December 31, 2006 as stated above.

Alabama Power Company 2006
    Annual Report

As of December 31, 2006, the weighted average remaining
    contractual term for the options outstanding and options
    exercisable is 6.6 years and 5.5 years, respectively,
    and the aggregate intrinsic value for the options outstanding
    and options exercisable is $48.5 million and
    $39.7 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2006, there was $1.4 million of
    total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option
    awards not yet vested. That cost is expected to be recognized
    over a weighted-average period of approximately 11 months.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years
    ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 was
    $4.9 million, $21.9 million, and $16.1 million,
    respectively.

The actual tax benefit realized by the Company for the tax
    deductions from stock option exercises totaled
    $1.9 million, $8.5 million, and $6.2 million,
    respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005,
    and 2004.

NUCLEAR
    INSURANCE

Under the Price-Anderson Amendments Act (Act), the Company
    maintains agreements of indemnity with the NRC that, together
    with private insurance, cover third-party liability arising from
    any nuclear incident occurring at Plant Farley. The Act provides
    funds up to $10.8 billion for public liability claims that
    could arise from a single nuclear incident. Plant Farley is
    insured against this liability to a maximum of $300 million
    by American Nuclear Insurers (ANI), with the remaining coverage
    provided by a mandatory program of deferred premiums that could
    be assessed, after a nuclear incident, against all owners of
    nuclear reactors. The Company could be assessed up to
    $101 million per incident for each licensed reactor it
    operates but not more than an aggregate of $15 million per
    incident to be paid in a calendar year for each reactor. Such
    maximum assessment, excluding any applicable state premium
    taxes, for the Company is $201 million per incident but not
    more than an aggregate of $30 million to be paid for each
    incident in any one year.

The Company is a member of Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited
    (NEIL), a mutual insurer established to provide property damage
    insurance in an amount up to $500 million for members’
    nuclear generating facilities.

Additionally, the Company has policies that currently provide
    decontamination, excess property insurance, and premature
    decommissioning coverage up to $2.25 billion for losses in
    excess of the $500 million primary coverage. This excess
    insurance is also provided by NEIL.

NEIL also covers the additional costs that would be incurred in
    obtaining replacement power during a prolonged accidental outage
    at a member’s nuclear plant. Members can purchase this
    coverage, subject to a deductible waiting period of up to
    26 weeks, with a maximum per occurrence per unit limit of
    $490 million. After this deductible period, weekly
    indemnity payments would be received until either the unit is
    operational or until the limit is exhausted in approximately
    three years. The Company purchases the maximum limit allowed by
    NEIL and has elected a

12-week

waiting period.

Under each of the NEIL policies, members are subject to
    assessments if losses each year exceed the accumulated funds
    available to the insurer under that policy. The current maximum
    annual assessments for the Company under the NEIL policies would
    be $38 million.

Following the terrorist attacks of September 2001, both ANI and
    NEIL confirmed that terrorist acts against commercial nuclear
    power plants would, subject to the normal policy limits, be
    covered under their insurance. Both companies, however, revised
    their policy terms on a prospective basis to include an industry
    aggregate for all “non-certified” terrorist acts,
    i.e., acts that are not certified acts of terrorism pursuant to
    the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, which was renewed in
    2005. The aggregate for all NEIL policies, which applies to
    non-certified property claims stemming from terrorism within a
    12 month duration, is $3.2 billion plus any amounts
    available through reinsurance or indemnity from an outside
    source. The non-certified ANI nuclear liability cap is a
    $300 million shared industry aggregate during the normal
    ANI policy period.

For all

on-site

property damage insurance policies for commercial nuclear power
    plants, the NRC requires that the proceeds of such policies
    shall be dedicated first for the sole purpose of placing the
    reactor in a safe and stable condition after an accident. Any
    remaining proceeds are to be applied next toward the costs of
    decontamination and debris removal operations ordered by the
    NRC, and any further remaining proceeds are to be paid either to
    the Company or to its bond trustees as may be appropriate under
    the policies and applicable trust indentures.

All retrospective assessments, whether generated for liability,
    property, or replacement power, may be subject to applicable
    state premium taxes.

GEORGIA POWER COMPANY

FINANCIAL SECTION

II-138


REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Georgia
    Power Company

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements
    of capitalization of Georgia Power Company (the
    “Company”) (a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern
    Company) as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related
    statements of income, comprehensive income, common
    stockholder’s equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2006. These
    financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to
    have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
    control over financial reporting. Our audits included
    consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a
    basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
    circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
    on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements (pages II-160 to

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

Georgia Power Company 2006 Annual
    Report

OVERVIEW

Business
    Activities

Georgia Power Company (the Company) operates as a vertically
    integrated utility providing electricity to retail customers
    within its traditional service area located within the State of
    Georgia and to wholesale customers in the Southeast.

Effective July 1, 2006, Savannah Electric and Power Company
    (Savannah Electric), which was also a wholly owned subsidiary of
    Southern Company, was merged into the Company. The Company has
    accounted for the merger in a manner similar to a pooling of
    interests, and the Company’s financial statements included
    herein now reflect the merger as though it had occurred on
    January 1, 2004. The supplemental selected financial and
    operating data reflect the merger as though it had occurred on
    January 1, 2002. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL –
    “Merger” and Note 3 to the financial statements
    under “Retail Regulatory Matters – Merger”
    for additional information.

Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of
    the Company’s primary business of selling electricity.
    These factors include the ability to maintain a stable
    regulatory environment, to achieve energy sales growth, and to
    effectively manage and secure timely recovery of rising costs.
    These costs include those related to growing demand,
    increasingly stringent environmental standards, and fuel prices.
    In December 2004, the Company completed a major retail rate
    proceeding (2004 Retail Rate Plan) that has provided earnings
    stability. This regulatory action also enabled the recovery of
    substantial capital investments to facilitate the continued
    reliability of the transmission and distribution network and
    continued environmental improvements at the generating plants.
    Appropriately balancing environmental expenditures with customer
    prices will continue to challenge the Company for the
    foreseeable future. The Company is required to file a general
    rate case by July 1, 2007, which will determine whether the
    2004 Retail Rate Plan should be continued, modified, or
    discontinued. The Company also received regulatory orders to
    increase its fuel cost recovery rate effective June 1,
    2005, July 1, 2006, and March 1, 2007.

Key
    Performance Indicators

In striving to maximize shareholder value while providing
    cost-effective energy to more than two million customers, the
    Company continues to focus on several key indicators. These
    indicators include customer satisfaction, plant availability,
    system reliability, and net income after dividends on preferred
    stock. The Company’s financial success is directly tied to
    the satisfaction of its customers. Key elements of ensuring
    customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high
    reliability, and competitive prices. Management uses customer
    satisfaction surveys and reliability indicators to evaluate the
    Company’s results.

Peak season equivalent forced outage rate (Peak Season EFOR) is
    an indicator of fossil/hydro plant availability and efficient
    generation fleet operations during the months when generation
    needs are greatest. The rate is calculated by dividing the
    number of hours of forced outages by total generation hours. The
    2006 Peak Season EFOR of 0.99 percent is above target, a
    significant improvement over 2005 Peak Season EFOR of
    1.42 percent. Transmission and distribution system
    reliability performance is measured by the frequency and
    duration of outages. Performance targets for reliability are set
    internally based on historical performance, expected weather
    conditions, and expected capital expenditures. 2006 performance
    exceeded all targets on these reliability measures. Net income
    is the primary component of the Company’s contribution to
    Southern Company’s earnings per share goal.

The Company’s 2006 results compared to its targets for some
    of these indicators are reflected in the following chart.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

(continued)

Georgia Power Company 2006 Annual Report

$43 million, or 5.8 percent, increase over 2005.
    Operating income increased in 2006 due to higher base retail
    revenues and wholesale non-fuel revenues, partially offset by
    higher non-fuel operating expenses and higher financing costs.
    The Company’s 2005 earnings totaled $744 million
    representing a $61 million, or 9.0 percent, increase
    over 2004. Operating income increased in 2005 due to higher base
    retail revenues resulting from retail rate increases effective
    January 1, 2005 and June 1, 2005 and more favorable
    weather, as well as higher wholesale revenues resulting from new
    contracts effective January 1, 2005, partially offset by
    increased non-fuel operating expenses. The Company’s 2004
    earnings totaled $683 million representing a
    $29 million, or 4.4 percent, increase over 2003.
    Operating income increased in 2004 due to higher base retail
    revenues attributable to more favorable weather and customer
    growth during the year, partially offset by higher non-fuel
    operating expenses. In addition, lower depreciation and
    amortization expense resulting from a three-year retail rate
    plan approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC) in
    2001 (2001 Retail Rate Plan) significantly offset increased
    purchased power capacity expenses.

Retail base revenues of $3.8 billion in 2006 increased
    $7.0 million, or 0.2 percent, from 2005 primarily due
    to customer growth of 1.9 percent and more favorable
    weather, partially offset by lower market-driven rates to large
    commercial and industrial customers. Retail base revenues of
    $3.8 billion in 2005 increased by $360 million, or
    10.6 percent, from 2004 primarily due to the retail rate
    increases effective January 1, 2005 and June 1, 2005,
    sustained economic strength, customer growth, more favorable
    weather, and generally higher prices to large business
    customers. See Note 3 to the financial statements under
    “Retail Regulatory Matters – Rate Plans” for
    additional information. Retail base revenues of
    $3.4 billion in 2004 increased by $192 million, or
    6.0 percent, from 2003 primarily due to an improved
    economy, customer growth, generally higher prices to the
    Company’s large business customers, and more favorable
    weather.

Electric rates include provisions to adjust billings for
    fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of
    purchased power costs. Under these fuel cost recovery
    provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses,
    including the fuel component of purchased power, and do not
    affect net income. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL –
    “PSC Matters – Fuel Cost Recovery” herein
    for additional information.

Revenues from unit power sales contracts remained relatively
    constant in 2006, 2005, and 2004. Revenues from other
    non-affiliated sales increased $21 million, or
    4.6 percent, and $273 million, or 146.0 percent,
    in 2006 and 2005, respectively, and decreased $13 million,
    or 6.5 percent, in 2004. The increase in 2006 was due to a
    9.5 percent increase in the demand for

kilowatt-hour

(KWH) energy sales due to a new contract with an electrical
    membership corporation (EMC) that went into effect in April
    2006. The increase in 2005 was primarily due to contracts with
    30 EMCs that went into effect in January 2005 which increased
    the demand for energy. The capacity component of these
    transactions increased $1 million and $73.2 million in
    2006 and 2005, respectively.

Revenues from sales to affiliated companies within the Southern
    Company system will vary from year to year depending on demand
    and the availability and cost of generating resources at each
    company. These affiliated sales and purchases are made in
    accordance with the Intercompany Interchange Contract (IIC), as
    approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). In
    2006 and 2005, KWH energy sales to affiliates increased
    9.2 percent and 2.2 percent, respectively, due to
    higher demand. However, revenues from these sales decreased by
    8.3 percent in 2006 due to reduced cost per KWH delivered.
    Revenues increased 59.8 percent in 2005 due to higher fuel
    prices. In 2004, KWH energy sales to affiliates decreased
    18.3 percent due to lower demand. However, the decline in
    associated revenues was only 5.0 percent due to higher fuel
    prices. These transactions do not have a significant impact on
    earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost.

Other operating revenues increased $24.6 million, or
    11.6 percent, in 2006 primarily due to increased revenues
    of $14.1 million related to work performed for the other
    owners of the integrated transmission system (ITS) in the State
    of Georgia, higher customer fees of $4.6 million, and
    higher outdoor lighting revenues of $6.1 million due

II-142

to a 5.5 percent increase in customers. Other operating
    revenues increased $26.1 million, or 14.1 percent, in
    2005 from 2004, primarily due to higher transmission revenues of
    $16 million related to work performed for the other owners
    of the ITS, higher revenues under the open access tariff
    agreement, higher outdoor lighting revenues of
    $5.4 million, and higher customer fees that went into
    effect in 2005 of $5.9 million. The increased transmission
    revenues in 2006 and 2005 did not have an impact on earnings
    since they were offset by associated transmission expenses.
    Other operating revenues increased $11.6 million, or
    6.7 percent, in 2004 over 2003 primarily due to higher
    revenues from outdoor lighting of $4.2 million and pole
    attachment rentals of $4.9 million and higher gains on
    sales of emission allowances of $2 million.

Energy
    Sales

Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the volume of
    energy sold each year. KWH sales for 2006 and the percent change

Residential KWH sales increased 2.7 percent in 2006 over
    2005 due to customer growth of 1.9 percent and more
    favorable weather. Commercial KWH sales increased
    2.5 percent in 2006 over 2005 due to customer growth of
    2.0 percent and a reclassification of customers from
    industrial to commercial to be consistent with the rate
    structure approved by the Georgia PSC. Industrial KWH sales
    decreased 1.0 percent due to a 3.4 percent decrease in
    the number of customers as a result of this reclassification.

Residential KWH sales increased 2.7 percent in 2005 over
    2004 due to more favorable weather, customer growth of
    1.8 percent, and a 0.9 percent increase in the average
    energy consumption per customer. Commercial KWH sales increased
    6.0 percent in 2005 when compared to 2004 due to more
    favorable weather, sustained economic strength, customer growth
    of 1.9 percent, and a reclassification of customers from
    industrial to commercial to be consistent with the rate
    structure approved by the Georgia PSC. Industrial sales
    decreased 5.0 percent primarily due to this
    reclassification of customers.

Residential KWH sales increased 5.5 percent in 2004 from
    2003 due to more favorable weather and a 1.9 percent
    increase in residential customers. Commercial KWH sales
    increased 4.1 percent in 2004 due to an improved economy
    and a 3.0 percent increase in commercial customers.
    Industrial sales increased 2.4 percent in 2004 due to the
    improved economy.

Fuel
    and Purchased Power Expenses

Fuel costs constitute the single largest expense for the
    Company. The mix of fuel sources for generation of electricity
    is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel
    consumed, and the availability of generating units. Details of
    the Company’s generation, fuel, and purchased power are as
    follows:

Fuel and purchased power expenses were $3.4 billion in
    2006, an increase of $124 million, or 3.8 percent,
    above prior year costs. This increase was driven by a
    $181 million increase related to total KWH generated and
    purchased, partially offset by a $57 million decrease in
    the cost of fuel.

Fuel and purchased power expenses were $3.3 billion in
    2005, an increase of $863 million, or 36.1 percent,
    above prior year costs. This increase was the result of an

II-143


MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

(continued)

Georgia Power Company 2006 Annual Report

$868 million increase in the cost of fuel and a
    $5 million decrease related to total KWH generated and
    purchased.

Fuel and purchased power expenses were $2.4 billion in
    2004, an increase of $365 million, or 18 percent,
    above prior year costs. This increase was the result of a
    $20 million increase in the cost of fuel and a
    $345 million increase related to total KWH generated and
    purchased.

The Company has entered into three power purchase agreements
    (PPAs) to purchase a total of approximately 1,000 megawatts (MW)
    annually from June 2009 through May 2024. These agreements were
    approved by the Georgia PSC on October 2, 2006. These
    agreements satisfy approximately 550 MW of growth, replace
    an existing 450 MW agreement that expires in May 2009, and
    are expected to result in higher operations and maintenance
    expenses that will be subject to recovery through future base
    rates.

While prices have moderated somewhat in 2006, a significant
    upward trend in the cost of coal and natural gas has emerged
    since 2003, and volatility in these markets is expected to
    continue. Increased coal prices have been influenced by a
    worldwide increase in demand as a result of rapid economic
    growth in China, as well as by increases in mining and fuel
    transportation costs. Higher natural gas prices in the United
    States are the result of increased demand and slightly lower gas
    supplies despite increased drilling activity. Natural gas
    production and supply interruptions, such as those caused by the
    2004 and 2005 hurricanes result in an immediate market response;
    however, the long-term impact of this price volatility may be
    reduced by imports of liquefied natural gas if new liquefied gas
    facilities are built. Fuel expenses generally do not affect net
    income, since they are offset by fuel revenues under the
    Company’s fuel cost recovery provisions. See FUTURE
    EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “PSC MATTERS —
    Fuel Cost Recovery.”

Other
    Operations and Maintenance Expenses

In 2006, other operations and maintenance expenses decreased
    $11 million, or 0.7 percent, from the prior year.
    Maintenance for generating plants decreased $20.0 million
    in 2006 as a result of scheduled outages in 2005 offset by an
    increase of $18.2 million for transmission and distribution
    expenses related to load dispatching and overhead line
    maintenance. Also contributing to the decrease were decreased
    employee benefit expenses related to medical benefits and lower
    workers compensation expense of $23.2 million, partially
    offset by lower pension income of $13.7 million.

In 2005, other operations and maintenance expenses increased
    $86 million, or 5.8 percent. Maintenance for
    generating plant and transmission and distribution increased
    $27.5 million and $15.9 million, respectively, as a
    result of scheduled outages and, to a lesser extent, certain
    flexible projects planned for other periods. Increased employee
    benefit expense of $18.9 million related to pension and
    medical benefits and higher property insurance costs of
    $4.6 million resulting from storm damage also contributed
    to the increase. Customer assistance expense and uncollectible
    account expense also increased an additional $9.3 million
    in 2005 over 2004, primarily as a result of promotional expenses
    related to an energy efficiency program and an increased number
    of customer bankruptcies.

In 2004, other operations and maintenance expenses increased
    $155 million, or 11.6 percent, in part due to the
    timing of generating plant maintenance of $37.6 million and
    transmission and distribution maintenance of $39.6 million.
    Increased employee benefit expense of $30 million related
    to pension and medical benefits and higher workers compensation
    expense of $8 million also contributed to the increase.

Depreciation
    and Amortization Expenses

Depreciation and amortization decreased $27.9 million, or
    5.3 percent, in 2006 from the prior year due to the
    amortization of a regulatory liability related to the inclusion
    of certified PPAs in retail rates as ordered by the Georgia PSC
    under the terms of the 2004 Retail Rate Plan. This decrease was
    partially offset by a $15.9 million, or 3.2 percent,
    increase in depreciation expense in 2006 over 2005 due to an
    increase in plant in service. Depreciation and amortization
    increased $230 million, or 77.5 percent, in 2005 over
    2004 primarily due to the expiration at the end of 2004 of
    certain provisions of the 2001 Retail Rate Plan. In accordance
    with the 2001 Retail Rate Plan, the Company amortized an
    accelerated cost recovery liability as a credit to amortization
    expense and recognized new Georgia PSC-certified purchased power
    costs in rates evenly over the three years ended
    December 31, 2004. This treatment resulted in a credit to
    amortization expense of $187.1 million in 2004 and a total
    decrease in depreciation and amortization of $74 million in
    2004. See Note 3 to the financial statements under
    “Retail Regulatory Matters – Rate Plans” for
    additional information.

Taxes
    Other Than Income Taxes

Taxes other than income taxes increased $22.8 million, or
    8.3 percent, in 2006 primarily due to higher property taxes
    of $13.3 million as a result of an increase in property
    values and higher municipal gross receipts taxes of
    $9.1 million as a result of increased retail operating

Georgia Power Company 2006 Annual Report

revenues. Taxes other than income taxes increased
    $33 million, or 13.6 percent, in 2005 primarily due to
    higher municipal gross receipts taxes of $18.1 million
    resulting from increased retail operating revenues and higher
    property taxes of $14.0 million. Taxes other than income
    taxes increased $15.6 million, or 6.8 percent, in 2004
    primarily due to higher municipal gross receipts taxes
    associated with increased retail operating revenues.

Allowance
    For Equity Funds Used During Construction

Allowance for equity funds used during construction (AFUDC)
    remained relatively constant in 2006 and 2005 and increased
    $18.1 million in 2004, primarily due to the construction of
    the Plant McIntosh combined cycle units 10 and 11 which were
    placed in service in June 2005.

Interest
    Income

Interest income decreased $4.1 million in 2006 primarily
    due to interest on a favorable state tax settlement of
    $3.8 million in 2005. Interest income remained relatively
    constant in 2005. Interest income decreased $9 million in
    2004 when compared to the prior year primarily due to interest
    on a favorable income tax settlement of $14.5 million in
    2003.

Interest
    Expense

Interest expense increased $22.5 million, or
    9.5 percent, in 2006 primarily due to generally higher
    interest rates on variable rate debt and commercial paper, the
    issuance of additional senior notes during 2005, and higher
    average balances on short-term debt. Interest expense increased
    $40.6 million, or 15.9 percent, in 2005 from 2004
    primarily due to the issuance of additional senior notes in 2005
    and generally higher interest rates on variable rate debt and
    commercial paper. Variable rates on pollution control bonds are
    highly correlated with the Bond Market Association Municipal
    Swap Index, which averaged 2.5 percent in 2005 and
    1.2 percent in 2004. Variable rates on commercial paper and
    senior notes are highly correlated with the one-month London
    Interbank Offer Rate, which averaged 3.4 percent in 2005
    and 1.5 percent in 2004. Interest expense remained
    relatively constant in 2004. The Company refinanced or retired
    $324 million, $635 million, and $470 million of
    securities in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Interest
    capitalized increased in 2005 and 2004 due to the Plant McIntosh
    construction referenced above.

Other
    Income and (Expense), net

Other income and (expense), net increased $1.9 million, or
    26.7 percent, in 2006 primarily due to reduced expenses of
    $2.9 million and $5.0 million related to the employee
    stock ownership plan and charitable donations, respectively, and
    increased revenues of $3.6 million, $5.4 million, and
    $3.4 million related to a residential pricing program,
    customer contracting, and customer facilities charges,
    respectively. These increases were partially offset by net
    financial gains on gas hedges of $18.6 million in 2005.
    Other income and (expense), net increased $21.5 million in
    2005 from 2004 primarily due to $16.8 million of additional
    gas hedge gains. Other income and (expense), net decreased in
    2004 primarily due to a $15.5 million disallowance of Plant
    McIntosh construction costs in December 2004, partially offset
    by a $7.5 million decrease in donations and
    $3.4 million in increased income from a customer pricing
    program. See Note 3 to the financial statements under
    “Retail Regulatory Matters – Rate Plans” and
    “– Fuel Hedging Program” for additional
    information.

Effects
    of Inflation

The Company is subject to rate regulation that is based on the
    recovery of historical costs. When historical costs are
    included, or when inflation exceeds projected costs used in rate
    regulation, the effects of inflation can create an economic loss
    since the recovery of costs could be in dollars that have less
    purchasing power. In addition, income tax laws are based on
    historical costs. While the inflation rate has been relatively
    low in recent years, it continues to have an adverse effect on
    the Company because of the large investment in utility plant
    with long economic lives. Conventional accounting for historical
    cost does not recognize this economic loss nor the partially
    offsetting gain that arises through financing facilities with
    fixed-money obligations such as long-term debt, preferred stock,
    and preferred securities. Any recognition of inflation by
    regulatory authorities is reflected in the rate of return
    allowed in the Company’s approved electric rates.

FUTURE
    EARNINGS POTENTIAL

General

The Company operates as a vertically integrated utility
    providing electricity to retail customers within its traditional
    service territory located within the State of Georgia and to
    wholesale customers in the Southeast. Prices for electricity
    provided by the Company to retail customers are set by the
    Georgia PSC under cost-based regulatory principles. Prices for
    electricity relating to PPAs, interconnecting transmission
    lines, and the exchange of electric power are set by the FERC.

rates and revenues are reviewed and adjusted periodically with
    certain limitations. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES –
    “Application of Critical Accounting Policies and
    Estimates – Electric Utility Regulation” herein
    and Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail
    Regulatory Matters” and “FERC Matters” for
    additional information about regulatory matters.

The results of operations for the past three years are not
    necessarily indicative of future earnings potential. The level
    of the Company’s future earnings depends on numerous
    factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of
    the Company’s business of selling electricity. These
    factors include the ability of the Company to maintain a stable
    regulatory environment that continues to allow for the recovery
    of all prudently incurred costs during a time of increasing
    costs. Future earnings in the near term will depend, in part,
    upon growth in energy sales, which is subject to a number of
    factors. These factors include weather, competition, new energy
    contracts with neighboring utilities, energy conservation
    practiced by customers, the price of electricity, the price
    elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic growth in the
    Company’s service area. Assuming normal weather, retail
    sales growth is expected to be approximately 2.1 percent on
    average from 2007 to 2011.

Environmental
    Matters

Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other
    environmental regulations could affect earnings if such costs
    cannot be fully recovered in rates on a timely basis.
    Environmental compliance spending over the next several years
    may exceed amounts estimated. Some of the factors driving the
    potential for such an increase are higher commodity costs,
    market demand for labor, and scope additions and clarifications.
    The timing, specific requirements, and estimated costs could
    also change as environmental regulations are modified. See
    Note 3 to the financial statements under
    “Environmental Matters” for additional information.

New
    Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
    brought a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the
    Northern District of Georgia against certain Southern Company
    subsidiaries, including the Company and Alabama Power, alleging
    that these subsidiaries had violated the New Source Review (NSR)
    provisions of the Clean Air Act and related state laws at
    certain coal-fired generating facilities, including the
    Company’s Plants Bowen and Scherer. Through subsequent
    amendments and other legal procedures, the EPA filed a separate
    action in January 2001 against Alabama Power in the
    U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama
    after Alabama Power was dismissed from the original action. In
    these lawsuits, the EPA alleged that NSR violations occurred at
    eight coal-fired generating facilities operated by Alabama Power
    and the Company (including a facility formerly owned by Savannah
    Electric). The civil actions request penalties and injunctive
    relief, including an order requiring the installation of the
    best available control technology at the affected units.

On June 19, 2006, the U.S. District Court for the
    Northern District of Alabama entered a consent decree between
    Alabama Power and the EPA, resolving the alleged NSR violations
    at Plant Miller. The consent decree required Alabama Power to
    pay $100,000 to resolve the government’s claim for a civil
    penalty and to donate $4.9 million of sulfur dioxide
    emission allowances to a nonprofit charitable organization and
    formalized specific emissions reductions to be accomplished by
    Alabama Power, consistent with other Clean Air Act programs that
    require emissions reductions. On August 14, 2006, the
    district court in Alabama granted Alabama Power’s motion
    for summary judgment and entered final judgment in favor of
    Alabama Power on the EPA’s claims related to Plants Barry,
    Gaston, Gorgas, and Greene County. The plaintiffs have appealed
    this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
    Circuit and on November 14, 2006, the Eleventh Circuit
    granted plaintiffs’ request to stay the appeal, pending the
    U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in a similar NSR case
    filed by the EPA against Duke Energy. The action against the
    Company has been administratively closed since the spring of
    2001, and none of the parties has sought to reopen the case.

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and
    the EPA regulations and interpretations in effect at the time
    the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act authorizes
    maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $32,500 per day, per
    violation at each generating unit, depending on the date of the
    alleged violation. An adverse outcome in this matter could
    require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be
    determined at this time and could possibly require payment of
    substantial penalties. Such expenditures could affect future
    results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition if
    such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

The EPA has issued a series of proposed and final revisions to
    its NSR regulations under the Clean Air Act, many of which have
    been subject to legal challenges by environmental groups and
    states. On June 24, 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals
    for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld, in part, the
    EPA’s revisions to NSR

II-146

regulations that were issued in December 2002 but vacated
    portions of those revisions addressing the exclusion of certain
    pollution control projects. These regulatory revisions have been
    adopted by the State of Georgia. On March 17, 2006, the
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
    also vacated an EPA rule which sought to clarify the scope of
    the existing Routine Maintenance, Repair, and Replacement
    exclusion. In October 2005 and September 2006, the EPA also
    published proposed rules clarifying the test for determining
    when an emissions increase subject to the NSR permitting
    requirements has occurred. The impact of these proposed rules
    will depend on adoption of the final rules by the EPA and the
    State of Georgia’s implementation of such rules, as well as
    the outcome of any additional legal challenges, and, therefore,
    cannot be determined at this time.

Carbon
    Dioxide Litigation

In July 2004, attorneys general from eight states, each outside
    of Southern Company’s service territory, and the
    corporation counsel for New York City filed a complaint in the
    U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York
    against Southern Company and four other electric power
    companies. A nearly identical complaint was filed by three
    environmental groups in the same court. The complaints allege
    that the companies’ emissions of carbon dioxide, a
    greenhouse gas, contribute to global warming, which the
    plaintiffs assert is a public nuisance. Under common law public
    and private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs seek a judicial
    order (1) holding each defendant jointly and severally
    liable for creating, contributing to,

and/or

maintaining global warming and (2) requiring each of the
    defendants to cap its emissions of carbon dioxide and then
    reduce those emissions by a specified percentage each year for
    at least a decade. Plaintiffs have not, however, requested that
    damages be awarded in connection with their claims. Southern
    Company believes these claims are without merit and notes that
    the complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis for the
    claims. In September 2005, the U.S. District Court for the
    Southern District of New York granted Southern Company’s
    and the other defendants’ motions to dismiss these cases.
    The plaintiffs filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals
    for the Second Circuit in October 2005. The ultimate outcome of
    these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Plant
    Wansley Environmental Litigation

In December 2002, the Sierra Club, Physicians for Social
    Responsibility, Georgia Forestwatch, and one individual filed a
    civil suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
    District of Georgia against the Company for alleged violations
    of the Clean Air Act at four of the units at Plant Wansley. The
    civil action requested injunctive and declaratory relief, civil
    penalties, a supplemental environmental project, and
    attorneys’ fees. In January 2007, following the March 2006
    reversal and remand by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
    Eleventh Circuit, the district court ruled for the Company on
    all remaining allegations in this case. The only issue remaining
    for resolution by the district court is the appropriate remedy
    for two isolated, short-term, technical violations of the
    plant’s Clean Air Act operating permit. The court has asked
    the parties to submit a joint proposed remedy or individual
    proposals in the event the parties cannot agree. Although the
    ultimate outcome of this matter cannot currently be determined,
    the resulting liability associated with the two events is not
    expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
    financial statements.

Environmental
    Statutes and Regulations

General

The Company’s operations are subject to extensive
    regulation by state and federal environmental agencies under a
    variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental
    media, including air, water, and land resources. Applicable
    statutes include the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the
    Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
    Liability Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the
    Toxic Substances Control Act; the Emergency Planning &
    Community

Right-to-Know

Act; and the Endangered Species Act. Compliance with these
    environmental requirements involves significant capital and
    operating costs, a major portion of which is expected to be
    recovered through existing ratemaking provisions. Through 2006,
    the Company had invested approximately $1.5 billion in
    capital projects to comply with these requirements, with annual
    totals of $351 million, $117 million, and
    $47 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The
    Company expects that capital expenditures to assure compliance
    with existing and new regulations will be an additional
    $955 million, $637 million, and $316 million for
    2007, 2008, and 2009, respectively. Because the Company’s
    compliance strategy is impacted by changes to existing
    environmental laws and regulations, the cost, availability, and
    existing inventory of emission allowances, and the
    Company’s fuel mix, the ultimate outcome cannot be
    determined at this time. Environmental costs that are known and
    estimable at this time are included in capital expenditures
    discussed under FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY –
    “Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations”
    herein.

    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

(continued)

Georgia Power Company 2006 Annual Report

Compliance with possible additional federal or state legislation
    or regulations related to global climate change, air quality, or
    other environmental and health concerns could also significantly
    affect the Company. New environmental legislation or
    regulations, or changes to existing statutes or regulations,
    could affect many areas of the Company’s operations;
    however, the full impact of any such changes cannot be
    determined at this time.

Air
    Quality

Compliance with the Clean Air Act and resulting regulations has
    been and will continue to be a significant focus for the
    Company. Through 2006, the Company had spent approximately
    $1.3 billion in reducing sulfur dioxide
    (SO


)
    and nitrogen oxide
    (NO

x

)
    emissions and in monitoring emissions pursuant to the Clean Air
    Act. Additional controls have been announced and are currently
    being installed at several plants to further reduce
    SO


,
    NO

x

,
    and mercury emissions, maintain compliance with existing
    regulations, and meet new requirements.

Approximately $700 million of the expenditures related to
    reducing
    NO

x

emissions pursuant to state and federal requirements were in
    connection with the EPA’s

one-hour

ozone air quality standard and the 1998 regional
    NO

x

reduction rules.

In 2005, the EPA revoked the

one-hour

ozone air quality standard and published the second of two sets
    of final rules for implementation of the new, more stringent

eight-hour

ozone standard. Areas within the Company’s service area
    that were designated as nonattainment under the

eight-hour

ozone standard include Macon and a

20-county

area within metropolitan Atlanta. Macon is in the process of
    seeking redesignation by the EPA as an attainment area and is
    preparing a maintenance plan for approval. On December 22,
    2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
    Columbia Circuit vacated the first set of implementation rules
    adopted in 2004 and remanded the rules to the EPA for further
    refinement. The impact of this decision, if any, cannot be
    determined at this time and will depend on subsequent legal
    action

and/or

rulemaking activity. State implementation plans, including new
    emission control regulations necessary to bring ozone
    nonattainment areas into attainment, are currently required for
    Georgia by June 2007. These state implementation plans could
    require further reductions in
    NO

x

emissions from power plants.

During 2005, the EPA’s fine particulate matter
    nonattainment designations became effective for several areas
    within the Company’s service area and the EPA proposed a
    rule for the implementation of the fine particulate matter
    standard. The EPA is expected to publish its final rule for
    implementation of the existing fine particulate matter standard
    in early 2007. State plans for addressing the nonattainment
    designations under the existing standard are required by April
    2008 and could require further reductions in
    SO


and
    NO

x

emissions from power plants. On September 21, 2006, the EPA
    published a final rule lowering the

24-hour

fine
    particulate matter air quality standard even further and plans
    to designate nonattainment areas based on the new standard by
    December 2009. The final outcome of this matter cannot be
    determined at this time.

The EPA issued the final Clean Air Interstate Rule in March
    2005. This

cap-and-trade

rule addresses power plant
    SO


and
    NO

x

emissions that were found to contribute to nonattainment of the

eight-hour

ozone and fine particulate matter standards in downwind states.
    Twenty-eight eastern states, including the State of Georgia, are
    subject to the requirements of the rule. The rule calls for
    additional reductions of
    NO

x

and/or

SO


to be achieved in two phases, 2009/2010 and 2015. These
    reductions will be accomplished by the installation of
    additional emission controls at the Company’s coal-fired
    facilities or by the purchase of emission allowances from a

cap-and-trade

program.

The Clean Air Visibility Rule (formerly called the Regional Haze
    Rule) was finalized in July 2005. The goal of this rule is to
    restore natural visibility conditions in certain areas
    (primarily national parks and wilderness areas) by 2064. The
    rule involves (1) the application of Best Available
    Retrofit Technology (BART) to certain sources built between 1962
    and 1977 and (2) the application of any additional
    emissions reductions which may be deemed necessary for each
    designated area to achieve reasonable progress toward the
    natural conditions goal by 2018. Thereafter, for each

10-year

planning period, additional emissions reductions will be
    required to continue to demonstrate reasonable progress in each
    area during that period. For power plants, the Clean Air
    Visibility Rule allows states to determine that the Clean Air
    Interstate Rule satisfies BART requirements for
    SO


and
    NO

x

.
    However, additional BART requirements for particulate matter
    could be imposed and the reasonable progress provisions could
    result in requirements for additional
    SO


controls. By December 17, 2007, states must submit
    implementation plans that contain strategies for BART and any
    other control measures required to achieve the first phase of
    reasonable progress.

In March 2005, the EPA published the final Clean Air Mercury
    Rule, a

cap-and-trade

program for the reduction of mercury emissions from coal-fired
    power plants. The rule sets caps on mercury emissions to be
    implemented in two phases, 2010 and 2018, and provides

II-148


MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Georgia Power Company 2006 Annual Report

for an emission allowance trading market. The Company
    anticipates that emission controls installed to achieve
    compliance with the Clean Air Interstate Rule and the

eight-hour

ozone and fine-particulate air quality standards will also
    result in mercury emission reductions. However, the long-term
    capability of emission control equipment to reduce mercury
    emissions is still being evaluated, and the installation of
    additional control technologies may be required.

The impacts of the

eight-hour

ozone and the fine particulate matter nonattainment
    designations, the Clean Air Interstate Rule, the Clean Air
    Visibility Rule, and the Clean Air Mercury Rule on the Company
    will depend on the development and implementation of rules at
    the state level. States implementing the Clean Air Mercury Rule
    and the Clean Air Interstate Rule, in particular, have the
    option not to participate in the national

cap-and-trade

programs and could require reductions greater than those
    mandated by the federal rules. Impacts will also depend on
    resolution of pending legal challenges to these rules.
    Therefore, the full effects of these regulations on the Company
    cannot be determined at this time. The Company has developed and
    continually updates a comprehensive environmental compliance
    strategy to comply with the continuing and new environmental
    requirements discussed above. As part of this strategy, the
    Company plans to install additional
    SO


,
    NO

x

,
    and mercury emission controls within the next several years to
    assure continued compliance with applicable air quality
    requirements.

Water
    Quality

In July 2004, the EPA published its final technology- based
    regulations under the Clean Water Act for the purpose of
    reducing impingement and entrainment of fish, shellfish, and
    other forms of aquatic life at existing power plant cooling
    water intake structures. The rules require baseline biological
    information and, perhaps, installation of fish protection
    technology near some intake structures at existing power plants.
    On January 25, 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
    Second Circuit overturned and remanded several provisions of the
    rule to the EPA for revisions. Among other things, the court
    rejected the EPA’s use of “cost-benefit” analysis
    and suggested some ways to incorporate cost considerations. The
    full impact of these regulations will depend on subsequent legal
    proceedings, further rulemaking by the EPA, results of studies
    and analyses performed as part of the rules’
    implementation, and the actual requirements established by the
    State of Georgia and therefore, cannot now be determined.

The Company is retrofitting a closed-loop recirculating cooling
    tower at one facility under the Clean Water Act to cool water
    prior to discharge and is considering undertaking similar work
    at an additional facility. The total estimated capital cost for
    this project is $96 million.

Environmental
    Remediation

The Company must comply with other environmental laws and
    regulations that cover the handling and disposal of waste and
    release of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and
    regulations, the Company could incur substantial costs to clean
    up properties. The Company conducts studies to determine the
    extent of any required cleanup and has recognized in its
    financial statements the costs to clean up known sites. Amounts
    for cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs were not material for
    any year presented. The Company may be liable for some or all
    required cleanup costs for additional sites that may require
    environmental remediation. See Note 3 to the financial
    statements under “Environmental Matters –
    Environmental Remediation” for additional information.

Global
    Climate Issues

Domestic efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions have been
    spurred by international negotiations under the Framework
    Convention on Climate Change and specifically the Kyoto
    Protocol, which proposes a binding limitation on the emissions
    of greenhouse gases for industrialized countries. The Bush
    Administration has not supported U.S. ratification of the
    Kyoto Protocol or other mandatory carbon dioxide reduction
    legislation; however, in 2002, it did announce a goal to reduce
    the greenhouse gas intensity of the U.S. economy, the ratio
    of greenhouse gas emissions to the value of U.S. economic
    output, by 18 percent by 2012. Southern Company is
    participating in the voluntary electric utility sector climate
    change initiative, known as Power Partners, under the Bush
    Administration’s Climate VISION program. The utility sector
    pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions rate by
    3 percent to 5 percent by 2010-2012. Southern Company
    continues to evaluate future energy and emission profiles
    relative to the Power Partners program and is participating in
    voluntary programs to support the industry initiative. In
    addition, Southern Company is participating in the Bush
    Administration’s Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean
    Development and Climate, a public/private partnership to work
    together to meet goals for energy security, national air
    pollution reduction, and climate change in ways that promote
    sustainable

II-149

Georgia Power Company 2006 Annual Report

economic growth and poverty reduction. Legislative proposals
    that would impose mandatory restrictions on carbon dioxide
    emissions continue to be considered in Congress. The ultimate
    outcome cannot be determined at this time; however, mandatory
    restrictions on the Company’s carbon dioxide emissions
    could result in significant additional compliance costs that
    could affect future results of operations, cash flows, and
    financial condition if such costs are not recovered through
    regulated rates.

FERC
    Matters

Market-Based
    Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to
    non-affiliates, including short-term opportunity sales, at
    market-based prices. Specific FERC approval must be obtained
    with respect to a market-based contract with an affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess
    Southern Company’s generation dominance within its retail
    service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in
    other markets is not an issue in that proceeding. Any new
    market-based rate sales by the Company in Southern
    Company’s retail service territory entered into during a

15-month

refund period beginning February 27, 2005 could be subject
    to refund to the level of the default cost-based rates, pending
    the outcome of the proceeding. Such sales through May 27,
    2006, the end of the refund period, were approximately
    $5.8 million for the Company. In the event that the
    FERC’s default mitigation measures for entities that are
    found to have market power are ultimately applied, the Company
    may be required to charge cost-based rates for certain wholesale
    sales in the Southern Company retail service territory, which
    may be lower than negotiated market-based rates. The final
    outcome of this matter will depend on the form in which the
    final methodology for assessing generation market power and
    mitigation rules may be ultimately adopted and cannot be
    determined at this time.

In addition, in May 2005, the FERC started an investigation to
    determine whether Southern Company satisfies the other three
    parts of the FERC’s market-based rate analysis:
    transmission market power, barriers to entry, and affiliate
    abuse or reciprocal dealing. The FERC established a new

15-month

refund period related to this expanded investigation. Any new
    market-based rate sales involving any Southern Company
    subsidiary, including the Company, could be subject to refund to
    the extent the FERC orders lower rates as a result of this new
    investigation. Such sales through October 19, 2006, the end
    of the refund period, were approximately $18.8 million for
    the Company, of which $3.9 million relates to sales inside
    the retail service territory discussed above. The FERC also
    directed that this expanded proceeding be held in abeyance
    pending the outcome of the proceeding on the IIC discussed
    below. On January 3, 2007, the FERC issued an order noting
    settlement of the IIC proceeding and seeking comment
    identifying any remaining issues and the proper procedure for
    addressing any such issues.

The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for
    these proceedings and is vigorously defending itself in this
    matter. However, the final outcome of this matter, including any
    remedies to be applied in the event of an adverse ruling in
    these proceedings, cannot now be determined.

Intercompany
    Interchange Contract

The Company’s generation fleet is operated under
    the IIC, as approved by the FERC. In May 2005, the FERC
    initiated a new proceeding to examine (1) the provisions of
    the IIC among Alabama Power, the Company, Gulf Power,
    Mississippi Power, Savannah Electric, Southern Power, and
    Southern Company Services, Inc. (SCS), as agent, under the terms
    of which the power pool of Southern Company is operated, and, in
    particular, the propriety of the continued inclusion of Southern
    Power as a party to the IIC, (2) whether any parties
    to the IIC have violated the FERC’s standards of
    conduct applicable to utility companies that are transmission
    providers, and (3) whether Southern Company’s code of
    conduct defining Southern Power as a “system company”
    rather than a “marketing affiliate” is just and
    reasonable. In connection with the formation of Southern Power,
    the FERC authorized Southern Power’s inclusion in
    the IIC proceeding in 2000. The FERC also previously
    approved Southern Company’s code of conduct.

On October 5, 2006, the FERC issued an order accepting a
    settlement resolving the proceeding subject to Southern
    Company’s agreement to accept certain modifications to the
    settlement’s terms. On October 20, 2006, Southern
    Company notified the FERC that it accepted the modifications.
    The modifications largely involve functional separation and
    information restrictions related to marketing activities
    conducted on behalf of Southern Power. Southern Company filed
    with the FERC on November 6, 2006 an implementation plan to
    comply with the modifications set forth in the order. The impact
    of the modifications is not expected to have a material impact
    on the Company’s financial statements.

Georgia Power Company 2006 Annual Report

Generation
    Interconnection Agreements

In July 2003, the FERC issued its final rule on the
    standardization of generation interconnection agreements and
    procedures (Order 2003). Order 2003 shifts much of the financial
    burden of new transmission investment from the generator to the
    transmission provider. The FERC has indicated that Order 2003,
    which was effective January 20, 2004, is to be applied
    prospectively to new generating facilities interconnecting to a
    transmission system. Order 2003 was affirmed by the U.S. Court
    of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on
    January 12, 2007. The cost impact resulting from Order 2003
    will vary on a

case-by-case

basis for each new generator interconnecting to the transmission
    system.

On November 22, 2004, generator company subsidiaries of
    Tenaska, Inc. (Tenaska), as counterparties to three previously
    executed interconnection agreements with subsidiaries of
    Southern Company, including the Company, filed complaints at the
    FERC requesting that the FERC modify the agreements and that the
    Company refund a total of $7.9 million previously paid for
    interconnection facilities, with interest. Southern Company has
    also received requests for similar modifications from other
    entities, though no other complaints are pending with the FERC.
    On January 19, 2007, the FERC issued an order granting
    Tenaska’s requested relief. Although the FERC’s order
    requires the modification of Tenaska’s interconnection
    agreements, the order reduces the amount of the refund that had
    been requested by Tenaska. As a result, the Company estimates
    indicate that no refund is due Tenaska. Southern Company has
    requested rehearing of the FERC’s order. The final outcome
    of this matter cannot now be determined.

Transmission

In December 1999, the FERC issued its final rule on Regional
    Transmission Organizations (RTOs). Since that time, there have
    been a number of additional proceedings at the FERC designed to
    encourage further voluntary formation of RTOs or to mandate
    their formation. However, at the current time, there are no
    active proceedings that would require the Company to participate
    in an RTO. Current FERC efforts that may potentially change the
    regulatory

and/or

operational structure of transmission include rules related to
    the standardization of generation interconnection, as well as an
    inquiry into, among other things, market power by vertically
    integrated utilities. See “Market-Based Rate
    Authority” and “Generation Interconnection
    Agreements” above for additional information. The final
    outcome of these proceedings cannot now be determined. However,
    the Company’s financial condition, results of operations,
    and cash flows could be adversely affected by future changes in
    the federal regulatory or operational structure of transmission.

PSC
    Matters

Merger

Effective July 1, 2006, Savannah Electric was merged into
    the Company. Prior to the merger, Southern Company was the sole
    common shareholder of both the Company and Savannah Electric. At
    the time of the merger, each outstanding share of Savannah
    Electric common stock was cancelled and Southern Company was
    issued an additional 1,500,000 shares of the Company’s
    common stock, no par value per share. In addition, at the time
    of the merger, each outstanding share of Savannah
    Electric’s preferred stock was cancelled and converted into
    the right to receive one share of the Company’s


/


percent
    Series Class A Preferred Stock, Non-Cumulative, Par
    Value $25 Per Share, resulting in the issuance by the Company of
    1,800,000 shares of such Class A Preferred Stock in
    July 2006. Following completion of the merger, the outstanding
    capital stock of the Company consists of 9,261,500 shares
    of common stock, all of which are held by Southern Company, and
    1,800,000 shares of Class A Preferred Stock.

With respect to the merger, the Georgia PSC voted on
    June 15, 2006 to set a Merger Transition Adjustment (MTA)
    applicable to customers in the former Savannah Electric service
    territory so that the fuel rate that became effective on
    July 1, 2006 plus the MTA equals the applicable fuel rate
    paid by such customers as of June 30, 2006. See “Fuel
    Cost Recovery” herein for additional information. Amounts
    collected under the MTA are being credited to customers in the
    original Georgia Power service territory through a Merger
    Transition Credit (MTC). The MTA and the MTC will be in effect
    until December 31, 2007, when the Company’s base rates
    are scheduled to be adjusted.

Rate
    Plans

In December 2004, the Georgia PSC approved the 2004 Retail Rate
    Plan. Under the terms of the 2004 Retail Rate Plan, earnings are
    being evaluated annually against a retail return on common
    equity (ROE) range of 10.25 percent to 12.25 percent.
    Two-thirds of any earnings above 12.25 percent are applied
    to rate refunds, with the remaining one-third retained by the
    Company. Retail rates increased by approximately
    $194 million and customer fees increased by approximately
    $9 million effective January 1, 2005 to cover the
    higher costs of

purchased power; operations and maintenance expenses;
    environmental compliance; and continued investment in new
    generation, transmission and distribution facilities to support
    growth and ensure reliability. In 2007, the Company will refund
    2005 earnings above 12.25 percent retail ROE. No refund is
    anticipated for 2006.

The Company is required to file a general rate case by
    July 1, 2007, in response to which the Georgia PSC would be
    expected to determine whether the 2004 Retail Rate Plan should
    be continued, modified, or discontinued. See Note 3 to the
    financial statements under “Retail Regulatory
    Matters – Rate Plans” for additional information.

Fuel
    Cost Recovery

The Company has established fuel cost recovery rates approved by
    the Georgia PSC. In March 2006, the Company and Savannah
    Electric filed a combined request for fuel cost recovery rate
    changes with the Georgia PSC to be effective July 1, 2006,
    concurrent with the merger of the companies. On June 15,
    2006, the Georgia PSC ruled on the request and approved an
    increase in the Company’s total annual billings of
    approximately $400 million. The Georgia PSC order provided
    for a combined ongoing fuel forecast but reduced the requested
    increase related to such forecast by $200 million. The
    order also required the Company to file for a new fuel cost
    recovery rate on a semi-annual basis, beginning in September
    2006. Accordingly, on September 15, 2006, the Company filed
    a request to recover fuel costs incurred through August 2006 by
    increasing the fuel cost recovery rate. On November 13,
    2006, under agreement with the Georgia PSC staff, the Company
    filed a supplementary request reflecting a forecast of annual
    fuel costs, as well as updated information for previously
    incurred fuel costs.

On February 6, 2007, the Georgia PSC approved an increase
    in the Company’s total annual billings of approximately
    $383 million. The order reduced the Company’s
    requested increase in the forecast of annual fuel costs by
    $40 million and disallowed $4 million of previously
    incurred fuel costs. The order also requires the Company to file
    for a new fuel cost recovery rate no later than March 1,
    2008. The new rates will become effective on March 1, 2007.
    Estimated under recovered fuel costs through February 2007 are
    to be recovered through May 2009 for customers in the original
    Georgia Power territory and through November 2009 for customers
    in the former Savannah Electric territory. As of
    December 31, 2006, the Company had an under recovered fuel
    balance of approximately $898 million, of which
    approximately $544 million is included in deferred charges
    and other assets in the balance sheets.

Fuel cost recovery revenues as recorded on the financial
    statements are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable
    costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates.
    Accordingly, a change in the billing factor has no significant
    effect on the Company’s revenues or net income, but does
    impact annual cash flow. In accordance with Georgia PSC order, a
    portion of the under recovered regulatory clause revenues for
    the Company is included in deferred charges and other assets in
    the balance sheets. See Note 1 to the financial statements
    under “Revenues” and Note 3 to the financial
    statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters” for
    additional information.

Nuclear

On August 15, 2006, as part of a potential expansion of
    Plant Vogtle, the Company and Southern Nuclear Operating
    Company, Inc. (SNC) filed an application with the Nuclear
    Regulatory Commission (NRC) for an early site permit (ESP) on
    behalf of the owners of Plant Vogtle. In addition, the Company
    and SNC notified the NRC of their intent to apply for a combined
    construction and operating license (COL) in 2008. Ownership
    agreements have been signed with each of the existing Plant
    Vogtle co-owners. See Note 4 to the financial statements
    for additional information on these co-owners. In June 2006, the
    Georgia PSC approved the Company’s request to establish an
    accounting order that would allow the Company to defer for
    future recovery the ESP and COL costs, of which the
    Company’s portion is estimated to total approximately
    $51 million over the next four years. At this point, no
    final decision has been made regarding actual construction. Any
    new generation resource must be certified by the Georgia PSC in
    a separate proceeding.

Other
    Matters

The Company is involved in various other matters being
    litigated, regulatory matters, and certain tax-related issues
    that could affect future earnings. See Note 3 to the
    financial statements for information regarding material issues.

ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES

Application
    of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
    Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to
    the financial statements. In the application of these policies,
    certain estimates are made that may have a material impact on
    the Company’s results of operations and related
    disclosures. Different

II-152


MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Georgia Power Company 2006 Annual Report

assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are
    significantly different from those recorded in the financial
    statements. Senior management has reviewed and discussed the
    following critical accounting policies and estimates with the
    Audit Committee of Southern Company’s Board of Directors.

Electric
    Utility Regulation

The Company is subject to retail regulation by the Georgia PSC
    and wholesale regulation by the FERC. These regulatory agencies
    set the rates the Company is permitted to charge customers based
    on allowable costs. As a result, the Company applies FASB
    Statement No. 71, “Accounting for the Effects of
    Certain Types of Regulation” (SFAS No. 71), which
    requires the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate
    regulation. Through the ratemaking process, the regulators may
    require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different
    than when they would be recognized by a non-regulated company.
    This treatment may result in the deferral of expenses and the
    recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated
    future recovery through rates or the deferral of gains or
    creation of liabilities and the recording of related regulatory
    liabilities. The application of SFAS No. 71 has a
    further effect on the Company’s financial statements as a
    result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the
    ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from those
    actually incurred by the Company; therefore, the accounting
    estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation,
    nuclear decommissioning, and pension and postretirement benefits
    have less of a direct impact on the Company’s results of
    operations than they would on a non-regulated company.

As reflected in Note 1 to the financial statements
    significant regulatory assets and liabilities have been
    recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of
    these regulatory assets and liabilities based on applicable
    regulatory guidelines and accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States. However, adverse legislative,
    judicial, or regulatory actions could materially impact the
    amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could
    adversely impact the Company’s financial statements.

Contingent
    Obligations

The Company is subject to a number of federal and state laws and
    regulations, as well as other factors and conditions that
    potentially subject it to environmental, litigation, income tax,
    and other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and
    Note 3 to the financial statements for more information
    regarding certain of these contingencies. The Company
    periodically evaluates its exposure to such risks and records
    reserves for those matters where a loss is considered probable
    and reasonably estimable in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles. The adequacy of reserves can be
    significantly affected by external events or conditions that can
    be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters
    could materially affect the Company’s financial statements.
    These events or conditions include the following:

•

Changes in existing state or federal regulation by governmental
    authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality,
    control of toxic substances, hazardous and solid wastes, and
    other environmental matters.

•

Changes in existing income tax regulations or changes in
    Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or Georgia Department of Revenue
    interpretations of existing regulations.

•

Identification of additional sites that require environmental
    remediation or the filing of other complaints in which the
    Company may be asserted to be a potentially responsible party.

•

Identification and evaluation of other potential lawsuits or
    complaints in which the Company may be named as a defendant.

•

Resolution or progression of existing matters through the
    legislative process, the court systems, the IRS, or the EPA.

Unbilled
    Revenues

Revenues related to the sale of electricity are recorded when
    electricity is delivered to customers. However, the
    determination of KWH sales to individual customers is based on
    the reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic
    basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of
    electricity delivered to customers, but not yet metered and
    billed, are estimated. Components of the unbilled revenue
    estimates include total KWH territorial supply, total KWH
    billed, estimated total electricity lost in delivery, and
    customer usage. These components can fluctuate as a result of a
    number of factors including weather, generation patterns, power
    delivery volume, and other operational constraints. These
    factors can be unpredictable and can vary from historical
    trends. As a result, the overall estimate of unbilled revenues
    could be significantly affected, which could have a material
    impact on the Company’s results of operations.

Georgia Power Company 2006 Annual Report

New
    Accounting Standards

Stock
    Options

On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted FASB Statement
    No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment”
    (SFAS No. 123(R)), using the modified prospective
    method. As a result, compensation cost relating to share-based
    payment transactions must now be recognized in the
    Company’s financial statements. That cost is measured based
    on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability
    instruments issued. Although the compensation expense required
    under the revised statement differs slightly, the impacts on the
    Company’s financial statements are similar to the pro forma
    disclosures included in Note 1 to the financial statements
    under “Stock Options.”

Pensions
    and Other Postretirement Plans

On December 31, 2006, the Company adopted FASB Statement
    No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined
    Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans”
    (SFAS No. 158), which requires recognition of the
    funded status of its defined benefit postretirement plans in its
    balance sheet. With the adoption of SFAS No. 158, the
    Company recorded an additional prepaid pension asset of
    $218 million with respect to its overfunded defined benefit
    plan and additional liabilities and deferred credits of
    $13 million and $255 million, respectively, related to
    its underfunded non-qualified pension plans and retiree benefit
    plans. Additionally, SFAS No. 158 will require the
    Company to change the measurement date for its defined benefit
    postretirement plan assets and obligations from
    September 30 to December 31 beginning with the year
    ending December 31, 2008. See Note 2 to the financial
    statements for additional information.

Guidance
    on Considering the Materiality of Misstatements

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
    issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,
    “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when
    Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
    Statements” (SAB 108). SAB 108 addresses how the
    effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be
    considered when quantifying misstatements in current year
    financial statements. SAB 108 requires companies to
    quantify misstatements using both a balance sheet and an income
    statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach
    results in quantifying an error that is material in light of
    relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. When the effect
    of initial adoption is material, companies will record the
    effect as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year
    retained earnings. The provisions of SAB 108 were effective
    for the Company for the year ended December 31, 2006. The
    adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s financial statements.

Income
    Taxes

In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”
    (FIN 48). This interpretation requires that tax benefits
    must be “more likely than not” of being sustained in
    order to be recognized. The Company adopted FIN 48
    effective January 1, 2007 with no material impact on the
    Company’s financial statements.

Fair
    Value Measurement

The FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157, “Fair Value
    Measurements” (SFAS No. 157) in September
    2006. SFAS No. 157 provides guidance on how to measure
    fair value where it is permitted or required under other
    accounting pronouncements. SFAS No. 157 also requires
    additional disclosures about fair value measurements. The
    Company plans to adopt SFAS No. 157 on January 1,
    2008 and is currently assessing its impact.

Fair
    Value Option

In February 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 159,
    “Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115” (SFAS No. 159). This standard
    permits an entity to choose to measure many financial
    instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company
    plans to adopt SFAS No. 159 on January 1, 2008
    and is currently assessing its impact.

FINANCIAL
    CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

The Company’s financial condition remained stable at
    December 31, 2006. Cash flow from operations increased
    $117 million in 2006, resulting primarily from increased
    retail operating revenues partially offset by higher fuel
    inventories and an increase in under recovered deferred fuel
    costs. In 2005, cash flow from operations increased
    $58 million resulting primarily from increased retail
    operating revenues, partially offset by the increase in under
    recovered deferred fuel costs. In 2004, cash flow from
    operations decreased $246 million resulting primarily from
    the increase in under recovered deferred fuel costs.

II-154


MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

(continued)

Georgia Power Company 2006 Annual Report

In 2006, gross property additions were $1.2 billion. These
    additions were primarily related to transmission and
    distribution facilities, nuclear fuel, and equipment to comply
    with environmental standards. The majority of funds needed for
    gross property additions for the last several years have been
    provided from operating activities and capital contributions
    from Southern Company and the issuance of short-term debt. The
    statements of cash flows provide additional details.

The Company’s ratio of common equity to total
    capitalization – including short-term debt –
    was 48.6 percent in 2006, 47.9 percent in 2005, and
    47.5 percent in 2004. The Company has received investment
    grade ratings from the major rating agencies with respect to
    debt, preferred securities, and preferred stock.

Sources
    of Capital

The Company plans to obtain the funds required for construction
    and other purposes from sources similar to those used in the
    past, which were primarily from operating cash flows. However,
    the type and timing of any future financings, if needed, will
    depend on market conditions, regulatory approvals, and other
    factors.

The issuance of long-term securities by the Company is subject
    to the approval of the Georgia PSC. In addition, the issuance of
    short-term debt securities by the Company is subject to
    regulatory approval by the FERC. Additionally, with respect to
    the public offering of securities, the Company files
    registration statements with the SEC under the Securities Act of
    1933, as amended (1933 Act). The amounts of securities
    authorized by the Georgia PSC, as well as the amounts, if any,
    registered under the 1933 Act, are continuously monitored
    and appropriate filings are made to ensure flexibility in the
    capital markets.

The Company obtains financing separately without credit support
    from any affiliate. See Note 6 to the financial statements
    under “Bank Credit Arrangements” for additional
    information. The Southern Company system does not maintain a
    centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of the Company
    are not commingled with funds of any other company.

The Company’s current liabilities frequently exceed current
    assets because of the continued use of short-term debt as a
    funding source for under recovered fuel costs and to meet cash
    needs which can fluctuate significantly due to the seasonality
    of the business.

To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the Company had
    credit arrangements with banks totaling $910 million, of
    which $904 million was unused, at the beginning of 2007.
    See Note 6 to the financial statements under “Bank
    Credit Arrangements” for additional information.

At the beginning of 2007, bank credit arrangements were as
    follows:

Expires

Total

Unused




(in millions)

$910

$904

$40

$–

$870

The credit arrangements that expire in 2007 allow for the
    execution of term loans for an additional two-year period.

The Company may also meet short-term cash needs through a
    Southern Company subsidiary organized to issue and sell
    commercial paper and extendible commercial notes at the request
    and for the benefit of the Company and the other traditional
    operating companies. Proceeds from such issuances for the
    benefit of the Company are loaned directly to the Company and
    are not commingled with proceeds from issuances for the benefits
    of any other operating company. The obligations of each company
    under these arrangements are several; there is no cross
    affiliate credit support. As of December 31, 2006, the
    Company had outstanding $733 million of commercial paper
    and no extendible commercial notes.

Financing
    Activities

During 2006, the Company issued $150 million of senior
    notes and incurred $154 million of obligations related to
    the issuance of pollution control bonds. The issuances were used
    to reduce the Company’s short-term indebtedness and refund
    $154 million of higher interest rate obligations related to
    pollution control bonds, respectively. In addition,
    $20 million of first mortgage bonds matured.

Credit
    Rating Risk

The Company does not have any credit arrangements that would
    require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as
    a result of a credit rating downgrade. There are certain
    contracts that could require collateral, but not accelerated
    payment, in the event of a credit rating change to BBB- or Baa3
    or below. Generally, collateral may be provided for by a
    Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. These
    contracts are primarily for physical electricity purchases and
    sales. At December 31, 2006, the maximum potential
    collateral requirements at a BBB- or Baa3 rating were
    approximately $7.8 million. The maximum potential

II-155


MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

(continued)

Georgia Power Company 2006 Annual Report

collateral requirements at a rating below BBB- or Baa3 were
    approximately $250 million.

The Company is also party to certain derivative agreements that
    could require collateral

and/or

accelerated payment in the event of a credit rating change to
    below investment grade for the Company and/or Alabama Power.
    These agreements are primarily for natural gas and power price
    risk management activities. At December 31, 2006, the
    Company’s exposure related to these agreements was
    approximately $27.4 million.

Market
    Price Risk

Due to cost-based rate regulation, the Company has limited
    exposure to market rate volatility in interest rates, commodity
    fuel prices, and prices of electricity. To manage the volatility
    attributable to these exposures, the Company nets the exposures
    to take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various
    derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to
    the Company’s policies in areas such as counterparty
    exposure and hedging practices. The Company’s policy is
    that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes
    and mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management
    policies. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques
    including, but not limited to, market valuation, value at risk,
    stress tests, and sensitivity analysis.

To mitigate future exposure to changes in interest rates, the
    Company has entered into forward starting interest rate swaps
    that have been designated as hedges. These swaps have a notional
    amount of $525 million and are related to anticipated debt
    issuances over the next two years. Subsequent to
    December 31, 2006, the Company entered into hedges totaling
    $375 million, also related to anticipated debt issuances
    over the next two years. The weighted average interest rate on
    outstanding variable long-term debt that has not been hedged at
    January 1, 2007 was 4.6 percent. If the Company
    sustained a 100 basis point change in interest rates for
    all unhedged variable rate long-term debt, the change would
    affect annualized interest expense by approximately
    $5 million at January 1, 2007. For further
    information, see Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements
    under “Financial Instruments” for additional
    information.

To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity
    prices, the Company enters into fixed-price contracts for the
    purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale
    electricity market and, to a lesser extent, into similar
    contracts for gas purchases.

The Company has implemented a fuel hedging program at the
    instruction of the Georgia PSC. The changes in fair value of
    energy-related derivative contracts and year-end valuations were
    as follows at December 31:

Unrealized gains and losses from mark to market adjustments on
    derivative contracts related to the Company’s fuel hedging
    programs are recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities.
    Realized gains and losses from these programs are included in
    fuel expense and are recovered through the Company’s fuel
    cost recovery mechanism. Of the net financial gains, the Company
    was allowed to retain 25 percent in earnings through
    June 30, 2006. In 2005, the Company had a total net gain of
    $74.6 million of which the Company retained
    $18.6 million. There were no net financial gains in 2006
    and 2004. Effective July 1, 2006, the Georgia PSC ordered
    the suspension of the profit sharing framework related to the
    fuel hedging program. New profit sharing arrangements as well as
    other charges to the fuel hedging program are currently under
    development. See Note 3 to the financial statements under
    “Retail Regulatory Matters – Fuel Hedging
    Program” for additional information. Gains and losses on
    derivative contracts that are not designated as hedges are
    recognized in the statements of income as incurred. At
    December 31, 2006, the fair value gains/(losses) of
    energy-related derivative

Unrealized gains (losses) recognized in income in 2006, 2005,
    and 2004 were not material. The Company is exposed to market
    price risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to
    the derivative energy contracts. The Company’s policy is to
    enter into agreements with counterparties that have investment
    grade credit ratings by Moody’s and Standard &
    Poor’s or with counterparties who have posted collateral to
    cover potential credit exposure. Therefore, the Company does not
    anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the
    counterparties. For additional information, see Notes 1 and
    6 to the financial statements under “Financial
    Instruments.”

Capital
    Requirements and Contractual Obligations

The construction program of the Company is currently estimated
    to be $1.9 billion for 2007, $1.8 billion for 2008,
    and $1.8 billion for 2009. Environmental expenditures
    included in these amounts are $955 million,
    $637 million, and $316 million for 2007, 2008, and
    2009, respectively. Actual construction costs may vary from
    these estimates because of changes in such factors as: business
    conditions; environmental regulations; nuclear plant
    regulations; FERC rules and regulations; load projections; the
    cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and
    materials; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no
    assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be
    fully recovered.

As a result of requirements by the NRC, the Company has
    established external trust funds for nuclear decommissioning
    costs. For additional information, see Note 1 to the
    financial statements under “Nuclear Decommissioning.”

In addition, as discussed in Note 2 to the financial
    statements, the Company provides postretirement benefits to
    substantially all employees and funds trusts to the extent
    required by the Georgia PSC and the FERC.

Other funding requirements related to obligations associated
    with scheduled maturities of long-term debt and preferred
    securities and the related interest, preferred stock dividends,
    leases, derivatives, and other purchase commitments are as
    follows. See Notes 1, 6, and 7 to the financial
    statements for additional information.

Georgia Power Company 2006 Annual Report

Cautionary
    Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

The Company’s 2006 Annual Report contains forward-looking
    statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other
    things, statements concerning retail sales growth, retail rates,
    fuel cost recovery, environmental regulations and expenditures,
    the Company’s projections for postretirement benefit trust
    contributions, financing activities, access to sources of
    capital, the impacts of the adoption of new accounting rules,
    completion of construction projects, and estimated construction
    and other expenditures. In some cases, forward-looking
    statements can be identified by terminology such as
    “may,” “will,” “could,”
    “should,” “expects,” “plans,”
    “anticipates,” “believes,”
    “estimates,” “projects,”
    “predicts,” “potential,” or
    “continue” or the negative of these terms or other
    similar terminology. There are various factors that could cause
    actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the
    forward-looking statements; accordingly, there can be no
    assurance that such indicated results will be realized. These
    factors include:

•

the impact of recent and future federal and state regulatory
    change, including legislative and regulatory initiatives
    regarding deregulation and restructuring of the electric utility
    industry, implementation of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and
    also changes in environmental, tax, and other laws and
    regulations to which the Company is subject, as well as changes
    in application of existing laws and regulations;

•

current and future litigation, regulatory investigations,
    proceedings, or inquiries, including FERC matters and the
    pending EPA civil action against the Company;

•

the effects, extent, and timing of the entry of additional
    competition in the markets in which the Company operates;

•

variations in demand for electricity, including those relating
    to weather, the general economy and population, and business
    growth (and declines);

•

available sources and costs of fuels;

•

ability to control costs;

•

investment performance of the Company’s employee benefit
    plans;

•

advances in technology;

•

state and federal rate regulations and the impact of pending and
    future rate cases and negotiations, including rate cases related
    to fuel cost recovery;

•

internal restructuring or other restructuring options that may
    be pursued;

•

potential business strategies, including acquisitions or
    dispositions of assets or businesses, which cannot be assured to
    be completed or beneficial to the Company;

•

the ability of counterparties of the Company to make payments as
    and when due;

•

the ability to obtain new short- and long-term contracts with
    neighboring utilities;

•

the direct or indirect effect on the Company’s business
    resulting from terrorist incidents and the threat of terrorist
    incidents;

•

interest rate fluctuations and financial market conditions and
    the results of financing efforts, including the Company’s
    credit ratings;

•

the ability of the Company to obtain additional generating
    capacity at competitive prices;

•

catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions,
    floods, hurricanes, pandemic health events such as an avian
    influenza, or other similar occurrences;

•

the direct or indirect effects on the Company’s business
    resulting from incidents similar to the August 2003 power outage
    in the Northeast;

•

the effect of accounting pronouncements issued periodically by
    standard-setting bodies; and

•

other factors discussed elsewhere herein and in other reports
    (including the

Form 10-K)

filed by the Company from time to time with the SEC.

The
    Company expressly disclaims any obligation to update any
    forward-looking statements.

    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Georgia Power Company 2006
    Annual Report

1.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General

Georgia Power Company (the Company) is a wholly owned subsidiary
    of Southern Company, which is the parent company of four
    traditional operating companies, Southern Power Company
    (Southern Power), Southern Company Services (SCS), Southern
    Communications Services (SouthernLINC Wireless), Southern
    Company Holdings (Southern Holdings), Southern Nuclear Operating
    Company (Southern Nuclear), Southern Telecom, and other direct
    and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional operating
    companies – Alabama Power, the Company, Gulf Power,
    and Mississippi Power – provide electric service in
    four Southeastern states. The Company operates as a vertically
    integrated utility providing electricity to retail customers
    within its traditional service area located within the State of
    Georgia and to wholesale customers in the Southeast. Southern
    Power constructs, acquires, and manages generation assets and
    sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market.
    SCS, the system service company, provides at cost, specialized
    services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies.
    SouthernLINC Wireless provides digital wireless communications
    services to the traditional operating companies and also markets
    these services to the public within the Southeast. Southern
    Telecom provides fiber cable services within the Southeast.
    Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary
    for Southern Company’s investments in synthetic fuels and
    leveraged leases and various other energy-related businesses.
    Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to Southern
    Company’s nuclear power plants. On January 4, 2006,
    Southern Company completed the sale of substantially all the
    assets of Southern Company Gas, its competitive retail natural
    gas marketing subsidiary.

Effective July 1, 2006, the Company merged with Savannah
    Electric. The Company has accounted for the merger in a manner
    similar to a pooling of interests, and the Company’s
    financial statements now reflect the merger as though it had
    occurred on January 1, 2004. See Note 3 under
    “Retail Regulatory Matters – Merger” for
    additional information.

The equity method is used for subsidiaries in which the Company
    has significant influence but does not control and for variable
    interest entities where the Company is not the primary
    beneficiary. Certain prior years’ data presented in the
    financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the
    current year presentation.

The Company is subject to regulation by the Federal Energy
    Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Georgia Public Service
    Commission (PSC). The Company follows accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States and complies with the
    accounting policies and practices prescribed by its regulatory
    commissions. The preparation of financial statements in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States requires the use of estimates, and the actual
    results may differ from those estimates.

Affiliate
    Transactions

The Company has an agreement with SCS under which the following
    services are rendered to the Company at direct or allocated
    cost: general and design engineering, purchasing, accounting and
    statistical analysis, finance and treasury, tax, information
    resources, marketing, auditing, insurance and pension
    administration, human resources, systems and procedures, and
    other services with respect to business and operations and power
    pool operations. Costs for these services amounted to
    $386 million in 2006, $348 million in 2005, and
    $310 million in 2004. Cost allocation methodologies used by
    SCS were approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission
    prior to the repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
    1935, as amended, and management believes they are reasonable.
    The FERC permits services to be rendered at cost by system
    service companies.

The Company has an agreement with Southern Nuclear under which
    the following nuclear-related services are rendered to the
    Company at cost: general executive and advisory services,
    general operations, management and technical services,
    administrative services including procurement, accounting,
    employee relations, systems and procedures services, strategic
    planning and budgeting services, and other services with respect
    to business and operations. Costs for these services amounted to
    $348 million in 2006, $328 million in 2005, and
    $311 million in 2004.

The Company has an agreement with Southern Power under which the
    Company operates and maintains Southern Power owned Plants
    Dahlberg, Franklin, and Wansley at cost. Billings under these
    agreements with Southern Power amounted to $5.4 million in
    2006, $5.2 million in 2005, and $4.8 million in 2004.

The Company has an agreement with SouthernLINC Wireless under
    which the Company receives digital wireless communications
    services and purchases digital equipment. Costs for these
    services amounted to $7.1 million in 2006,
    $7.7 million in 2005, and $8.0 million in 2004.

NOTES

(continued)

Georgia Power Company 2006
    Annual Report

Southern Company’s 30 percent ownership interest in
    Alabama Fuel Products, LLC (AFP), which produces synthetic fuel,
    was terminated July 1, 2006. The Company has an agreement
    with an indirect subsidiary of Southern Company that provides
    services for AFP. Under this agreement, the Company provides
    certain accounting functions, including processing and paying
    fuel transportation invoices, and the Company is reimbursed for
    its expenses. Amounts billed under this agreement totaled
    approximately $76 million in 2006, $61 million in
    2005, and $53 million in 2004. In addition, the Company
    purchases synthetic fuel from AFP for use at Plant Branch. Fuel
    purchases totaled $146 million through June 30, 2006,
    $216 million in 2005, and $163 million in 2004.

The Company has entered into several purchased power agreements
    (PPAs) with Southern Power for capacity and energy. Expenses
    associated with these PPAs were $407 million,
    $469 million, and $314 million in 2006, 2005, and
    2004, respectively. Additionally, the Company had
    $28 million and $29 million of prepaid capacity
    expenses included in deferred charges and other assets in the
    balance sheets at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    See Note 7 under “Purchased Power Commitments”
    for additional information.

The Company has an agreement with Gulf Power under which Gulf
    Power jointly owns a portion of Plant Scherer. Under this
    agreement, the Company operates Plant Scherer, and Gulf Power
    reimburses the Company for its proportionate share of the
    related expenses which were $8.0 million in 2006,
    $4.3 million in 2005, and $6.8 million in 2004. See
    Note 4 for additional information.

The Company provides incidental services to other Southern
    Company subsidiaries which are generally minor in duration and
    amount. However, with the hurricane damage experienced by
    Alabama Power, Gulf Power, and Mississippi Power in 2005,
    assistance provided to aid in storm restoration, including
    company labor, contract labor, and materials, caused an increase
    in these activities. The total amount of storm assistance
    provided to Alabama Power, Gulf Power, and Mississippi Power in
    2005 was $4.3 million, $5.0 million, and
    $55.2 million, respectively. These activities were billed
    at cost.

Also see Note 4 for information regarding the
    Company’s ownership in and PPA with Southern Electric
    Generating Company (SEGCO) and Note 5 for information on
    certain deferred tax liabilities due to affiliates.

The traditional operating companies, including the Company, and
    Southern Power may jointly enter into various types of wholesale
    energy, natural gas, and certain other contracts, either
    directly or through SCS as agent. Each participating company may
    be jointly and severally liable for the obligations incurred
    under these agreements. See Note 7 under “Fuel
    Commitments” for additional information.

Regulatory
    Assets and Liabilities

The Company is subject to the provisions of Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 71, “Accounting
    for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation”
    (SFAS No. 71). Regulatory assets represent probable
    future revenues associated with certain costs that are expected
    to be recovered from customers through the ratemaking process.
    Regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in
    revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be
    credited to customers through the ratemaking process.

II-167


NOTES

(continued)

Georgia Power Company 2006
    Annual Report

In the event that a portion of the Company’s operations is
    no longer subject to the provisions of SFAS No. 71,
    the Company would be required to write off related regulatory
    assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable
    through regulated rates. In addition, the Company would be
    required to determine if any impairment to other assets,
    including plant, exists and, write down the assets, if impaired,
    to their fair value. All regulatory assets and liabilities are
    reflected in rates.

Revenues

Energy and other revenues are recognized as services are
    provided. Unbilled revenues are accrued at the end of each
    fiscal period. Electric rates for the Company include provisions
    to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs and the energy
    component of purchased power costs, and certain other costs.
    Revenues are adjusted for differences between the actual
    recoverable costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates.

Retail fuel cost recovery rates require periodic filings with
    the Georgia PSC. The Company is required to file its next fuel
    case by March 1, 2008. See Note 3 under “Retail
    Regulatory Matters – Fuel Cost Recovery.”

The Company has a diversified base of customers. No single
    customer or industry comprises 10 percent or more of
    revenues. For all periods presented, uncollectible accounts
    averaged less than 1 percent of revenues.

Fuel
    Costs

Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is used. Fuel expense
    includes the cost of purchased emission allowances as they are
    used. Fuel expense also includes the amortization of the cost of
    nuclear fuel and a charge, based on nuclear generation, for the
    permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. Total charges for
    nuclear fuel included in fuel expense amounted to
    $71 million in 2006, $70 million in 2005, and
    $73 million in 2004.

Nuclear
    Fuel Disposal Costs

The Company has contracts with the U.S. Department of
    Energy (DOE) that provide for the permanent disposal of spent
    nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin disposing of spent nuclear
    fuel in 1998 as required by the contracts, and the Company is
    pursuing legal remedies against the government for breach of
    contract. Sufficient pool storage capacity for spent fuel is
    available at Plant Vogtle to maintain full-core discharge
    capability for both units into 2014. Construction of an

on-site

dry
    storage facility at Plant Vogtle is expected to begin in
    sufficient time to maintain pool full-core discharge capability.
    At Plant Hatch, an

on-site

dry
    storage facility is operational and can be expanded to
    accommodate spent fuel through the expected life of the plant.

Also, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 established a Uranium
    Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund, which has
    been funded in part by a special assessment on utilities with
    nuclear plants. This assessment was paid over a

15-year

period; the final installment occurred in 2006. This fund will
    be used by the DOE for the decontamination and decommissioning
    of its nuclear fuel enrichment facilities. The law provides that
    utilities will recover these payments in the same manner as any
    other fuel expense.

State Tax
    Credits

The State of Georgia provides a tax credit for qualified
    investment property to manufacturing companies that construct
    new facilities. The credit ranges from 1 percent to
    8 percent of qualified construction expenditures depending
    upon the county in which the new facility is located. The
    Company’s policy is to recognize these credits when
    management believes that they are more likely than not to be
    allowed by the Georgia Department of Revenue. State tax credits
    of $19.9 million, $9.4 million, and $13.1 million
    were recorded in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

Property,
    Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost, less
    regulatory disallowances and impairments. Original cost
    includes: materials; labor; minor items of property; appropriate
    administrative and general costs; payroll-

    Annual Report

related costs such as taxes, pensions, and other benefits; and
    the interest capitalized

and/or

cost
    of funds used during construction.

The Company’s property, plant, and equipment consisted of
    the following at December 31 (in millions)

:

$

21,280

$

20,636

The cost of replacements of property, exclusive of minor items
    of property, is capitalized. The cost of maintenance, repairs,
    and replacement of minor items of property is charged to
    maintenance expense as incurred or performed with the exception
    of certain generating plant maintenance costs. As mandated by
    the Georgia PSC, the Company defers and amortizes nuclear
    refueling costs over the unit’s operating cycle before the
    next refueling. The refueling cycles are 18 and 24 months
    for Plants Vogtle and Hatch, respectively. Also, in accordance
    with the Georgia PSC order, the Company defers the costs of
    certain significant inspection costs for the combustion turbines
    at Plant McIntosh and amortizes such costs over 10 years,
    which approximates the expected maintenance cycle.

Income
    and Other Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred
    income taxes and provides deferred income taxes for all
    significant income tax temporary differences. Investment tax
    credits utilized are deferred and amortized to income over the
    average lives of the related property. Taxes that are collected
    from customers on behalf of governmental agencies to be remitted
    to these agencies are presented net on the statements of income.

Depreciation
    and Amortization

Depreciation of the original cost of utility plant in service is
    provided primarily by using composite straight-line rates, which
    approximated 2.6 percent in each of 2006, 2005, and 2004.
    Depreciation studies are conducted periodically to update the
    composite rates that are approved by the Georgia PSC. Effective
    January 1, 2005, the Company’s depreciation rates were
    revised by the Georgia PSC. The revised depreciation rates had
    no material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

When property subject to depreciation is retired or otherwise
    disposed of in the normal course of business, its original cost,
    together with the cost of removal, less salvage, is charged to
    accumulated depreciation. Minor items of property included in
    the original cost of the plant are retired when the related
    property unit is retired.

Under the Company’s retail rate plan for the three years
    ending December 31, 2007 (2004 Retail Rate Plan), the
    Company was ordered to recognize Georgia PSC –
    certified capacity costs in rates evenly over the three years
    covered by the 2004 Retail Rate Plan. The Company recorded a
    credit to amortization of $14 million in 2006 as well as
    $33 million in 2005. Under the retail rate plan for the
    Company ending December 31, 2004 (2001 Retail Rate Plan),
    the Georgia PSC ordered the Company to amortize
    $333 million, the cumulative balance of accelerated
    depreciation and amortization previously expensed, equally over
    three years as a credit to depreciation and amortization expense
    beginning January 2002. The Company also was ordered to
    recognize new certified capacity costs in rates evenly over the
    same three-year period under the 2001 Retail Rate Plan. As a
    result, the Company recorded a reduction in depreciation and
    amortization expense of $77 million in 2004. See
    Note 3 under “Retail Regulatory Matters –
    Rate Plans” for additional information.

Asset
    Retirement Obligations

and Other Costs of Removal

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted FASB
    Statement No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
    Obligations” (SFAS No. 143), which established
    new accounting and reporting standards for legal obligations
    associated with the ultimate costs of retiring long-lived
    assets. The present value of the ultimate costs for an
    asset’s future retirement is recorded in the period in
    which the liability is incurred. The costs are capitalized as
    part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the
    asset’s useful life. In addition, effective
    December 31, 2005, the Company adopted the provisions of
    FASB Interpretation No. 47, “Conditional Asset
    Retirement Obligations” (FIN 47), which requires that
    an asset retirement obligation be recorded even though the
    timing

and/or

method of settlement are conditional on future events. Prior to
    December 2005, the Company did not recognize asset retirement
    obligations for asbestos removal because the timing of their
    retirements was dependent on future events. The Company has
    received approval from the Georgia PSC allowing the continued
    accrual of other future retirement costs for long-lived assets
    that the Company does not have a legal obligation

II-169


NOTES

    Annual Report

to retire. Accordingly, the accumulated removal costs for these
    obligations will continue to be reflected in the balance sheets
    as a regulatory liability. Therefore, the Company had no
    cumulative effect to net income resulting from the adoption of
    SFAS No. 143 or FIN 47.

The liability recognized to retire long-lived assets primarily
    relates to the Company’s nuclear facilities, which include
    the Company’s ownership interests in Plants Hatch and
    Vogtle. The fair value of assets legally restricted for settling
    retirement obligations related to nuclear facilities as of
    December 31, 2006 was $544 million. In addition, the
    Company has retirement obligations related to various landfill
    sites, ash ponds, and underground storage tanks. In connection
    with the adoption of FIN 47, the Company also recorded
    additional asset retirement obligations (and assets) of
    approximately $95 million related to asbestos removal. The
    Company also has identified retirement obligations related to
    certain transmission and distribution facilities, leasehold
    improvements, equipment on customer property, and property
    associated with the Company’s rail lines. However,
    liabilities for the removal of these assets have not been
    recorded because no reasonable estimate can be made regarding
    the timing of any related retirements. The Company will continue
    to recognize in the statements of income the allowed removal
    costs in accordance with its regulatory treatment. Any
    difference between costs recognized under SFAS No. 143
    and FIN 47 and those reflected in rates are recognized as
    either a regulatory asset or liability in the balance sheets as
    ordered by the Georgia PSC. See “Nuclear
    Decommissioning” herein for further information on amounts
    included in rates.

Nuclear
    Decommissioning

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requires licensees of
    commercial nuclear power reactors to establish a plan for
    providing reasonable assurance of funds for future
    decommissioning. The Company has external trust funds to comply
    with the NRC’s regulations. Use of the funds is restricted
    to nuclear decommissioning activities and the funds are managed
    and invested in accordance with applicable requirements of
    various regulatory bodies, including the NRC, the FERC, and
    state PSCs, as well as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The
    trust funds are invested in a tax-efficient manner in a
    diversified mix of equity and fixed income securities and are
    classified as

available-for-sale.

The trust funds are included in the balance sheets at fair
    value, as obtained from quoted market prices for the same or
    similar investments. As the external trust funds are actively
    managed by unrelated parties with limited direction from the
    Company, the Company does not have the ability to choose to hold
    securities with unrealized losses until recovery. Through 2005,
    the Company considered other-than-temporary impairments to be
    immaterial. However, since the January 1, 2006 effective
    date of FASB Staff Position FAS 115-1/124-1, “The
    Meaning of

Other-Than-Temporary

Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments” (FSP

No. 115-1),

the Company considers all unrealized losses to represent

other-than-temporary

impairments. The adoption of FSP

No. 115-1

had no impact on the results of operations, cash flows, or
    financial condition of the Company as all losses have been and
    continue to be recorded through a regulatory liability, whether
    realized, unrealized, or identified as other-than-temporary.

Georgia Power Company 2006
    Annual Report

Sales of the securities held in the trust funds resulted in
    proceeds of $457.4 million, $372.5 million, and
    $532.3 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, all
    of which were re-invested. Realized gains and

other-than-temporary

impairment losses were $17.8 million and
    $12.1 million, respectively, in 2006. Net realized
    gains/(losses) were $12.6 million and $14.1 million in
    2005 and 2004, respectively. Realized gains and

other-than-temporary

impairment losses are determined on a specific identification
    basis. In accordance with regulatory guidance, all realized and
    unrealized gains and losses are included in the regulatory
    liability for Asset Retirement Obligations in the balance sheets
    and are not included in net income or other comprehensive
    income. Unrealized gains and

other-than-temporary

impairment losses are considered non-cash transactions for
    purposes of the statements of cash flows. Unrealized losses were
    not material in any period presented and did not require the
    recognition of any impairment to the underlying investments.

Amounts previously recorded in internal reserves are being
    transferred into the external trust funds over periods approved
    by the Georgia PSC. The NRC’s minimum external funding
    requirements are based on a generic estimate of the cost to
    decommission only the radioactive portions of a nuclear unit
    based on the size and type of reactor. The Company has filed
    plans with the NRC to ensure that, over time – the
    deposits and earnings of the external trust funds will provide
    the minimum funding amounts prescribed by the NRC. Annual
    provisions for nuclear decommissioning are based on an annuity
    method as approved by the Georgia PSC. The amount expensed in 2006 and
    the accumulated provisions for decommissioning at December 31, 2006 were as

Site study cost is the estimate to decommission a specific
    facility as of the site study year. The estimated costs of
    decommissioning are based on the most current study performed in
    2006, which will be filed with the Georgia PSC in 2007 as a part
    of the retail base rate case. The Company’s ownership
    interests in Plants Hatch and Vogtle were as follows:

The decommissioning cost estimates are based on prompt
    dismantlement and removal of the plant from service. The actual
    decommissioning costs may vary from the above estimates because
    of changes in the assumed date of decommissioning, changes in
    NRC requirements, or changes in the assumptions used in making
    these estimates.

Under the 2004 Retail Rate Plan, effective January 1, 2005, the Georgia PSC decreased the annual
    decommissioning costs for ratemaking from $9 million to
    $7 million. This amount is based on the NRC generic
    estimate to decommission the radioactive portion of the
    facilities as of 2003. The estimates are $421 million and
    $326 million for Plants Hatch and Vogtle, respectively.
    Significant assumptions used to determine the costs for
    ratemaking include an estimated inflation rate of
    3.1 percent and an estimated trust earnings rate of
    5.1 percent. Another significant assumption used was the
    change in the operating license for Plant Hatch. In January
    2002, the NRC granted the Company a

20-year

extension of the licenses for both units at Plant Hatch which
    permits the operation of units 1 and 2 until 2034 and 2038,
    respectively. The Company plans to file an application with the
    NRC in June 2007 to extend the licenses for Plant Vogtle units 1
    and 2 for an additional 20 years. The Company expects the
    Georgia PSC to periodically review and adjust, if necessary, the
    amounts collected in rates for the anticipated cost of
    decommissioning.

Allowance
    for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) and Interest
    Capitalized

In accordance with regulatory treatment, the Company records
    AFUDC, which represents the estimated debt and equity costs of
    capital funds that are necessary to finance the construction of
    new regulated facilities. While cash is not realized currently
    from such allowance, it increases

II-171


NOTES

(continued)

Georgia Power Company 2006
    Annual Report

the revenue requirement over the service life of the plant
    through a higher rate base and higher depreciation expense.
    Interest related to the construction of new facilities not
    included in the Company’s retail rates is capitalized in
    accordance with standard interest capitalization requirements.
    For the years 2006, 2005, and 2004, the average AFUDC rates were
    8.3 percent, 8.0 percent, and 8.0 percent,
    respectively, and AFUDC capitalized was $44.1 million,
    $41.1 million, and $39.1 million, respectively. AFUDC
    and interest capitalized, net of taxes, were 5.0 percent,
    4.9 percent, and 5.2 percent of net income after
    dividends on preferred stock for 2006, 2005, and 2004
    respectively.

Impairment
    of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles

The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination
    of whether an impairment has occurred is based on either a
    specific regulatory disallowance or an estimate of undiscounted
    future cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared with
    the carrying value of the assets. If an impairment has occurred,
    the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by either
    the amount of regulatory disallowance or by estimating the fair
    value of the assets and recording a loss if the carrying value
    is greater than the fair value. For assets identified as held
    for sale, the carrying value is compared to the estimated fair
    value less the cost to sell in order to determine if an
    impairment loss is required. Until the assets are disposed of,
    their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or
    events change. See Note 3 under “Retail Regulatory
    Matters – Rate Plans” for information regarding a
    regulatory disallowance by the Georgia PSC in December 2004.

Storm
    Damage Reserve

The Company maintains a reserve for property damage to cover the
    cost of damages from major storms to its transmission and
    distribution lines and the cost of uninsured damages to its
    generation facilities and other property as mandated by the
    Georgia PSC. The Company accrues $6.6 million annually that
    is recoverable through base rates. The Company expects the
    Georgia PSC to periodically review and adjust, if necessary, the
    amounts collected in rates for storm damage costs.

Environmental
    Remediation Cost Recovery

The Company continues to recover environmental costs through its
    base rates. Beginning in 2005, such rates include an annual
    accrual of $5.4 million for environmental remediation.
    Environmental remediation expenditures will be charged against
    the reserve as they are incurred. The annual accrual amount will
    be reviewed and adjusted in future regulatory proceedings. Under
    Georgia PSC ratemaking provisions, $22 million had
    previously been deferred in a regulatory liability account for
    use in meeting future environmental remediation costs of the
    Company and is being amortized over a three-year period that
    began in January 2005.

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash
    investments are considered cash equivalents. Temporary cash
    investments are securities with original maturities of
    90 days or less.

Materials
    and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include the average costs of
    transmission, distribution, and generating plant materials.
    Materials are charged to inventory when purchased and then
    expensed or capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when installed.

Fuel
    Inventory

Fuel inventory includes the average costs of oil, coal, natural
    gas, and emission allowances. Fuel is charged to inventory when
    purchased and then expensed as used and recovered by the Company
    through fuel cost recovery rates approved by the Georgia PSC.
    Emission allowances granted by the Environmental Protection
    Agency (EPA) are included in inventory at zero cost.

Stock
    Options

Southern Company provides non-qualified stock options to a large
    segment of the Company’s employees ranging from line
    management to executives. Prior to January 1, 2006, the
    Company accounted for options granted in accordance with
    Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25; thus, no
    compensation expense was recognized because the exercise price
    of all options granted equaled the fair market value on the date
    of the grant.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair
    value recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123(R),
    “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123(R)),
    using the modified prospective method. Under that method,
    compensation cost for the year ended December 31, 2006 is
    recognized as the requisite service is rendered and includes:
    (a) compensation cost for the portion of share-based awards
    granted prior to and that were outstanding as of January 1,
    2006, for which the

II-172


NOTES

    Annual Report

requisite service had not been rendered, based on the grant-date
    fair value of those awards as calculated in accordance with the
    original provisions of FASB Statement No. 123,
    “Accounting for Stock-based Compensation”
    (SFAS No. 123), and (b) compensation cost for all
    share-based awards granted subsequent to January 1, 2006,
    based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with
    the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). Results for prior
    periods have not been restated.

The compensation cost and tax benefits related to the grant and
    exercise of Southern Company stock options to the Company’s
    employees are recognized in the Company’s financial
    statements with a corresponding credit to equity, representing a
    capital contribution from Southern Company.

For the Company, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) has
    resulted in a reduction in earnings before income taxes and net
    income of $6 million and $4 million, respectively, for
    the year ended December 31, 2006. Additionally,
    SFAS No. 123(R) requires the gross excess tax benefit
    from stock option exercises to be reclassified as a financing
    cash flow as opposed to an operating cash flow; the reduction in
    operating cash flows and increase in financing cash flows for
    the year ended December 31, 2006 was $3 million.

For the years prior to the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R), the pro forma impact of fair-value
    accounting for options granted on net income is as follows:

Because historical forfeitures have been insignificant and are
    expected to remain insignificant, no forfeitures are assumed in
    the calculation of compensation expense; rather they are
    recognized when they occur.

The estimated fair values of stock options granted in 2006,
    2005, and 2004 were derived using the Black-Scholes stock option
    pricing model. Expected volatility is based on historical
    volatility of Southern Company’s stock over a period equal
    to the expected term. The Company uses historical exercise data
    to estimate the expected term that represents the period of time
    that options granted to employees are expected to be
    outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on the
    U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant
    that covers the expected term of the stock options. The
    following table shows the assumptions used in the pricing model
    and the weighted average grant-date fair value of stock options

Financial
    Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit
    exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, the prices of
    certain fuel purchases, and electricity purchases and sales. All
    derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets
    or liabilities and are measured at fair value. Substantially all
    of the Company’s bulk energy purchases and sales contracts
    that meet the definition of a derivative are exempt from fair
    value accounting requirements and are accounted for under the
    accrual method. Other derivative contracts qualify as cash flow
    hedges of anticipated transactions or are recoverable through
    the Georgia PSC-approved fuel hedging program. This results in
    the deferral of related gains and losses in other comprehensive
    income or regulatory assets and liabilities, respectively, until
    the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness arising from
    cash flow hedges is recognized currently in net income. Other
    derivative contracts are marked to market through current period
    income and are recorded on a net basis in the statements of
    income.

The Company is exposed to losses related to financial
    instruments in the event of counterparties’ nonperformance.
    The Company has established controls to determine and monitor
    the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate the
    Company’s exposure to counterparty credit risk.

Comprehensive
    Income

The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of
    all changes in common stock equity of an enterprise that result
    from transactions and other economic events of the period other
    than transactions with owners. Comprehensive income consists of
    net income, changes in the fair value of qualifying cash flow
    hedges and marketable securities, and changes in additional
    minimum pension liability less income taxes and
    reclassifications for amounts included in net income.

Variable
    Interest Entities

The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity must
    consolidate the related assets and liabilities. The Company has
    established certain wholly-owned trusts to issue preferred
    securities. However, the Company is not considered the primary
    beneficiary of the trusts. Therefore, the investments in these
    trusts are reflected as Other Investments, and the related loans
    from the trusts are reflected as Long-term Debt Payable to
    Affiliated Trusts in the balance sheets. See Note 6 under
    “Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities/Long-Term Debt
    Payable to Affiliated Trusts” for additional information.

2.

RETIREMENT
    BENEFITS

The Company has a defined benefit, trusteed pension plan
    covering substantially all employees. The plan is funded in
    accordance with requirements of the Employee Retirement Income
    Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). No contributions to
    the plan are expected for the year ending December 31,
    2007. The Company also provides certain defined benefit pension
    plans for a selected group of management and highly compensated
    employees. Benefits under these non-qualified pension plans are
    funded on a cash basis. In addition, the Company provides
    certain medical care and life insurance benefits for retired
    employees through other postretirement benefit plans. The
    Company funds related trusts to the extent required by the
    Georgia PSC and the FERC. For the year ending December 31,
    2007, postretirement trust contributions are expected to total
    approximately $16 million.

On December 31, 2006, the Company adopted FASB Statement
    No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined
    Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans”
    (SFAS No. 158), which requires recognition of the
    funded status of its defined benefit postretirement plans in its
    balance sheet. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 158,
    the Company generally recognized only the difference between the
    benefit expense recognized and employer contributions to the
    plan as either a prepaid asset or as a liability. With respect
    to each of its underfunded non-qualified pension plans, the
    Company recognized an additional minimum liability representing
    the difference between each plan’s accumulated benefit
    obligation and its assets.

Upon the adoption of SFAS No. 158, the Company was
    required to recognize on its balance sheet assets and
    liabilities related to unrecognized prior service cost,
    unrecognized gains or losses (from changes in actuarial
    assumptions and the difference between actual and expected
    returns on plan assets), and any unrecognized transition amounts
    (resulting from the change from cash-basis accounting to accrual
    accounting). These amounts will continue to be amortized as a
    component of expense over the employees’ remaining average
    service life. SFAS No. 158 did not change the
    recognition of pension and other postretirement benefit expense
    in the statement of income. Upon the adoption of
    SFAS No. 158, the Company recorded an additional
    prepaid pension asset of $218 million with respect to its
    overfunded defined benefit plan and additional liabilities and
    deferred credits of $13 million and $255 million,
    respectively, related to its underfunded non-qualified pension
    plans and retiree benefit plans. The incremental effect of

The measurement date for plan assets and obligations is
    September 30 for each year presented. Pursuant to
    SFAS No. 158, the Company will be required to change

At December 31, 2006, the projected benefit obligations for
    the qualified and non-qualified pension plans were
    $2.0 billion and $0.1 billion, respectively. All plan
    assets are related to the qualified plan.

Pension plan assets are managed and invested in accordance with
    all applicable requirements, including ERISA and the Internal
    Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Internal Revenue Code). The

Net periodic pension cost (income) is the sum of service cost,
    interest cost, and other costs netted against the expected
    return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets is
    determined by multiplying the expected rate of return on plan
    assets and the market-related value of plan assets. In
    determining the market-related value of plan assets, the Company
    has elected to amortize changes in the market value of all plan
    assets over five years rather than recognize the changes
    immediately. As a result, the accounting value of plan assets
    that is used to calculate the expected return on plan assets
    differs from the current fair value of the plan assets.

Future benefit payments reflect expected future service and are
    estimated based on assumptions used to measure the projected
    benefit obligation for the pension plans. At December 31,
    2006, estimated benefit payments were as follows:

Act provides a 28 percent prescription drug subsidy for
    Medicare eligible retirees. FSP

requires recognition of the impacts of the Medicare Act in the
    APBO and future cost of service for postretirement medical plan.
    The effect of the subsidy reduced the Company’s expenses
    for the year ended December 31, 2006, the year ended
    December 31, 2005, and the six months ended
    December 31, 2004 by approximately $16 million,

The weighted average rates assumed in the actuarial calculations
    used to determine both the benefit obligations as of the
    measurement date and the net periodic costs for the pension and
    postretirement benefit plans for the following year are
    presented below. Net periodic benefit costs for 2004 were

The Company determined the long-term rate of return based on

    taking into account the diversification benefits of investing in
    multiple asset classes.

An additional assumption used in measuring the APBO was a
    weighted average medical care cost trend rate of
    9.56 percent for 2007, decreasing gradually to
    5.00 percent through the year 2015 and remaining at that
    level thereafter. An annual increase or decrease in the assumed
    medical care cost trend rate of 1 percent would affect the

    employee’s base salary. Prior to November 2006, the Company
    matched employee contributions at a rate of 75 percent up
    to 6 percent of the employee’s base salary. Total
    matching contributions made to the plan for 2006, 2005, and 2004
    were $21 million, $20 million, and $19 million,

CONTINGENCIES
    AND REGULATORY MATTERS

General
    Litigation Matters

The Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions
    arising in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the
    Company’s business activities are subject to extensive
    governmental regulation related to public health and the
    environment. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of
    various types, including property damage, personal injury, and
    citizen enforcement of environmental requirements such as
    opacity and other air quality standards, has increased generally
    throughout the United States. In particular, personal injury
    claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous
    materials have become more frequent. The ultimate outcome of
    such pending or potential litigation against the Company cannot
    be predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not
    specifically reported herein, management does not anticipate
    that the liabilities, if any, arising from such current
    proceedings would have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s financial statements.

Environmental
    Matters

New
    Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the EPA brought a civil action in the
    U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia
    against certain Southern Company subsidiaries, including Alabama
    Power and the Company, alleging that these subsidiaries had
    violated the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air
    Act and related state laws at

II-178


NOTES

(continued)

Georgia Power Company 2006
    Annual Report

certain coal-fired generating facilities, including the
    Company’s Plants Bowen and Scherer. Through subsequent
    amendments and other legal procedures, the EPA filed a separate
    action in January 2001 against Alabama Power in the
    U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama
    after it was dismissed from the original action. In these
    lawsuits, the EPA alleged that NSR violations occurred at eight
    coal-fired generating facilities operated by Alabama Power and
    the Company (including a facility formerly owned by Savannah
    Electric). The civil actions request penalties and injunctive
    relief, including an order requiring the installation of the
    best available control technology at the affected units. On
    June 19, 2006, the U.S. District Court for the
    Northern District of Alabama entered a consent decree between
    Alabama Power and the EPA, resolving the alleged NSR violations
    at Plant Miller. The consent decree required Alabama Power to
    pay $100,000 to resolve the government’s claim for a civil
    penalty, and to donate $4.9 million of sulfur dioxide
    emission allowances to a nonprofit charitable organization, and
    formalized specific emissions reductions to be accomplished by
    Alabama Power, consistent with other Clean Air Act programs that
    require emissions reductions. On August 14, 2006, the
    district court in Alabama granted Alabama Power’s motion
    for summary judgment and entered final judgment in favor of
    Alabama Power on the EPA’s claims related to Plants Barry,
    Gaston, Gorgas, and Greene County. The plaintiffs have appealed
    this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
    Circuit, and on November 14, 2006, the Eleventh Circuit
    granted plaintiffs’ request to stay the appeal, pending the
    U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in a similar NSR case
    filed by the EPA against Duke Energy. The action against the
    Company has been administratively closed since the spring of
    2001, and none of the parties has sought to reopen the case.

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and
    the EPA regulations and interpretations in effect at the time
    the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act authorizes
    maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $32,500 per day, per
    violation at each generating unit, depending on the date of the
    alleged violation. An adverse outcome in this case could require
    substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at
    this time and could possibly require payment of substantial
    penalties. Such expenditures could affect future results of
    operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such costs
    are not recovered through regulated rates.

Plant
    Wansley Environmental Litigation

In December 2002, the Sierra Club, Physicians for Social
    Responsibility, Georgia Forestwatch, and one individual filed a
    civil suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
    District of Georgia against the Company for alleged violations
    of the Clean Air Act at four of the units at Plant Wansley. The
    civil action requested injunctive and declaratory relief, civil
    penalties, a supplemental environmental project, and
    attorneys’ fees. In January 2007, following the March 2006
    reversal and remand by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
    Eleventh Circuit, the district court ruled for the Company on
    all remaining allegations in this case. The only issue remaining
    for resolution by the district court is the appropriate remedy
    for two isolated, short-term, technical violations of the
    plant’s Clean Air Act operating permit. The court has asked
    the parties to submit a joint proposed remedy or individual
    proposals in the event the parties cannot agree. Although the
    ultimate outcome of this matter cannot currently be determined,
    the resulting liability associated with the two events is not
    expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
    financial statements.

Environmental
    Remediation

The Company has been designated as a potentially responsible
    party at sites governed by the Georgia Hazardous Site Response
    Act

and/or

by the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response,
    Compensation, and Liability Act. In 1995, the EPA designated the
    Company and four other unrelated entities as potentially
    responsible parties at a site in Brunswick, Georgia, that is
    listed on the federal National Priorities List. As of
    December 31, 2006, the Company had recorded approximately
    $6 million in cumulative expenses associated with its

agreed-upon

share of the removal and remedial investigation and feasibility
    study costs for the Brunswick site. Additional claims for
    recovery of natural resource damages at the site are
    anticipated. The Company has also recognized $36 million in
    cumulative expenses through December 31, 2006 for the
    assessment and anticipated cleanup of other sites on the Georgia
    Hazardous Sites Inventory.

The final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.
    However, based on the currently known conditions at these sites
    and the nature and extent of activities relating to these sites,
    management does not believe that additional liabilities, if any,
    at these sites would be material to the Company’s financial
    statements.

FERC
    Matters

Market-Based
    Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to
    non-affiliates, including short-term opportunity sales, at
    market-based prices. Specific FERC approval must be obtained
    with respect to a market-based contract with an affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess
    Southern Company’s generation dominance within its retail
    service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in
    other markets is not an issue in that proceeding. Any new
    market-based rate sales by the Company in Southern
    Company’s retail service territory entered into during a

15-month

refund period beginning February 27, 2005 could be subject
    to refund to the level of the default cost-based rates, pending
    the outcome of the proceeding. Such sales through May 27,
    2006, the end of the refund period, were approximately
    $5.8 million for the Company. In the event that the
    FERC’s default mitigation measures for entities that are
    found to have market power are ultimately applied, the Company
    may be required to charge cost-based rates for certain wholesale
    sales in the Southern Company retail service territory, which
    may be lower than negotiated market-based rates. The final
    outcome of this matter will depend on the form in which the
    final methodology for assessing generation market power and
    mitigation rules may be ultimately adopted and cannot be
    determined at this time.

In addition, in May 2005, the FERC started an investigation to
    determine whether Southern Company satisfies the other three
    parts of the FERC’s market-based rate analysis:
    transmission market power, barriers to entry, and affiliate
    abuse or reciprocal dealing. The FERC established a new

15-month

refund period related to this expanded investigation. Any new
    market-based rate sales involving any Southern Company
    subsidiary, including the Company, could be subject to refund to
    the extent the FERC orders lower rates as a result of this new
    investigation. Such sales through October 19, 2006, the end
    of the refund period, were approximately $18.8 million for
    the Company, of which $3.9 million relates to sales inside
    the retail service territory as discussed above. The FERC also
    directed that this expanded proceeding be held in abeyance
    pending the outcome of the proceeding on the Intercompany
    Interchange Contract (IIC) discussed below. On
    January 3, 2007, the FERC issued an order noting settlement
    of the IIC proceeding and seeking comment identifying any
    remaining issues and the proper procedure for addressing any
    such issues.

The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for
    these proceedings and is vigorously defending itself in this
    matter. However, the final outcome of this matter, including any
    remedies to be applied in the event of an adverse ruling in
    these proceedings cannot now be determined.

Intercompany
    Interchange Contract

The Company’s generation fleet is operated under
    the IIC, as approved by the FERC. In May 2005, the FERC
    initiated a new proceeding to examine (1) the provisions of
    the IIC among Alabama Power, the Company, Gulf Power,
    Mississippi Power, Savannah Electric, Southern Power, and SCS,
    as agent, under the terms of which the power pool of Southern
    Company is operated, and, in particular, the propriety of the
    continued inclusion of Southern Power as a party to
    the IIC, (2) whether any parties to the IIC have
    violated the FERC’s standards of conduct applicable to
    utility companies that are transmission providers, and
    (3) whether Southern Company’s code of conduct
    defining Southern Power as a “system company” rather
    than a “marketing affiliate” is just and reasonable.
    In connection with the formation of Southern Power, the FERC
    authorized Southern Power’s inclusion in the IIC in
    2000. The FERC also previously approved Southern Company’s
    code of conduct.

On October 5, 2006, the FERC issued an order accepting a
    settlement resolving the proceeding subject to Southern
    Company’s agreement to accept certain modifications to the
    settlement’s terms. On October 20, 2006, Southern
    Company notified the FERC that it accepted the modifications.
    The modifications largely involve functional separation and
    information restrictions related to marketing activities
    conducted on behalf of Southern Power. Southern Company filed
    with the FERC on November 6, 2006 an implementation plan to
    comply with the modifications set forth in the order. The impact
    of the modifications is not expected to have a material impact
    on the Company’s financial statements.

Generation
    Interconnection Agreements

In July 2003, the FERC issued its final rule on the
    standardization of generation interconnection agreements and
    procedures (Order 2003). Order 2003 shifts much of the financial
    burden of new transmission investment from the generator to the
    transmission provider. The FERC has indicated that Order 2003,
    which was effective January 20, 2004, is to be applied
    prospectively to new generating facilities interconnecting to a
    transmission system. Order 2003 was affirmed by the
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
    on January 12, 2007. The

II-180


NOTES

    Annual Report

cost impact resulting from Order 2003 will vary on a

case-by-case

basis for each new generator interconnecting to the transmission
    system.

On November 22, 2004, generator company subsidiaries of
    Tenaska, Inc. (Tenaska), as counterparties to three previously
    executed interconnection agreements with subsidiaries of
    Southern Company, including the Company, filed complaints at the
    FERC requesting that the FERC modify the agreements and that the
    Company refund a total of $7.9 million previously paid for
    interconnection facilities, with interest. Southern Company has
    also received requests for similar modifications from other
    entities, though no other complaints are pending with the FERC.
    On January 19, 2007, the FERC issued an order granting
    Tenaska’s requested relief. Although the FERC’s order
    requires the modification of Tenaska’s interconnection
    agreements, the order reduces the amount of the refund that had
    been requested by Tenaska. As a result, the Company estimates
    indicate that no refund is due Tenaska. Southern Company has
    requested rehearing of the FERC’s order. The final outcome
    of this matter cannot now be determined.

Right of
    Way Litigation

Southern Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including the
    Company, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Telecom,
    have been named as defendants in numerous lawsuits brought by
    landowners since 2001. The plaintiffs’ lawsuits claim that
    defendants may not use, or sublease to third parties, some or
    all of the fiber optic communications lines on the rights of way
    that cross the plaintiffs’ properties and that such actions
    exceed the easements or other property rights held by
    defendants. The plaintiffs assert claims for, among other
    things, trespass and unjust enrichment, and seek compensatory
    and punitive damages and injunctive relief. Management believes
    that the Company has complied with applicable laws and that the
    plaintiffs’ claims are without merit.

In January 2005, the Superior Court of Decatur County, Georgia
    granted partial summary judgment in a lawsuit brought by
    landowners against the Company based on the plaintiffs’
    declaratory judgment claim that the easements do not permit
    general telecommunications use. The court also dismissed
    Southern Telecom from this case. The Company appealed this
    ruling to the Georgia Court of Appeals. The Georgia Court of
    Appeals reversed, in part, the trial court’s order and
    remanded the case to the trial court for the determination of
    further issues. After the Court of Appeals’ decision, the
    plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied,
    and a petition for certiorari to the Georgia Supreme Court,
    which was also denied. On October 10, 2006, the Superior
    Court of Decatur County, Georgia granted the Company’s
    motion for summary judgment. The period during which the
    plaintiff could have appealed has expired. This matter is now
    concluded.

In addition, in late 2001, certain subsidiaries of Southern
    Company, including Alabama Power, the Company, Gulf Power,
    Mississippi Power, Savannah Electric, and Southern Telecom, were
    named as defendants in a lawsuit brought by a telecommunications
    company that uses certain of the defendants’ rights of way.
    This lawsuit alleges, among other things, that the defendants
    are contractually obligated to indemnify, defend, and hold
    harmless the telecommunications company from any liability that
    may be assessed against it in pending and future right of way
    litigation. The Company believes that the plaintiff’s
    claims are without merit. In the fall of 2004, the trial court
    stayed the case until resolution of the underlying landowner
    litigation discussed above. In January 2005, the Georgia Court
    of Appeals dismissed the telecommunications company’s
    appeal of the trial court’s order for lack of jurisdiction.
    An adverse outcome in this matter, combined with an adverse
    outcome against the telecommunications company in one or more of
    the right of way lawsuits, could result in substantial
    judgments; however, the final outcome of these matters cannot
    now be determined.

Property
    Tax Dispute

The Company is involved in a property tax dispute with Monroe
    County, Georgia (Monroe County). The Monroe County Board of Tax
    Assessors (Monroe Board) has issued assessments reflecting
    substantial increases in the ad valorem tax valuation of the
    Company’s 22.95 percent ownership interest in Plant
    Scherer, which is located in Monroe County, for tax years 2003,
    2004, and 2005. The Company is aggressively pursuing
    administrative appeals in Monroe County and has filed notices of
    arbitration for all three years. The appeals are currently
    stayed, pending the outcome of the litigation discussed below.

In November 2004, the Company filed suit, on its behalf, against
    the Monroe Board in the Superior Court of Monroe County. The
    Company requests injunctive relief prohibiting Monroe County and
    the Monroe Board from unlawfully changing the value of Plant
    Scherer and ultimately collecting additional ad valorem taxes
    from the Company. On December 22, 2005, the court granted
    Monroe County’s motion for summary judgment. The Company
    has filed an appeal of the Superior Court’s decision to the
    Georgia Supreme Court.

Retail
    Regulatory Matters

Merger

Effective July 1, 2006, Savannah Electric was merged into
    the Company. Prior to the merger, Southern Company was the sole
    common shareholder of both the Company and Savannah Electric. At
    the time of the merger, each outstanding share of Savannah
    Electric common stock was cancelled and Southern Company was
    issued an additional 1,500,000 shares of the Company’s
    common stock, no par value per share. In addition, at the time
    of the merger, each outstanding share of Savannah
    Electric’s preferred stock was cancelled and converted into
    the right to receive one share of the Company’s

    transaction for purposes of the statements of cash flows.
    Following completion of the merger, the outstanding capital
    stock of the Company consists of 9,261,500 shares of common
    stock, all of which are held by Southern Company, and
    1,800,000 shares of Class A Preferred Stock.

With respect to the merger, the Georgia PSC voted on
    June 15, 2006 to set a Merger Transition Adjustment (MTA)
    applicable to customers in the former Savannah Electric service
    territory so that the fuel rate that became effective on
    July 1, 2006 plus the MTA equals the applicable fuel rate
    paid by such customers as of June 30, 2006. See “Fuel
    Cost Recovery” below for additional information. Amounts
    collected under the MTA are being credited to customers in the
    original Georgia Power service territory through a Merger
    Transition Credit (MTC). The MTA and the MTC will be in effect
    until December 31, 2007, when the Company’s base rates
    are scheduled to be adjusted.

Rate
    Plans

In December 2004, the Georgia PSC approved the 2004 Retail Rate
    Plan for the Company. Under the terms of the 2004 Retail Rate
    Plan, the Company’s earnings are evaluated against a retail
    return on equity (ROE) range of 10.25 percent to
    12.25 percent. Two-thirds of any earnings above
    12.25 percent will be applied to rate refunds, with the
    remaining one-third retained by the Company. Retail rates and
    customer fees increased by approximately $203 million
    effective January 1, 2005 to cover the higher costs of
    purchased power, operating and maintenance expenses,
    environmental compliance, and continued investment in new
    generation, transmission, and distribution facilities to support
    growth and ensure reliability. In 2007, the Company will refund
    2005 earnings above 12.25 percent retail ROE. No refunds
    are anticipated for 2006.

In connection with the 2004 Retail Rate Plan, the Georgia PSC
    approved the transfer of the Plant McIntosh construction project
    from Southern Power at a total fair market value of
    approximately $385 million. This value reflected an
    approximate $16 million disallowance and reduced the
    Company’s net income by approximately $9.5 million.
    The Georgia PSC also certified a total completion cost not to
    exceed $547 million for the project. In June 2005, Plant
    McIntosh units 10 and 11 were placed into service at a total
    cost that did not exceed the certified amount. Under the 2004
    Retail Rate Plan, the Plant McIntosh revenue requirements impact
    is being reflected in the Company’s rates evenly over the
    three years ending December 31, 2007.

In May 2005, the Georgia PSC approved a new three-year rate plan
    for the former Savannah Electric ending May 31, 2008. Under
    the terms of the plan, earnings were evaluated against a retail
    ROE range of 9.75 percent to 11.75 percent. Retail
    base revenues increased in June 2005 by approximately
    $9.6 million.

The Company is required to file a general rate case by
    July 1, 2007, in response to which the Georgia PSC would be
    expected to determine whether the 2004 Retail Rate Plan should
    be continued, modified, or discontinued. In connection with this
    case, the former Savannah Electric’s base rate tariffs will
    be combined with the Company’s.

Under the terms of the 2001 Retail Rate Plan, earnings were
    evaluated against a retail return on common equity range of
    10 percent to 12.95 percent. The Company’s
    earnings in all three years were within the common equity range.
    Under the 2001 Retail Rate Plan, the Company amortized a
    regulatory liability of $333 million, related to previously
    recorded accelerated amortization expenses, equally over three
    years beginning in 2002. Also, the 2001 Retail Rate Plan
    required the Company to recognize capacity and operating and
    maintenance costs related to certified purchase power

Fuel
    Cost Recovery

The Company has established fuel cost recovery rates approved by
    the Georgia PSC. In March 2006, the Company and Savannah
    Electric filed a combined request for fuel cost recovery rate
    changes with the Georgia PSC to be effective July 1, 2006,
    concurrent with the merger of the companies. On June 15,
    2006, the Georgia PSC ruled on the request and approved an
    increase in the Company’s total annual fuel billings of
    approximately $400 million. The Georgia PSC order provided
    for a combined ongoing fuel forecast but reduced the requested
    increase related to such forecast by $200 million. The
    order also required the Company to file for a new fuel cost
    recovery rate on a semi-annual basis, beginning in September
    2006. Accordingly, on September 15, 2006, the Company filed
    a request to recover fuel costs incurred through August 2006 by
    increasing the fuel cost recovery rate. On November 13,
    2006, under agreement with the Georgia PSC staff, the Company
    filed a supplementary request reflecting a forecast of annual
    fuel costs, as well as updated information for previously
    incurred fuel costs.

On February 6, 2007, the Georgia PSC approved an increase
    in the Company’s total annual billings of approximately
    $383 million. The Georgia PSC order reduced the
    Company’s requested increase in the forecast of annual fuel
    costs by $40 million and disallowed $4 million of
    previously incurred fuel costs. The order also requires the
    Company to file for a new fuel cost recovery rate no later than
    March 1, 2008. Estimated under recovered fuel costs through
    February 2007 are to be recovered through May 2009 for customers
    in the original Georgia Power territory and through November
    2009 for customers in the former Savannah Electric territory. As
    of December 31, 2006, the Company had an under recovered
    fuel balance of approximately $898 million, of which
    approximately $544 million is included in deferred charges
    and other assets in the balance sheets.

In May 2005, the Georgia PSC approved the Company’s request
    to increase customer fuel rates by approximately
    9.5 percent to recover under recovered fuel costs of
    approximately $508 million existing as of May 31, 2005
    over a four-year period that began June 1, 2005.

In November 2005, the Georgia PSC voted to approve Savannah
    Electric’s request to increase customer rates to recover
    estimated under recovered fuel cost of approximately
    $71.8 million as of November 30, 2005 over an
    estimated four-year period beginning December 1, 2005, as
    well as future projected fuel costs.

Fuel
    Hedging Program

In 2003, the Georgia PSC approved an order allowing the Company
    to implement a natural gas and oil procurement and hedging
    program. This order allows the Company to use financial
    instruments to hedge price and commodity risk associated with
    these fuels. The order limits the program in terms of time,
    volume, dollars, and physical amounts hedged. The costs of the
    program, including any net losses, are recovered as a fuel cost
    through the fuel cost recovery clause. Annual net financial
    gains from the hedging program, through June 30, 2006, were
    shared with the retail customers receiving 75 percent and
    the Company retaining 25 percent of the total net gains.
    Effective July 1, 2006, the Georgia PSC ordered the
    suspension of the profit sharing framework related to the fuel
    hedging program. New profit sharing arrangements as well as
    other changes to the fuel hedging program are currently under
    development. In 2005, the Company had a total net gain of
    $74.6 million, of which the Company retained
    $18.6 million. The Company had no net gains in 2004 or 2006.

JOINT
    OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS

The Company and an affiliate, Alabama Power, own equally all of
    the outstanding capital stock of SEGCO which owns electric
    generating units with a total rated capacity of 1,020 megawatts,
    as well as associated transmission facilities. The capacity of
    the units has been sold equally to the Company and Alabama Power
    under a contract which, in substance, requires payments
    sufficient to provide for the operating expenses, taxes, debt
    service, and return on investment, whether or not SEGCO has any
    capacity and energy available. The term of the contract extends
    automatically for two-year periods, subject to either
    party’s right to cancel upon two year’s notice.

INCOME
    TAXES

Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return
    and combined income tax returns for the States of Alabama,
    Georgia, and Mississippi. Under a joint consolidated income tax
    allocation agreement, each subsidiary’s current and
    deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis and no
    subsidiary is allocated more expense than would be paid if they
    filed a separate income tax return. In accordance with IRS
    regulations, each company is jointly and severally liable for
    the tax liability.

In 2004, in order to avoid the loss of certain federal income
    tax credits related to the production of synthetic fuel,
    Southern Company chose to defer certain deductions otherwise
    available to the subsidiaries. The cash flow benefit associated
    with the utilization of the tax credits was allocated to the
    subsidiary that otherwise would have claimed the available
    deductions on a separate company basis without the deferral.
    This allocation concurrently reduced the tax benefit of the
    credits allocated to those subsidiaries that generated the
    credits. As the deferred expenses are deducted, the benefit of
    the tax credits will be repaid to the subsidiaries that
    generated the tax credits. The Company has recorded
    $9.2 million payable to these subsidiaries in Accumulated
    Deferred Income Taxes on the balance sheets at December 31,
    2006.

The transfer of the Plant McIntosh construction project from
    Southern Power to the Company resulted in a deferred gain to
    Southern Power for federal income tax purposes. The Company will
    reimburse Southern Power for the remaining balance of the
    related deferred taxes of $5.0 million reflected in
    Southern Power’s future taxable income. $4.5 million
    of this payable to Southern Power is included in Other Deferred
    Credits and $0.5 million is included in Affiliated Accounts
    Payable in the balance sheets at December 31, 2006.

The transfer of the Dahlberg, Wansley, and Franklin projects to
    Southern Power from the Company in 2001 and 2002 also resulted
    in a deferred gain for federal income tax purposes. Southern
    Power will reimburse the Company for the remaining balance of
    the related deferred taxes of $10.0 million reflected in
    the Company’s future taxable income. $8.7 million of
    this receivable from Southern Power is included in Other
    Deferred Debits and $1.3 million is included in Affiliated
    Accounts Receivable in the balance sheets at December 31,
    2006.

At December 31, 2006, tax-related regulatory assets were
    $511 million and tax-related regulatory liabilities were
    $157 million. The assets are attributable to tax benefits
    flowed through to customers in prior years and to taxes
    applicable to capitalized interest. The liabilities are
    attributable to deferred taxes previously recognized at rates
    higher than current enacted tax law and to unamortized
    investment tax credits.

    depreciation in the statements of income. Credits amortized in
    this manner amounted to $13.0 million in 2006, 2005, and
    2004. At December 31, 2006, all investment tax credits
    available to reduce federal income taxes payable had been

    December 31, 2006 when compared to 2005. The Company has
    also filed similar claims for the years 2001 through 2004.
    Amounts recorded in the Company’s financial statements for
    the year ended December 31, 2006 related to these claims
    are not material. The Georgia Department of Revenue is currently
    reviewing these claims. If approved as filed, such claims could
    have a significant, and possibly material, effect on the
    Company’s net income. The ultimate outcome of this matter
    cannot now be determined.

Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts

The Company has formed certain wholly owned trust subsidiaries
    for the purpose of issuing preferred securities. The proceeds of
    the related equity investments and preferred security sales were
    loaned back to the Company through the issuance of junior
    subordinated notes totaling $969 million, which constitute
    substantially all of the assets of these trusts and are
    reflected in the balance sheets as Long-term Debt Payable to
    Affiliated Trusts. The Company considers that the mechanisms and
    obligations relating to the preferred securities issued for its
    benefit, taken together, constitute a full and unconditional
    guarantee by it of the respective trusts’ payment
    obligations with respect to these securities. At
    December 31, 2006, preferred securities of
    $940 million were outstanding. See Note 1 under
    “Variable Interest Entities” for additional
    information on the accounting treatment for these trusts and the
    related securities.

    $115 million in 2011.

Pollution
    Control Bonds

Pollution control obligations represent loans to the Company
    from public authorities of funds derived from sales by such
    authorities of revenue bonds issued to finance pollution control
    facilities. The Company is required to make payments sufficient
    for the authorities to meet principal and interest requirements
    of such bonds. The Company has incurred obligations in
    connection with the sale by public authorities of tax-exempt
    pollution control revenue bonds. The amount of tax-exempt
    pollution control revenue bonds outstanding at December 31,
    2006 was $1.7 billion.

Senior
    Notes

The Company issued $150 million aggregate principal amount
    of unsecured senior notes in 2006. The proceeds of the issuance
    were used to repay a portion of the Company’s short term
    indebtedness. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company
    had $2.8 billion and $2.8 billion of senior notes
    outstanding, respectively. These senior notes are effectively
    subordinated to all secured debt of the Company.

Capital
    Leases

Assets acquired under capital leases are recorded in the balance
    sheets as utility plant in service, and the related obligations
    are classified as long-term debt. At December 31, 2006 and
    2005, the Company had a capitalized lease obligation for its
    corporate headquarters building of $72 million and
    $74 million, respectively, with an interest rate of
    8.1 percent. For ratemaking purposes, the Georgia PSC has
    treated the lease as an operating lease and has allowed only the
    lease payments in cost of service. The difference between the
    accrued expense and the lease payments allowed for ratemaking
    purposes has been deferred and is being amortized to expense as
    ordered by the Georgia PSC. See Note 1 under
    “Regulatory Assets and Liabilities.” At
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had capitalized
    lease obligations for its Plant Kraft coal unloading dock and
    its vehicles of $4.1 million and $5.1 million,
    respectively. However, for ratemaking purposes, these
    obligations are treated as operating leases and, as such, lease
    payments are charged to expense as incurred. The annual expense
    incurred for these leases in 2006, 2005, and 2004 was
    $9.6 million, $9.7 million, and $9.6 million,
    respectively.

Bank
    Credit Arrangements

At the beginning of 2007, the Company had credit arrangements
    with banks totaling $910 million, of which
    $904 million was unused. Of these facilities,
    $40 million expires during 2007, with the remaining
    $870 million expiring in 2011. The facilities that expire
    in 2007 provide the option of converting borrowings into a
    two-year term loan. The Company expects to renew its facilities,
    as needed, prior to expiration. The agreements contain stated
    borrowing rates. All the agreements require payment of
    commitment fees based on the unused portion of the commitments
    or the maintenance of compensating balances with the banks.
    Commitment fees are less than 1/8 of 1 percent for the
    Company. Compensating balances are not legally restricted from
    withdrawal.

NOTES

(continued)

Georgia Power Company 2006
    Annual Report

The credit arrangements contain covenants that limit the level
    of indebtedness to capitalization to 65 percent, as defined
    in the arrangements. For purposes of these definitions,
    indebtedness excludes the long-term debt payable to affiliated
    trusts. In addition, the credit arrangements contain cross
    default provisions that would trigger an event of default if the
    Company defaulted on other indebtedness above a specified
    threshold. At December 31, 2006, the Company was in
    compliance with all such covenants. None of the arrangements
    contain material adverse change clauses at the time of
    borrowings.

The $904 million in unused credit arrangements provides
    liquidity support to the Company’s variable rate pollution
    control bonds. The amount of variable rate pollution control
    bonds outstanding requiring liquidity support as of
    December 31, 2006 was $112 million. In addition, the
    Company borrows under a commercial paper program and an
    extendible commercial note program. The amount of commercial
    paper outstanding at December 31, 2006 was
    $733 million. The amount of commercial paper outstanding at
    December 31, 2005 was $327 million. There were no
    outstanding extendible commercial notes at December 31,
    2006. Commercial paper is included in notes payable on the
    balance sheets.

During 2006, the peak amount of short-term debt outstanding was
    $757 million and the average amount outstanding was
    $549 million. The average annual interest rate on
    short-term debt in 2006 was 5.1 percent.

Financial
    Instruments

The Company enters into energy-related derivatives to hedge
    exposures to electricity, gas, and other fuel price changes.
    However, due to cost-based rate regulations, the Company has
    limited exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices
    and prices of electricity. See Note 3 under “Retail
    Regulatory Matters – Fuel Hedging Program” for
    information on the Company’s fuel hedging program. The
    Company also enters into hedges of forward electricity sales.
    There was no material ineffectiveness recorded in earnings in
    2006, 2005, and 2004.

At December 31, 2006, the fair value gains / (losses) of
    derivative energy contracts were reflected in the financial

The fair value gain or loss for hedges that are recoverable

    assets and liabilities and are recognized in earnings at the
    same time the hedged items affect earnings. The Company has
    energy-related hedges in place up to and including 2009.

The Company enters into derivatives to hedge exposure to
    interest rate changes. Derivatives related to variable rate
    securities or forecasted transactions are accounted for as cash
    flow hedges. The derivatives employed as hedging instruments are
    structured to minimize ineffectiveness. As such, no material
    ineffectiveness has been recorded in earnings. Subsequent to
    December 31, 2006, the Company entered into
    $375 million notional amounts of interest rate swaps to
    hedge unfavorable changes in interest rates. The hedges will be
    terminated at the time the underlying debt is issued. In
    addition to interest rate swaps, the Company has also entered
    into certain option agreements that effectively cap its interest
    rate exposure in return for payment of a premium. In some cases,
    costless collars have been used that effectively establish a
    floor and a ceiling to interest rate expense.

At December 31, 2006, the Company had $1.2 billion
    notional amounts of interest derivatives accounted for as cash
    flow hedges outstanding with net fair value gains as follows:

The fair value gain or loss for cash flow hedges is recorded in

    the same time the hedged items affect earnings. In 2006, 2005,
    and 2004, the Company settled gains (losses) totaling
    $(3.9) million, $0.9 million, and
    $(12.4) million, respectively, upon termination of certain

COMMITMENTS

Construction
    Program

The Company currently estimates property additions to be
    approximately $1.9 billion, $1.8 billion, and
    $1.8 billion in 2007, 2008, and 2009, respectively. These
    amounts include $94 million, $73 million, and
    $88 million in 2007, 2008, and 2009, respectively, for
    construction expenditures related to contractual purchase
    commitments for uranium and nuclear fuel conversion, enrichment,
    and fabrication services included under “Fuel
    Commitments” herein. The construction program is subject to
    periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may
    vary from estimates because of numerous factors, including, but
    not limited to, changes in business conditions, changes in FERC
    rules and regulations, revised load growth estimates, changes in
    environmental regulations, changes in existing nuclear plants to
    meet new regulatory requirements, increasing costs of labor,
    equipment, and materials, and cost of capital. At
    December 31, 2006, significant purchase commitments were
    outstanding in connection with the construction program.

Long-Term
    Service Agreements

The Company has entered into a Long-Term Service Agreement
    (LTSA) with General Electric (GE) for the purpose of securing
    maintenance support for the combustion turbines at the Plant
    McIntosh combined cycle facility. In summary, the LTSA
    stipulates that GE will perform all planned inspections on the
    covered equipment, which includes the cost of all labor and
    materials. GE is also obligated to cover the costs of unplanned
    maintenance on the covered equipment subject to a limit
    specified in each contract.

In general, this LTSA is in effect through two major inspection
    cycles per unit. Scheduled payments to GE are made quarterly
    based on actual operating hours of the respective units. Total
    payments to GE under this agreement are currently estimated at
    $198.5 million over the remaining term of the agreement,
    which is currently projected to be approximately 12 years.
    However, the LTSA contains various cancellation provisions at
    the option of the Company.

The Company has also entered into an LTSA with GE through 2014
    for neutron monitoring system parts and electronics at Plant
    Hatch. Total remaining payments to GE under this agreement are
    currently estimated at $12.2 million. The contract contains
    cancellation provisions at the option of the Company.

Payments made to GE prior to the performance of any work are
    recorded as a prepayment in the balance sheets. Work performed
    by GE is capitalized or charged to expense as appropriate net of
    any joint owner billings, based on the nature of the work.

Fuel
    Commitments

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of its generating
    plants, the Company has entered into various long-term
    commitments for the procurement of fossil and nuclear fuel. In
    most cases, these contracts contain provisions for price
    escalations, minimum purchase levels, and other financial
    commitments. Coal commitments include forward contract purchases
    for sulfur dioxide emission allowances. Natural gas purchase
    commitments contain fixed volumes with prices based on various
    indices at the time of delivery. Amounts included in the chart
    below represent estimates based on New York Mercantile Exchange
    future prices at December 31, 2006.

Total estimated minimum long-term obligations at
    December 31, 2006 were as follows:

Company has entered into keep-well agreements with the Company
    and each of the other traditional operating companies to ensure
    they will not subsidize or be responsible for any costs, losses,
    liabilities, or damages resulting from the inclusion of Southern
    Power as a contracting party under these agreements.

Purchased
    Power Commitments

The Company has commitments regarding a portion of a
    5 percent interest in Plant Vogtle owned by MEAG that are
    in effect until the latter of the retirement of the plant or the
    latest stated maturity date of MEAG’s bonds issued to
    finance such ownership interest. The payments for capacity are
    required whether or not any capacity is available. The energy
    cost is a function of each unit’s variable operating costs.
    Except as noted below, the cost of such capacity and energy is
    included in purchased power from non-affiliates in the
    statements of income. Capacity payments totaled
    $49 million, $54 million, and $55 million in
    2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The current projected Plant
    Vogtle capacity payments are:

Operating
    Leases

The Company has entered into various operating leases with
    various terms and expiration dates. Rental expenses related to
    these operating leases totaled $33 million for 2006,
    $39 million for 2005, and $39 million for 2004.

At December 31, 2006, estimated minimum lease payments for
    these noncancelable operating leases were as follows:

In addition to the rental commitments above, the Company has
    obligations upon expiration of certain rail car leases with
    respect to the residual value of the leased property. These
    leases expire in 2011 and the Company’s maximum obligation
    is $64 million. At the termination of the leases, at the
    Company’s option, the Company may either exercise its
    purchase option or the property can be sold to a third party.
    The Company expects that the fair market value of the leased
    property would substantially reduce or eliminate the
    Company’s payments under the residual value obligation. A
    portion of the rail car lease obligations is shared with the
    joint owners of Plants Scherer and Wansley. Rental expenses
    related to the rail car leases are fully recoverable through the
    fuel cost recovery clause as ordered by the Georgia PSC.

Guarantees

Alabama Power has guaranteed unconditionally the obligation of
    SEGCO under an installment sale agreement for the purchase of
    certain pollution control facilities at SEGCO’s generating
    units, pursuant to which $24.5 million principal amount of
    pollution control revenue bonds are outstanding. Alabama Power
    has also guaranteed $50 million in senior notes issued by
    SEGCO. The Company has agreed to reimburse Alabama Power for the
    pro rata portion of such obligations corresponding to the
    Company’s then proportionate ownership of stock of SEGCO if
    Alabama Power is called upon to make such payment under its
    guaranty.

As discussed earlier in this note under “Operating
    Leases,” the Company has entered into certain residual
    value guarantees related to rail car leases.

STOCK
    OPTION PLAN

Southern Company provides non-qualified stock options to a large
    segment of the Company’s employees ranging from line
    management to executives. As of December 31, 2006, there
    were 1,651 current and former employees of the Company
    participating in the stock option plan. The maximum number of
    shares of Southern Company common stock that may be issued under
    these programs may not exceed 57 million. The prices of
    options granted to date have been at the fair market value of
    the shares on the dates of grant. Options granted to date become
    exercisable pro rata over a maximum period of three years from
    the date of grant. The Company generally recognizes stock option
    expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period which
    equates to the requisite service period; however for employees
    who are eligible for retirement the total cost is expensed at
    the grant date. Options outstanding will expire no later than
    10 years after the date of grant, unless terminated earlier
    by the Southern Company Board of Directors in accordance with
    the stock option plan. For certain stock option awards a change
    in control will provide accelerated vesting. As part of the
    adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), as discussed earlier in
    Note 1 under “Stock Options,” Southern Company
    has not modified its stock option plan or outstanding stock
    options, nor has it changed the underlying valuation assumptions
    used in valuing the stock options that were used under
    SFAS No. 123.

The Company’s activity in the stock option plan for 2006 is
    summarized below:

The number of stock options vested, and expected to vest in the
    future, at December 31, 2006 is not significantly different
    from the number of stock options outstanding at
    December 31, 2006 as stated above.

At December 31, 2006, the weighted average remaining
    contractual term for the options outstanding and options
    exercisable is 6.4 years and 5.3 years, respectively,
    and the aggregate intrinsic value for the options outstanding
    and options exercisable is $66 million and
    $55 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2006, there was $2.5 million of
    total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option
    awards not yet vested. That cost is expected to be recognized
    over a weighted-average period of approximately 11 months.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years
    ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 was
    $10 million, $24 million, and $16 million,
    respectively.

The actual tax benefit realized by the Company for the tax
    deductions from stock option exercises totaled $4 million,
    $9 million, and $6 million, respectively, for the
    years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004.

NUCLEAR
    INSURANCE

Under the Price-Anderson Amendments Act (Act), the Company
    maintains agreements of indemnity with the NRC that, together
    with private insurance, cover third-party liability arising from
    any nuclear incident occurring at the Company’s nuclear
    power plants. The Act provides funds up to $10.76 billion
    for public liability claims that could arise from a single
    nuclear incident. Each nuclear plant is insured against this
    liability to a maximum of $300 million by American Nuclear
    Insurers (ANI), with

II-190


NOTES

Georgia Power Company 2006
    Annual Report

the remaining coverage provided by a mandatory program of
    deferred premiums that could be assessed, after a nuclear
    incident, against all owners of nuclear reactors. A company
    could be assessed up to $101 million per incident for each
    licensed reactor it operates but not more than an aggregate of
    $15 million per incident to be paid in a calendar year for
    each reactor. Such maximum assessment for the Company, excluding
    any applicable state premium taxes, based on its ownership and
    buyback interests, is $203 million per incident but not
    more than an aggregate of $30 million to be paid for each
    incident in any one year.

The Company is a member of Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited
    (NEIL), a mutual insurer established to provide property damage
    insurance in an amount up to $500 million for members’
    nuclear generating facilities.

Additionally, the Company has policies that currently provide
    decontamination, excess property insurance, and premature
    decommissioning coverage up to $2.25 billion for losses in
    excess of the $500 million primary coverage. This excess
    insurance is also provided by NEIL.

NEIL also covers additional costs that would be incurred in
    obtaining replacement power during a prolonged accidental outage
    at a member’s nuclear plant. Members can purchase this
    coverage, subject to a deductible waiting period of up to
    26 weeks, with a maximum per occurrence per unit limit of
    $490 million. After the deductible period, weekly indemnity
    payments would be received until either the unit is operational
    or until the limit is exhausted in approximately three years.
    The Company purchases the maximum limit allowed by NEIL subject
    to ownership limitations and has elected a

12-week

waiting period.

Under each of the NEIL policies, members are subject to
    assessments if losses each year exceed the accumulated funds
    available to the insurer under that policy. The current maximum
    annual assessments for the Company under the NEIL policies would
    be $49 million.

Following the terrorist attacks of September 2001, both ANI and
    NEIL confirmed that terrorist acts against commercial nuclear
    power plants would, subject to the normal policy limits, be
    covered under their insurance. Both companies, however, revised
    their policy terms on a prospective basis to include an industry
    aggregate for all “non-certified” terrorist acts i.e.,
    acts that are not certified acts of terrorism pursuant to the
    Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, which was renewed in 2005.
    The aggregate for all NEIL policies, which applies to
    non-certified property claims stemming from terrorism within a

12-month

duration, is $3.24 billion plus any amounts available
    through reinsurance or indemnity from an outside source. The
    non-certified ANI nuclear liability cap is a $300 million
    shared industry aggregate during the normal ANI policy period.

For all

on-site

property damage insurance policies for commercial nuclear power
    plants, the NRC requires that the proceeds of such policies
    shall be dedicated first for the sole purpose of placing the
    reactor in a safe and stable condition after an accident. Any
    remaining proceeds are to be applied next toward the costs of
    decontamination and debris removal operations ordered by the
    NRC, and any further remaining proceeds are to be paid either to
    the Company or to its bond trustees as may be appropriate under
    the policies and applicable trust indentures.

All retrospective assessments, whether generated for liability,
    property, or replacement power, may be subject to applicable
    state premium taxes.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Gulf
    Power Company

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements
    of capitalization of Gulf Power Company (the
    “Company”) (a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern
    Company) as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related
    statements of income, comprehensive income, common
    stockholder’s equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2006. These
    financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to
    have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
    control over financial reporting. Our audits included
    consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a
    basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
    circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
    on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An
    audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
    supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
    the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
    our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements (pages II-215 to
    II-240) present fairly, in all material respects, the
    financial position of Gulf Power Company at December 31,
    2006 and 2005, and the results of its operations and its cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2006, in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America.

As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, in 2006
    Gulf Power Company changed its method of accounting for the
    funded status of defined benefit pension and other
    postretirement plans.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Gulf Power Company 2006 Annual
    Report

OVERVIEW

Business
    Activities

Gulf Power Company (the Company) operates as a vertically
    integrated utility providing electricity to retail customers
    within its traditional service area located in northwest Florida
    and to wholesale customers in the Southeast.

Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of
    the Company’s business of selling electricity. These
    factors include the ability to maintain a stable regulatory
    environment, to achieve energy sales growth, and to effectively
    manage and secure timely recovery of rising costs. These costs
    include those related to growing demand, increasingly stringent
    environmental standards, fuel prices, and storm restoration
    costs. Appropriately balancing environmental expenditures with
    customer prices will continue to challenge the Company for the
    foreseeable future.

Hurricanes Dennis and Katrina hit the Gulf Coast of Florida in
    July 2005 and August 2005, respectively, damaging portions of
    the Company’s service area. In September 2004, Hurricane
    Ivan hit the Gulf Coast of Florida, causing substantial damage
    within the Company’s service area. In 2005, the Florida
    Public Service Commission (PSC) issued an order (2005 Order)
    that approved a stipulation and settlement between the Company
    and several consumer groups and thereby authorized the recovery
    of the Company’s storm damage costs related to Hurricane
    Ivan through a two-year surcharge that began in April 2005. In
    July 2006, the Florida PSC issued an order (2006 Order)
    approving another stipulation and settlement between the Company
    and several consumer groups and thereby authorized an extension
    of the storm-recovery surcharge currently being collected by the
    Company for an additional 27 months, expiring in June 2009.
    See Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements under
    “Property Damage Reserve” and “Retail Regulatory
    Matters – Storm Damage Cost Recovery,”
    respectively, for additional information.

Key
    Performance Indicators

In striving to maximize shareholder value while providing
    cost-effective energy to over 415,000 customers, the Company
    continues to focus on several key indicators. These indicators
    include customer satisfaction, plant availability, system
    reliability, and net income after dividends on preferred and
    preference stock. The Company’s financial success is
    directly tied to the satisfaction of its customers. Key elements
    of ensuring customer satisfaction include outstanding service,
    high reliability, and competitive prices. Management uses
    customer satisfaction surveys and reliability indicators to
    evaluate the Company’s results.

Peak season equivalent forced outage rate (Peak Season EFOR) is
    an indicator of plant availability and efficient generation
    fleet operations during the months when generation needs are
    greatest. The rate is calculated by dividing the number of hours
    of forced outages by total generation hours. Transmission and
    distribution system reliability performance is measured by the
    frequency and duration of outages. Performance targets for
    reliability are set internally based on historical performance,
    expected weather conditions, and expected economic conditions.
    Net income is the primary component of the Company’s
    contribution to Southern Company’s earnings per share goal.

The Company’s 2006 results compared with its targets for
    some of these key indicators are reflected in the following
    chart:

    performance achieved in 2006 reflects the continued emphasis
    that management places on these indicators, as well as the
    commitment shown by employees in achieving or exceeding
    management’s expectations.

Earnings

The Company’s 2006 net income after dividends on
    preferred and preference stock was $76.0 million, an
    increase of $0.8 million from the previous year. In 2005,
    earnings were $75.2 million, an increase of
    $7.0 million from the previous year. In 2004, earnings were
    $68.2 million, a decrease of $0.8 million from the
    previous year. The increase in earnings in 2006 is due primarily
    to higher operating revenues partially offset by higher
    operating expenses, higher financing costs, and increases in
    depreciation expense. The increase in

II-196


MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

(continued)

Gulf Power Company 2006 Annual Report

earnings in 2005 was due primarily to higher retail sales and
    lower non-fuel operating expenses, excluding expenses related to
    Hurricane Ivan storm damage, which are offset by revenues and do
    not affect earnings. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL –
    “PSC Matters – Storm Damage Cost Recovery”
    herein. The decrease in earnings in 2004 was due primarily to
    higher operating expenses related to replenishing property
    damage reserves and increased expenses related to employee
    benefits.

    17.4 percent, in 2005, and $37.7 million, or
    5.4 percent, in 2004. The significant factors driving these
    changes are shown in the table above.

Fuel and other cost recovery includes recovery provisions for
    fuel expenses and the energy component of purchased power costs,
    energy conservation costs, purchased power capacity costs, and
    environmental compliance costs. Annually, the Company petitions
    for recovery of projected costs including any

true-up

amount from prior periods, and approved rates are implemented
    each January. Other cost recovery also includes revenues related
    to the recovery of incurred costs for storm damage activity as
    approved by the Florida PSC. The recovery provisions generally
    equal the related expenses and have no material effect on net
    income. See Note 1 to the financial statements under
    “Revenues,” “Property Damage Reserve,” and
    “Environmental Cost Recovery” and Note 3 to the
    financial statements under “Retail Regulatory
    Matters – Environmental Cost Recovery” and
    “– Storm Damage Cost Recovery” for
    additional information.

Total sales for resale were $205.2 million in 2006, an
    increase of $29.5 million, or 16.8 percent, compared
    to 2005, primarily due to increased energy sales to affiliates

to serve their territorial energy requirements. Total sales for
    resale were $175.7 million in 2005, a decrease of
    $8.1 million, or 4.4 percent, compared to 2004,
    primarily due to lower energy sales to affiliates resulting from
    decreases in the Company’s available generation as a result
    of outages at Plants Crist and Smith. Total sales for resale
    were $183.8 million in 2004, an increase of
    $43.8 million, or 31.3 percent, compared to 2003,
    primarily due to energy sales to affiliates at a higher unit
    cost resulting from higher incremental fuel prices.

Revenue from sales to affiliated companies will vary from year
    to year depending on demand and the availability and cost of
    generating resources at each company. These affiliate sales and
    purchases are made in accordance with the Intercompany
    Interchange Contract (IIC), as approved by the Federal Energy
    Regulatory Commission (FERC). These transactions do not have a
    significant impact on earnings, since the energy is generally
    sold at marginal cost and energy purchases are generally offset
    by revenues through the Company’s fuel cost recovery clause.

Sales for resale to non-affiliates are predominantly unit power
    sales under long-term contracts to other Florida utilities.
    Revenues from contracts have both capacity and energy
    components. Capacity revenues reflect the recovery of fixed
    costs and a return on investment under the contracts. Energy is
    generally sold at variable cost. The capacity and energy
    components under these unit power sales contracts were as
    follows:

    2004, respectively, primarily due to an increase in franchise
    fees, which are proportional to changes in revenue.

    compared to 2005, primarily due to more favorable weather
    conditions and customer growth. Commercial energy sales
    increased 1.1 percent in 2005, compared to 2004, primarily
    due to customer growth offset by unfavorable weather conditions.
    Commercial energy sales increased 2.2 percent in 2004,
    compared to 2003, primarily due to more favorable weather
    conditions and customer growth.

Industrial energy sales decreased 1.1 percent in 2006,
    compared to 2005, due to reduced demand for and production of
    building materials and a conversion project by a major paper
    manufacturer. Industrial energy sales increased 2.3 percent
    in 2005, compared to 2004, primarily due to additional sales to
    customers with gas-fired cogeneration resulting from high
    natural gas prices. Industrial energy sales decreased
    1.6 percent in 2004, compared to 2003, primarily due to the
    short-term outage experienced as a result of Hurricane Ivan in
    September 2004.

Sales for resale to non-affiliates decreased 9.4 percent in
    2006, increased 1.7 percent in 2005, and decreased
    9.9 percent in 2004, each compared to the prior year
    primarily as a result of fluctuations in the fuel cost to

(continued)

Gulf Power Company 2006 Annual Report

produce energy sold to non-affiliated utilities under both
    long-term and short-term contracts. The degree to which oil and
    natural gas prices, which are the primary fuel sources for these
    customers, differ from the Company’s fuel costs will
    influence these changes in sales. The fluctuations in sales have
    a minimal effect on earnings because the energy is generally
    sold at variable cost.

Sales for resale to affiliates increased 48.6 percent in
    2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to increased territorial
    energy requirements of affiliates. Sales for resale to
    affiliates decreased 36.8 percent in 2005 compared to 2004,
    due to decreases in the Company’s available generation as a
    result of outages at Plants Crist and Smith. Sales for resale
    increased 28.1 percent in 2004 compared to 2003, primarily
    to serve affiliates’ territorial energy requirements.

Expenses

Fuel
    and Purchased Power

Fuel costs constitute the single largest expense for the
    Company. The mix of fuel sources for generation of electricity
    is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel
    consumed, and the availability of generation resources. Details
    of the Company’s amount and sources of generation, the
    average cost of fuel per net KWH generated, and the average
    costs of purchased power were as follows:

Fuel expense was $535 million in 2006, an increase of
    $119.1 million, or 28.7 percent, above the prior year
    costs. This increase was the result of an $82.4 million
    increase in the cost of fuel and a $36.7 million increase
    related to total KWH generated. Fuel expense was
    $416 million in 2005, an increase of $48.6 million, or
    13.2 percent, above the prior year costs. This increase was
    the result of a $67.5 million increase in the cost of fuel
    and an $18.9 million decrease related to total KWH
    generated. Fuel expense was $367 million in 2004, an
    increase of $50.7 million, or 16 percent, above the
    prior year costs. This increase was the result of an
    $32.7 million increase in the cost of fuel and a
    $18 million increase related to total KWH generated.

Purchased power expense was $73.8 million in 2006, a
    decrease of $24.6 million, or 25.0 percent, below the
    prior year costs. This decrease was the result of a
    $24.9 million decrease in total KWH purchased and a
    $0.3 million increase resulting from the higher average
    cost per net KWH. Purchased power expense was $98.4 million
    in 2005, an increase of $32.5 million, or
    49.3 percent, above the prior year costs. This increase was
    the result of a $7.6 million decrease in total KWH
    purchased and a $40.1 million increase resulting from the
    higher average cost per net KWH. Purchased power expense was
    $65.9 million in 2004, an increase of $15.7 million,
    or 31.4 percent, above the prior year costs. This increase
    was the result of a $6.6 million decrease in total KWH
    purchased and a $22.3 million increase resulting from the
    higher average cost per net KWH.

While prices have moderated somewhat in 2006, a significant
    upward trend in the cost of coal and natural gas has emerged
    since 2003, and volatility in these markets is expected to
    continue. Increased coal prices have been influenced by a
    worldwide increase in demand as a result of rapid economic
    growth in China, as well as by increases in mining and fuel
    transportation costs. Higher natural gas prices in the United
    States are the result of increased demand and slightly lower gas
    supplies despite increased drilling activity. Natural gas
    production and supply interruptions, such as those caused by the
    2004 and 2005 hurricanes, result in an immediate market
    response; however, the long-term impact of this price volatility
    may be reduced by imports of liquefied natural gas if new
    liquefied gas facilities are built. Fuel expenses generally do
    not affect net income, since they are offset by fuel revenues
    under the Company’s fuel cost recovery provisions. See
    FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “PSC
    Matters – Fuel Cost Recovery” herein and
    Note 3 to the financial statements for additional
    information.

Other
    Operations and Maintenance

In 2006, other operations and maintenance expense increased
    $9.7 million, or 3.9 percent, compared to the prior
    year primarily due to a $4.2 million increase in the

II-199


MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

Gulf Power Company 2006 Annual Report

recovery of incurred costs for storm damage activity as approved
    by the Florida PSC, a $1.9 million increase in employee
    benefit expenses, and a $1.1 million increase in property
    insurance costs. In 2005, other operations and maintenance
    expense increased $20.1 million, or 8.7 percent,
    compared to the prior year primarily due to the recovery of
    $20.4 million in Hurricane Ivan restoration costs as
    approved by the Florida PSC. Since these storm damage expenses
    are recognized as revenues are recorded, there is no impact on
    net income. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “PSC
    Matters – Storm Damage Cost Recovery” herein and
    Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail
    Regulatory Matters – Storm Damage Cost Recovery”
    for additional information. In 2004, other operations and
    maintenance expense increased $19.0 million, or
    9.0 percent, compared to the prior year primarily due to
    increases of $7.9 million in the property damage reserve,
    $2.9 million in the accrued expenses for uninsured
    litigation and workers compensation claims, $3.4 million
    for employee benefit expenses, and $2.5 million for
    production expenses. See Notes 1 and 3 to the financial
    statements under “Property Damage Reserve” and
    “Retail Regulatory Matters – Storm Damage Cost
    Recovery,” respectively, for additional information on the
    property damage reserve.

Depreciation
    and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expense increased
    $4.2 million, or 4.9 percent, in 2006 compared to the
    prior year primarily due to the construction of environmental
    control projects at Plants Crist and Daniel that were placed in
    service in 2005. Depreciation and amortization expense increased
    $2.2 million, or 2.7 percent, in 2005 compared to the
    prior year primarily due to the completion of environmental
    control projects at Plant Crist Unit 7. Depreciation and
    amortization expense remained relatively flat in 2004 compared
    to the prior year due to no significant change in depreciable
    assets.

Taxes
    Other Than Income Taxes

Taxes other than income taxes increased $3.4 million, or
    4.5 percent, in 2006, $6.5 million, or
    9.3 percent, in 2005, and $3.7 million, or
    5.7 percent, in 2004 primarily due to increases in
    franchise and gross receipts taxes, which are directly related
    to the increase in retail revenues.

Other
    Income and (Expense)

Allowance
    for Equity Funds Used During Construction

Allowance for equity funds used during construction (AFUDC)
    decreased $0.8 million, or 68.9 percent, in 2006
    compared to the prior year primarily due to the completion of an
    environmental control project at Plant Crist Unit 7. AFUDC
    decreased $0.7 million, or 37.1 percent, in 2005 and
    increased $1.1 million, or 160.7 percent, in 2004
    compared to the prior year primarily due to the construction and
    completion of an environmental control project at Plant Crist
    Unit 7. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL –
    “Environmental Matters – Environmental Statutes
    and Regulations” herein and Note 1 to the financial
    statements under “Allowance for Funds Used During
    Construction (AFUDC)” for additional information.

Interest
    Income

Interest income increased $1.4 million, or
    37.4 percent, in 2006 compared to the prior year primarily
    due to interest received related to the recovery of financing
    costs associated with the fuel clause and incurred costs for
    storm damage activity as approved by the Florida PSC. Interest
    income increased $2.6 million, or 210.9 percent, in
    2005 compared to the prior year primarily due to interest
    received from a tax refund resulting from Hurricane Ivan and
    interest received related to the recovery of financing costs
    associated with Hurricane Ivan. See FUTURE EARNINGS
    POTENTIAL – “Storm Damage Cost Recovery”
    herein and Note 3 to the financial statements under
    “Retail Regulatory Matters – Storm Damage Cost
    Recovery” for additional information. Interest income
    remained relatively flat in 2004 compared to the prior year.

Interest
    Expense

Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased
    $3.9 million, or 10.9 percent, in 2006 compared to the
    prior year as the result of higher interest rates on variable
    rate pollution control bonds, increased levels of short-term
    borrowings at higher interest rates, and the issuance of
    $60 million in senior notes in August 2005. These increases
    were partially offset by the maturity of a $100 million
    bank note in October 2005 and the extinguishment of
    $30 million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage
    bonds in 2005. Interest expense increased $4.2 million, or
    13.5 percent, in 2005 compared to the prior year as the
    result of higher interest rates on variable rate pollution
    control bonds and an increase in outstanding short-term
    indebtedness as a result of hurricane-related costs. Interest
    expense decreased $2.1 million, or 5.5 percent, in
    2004 compared to the prior year primarily as the result of
    refinancing higher cost securities.

Other
    Deductions

Other deductions increased $1.5 million, or
    52.9 percent, in 2006, decreased $1.4 million, or
    32.2 percent, in 2005, and $1.5 million, or
    25.7 percent, in 2004 compared to the prior years as a
    result of changes in charitable contributions.

Effects
    of Inflation

The Company is subject to rate regulation based on the recovery
    of historical costs. When historical costs are included, or when
    inflation exceeds projected costs used in rate regulation, the
    effects of inflation can create an economic loss since the
    recovery of costs could be in dollars that have less purchasing
    power. In addition, the income tax laws are based on historical
    costs. While the inflation rate has been relatively low in
    recent years, it continues to have an adverse effect on the
    Company because of the large investment in utility plant with
    long economic lives. Conventional accounting for historical cost
    does not recognize this economic loss nor the partially
    offsetting gain that arises through financing facilities with
    fixed-money obligations such as long-term debt and preferred
    securities. Any recognition of inflation by regulatory
    authorities is reflected in the rate of return allowed in the
    Company’s approved electric rates.

FUTURE
    EARNINGS POTENTIAL

General

The Company operates as a vertically integrated utility
    providing electricity to retail customers within its traditional
    service area located in northwest Florida and to wholesale
    customers in the Southeast. Prices for electricity provided by
    the Company to retail customers are set by the Florida PSC under
    cost-based regulatory principles. Prices for electricity
    relating to purchased power agreements (PPAs), interconnecting
    transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power are
    regulated by the FERC. Retail rates and earnings are reviewed
    and may be adjusted periodically within certain limitations. See
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES – “Application of Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates – Electric Utility
    Regulation” herein and Note 3 to the financial
    statements for additional information about regulatory matters.

The results of operations for the past three years are not
    necessarily indicative of future earnings potential. The level
    of the Company’s future earnings depends on numerous
    factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of
    the Company’s business of selling electricity. These
    factors include the ability of the Company to maintain a stable
    regulatory environment that continues to allow for the recovery
    of all prudently incurred costs during a time of increasing
    environmental and fuel costs. Future earnings in the near term
    will depend, in part, upon growth in energy sales, which is
    subject to a number of factors. These factors include weather,
    competition, new energy contracts with neighboring utilities,
    energy conservation practiced by customers, the price of
    electricity, the price elasticity of demand, and the rate of
    economic growth in the Company’s service area.

Environmental
    Matters

Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other
    environmental regulations could affect earnings if such costs
    cannot be fully recovered in rates on a timely basis.
    Environmental compliance spending over the next several years
    may exceed amounts estimated. Some of the factors driving the
    potential for such an increase are higher commodity costs,
    market demand for labor, and scope additions and clarifications.
    The timing, specific requirements, and estimated costs could
    also change as environmental regulations are modified. See
    Note 3 to the financial statements under
    “Environmental Matters” for additional information.

New
    Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
    brought a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the
    Northern District of Georgia against certain Southern Company
    subsidiaries, including Alabama Power and Georgia Power,
    alleging that these subsidiaries had violated the New Source
    Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act and related state
    laws at certain coal-fired generating facilities. Through
    subsequent amendments and other legal procedures, the EPA filed
    a separate action in January 2001 against Alabama Power in the
    U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama
    after Alabama Power was dismissed from the original action. In
    these lawsuits, the EPA alleged that NSR violations occurred at
    eight coal-fired generating facilities operated by Alabama Power
    and Georgia Power (including a facility formerly owned by
    Savannah Electric). The civil actions request penalties and
    injunctive relief, including an order requiring the installation
    of the best available control technology at the affected units.
    The EPA concurrently issued notices of violation relating to the
    Company’s Plant Crist and a unit partially owned by the
    Company at Plant Scherer. See Note 4 to the financial
    statements for information on the Company’s ownership
    interest in Plant Scherer Unit 3. In early 2000, the EPA filed a
    motion to amend its complaint to add the allegations in the
    notices

II-201


MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

Gulf Power Company 2006 Annual Report

of violation and to add the Company as a defendant. However, in
    March 2001, the court denied the motion based on lack of
    jurisdiction, and the EPA has not refiled.

On June 19, 2006, the U.S. District Court for the
    Northern District of Alabama entered a consent decree between
    Alabama Power and the EPA, resolving the alleged NSR violations
    at Plant Miller. The consent decree required Alabama Power to
    pay $100,000 to resolve the government’s claim for a civil
    penalty and to donate $4.9 million of sulfur dioxide
    emission allowances to a nonprofit charitable organization and
    formalized specific emissions reductions to be accomplished by
    Alabama Power, consistent with other Clean Air Act programs that
    require emissions reductions. On August 14, 2006, the
    district court in Alabama granted Alabama Power’s motion
    for summary judgment and entered final judgment in favor of
    Alabama Power on the EPA’s claims related to Plants Barry,
    Gaston, Gorgas, and Greene County. The plaintiffs have appealed
    this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
    Circuit and, on November 14, 2006, the Eleventh Circuit
    granted the plaintiffs’ request to stay the appeal, pending
    the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in a similar NSR case
    filed by the EPA against Duke Energy. The action against Georgia
    Power has been administratively closed since the spring of 2001,
    and none of the parties has sought to reopen the case.

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and
    the EPA regulations and interpretations in effect at the time
    the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act authorizes
    maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $32,500 per day, per
    violation at each generating unit, depending on the date of the
    alleged violation. An adverse outcome in this matter could
    require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be
    determined at this time and could possibly require payment of
    substantial penalties. Such expenditures could affect future
    results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition if
    such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

The EPA has issued a series of proposed and final revisions to
    its NSR regulations under the Clean Air Act, many of which have
    been subject to legal challenges by environmental groups and
    states. On June 24, 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals
    for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld, in part, the
    EPA’s revisions to NSR regulations that were issued in
    December 2002 but vacated portions of those revisions addressing
    the exclusion of certain pollution control projects. These
    regulatory revisions have been adopted by the State of Florida.
    On March 17, 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
    District of Columbia Circuit also vacated an EPA rule which
    sought to clarify the scope of the existing Routine Maintenance,
    Repair and Replacement exclusion. In October 2005 and September
    2006, the EPA also published proposed rules clarifying the test
    for determining when an emissions increase subject to the NSR
    permitting requirements has occurred. The impact of these
    proposed rules will depend on adoption of the final rules by the
    EPA and the State of Florida’s implementation of such
    rules, as well as the outcome of any additional legal
    challenges, and, therefore, cannot be determined at this time.

Carbon
    Dioxide Litigation

In July 2004, attorneys general from eight states, each outside
    of Southern Company’s service territory, and the
    corporation counsel for New York City filed a complaint in the
    U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York
    against Southern Company and four other electric power
    companies. A nearly identical complaint was filed by three
    environmental groups in the same court. The complaints allege
    that the companies’ emissions of carbon dioxide, a
    greenhouse gas, contribute to global warming, which the
    plaintiffs assert is a public nuisance. Under common law public
    and private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs seek a judicial
    order (1) holding each defendant jointly and severally
    liable for creating, contributing to,

and/or

maintaining global warming and (2) requiring each of the
    defendants to cap its emissions of carbon dioxide and then
    reduce those emissions by a specified percentage each year for
    at least a decade. Plaintiffs have not, however, requested that
    damages be awarded in connection with their claims. Southern
    Company believes these claims are without merit and notes that
    the complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis for the
    claims. In September 2005, the U.S. District Court for the
    Southern District of New York granted Southern Company’s
    and the other defendants’ motions to dismiss these cases.
    The plaintiffs filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals
    for the Second Circuit in October 2005. The ultimate outcome of
    these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Environmental
    Statutes and Regulations

General

The Company’s operations are subject to extensive
    regulation by state and federal environmental agencies under a
    variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental
    media, including air, water, and land resources. Applicable
    statutes include the Clean Air Act;

II-202


MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

(continued)

Gulf Power Company 2006 Annual Report

the Clean Water Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
    Compensation, and Liability Act; the Resource Conservation and
    Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Emergency
    Planning & Community

Right-to-Know

Act; and the Endangered Species Act.

Compliance with these environmental requirements involves
    significant capital and operating costs, a major portion of
    which is expected to be recovered through existing ratemaking
    provisions. Through 2006, the Company had invested approximately
    $299 million in capital projects to comply with these
    requirements, with annual totals of $46 million,
    $45 million, and $67 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004,
    respectively. The Company expects that capital expenditures to
    assure compliance with existing and new regulations will be an
    additional $171 million, $378 million, and
    $300 million for 2007, 2008, and 2009, respectively.
    Because the Company’s compliance strategy is impacted by
    changes to existing environmental laws and regulations, the
    cost, availability, and existing inventory of emission
    allowances, and the Company’s fuel mix, the ultimate
    outcome cannot be determined at this time. Environmental costs
    that are known and estimable at this time are included in
    capital expenditures discussed under FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    LIQUIDITY – “Capital Requirements and Contractual
    Obligations” herein.

The Florida Legislature has adopted legislation that allows a
    utility to petition the Florida PSC for recovery of prudent
    environmental compliance costs that are not being recovered
    through base rates or any other recovery mechanism. The
    legislation is discussed in Note 3 to the financial
    statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters –
    Environmental Cost Recovery.” Substantially all of the
    costs for the Clean Air Act and other new environmental
    legislation discussed below are expected to be recovered through
    the environmental cost recovery clause.

Compliance with possible additional federal or state legislation
    or regulations related to global climate change, air quality, or
    other environmental and health concerns could also significantly
    affect the Company. New environmental legislation or
    regulations, or changes to existing statutes or regulations,
    could affect many areas of the Company’s operations;
    however, the full impact of any such changes cannot be
    determined at this time.

Air
    Quality

Compliance with the Clean Air Act and resulting regulations has
    been and will continue to be a significant focus for the
    Company. Through 2006, the Company had spent approximately
    $153.4 million in reducing sulfur dioxide
    (SO


)
    and nitrogen oxide
    (NO

x

)
    emissions and in monitoring emissions pursuant to the Clean Air
    Act. Additional controls have been announced and are currently
    being installed at several plants to further reduce
    SO


,
    NO

x

,
    and mercury emissions, maintain compliance with existing
    regulations, and meet new requirements.

In 2006, the Company completed implementation of the terms of a
    2002 agreement with the State of Florida to help ensure
    attainment of the ozone standard in the Pensacola, Florida area.
    The conditions of the agreement, which required installing
    additional controls on certain units and retiring three older
    units at a plant near Pensacola, totaled approximately
    $133.8 million, and have been approved under the
    Company’s environmental cost recovery clause.

In 2005, the EPA revoked the

one-hour

ozone air quality standard and published the second of two sets
    of final rules for implementation of the new, more stringent

eight-hour

ozone standard. Macon, Georgia, where Plant Scherer is located,
    was designated as nonattainment under the eight-hour ozone
    standard. No area within the Company’s service area was
    designated as nonattainment under the

eight-hour

ozone standard. On December 22, 2006, the U.S. Court
    of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the
    first set of implementation rules adopted in 2004 and remanded
    the rules to the EPA for further refinement. The impact of this
    decision, if any, cannot be determined at this time and will
    depend on subsequent legal action

and/or

rulemaking activity. State implementation plans, including new
    emission control regulations necessary to bring ozone
    nonattainment areas into attainment, are currently required for
    most areas by June 2007. These state implementation plans could
    require further reductions in
    NO

x

emissions from power plants.

During 2005, the EPA’s fine particulate matter
    nonattainment designations became effective for areas within
    Georgia, and the EPA proposed a rule for the implementation of
    the fine particulate matter standard. The EPA is expected to
    publish its final rule for implementation of the existing fine
    particulate matter standard in early 2007. State plans for
    addressing the nonattainment designations under the existing
    standard are required by April 2008 and could require further
    reductions in
    SO


and
    NO

x

emissions from power plants. On September 21, 2006, the EPA
    published a final rule lowering the

24-hour

fine
    particulate matter air quality standard even further and plans
    to designate nonattainment areas based on the new standard by
    December 2009. The final outcome of this matter cannot be
    determined at this time.

II-203


MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

(continued)

Gulf Power Company 2006 Annual Report

The EPA issued the final Clean Air Interstate Rule in March
    2005. This

cap-and-trade

rule addresses power plant
    SO


and
    NO

x

emissions that were found to contribute to nonattainment of the

eight-hour

ozone and fine particulate matter standards in downwind states.
    Twenty-eight eastern states, including Florida, Georgia, and
    Mississippi are subject to the requirements of the rule. The
    rule calls for additional reductions of
    NO

x

and/or

SO


to be achieved in two phases, 2009/2010 and 2015. These
    reductions will be accomplished by the installation of
    additional emission controls at the Company’s coal-fired
    facilities or by the purchase of emission allowances from a

cap-and-trade

program.

The Clean Air Visibility Rule (formerly called the Regional Haze
    Rule) was finalized in July 2005. The goal of this rule is to
    restore natural visibility conditions in certain areas
    (primarily national parks and wilderness areas) by 2064. The
    rule involves (1) the application of Best Available
    Retrofit Technology (BART) to certain sources built between 1962
    and 1977, and (2) the application of any additional
    emissions reductions which may be deemed necessary for each
    designated area to achieve reasonable progress toward the
    natural conditions goal by 2018. Thereafter, for each

10-year

planning period, additional emissions reductions will be
    required to continue to demonstrate reasonable progress in each
    area during that period. For power plants, the Clean Air
    Visibility Rule allows states to determine that the Clean Air
    Interstate Rule satisfies BART requirements for
    SO


and
    NO

x

.
    However, additional BART requirements for particulate matter
    could be imposed, and the reasonable progress provisions could
    result in requirements for additional
    SO


controls. By December 17, 2007, states must submit
    implementation plans that contain strategies for BART and any
    other control measures required to achieve the first phase of
    reasonable progress.

In March 2005, the EPA published the final Clean Air Mercury
    Rule, a

cap-and-trade

program for the reduction of mercury emissions from coal-fired
    power plants. The rule sets caps on mercury emissions to be
    implemented in two phases, 2010 and 2018, and provides for an
    emission allowance trading market. The Company anticipates that
    emission controls installed to achieve compliance with the Clean
    Air Interstate Rule and the

eight-hour

ozone and fine-particulate air quality standards will also
    result in mercury emission reductions. However, the long-term
    capability of emission control equipment to reduce mercury
    emissions is still being evaluated, and the installation of
    additional control technologies may be required.

The impacts of the

eight-hour

ozone and the fine particulate matter nonattainment
    designations, the Clean Air Interstate Rule, the Clean Air
    Visibility Rule, and the Clean Air Mercury Rule on the Company
    will depend on the development and implementation of rules at
    the state level. States implementing the Clean Air Mercury Rule
    and the Clean Air Interstate Rule, in particular, have the
    option not to participate in the national

cap-and-trade

programs and could require reductions greater than those
    mandated by the federal rules. Impacts will also depend on
    resolution of pending legal challenges to these rules.
    Therefore, the full effects of these regulations on the Company
    cannot be determined at this time. The Company has developed and
    continually updates a comprehensive environmental compliance
    strategy to comply with the continuing and new environmental
    requirements discussed above. As part of this strategy, the
    Company plans to install additional
    SO


,
    NO

x

,
    and mercury emission controls within the next several years to
    assure continued compliance with applicable air quality
    requirements.

Water
    Quality

In July 2004, the EPA published its final technology-based
    regulations under the Clean Water Act for the purpose of
    reducing impingement and entrainment of fish, shellfish, and
    other forms of aquatic life at existing power plant cooling
    water intake structures. The rules require baseline biological
    information and, perhaps, installation of fish protection
    technology near some intake structures at existing power plants.
    On January 25, 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
    Second Circuit overturned and remanded several provisions of the
    rule to the EPA for revisions. Among other things, the court
    rejected the EPA’s use of “cost-benefit” analysis
    and suggested some ways to incorporate cost considerations. The
    full impact of these regulations will depend on subsequent legal
    proceedings, further rulemaking by the EPA, the results of
    studies and analyses performed as part of the rules’
    implementation, and the actual requirements established by state
    regulatory agencies and, therefore, cannot now be determined.

One facility within the Southern Company system is retrofitting
    a closed-loop recirculating cooling tower under the Clean Water
    Act to cool water prior to discharge and similar projects are
    being considered at other facilities.

Environmental
    Remediation

The Company must comply with other environmental laws and
    regulations that cover the handling and disposal

II-204


MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

(continued)

Gulf Power Company 2006 Annual Report

of waste and release of hazardous substances. Under these
    various laws and regulations, the Company could incur
    substantial costs to clean up properties. The Company conducts
    studies to determine the extent of any required cleanup and has
    recognized in its financial statements the costs to clean up
    known sites. Amounts for cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs
    were not material for any year presented. The Company may be
    liable for some or all required clean up costs for additional
    sites that may require environmental remediation. See
    Note 3 to the financial statements under
    “Environmental Matters – Environmental
    Remediation” for additional information.

Global
    Climate Issues

Domestic efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions have been
    spurred by international negotiations under the Framework
    Convention on Climate Change and specifically the Kyoto
    Protocol, which proposes a binding limitation on the emissions
    of greenhouse gases for industrialized countries. The Bush
    Administration has not supported U.S. ratification of the
    Kyoto Protocol or other mandatory carbon dioxide reduction
    legislation; however, in 2002, it did announce a goal to reduce
    the greenhouse gas intensity of the U.S. economy, the ratio
    of greenhouse gas emissions to the value of U.S. economic
    output, by 18 percent by 2012. Southern Company is
    participating in the voluntary electric utility sector climate
    change initiative, known as Power Partners, under the Bush
    Administration’s Climate VISION program. The utility sector
    pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions rate by
    3 percent to 5 percent by

2010-2012.

Southern Company continues to evaluate future energy and
    emission profiles relative to the Power Partners program and is
    participating in voluntary programs to support the industry
    initiative. In addition, Southern Company is participating in
    the Bush Administration’s Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean
    Development and Climate, a public/private partnership to work
    together to meet goals for energy security, national air
    pollution reduction, and climate change in ways that promote
    sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction. Legislative
    proposals that would impose mandatory restrictions on carbon
    dioxide emissions continue to be considered in Congress. The
    ultimate outcome cannot be determined at this time; however,
    mandatory restrictions on the Company’s carbon dioxide
    emissions could result in significant additional compliance
    costs that could affect future results of operations, cash
    flows, and financial condition if such costs are not recovered
    through regulated rates.

FERC
    Matters

Market-Based
    Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to
    non-affiliates, including short-term opportunity sales, at
    market-based prices. Specific FERC approval must be obtained
    with respect to a market-based contract with an affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess
    Southern Company’s generation dominance within its retail
    service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in
    other markets is not an issue in that proceeding. Any new
    market-based rate sales by the Company in Southern
    Company’s retail service territory entered into during a

15-month

refund period beginning February 27, 2005 could be subject
    to refund to the level of the default cost-based rates, pending
    the outcome of the proceeding. Such sales through May 27,
    2006, the end of the refund period, were approximately
    $0.8 million for the Company. In the event that the
    FERC’s default mitigation measures for entities that are
    found to have market power are ultimately applied, the Company
    may be required to charge cost-based rates for certain wholesale
    sales in the Southern Company retail service territory, which
    may be lower than negotiated market-based rates. The final
    outcome of this matter will depend on the form in which the
    final methodology for assessing generation market power and
    mitigation rules may be ultimately adopted and cannot be
    determined at this time.

In addition, in May 2005, the FERC started an investigation to
    determine whether Southern Company satisfies the other three
    parts of the FERC’s market-based rate analysis:
    transmission market power, barriers to entry, and affiliate
    abuse or reciprocal dealing. The FERC established a new

15-month

refund period related to this expanded investigation. Any new
    market-based rate sales involving any Southern Company
    subsidiary, including the Company, could be subject to refund to
    the extent the FERC orders lower rates as a result of this new
    investigation. Such sales through October 19, 2006, the end
    of the refund period, were approximately $3 million for the
    Company, of which $0.6 million relates to sales inside the
    retail service territory discussed above. The FERC also directed
    that this expanded proceeding be held in abeyance pending the
    outcome of the proceeding on the IIC discussed below. On
    January 3, 2007, the FERC issued an order noting settlement
    of the IIC proceeding and seeking comment identifying any
    remaining issues and the proper procedure for addressing any
    such issues.

Gulf Power Company 2006 Annual Report

The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for
    these proceedings and is vigorously defending itself in this
    matter. However, the final outcome of this matter, including any
    remedies to be applied in the event of an adverse ruling in
    these proceedings, cannot now be determined.

Intercompany
    Interchange Contract

The Company’s generation fleet is operated under
    the IIC, as approved by the FERC. In May 2005, the FERC
    initiated a new proceeding to examine (1) the provisions of
    the IIC among Alabama Power, Georgia Power, the Company,
    Mississippi Power, Savannah Electric, Southern Power, and
    Southern Company Services, Inc. (SCS), as agent, under the terms
    of which the power pool of Southern Company is operated, and, in
    particular, the propriety of the continued inclusion of Southern
    Power as a party to the IIC, (2) whether any parties
    to the IIC have violated the FERC’s standards of
    conduct applicable to utility companies that are transmission
    providers, and (3) whether Southern Company’s code of
    conduct defining Southern Power as a “system company”
    rather than a “marketing affiliate” is just and
    reasonable. In connection with the formation of Southern Power,
    the FERC authorized Southern Power’s inclusion in
    the IIC in 2000. The FERC also previously approved Southern
    Company’s code of conduct.

On October 5, 2006, the FERC issued an order accepting a
    settlement resolving the proceeding subject to Southern
    Company’s agreement to accept certain modifications to the
    settlement’s terms. On October 20, 2006, Southern
    Company notified the FERC that it accepted the modifications.
    The modifications largely involve functional separation and
    information restrictions related to marketing activities
    conducted on behalf of Southern Power. Southern Company filed
    with the FERC on November 6, 2006 an implementation plan to
    comply with the modifications set forth in the order. The impact
    of the modifications is not expected to have a material impact
    on the Company’s financial statements.

Generation
    Interconnection Agreements

In July 2003, the FERC issued its final rule on the
    standardization of generation interconnection agreements and
    procedures (Order 2003). Order 2003 shifts much of the financial
    burden of new transmission investment from the generator to the
    transmission provider. The FERC has indicated that Order 2003,
    which was effective January 20, 2004, is to be applied
    prospectively to new generating facilities interconnecting to a
    transmission system. Order 2003 was affirmed by the
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
    on January 12, 2007. The cost impact resulting from Order
    2003 will vary on a

case-by-case

basis for each new generator interconnecting to the transmission
    system.

On November 22, 2004, generator company subsidiaries of
    Tenaska, Inc (Tenaska), as counterparties to three previously
    executed interconnection agreements with subsidiaries of
    Southern Company filed complaints at the FERC requesting that
    the FERC modify the agreements and that those Southern Company
    subsidiaries refund a total of $19 million previously paid
    for interconnection facilities, with interest. Southern Company
    has also received requests for similar modifications from other
    entities, though no other complaints are pending with the FERC.
    On January 19, 2007, the FERC issued an order granting
    Tenaska’s requested relief. Although the FERC’s order
    requires the modification of Tenaska’s interconnection
    agreements, the order reduces the amount of the refund that had
    been requested by Tenaska. As a result, Southern Company
    estimates indicate that no refund is due Tenaska. Southern
    Company has requested rehearing of the FERC’s order. The
    final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Transmission

In December 1999, the FERC issued its final rule on Regional
    Transmission Organizations (RTOs). Since that time, there have
    been a number of additional proceedings at the FERC designed to
    encourage further voluntary formation of RTOs or to mandate
    their formation. However, at the current time, there are no
    active proceedings that would require the Company to participate
    in an RTO. Current FERC efforts that may potentially change the
    regulatory

and/or

operational structure of transmission include rules related to
    the standardization of generation interconnection, as well as an
    inquiry into, among other things, market power by vertically
    integrated utilities. See “Market-Based Rate
    Authority” and “Generation Interconnection
    Agreements” above for additional information. The final
    outcome of these proceedings cannot now be determined. However,
    the Company’s financial condition, results of operations,
    and cash flows could be adversely affected by future changes in
    the federal regulatory or operational structure of transmission.

Gulf Power Company 2006 Annual Report

PSC
    Matters

Fuel
    Cost Recovery

The Company has established fuel cost recovery rates approved by
    the Florida PSC. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the under
    recovered balance was $77.5 million and $31.6 million,
    respectively, primarily due to increased costs for coal in 2006
    and increased costs for coal and natural gas in 2005. The
    Company continuously monitors the under recovered fuel cost
    balance in light of these higher fuel costs. If the projected
    fuel revenue over or under recovery exceeds 10 percent of
    the projected fuel costs for the period, the Company is required
    to notify the Florida PSC and indicate if an adjustment to the
    fuel cost recovery factor is being requested.

In November 2006, the Florida PSC approved an increase of
    approximately 28 percent in the fuel factor for retail
    customers, effective with billings beginning January 2007. Fuel
    cost recovery revenues, as recorded on the financial statements,
    are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable costs and
    amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, any
    change in the billing factor would have no significant effect on
    the Company’s revenues or net income, but would impact
    annual cash flow.

Storm
    Damage Cost Recovery

Under authority granted by the Florida PSC, the Company
    maintains a reserve for property damage to cover the cost of
    uninsured damages from major storms to its transmission and
    distribution facilities, generation facilities, and other
    property.

Hurricanes Dennis and Katrina hit the Gulf Coast of Florida in
    July 2005 and August 2005, respectively, damaging portions of
    the Company’s service area. In September 2004, Hurricane
    Ivan hit the Gulf Coast of Florida, causing substantial damage
    within the Company’s service area. In 2005, the Florida PSC
    issued the 2005 Order that approved a stipulation and settlement
    between the Company and several consumer groups and thereby
    authorized the recovery of the Company’s storm damage costs
    related to Hurricane Ivan through the two-year surcharge that
    began in April 2005.

In July 2006, the Florida PSC issued the 2006 Order approving
    another stipulation and settlement between the Company and
    several consumer groups that resolved all matters relating to
    the Company’s request for recovery of incurred costs for
    storm-recovery activities related to the 2005 storms and the
    replenishment of the Company’s property damage reserve. The
    2006 Order provides for an extension of the storm-recovery
    surcharge currently being collected by the Company for an
    additional 27 months, expiring in June 2009.

According to the 2006 Order, the funds resulting from the
    extension of the current surcharge will first be credited to the
    unrecovered balance of storm-recovery costs associated with
    Hurricane Ivan until these costs have been fully recovered. The
    funds will then be credited to the property reserve for recovery
    of the storm-recovery costs of $52.6 million associated
    with Hurricanes Dennis and Katrina that were previously charged
    to the reserve. Should revenues collected by the Company through
    the extension of the storm-recovery surcharge exceed the
    storm-recovery costs associated with Hurricanes Dennis and
    Katrina, the excess revenues will be credited to the reserve.

The annual accrual to the reserve of $3.5 million and the
    Company’s limited discretionary authority to make
    additional accruals to the reserve will continue as previously
    approved by the Florida PSC. The Company made discretionary
    accruals to the reserve of $3 million, $6 million, and
    $15 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. As part
    of the 2005 Order regarding Hurricane Ivan costs that
    established the existing surcharge, the Company agreed that it
    would not seek any additional increase in its base rates and
    charges to become effective on or before March 1, 2007. The
    terms of the 2006 Order do not alter or affect that portion of
    the prior agreement.

According to the 2006 Order, in the case of future storms, if
    the Company incurs cumulative costs for storm-recovery
    activities in excess of $10 million during any calendar
    year, the Company will be permitted to file a streamlined formal
    request for an interim surcharge. Any interim surcharge would
    provide for the recovery, subject to refund, of up to
    80 percent of the claimed costs for storm-recovery
    activities. The Company would then petition the Florida PSC for
    full recovery through a final or non-interim surcharge or other
    cost recovery mechanism.

See Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements under
    “Property Damage Reserve” and “Storm Damage Cost
    Recovery,” respectively, for additional information.

Other
    Matters

In 2004, Georgia Power and the Company entered into PPAs with
    Florida Power & Light Company (FP&L) and Progress
    Energy Florida. Under the agreements, Georgia Power and the
    Company will provide FP&L and Progress Energy Florida with
    165 megawatts and 74 megawatts, respectively, of capacity
    annually from the jointly owned

Gulf Power Company 2006 Annual Report

Plant Scherer Unit 3 for the period from June 2010 through
    December 2015. The contracts provide for fixed capacity payments
    and variable energy payments based on actual energy delivered.
    The Florida PSC approved the contracts in 2005.

Also in 2004, Georgia Power and the Company entered into a PPA
    with Flint Electric Membership Corporation. Under the agreement,
    Georgia Power and the Company will provide Flint Electric
    Membership Corporation with 75 megawatts of capacity annually
    from the jointly owned Plant Scherer Unit 3 for the period from
    June 2010 through December 2019. The contract provides for fixed
    capacity payments and variable energy payments based on actual
    energy delivered.

The Company is involved in various other matters being litigated
    and regulatory matters that could affect future earnings. See
    Note 3 to the financial statements for information
    regarding material issues.

ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
    Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to
    the financial statements. In the application of these policies,
    certain estimates are made that may have a material impact on
    the Company’s results of operations and related
    disclosures. Different assumptions and measurements could
    produce estimates that are significantly different from those
    recorded in the financial statements. Senior management has
    reviewed and discussed critical accounting policies and
    estimates described below with the Audit Committee of Southern
    Company’s Board of Directors.

Electric
    Utility Regulation

The Company is subject to retail regulation by the Florida PSC
    and wholesale regulation by the FERC. These regulatory agencies
    set the rates the Company is permitted to charge customers based
    on allowable costs. As a result, the Company applies FASB
    Statement No. 71, “Accounting for the Effects of
    Certain Types of Regulation” (SFAS No. 71), which
    requires the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate
    regulation. Through the ratemaking process, the regulators may
    require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different
    than when they would be recognized by a non-regulated company.
    This treatment may result in the deferral of expenses and the
    recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated
    future recovery through rates or the deferral of gains or
    creation of liabilities and the recording of related regulatory
    liabilities. The application of SFAS No. 71 has a
    further effect on the Company’s financial statements as a
    result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the
    ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from those
    actually incurred by the Company; therefore, the accounting
    estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation and
    pension and postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact
    on the Company’s results of operations than they would on a
    non-regulated company.

As reflected in Note 1 to the financial statements,
    significant regulatory assets and liabilities have been
    recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of
    these regulatory assets and liabilities based on applicable
    regulatory guidelines and accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States. However, adverse legislative,
    judicial, or regulatory actions could materially impact the
    amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could
    adversely impact the Company’s financial statements.

Contingent
    Obligations

The Company is subject to a number of federal and state laws and
    regulations, as well as other factors and conditions that
    potentially subject it to environmental, litigation, income tax,
    and other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and
    Note 3 to the financial statements for more information
    regarding certain of these contingencies. The Company
    periodically evaluates its exposure to such risks and records
    reserves for those matters where a loss is considered probable
    and reasonably estimable in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles. The adequacy of reserves can be
    significantly affected by external events or conditions that can
    be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters
    could materially affect the Company’s financial statements.
    These events or conditions include the following:

•

Changes in existing state or federal regulation by governmental
    authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality,
    control of toxic substances, hazardous and solid wastes, and
    other environmental matters.

•

Changes in existing income tax regulations or changes in
    Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or state revenue department
    interpretations of existing regulations.

•

Identification of additional sites that require environmental
    remediation or the filing of other

II-208


MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

(continued)

Gulf Power Company 2006 Annual Report

complaints in which the Company may be asserted to be a
    potentially responsible party.

•

Identification and evaluation of other potential lawsuits or
    complaints in which the Company may be named as a defendant.

•

Resolution or progression of existing matters through the
    legislative process, the court systems, the IRS, or the EPA.

Unbilled
    Revenues

Revenues related to the sale of electricity are recorded when
    electricity is delivered to customers. However, the
    determination of KWH sales to individual customers is based on
    the reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic
    basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of
    electricity delivered to customers, but not yet metered and
    billed, are estimated. Components of the unbilled revenue
    estimates include total KWH territorial supply, total KWH
    billed, estimated total electricity lost in delivery, and
    customer usage. These components can fluctuate as a result of a
    number of factors including weather, generation patterns, power
    delivery volume and other operational constraints. These factors
    can be unpredictable and can vary from historical trends. As a
    result, the overall estimate of unbilled revenues could be
    significantly affected, which could have a material impact on
    the Company’s results of operations.

New
    Accounting Standards

Stock
    Options

On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted FASB Statement
    No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment” using the
    modified prospective method. This statement requires that
    compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions
    be recognized in financial statements. That cost is measured
    based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability
    instruments issued. Although the compensation expense required
    under the revised statement differs slightly, the impacts on the
    Company’s financial statements are similar to the pro forma
    disclosures included in Note 1 to the financial statements
    under “Stock Options.”

Pensions
    and Other Postretirement Plans

On December 31, 2006, the Company adopted FASB Statement
    No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined
    Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans”
    (SFAS No. 158), which requires recognition of the
    funded status of its defined benefit postretirement plans in its
    balance sheet. With the adoption of SFAS No. 158, the
    Company recorded an additional prepaid pension asset of
    $23.5 million with respect to its overfunded defined
    benefit plan and additional liabilities of $2.5 million and
    $12.9 million, respectively, related to its underfunded
    non-qualified pension plans and retiree benefit plan.
    Additionally, SFAS No. 158 will require the Company to
    change the measurement date for its defined benefit
    postretirement plan assets and obligations from
    September 30 to December 31 beginning with the year
    ending December 31, 2008. See Note 2 to the financial
    statements for additional information.

Guidance
    on Considering the Materiality of Misstatements

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
    issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,
    “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when
    Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
    Statements” (SAB 108). SAB 108 addresses how the
    effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be
    considered when quantifying misstatements in current year
    financial statements. SAB 108 requires companies to
    quantify misstatements using both a balance sheet and an income
    statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach
    results in quantifying an error that is material in light of
    relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. When the effect
    of initial adoption is material, companies will record the
    effect as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year
    retained earnings. The provisions of SAB 108 were effective
    for the Company for the year ended December 31, 2006. The
    adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s financial statements.

Income
    Taxes

In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”
    (FIN 48). This interpretation requires that tax benefits
    must be “more likely than not” of being sustained in
    order to be recognized. The Company adopted FIN 48
    effective January 1, 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 did
    not have a material impact on the Company’s financial
    statements.

Fair
    Value Measurement

The FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157, “Fair Value
    Measurements” (SFAS No. 157) in September
    2006. SFAS No. 157 provides guidance on how to measure
    fair value where it is permitted or required under other
    accounting pronouncements. SFAS No. 157 also requires

II-209


MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

(continued)

Gulf Power Company 2006 Annual Report

additional disclosures about fair value measurements. The
    Company plans to adopt SFAS No. 157 on January 1,
    2008 and is currently assessing its impact.

Fair
    Value Option

In February 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 159,
    “Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115” (SFAS No. 159). This standard
    permits an entity to choose to measure many financial
    instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company
    plans to adopt SFAS No. 159 on January 1, 2008
    and is currently assessing its impact.

FINANCIAL
    CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

The Company’s financial condition remained stable at
    December 31, 2006. Net cash flow from operations totaled
    $143.4 million, $152.7 million, and
    $144.5 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The
    $9.3 million decrease in net cash flows in 2006 is due
    primarily to increased payments related to income taxes and
    fuel. The $8.2 million increase in net cash flows in 2005
    was due primarily to the recovery of Hurricane Ivan restoration
    costs. The $46.8 million decrease in net cash flows in 2004
    was primarily due to payments related to storm damage from
    Hurricane Ivan. Gross property additions were
    $147.1 million in 2006. Funds for the Company’s
    property additions were provided by operating activities,
    capital contributions, and other financing activities. See the
    statements of cash flows for additional information.

The Company’s ratio of common equity to total
    capitalization, including short-term debt, was 42.1 percent
    in 2006, 43.0 percent in 2005, and 43.2 percent in
    2004. See Note 6 to the financial statements for additional
    information.

The Company has received investment grade ratings from the major
    rating agencies with respect to its debt, preferred securities,
    and preference stock.

Sources
    of Capital

The Company plans to obtain the funds required for construction
    and other purposes from sources similar to those used in the
    past, which were primarily from operating cash flows, securities
    issuances, term loans, and short-term indebtedness. However, the
    type and timing of any future financings, if needed, will depend
    on market conditions, regulatory approval, and other factors.

Security issuances are subject to regulatory approval by the
    Florida PSC pursuant to its rules and regulations. Additionally,
    with respect to the public offering of securities, the Company
    files registration statements with the SEC under the Securities
    Act of 1933, as amended (1933 Act). The amounts of
    securities authorized by the Florida PSC, as well as the
    amounts, if any, registered under the 1933 Act, are
    continuously monitored and appropriate filings are made to
    ensure flexibility in the capital markets.

The Company obtains financing separately without credit support
    from any affiliate. See Note 6 to the financial statements
    under “Bank Credit Arrangements” for additional
    information. The Southern Company system does not maintain a
    centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of the Company
    are not commingled with funds of any other company.

To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the Company has
    various internal and external sources of liquidity. At the
    beginning of 2007, the Company had approximately
    $7.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, along with
    $120 million of unused committed lines of credit with banks
    to meet its short-term cash needs. These bank credit
    arrangements will expire during 2007. The Company plans to renew
    these lines of credit during 2007. In addition, the Company has
    substantial cash flow from operating activities and access to
    the capital markets including commercial paper programs to meet
    liquidity needs. See Note 6 to the financial statements
    under “Bank Credit Arrangements” for additional
    information.

The Company may also meet short-term cash needs through a
    Southern Company subsidiary organized to issue and sell
    commercial paper and extendible commercial notes at the request
    and for the benefit of the Company and the other traditional
    operating companies. Proceeds from such issuances for the
    benefit of the Company are loaned directly to the Company and
    are not commingled with proceeds from such issuances for the
    benefit of any other traditional operating company. There is no
    cross affiliate credit support. At December 31, 2006, the
    Company had $80.4 million in commercial paper notes and
    $40.0 million in bank notes outstanding.

Financing
    Activities

In December 2006, the Company issued $110 million of senior
    notes. A portion of the proceeds of this issuance was used to
    redeem $30.9 million of long-term debt payable to
    affiliated trusts. The remainder of the funds from the sale of
    senior notes was used for general

II-210

Gulf Power Company 2006 Annual Report

corporate purposes, including the Company’s continuous
    construction program.

On January 19, 2007, the Company issued to Southern Company
    800,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, without
    par value, and realized proceeds of $80 million. The
    proceeds were used to repay a portion of the Company’s
    short-term indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes.

Credit
    Rating Risk

The Company does not have any credit arrangements that would
    require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as
    a result of a credit rating downgrade. There are certain
    contracts that could require collateral, but not accelerated
    payment, in the event of a credit rating change to BBB- or Baa3,
    or below. Generally, collateral may be provided for by a
    Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. These
    contracts are primarily for physical electricity purchases and
    sales. At December 31, 2006, the maximum potential
    collateral requirements at a BBB- or Baa3 rating were
    approximately $23.1 million. The maximum potential
    collateral requirements at a rating below BBB- or Baa3 were
    approximately $46.3 million.

The Company, along with all members of the Southern Company
    power pool, is party to certain derivative agreements that could
    require collateral

and/or

accelerated payment in the event of a credit rating change to
    below investment grade for Alabama Power

and/or

Georgia Power. These agreements are primarily for natural gas
    and power price risk management activities. At December 31,
    2006, the Company’s total exposure to these types of
    agreements was approximately $27.4 million.

Market
    Price Risk

Due to cost-based rate regulation, the Company has limited
    exposure to market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel
    prices, and prices of electricity. To manage the volatility
    attributable to these exposures, the Company nets the exposures
    to take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various
    derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to
    the Company’s policies in areas such as counterparty
    exposure and risk management practices. Company policy is that
    derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and
    mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management
    policies. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques
    including but not limited to market valuation, value at risk,
    stress testing, and sensitivity analysis.

To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity
    prices, the Company enters into fixed-price contracts for the
    purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale
    electricity market and, to a lesser extent, into similar
    contracts for natural gas purchases. The Company has implemented
    a fuel-hedging program with the approval of the Florida PSC.

The weighted average interest rate on $144.6 million
    variable long-term debt that has not been hedged at
    January 1, 2007 was 3.73 percent. If the Company
    sustained a 100 basis point change in interest rates for
    all variable rate long-term debt, the change would affect
    annualized interest expense by approximately $1.4 million
    at January 1, 2007. The Company is not aware of any facts
    or circumstances that would significantly affect such exposures
    in the near term. See Notes 1 and 6 to the financial
    statements under “Financial Instruments” for
    additional information.

The changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts
    and year-end valuations were as follows at December 31:

    Gains and losses on derivative contracts that are not designated
    as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as
    incurred. At December 31, 2006, the fair value
    gains/(losses) of energy-related derivative contracts were
    reflected in the financial statements as follows:

The Company is exposed to market price risk in the event of
    nonperformance by counterparties to the derivative energy
    contracts. The Company’s policy is to enter into agreements
    with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by
    Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s or with
    counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential
    credit exposure. Therefore, the Company does not anticipate
    market risk exposure from nonperformance by the counterparties.
    See Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements under
    “Financial Instruments” for additional information.

Capital
    Requirements and Contractual Obligations

The construction program of the Company is currently estimated
    to be $278 million in 2007, $458 million in 2008, and
    $395 million in 2009. The construction program also
    includes $171 million in 2007, $378 million in 2008,
    and $300 million in 2009 for environmental expenditures.
    Actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because
    of changes in such factors as: business conditions;
    environmental regulations; FERC rules and regulations; load
    projections; the cost and efficiency of construction labor,
    equipment, and materials; and the cost of capital. In addition,
    there can be no assurance that costs related to capital
    expenditures will be fully recovered.

The Company does not have any new generating capacity under
    construction. Construction of new transmission and distribution
    facilities and capital improvements, including those needed to
    meet environmental standards for the Company’s existing
    generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, is
    ongoing.

The Company has entered into two PPAs, one of which is with
    Southern Power, for a total of approximately 487 megawatts
    annually from June 2009 through May 2014. The PPAs are the
    result of a competitive request for proposals process initiated
    by the Company in January 2006 to address the anticipated need
    for additional capacity beginning in 2009. These PPAs are both
    subject to approval by the Florida PSC for purposes of cost
    recovery through the Company’s purchased power capacity
    clause, and the PPA with Southern Power is also subject to FERC
    approval.

As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the
    Company provides postretirement benefits to substantially all
    employees and funds trusts to the extent required by the FERC
    and the Florida PSC.

Other funding requirements related to obligations associated
    with scheduled maturities of long-term debt and preferred
    securities, as well as the related interest, derivative
    obligations, preference stock dividends, leases, and other
    purchase commitments are as follows. See Notes 1, 6,
    and 7 to the financial statements for additional information.

Cautionary
    Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

The Company’s 2006 Annual Report contains forward-looking
    statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other
    things, statements concerning the strategic goals for the
    Company’s storm damage cost recovery and repairs, retail
    rates, environmental regulations and expenditures, access to
    sources of capital, the Company’s projections for
    postretirement benefit trust contributions, financing
    activities, impacts of the adoption of new accounting rules,
    completion of construction projects, and estimated construction
    and other expenditures. In some cases, forward-looking
    statements can be identified by terminology such as
    “may,” “will,” “could,”
    “should,” “expects,” “plans,”
    “anticipates,” “believes,”
    “estimates,” “projects,”
    “predicts,” “potential” or
    “continue” or the negative of these terms or other
    similar terminology. There are various factors that could cause
    actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the
    forward-looking statements; accordingly, there can be no
    assurance that such indicated results will be realized. These
    factors include:

•

the impact of recent and future federal and state regulatory
    change, including legislative and regulatory initiatives
    regarding deregulation and restructuring of the electric utility
    industry, implementation of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and
    also changes in environmental, tax and other laws and
    regulations to which the Company is subject, as well as changes
    in application of existing laws and regulations;

•

current and future litigation, regulatory investigations,
    proceedings, or inquiries, including the pending EPA civil
    actions against the Company and FERC matters;

•

the effects, extent, and timing of the entry of additional
    competition in the markets in which the Company operates;

•

variations in demand for electricity, including those relating
    to weather, the general economy and population and business
    growth (and declines);

•

available sources and costs of fuels;

•

ability to control costs;

•

investment performance of the Company’s employee benefit
    plans;

•

advances in technology;

•

state and federal rate regulations and the impact of pending and
    future rate cases and negotiations, including rate actions
    relating to fuel and storm restoration cost recovery;

•

internal restructuring or other restructuring options that may
    be pursued;

•

potential business strategies, including acquisitions or
    dispositions of assets or businesses, which cannot be assured to
    be completed or beneficial to the Company;

•

the ability of counterparties of the Company to make payments as
    and when due;

•

the ability to obtain new short- and long-term contracts with
    neighboring utilities;

•

the direct or indirect effect on the Company’s business
    resulting from terrorist incidents and the threat of terrorist
    incidents;

•

interest rate fluctuations and financial market conditions and
    the results of financing efforts, including the Company’s
    credit ratings;

•

the ability of the Company to obtain additional generating
    capacity at competitive prices;

•

catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions,
    floods, hurricanes, pandemic health events such as an avian
    influenza, or other similar occurrences;

•

the direct or indirect effects on the Company’s business
    resulting from incidents similar to the August 2003 power outage
    in the Northeast;

•

the effect of accounting pronouncements issued periodically by
    standard setting bodies; and

•

other factors discussed elsewhere herein and in other reports
    (including the

Form 10-K)

filed by the Company from time to time with the SEC.

The
    Company expressly disclaims any obligation to update any
    forward-looking statements.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General

Gulf Power Company (the Company) is a wholly owned subsidiary of
    Southern Company, which is the parent company of four
    traditional operating companies, Southern Power Company
    (Southern Power), Southern Company Services (SCS), Southern
    Communications Services (SouthernLINC Wireless), Southern
    Company Holdings (Southern Holdings), Southern Nuclear Operating
    Company (Southern Nuclear), Southern Telecom, and other direct
    and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional operating companies,
    Alabama Power, Georgia Power, the Company, and Mississippi Power
    are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service
    in four Southeastern states. The Company provides retail service
    to customers in northwest Florida and to wholesale customers in
    the Southeast. Southern Power constructs, acquires, and manages
    generation assets and sells electricity at market-based rates in
    the wholesale market. SCS, the system service company, provides,
    at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and the
    subsidiary companies. SouthernLINC Wireless provides digital
    wireless communications services to the traditional operating
    companies and also markets these services to the public within
    the Southeast. Southern Telecom provides fiber cable services
    within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate
    holding company subsidiary for Southern Company’s
    investments in synthetic fuels and leveraged leases and various
    other energy-related businesses. Southern Nuclear operates and
    provides services to Southern Company’s nuclear power
    plants. On January 4, 2006, Southern Company completed the
    sale of substantially all of the assets of Southern Company Gas,
    its competitive retail natural gas marketing subsidiary.

The equity method is used for subsidiaries in which the Company
    has significant influence but does not control and for variable
    interest entities where the Company is not the primary
    beneficiary. Certain prior years’ data presented in the
    financial statements have been reclassified to conform with
    current year presentation.

The Company is subject to regulation by the Federal Energy
    Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Florida Public Service
    Commission (PSC). The Company follows accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States and complies with the
    accounting policies and practices prescribed by its regulatory
    commissions. The preparation of financial statements in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States requires the use of estimates, and the actual
    results may differ from those estimates.

Affiliate
    Transactions

The Company has an agreement with SCS under which the following
    services are rendered to the Company at direct or allocated
    cost: general and design engineering, purchasing, accounting and
    statistical analysis, finance and treasury, tax, information
    resources, marketing, auditing, insurance and pension
    administration, human resources, systems and procedures, and
    other services with respect to business and operations and power
    pool operations. Costs for these services amounted to
    $59 million, $54 million, and $56 million during
    2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Cost allocation
    methodologies used by SCS were approved by the Securities and
    Exchange Commission prior to the repeal of the Public Utility
    Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended, and management believes
    they are reasonable. The FERC permits services to be rendered at
    cost by system service companies.

The Company has agreements with Georgia Power and Mississippi
    Power under which the Company owns a portion of Plant Scherer
    and Plant Daniel. Georgia Power operates Plant Scherer and
    Mississippi Power operates Plant Daniel. The Company reimbursed
    Georgia Power $8.0 million, $4.3 million, and
    $6.8 million and Mississippi Power $19.7 million,
    $19.5 million, and $17.4 million in 2006, 2005, and
    2004, respectively, for its proportionate share of related
    expenses. See Note 4 and Note 7 under “Operating
    Leases” for additional information.

The Company provides incidental services to and receives such
    services from other Southern Company subsidiaries which are
    generally minor in duration and amount. However, with the
    hurricane damage experienced in 2004 and 2005, assistance
    provided to aid in storm restoration, including Company labor,
    contract labor, and materials, has caused an increase in these
    activities. The total amount of storm restoration provided to
    Mississippi Power was $0.2 million and $11.1 million
    in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company received storm
    restoration assistance from other Southern Company subsidiaries
    totaling $5.8 million and $12.7 million in 2005 and
    2004, respectively. These activities were billed at cost.

The traditional operating companies, including the Company, and
    Southern Power jointly enter into various types of wholesale
    energy, natural gas, and certain other contracts, either
    directly or through SCS, as agent. Each participating company
    may be jointly and severally liable

for the obligations incurred under these agreements. See
    Note 7 under “Fuel Commitments” for additional
    information.

Regulatory
    Assets and Liabilities

The Company is subject to the provisions of Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 71, “Accounting
    for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation”
    (SFAS No. 71). Regulatory assets represent probable
    future revenues associated with certain costs that are expected
    to be recovered from customers through the ratemaking process.
    Regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in
    revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be
    credited to customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory
    assets and (liabilities) reflected in the balance sheets at
    December 31 relate to:

In the event that a portion of the Company’s operations is
    no longer subject to the provisions of SFAS No. 71,
    the Company would be required to write off related regulatory
    assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable
    through regulated rates. In addition, the Company would be
    required to determine if any impairment to other assets,
    including plant, exists and write down the assets, if impaired,
    to their fair values. All regulatory assets and liabilities are
    reflected in rates.

Revenues

Energy and other revenues are recognized as services are
    provided. Unbilled revenues related to retail sales are accrued
    at the end of each fiscal period. Wholesale capacity revenues
    are generally recognized on a levelized basis over the
    appropriate contract period. The Company’s retail electric
    rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in
    fuel costs, the energy component of purchased power costs, and
    certain other costs. The Company is required to notify the
    Florida PSC if the projected fuel revenue over or under recovery
    exceeds 10 percent of the projected fuel costs for the
    period and indicate if an adjustment to the fuel cost recovery
    factor is being requested. The Company has similar retail cost
    recovery clauses for energy conservation costs, purchased power
    capacity costs, and environmental compliance costs. Revenues are
    adjusted for differences between these actual costs and amounts
    billed in current regulated rates. Under or over recovered
    regulatory clause revenues are recorded in the balance sheets
    and are recovered or returned to customers through adjustments
    to the billing factors. Annually, the Company petitions for
    recovery of projected costs including any

true-up

amount from prior periods, and approved rates are implemented
    each January.

The Company has a diversified base of customers. No single
    customer or industry comprises 10 percent or

II-222

more of revenues. For all periods presented, uncollectible
    accounts averaged less than 1 percent of revenues.

Fuel
    Costs

Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is used.

Property,
    Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost less
    regulatory disallowances and impairments. Original cost
    includes: materials; labor; minor items of property; appropriate
    administrative and general costs; payroll-related costs such as
    taxes, pensions, and other benefits; and the interest
    capitalized

and/or

cost
    of funds used during construction.

The Company’s property, plant, and equipment consisted of

The cost of replacements of property, exclusive of minor items
    of property, is capitalized. The cost of maintenance, repairs,
    and replacement of minor items of property is charged to
    maintenance expense as incurred or performed.

Income
    and Other Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred
    income taxes and provides deferred income taxes for all
    significant income tax temporary differences. Investment tax
    credits utilized are deferred and amortized to income over the
    average life of the related property. Taxes that are collected
    from customers on behalf of governmental agencies to be remitted
    to these agencies are presented net on the statements of income.

Depreciation
    and Amortization

Depreciation of the original cost of utility plant in service is
    provided primarily by using composite straight-line rates, which
    approximated 3.7 percent in 2006 and 3.8 percent in
    2005 and 2004. Depreciation studies are conducted periodically
    to update the composite rates. These studies are approved by the
    Florida PSC. When property subject to depreciation is retired or
    otherwise disposed of in the normal course of business, its
    original cost, together with the cost of removal, less salvage,
    is charged to accumulated depreciation. For other property
    dispositions, the applicable cost and accumulated depreciation
    is removed from the balance sheet accounts and a gain or loss is
    recognized. Minor items of property included in the original
    cost of the plant are retired when the related property unit is
    retired.

Asset
    Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of Removal

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted FASB
    Statement No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
    Obligations” (SFAS No. 143), which established
    new accounting and reporting standards for legal obligations
    associated with the ultimate costs of retiring long-lived
    assets. The present value of the ultimate costs of an
    asset’s future retirement is recorded in the period in
    which the liability is incurred. The costs are capitalized as
    part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the
    asset’s useful life. In addition, effective
    December 31, 2005, the Company adopted the provisions of
    FASB Interpretation No. 47, “Conditional Asset
    Retirement Obligations” (FIN 47), which requires that
    an asset retirement obligation be recorded even though the
    timing

and/or

method of settlement are conditional on future events. Prior to
    December 2005, the Company did not recognize asset retirement
    obligations for asbestos removal and disposal of polychlorinated
    biphenyls in certain transformers because the timing of their
    retirements was dependent on future events. The Company has
    received accounting guidance from the Florida PSC allowing the
    continued accrual of other future retirement costs for
    long-lived assets that the Company does not have a legal
    obligation to retire. Accordingly, the accumulated removal costs
    for these obligations will continue to be reflected in the
    balance sheets as a regulatory liability. Therefore, the Company
    had no cumulative effect to net income resulting from the
    adoption of SFAS No. 143 or FIN 47.

The liability recognized to retire long-lived assets primarily
    relates to the Company’s combustion turbines at its Pea
    Ridge facility, various landfill sites, and a barge unloading
    dock. In connection with the adoption of FIN 47, the
    Company also recorded additional asset retirement obligations
    (and assets) of $9.1 million, primarily related to asbestos
    removal, ash ponds, and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in
    certain transformers. The Company also has identified retirement
    obligations related to certain transmission and distribution
    facilities, certain wireless communication towers, and certain
    structures authorized by the United States Army

II-223


NOTES

Gulf Power Company 2006 Annual Report

Corps of Engineers. However, liabilities for the removal of
    these assets have not been recorded because the range of time
    over which the Company may settle these obligations is unknown
    and cannot be reasonably estimated. The Company will continue to
    recognize in the statements of income allowed removal costs in
    accordance with its regulatory treatment. Any differences
    between costs recognized under SFAS No. 143 and
    FIN 47 and those reflected in rates are recognized as
    either a regulatory asset or liability, as ordered by the
    Florida PSC, and are reflected in the balance sheets.

    balance sheets are as follows:

Allowance
    for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC)

In accordance with regulatory treatment, the Company records
    AFUDC, which represents the estimated debt and equity costs of
    capital funds that are necessary to finance the construction of
    new regulated facilities. While cash is not realized currently
    from such allowance, it increases the revenue requirement over
    the service life of the plant through a higher rate base and
    higher depreciation expense. For the years 2006, 2005, and 2004,
    the average annual AFUDC rate was 7.48 percent. AFUDC, net
    of taxes, as a percentage of net income after dividends on
    preferred and preference stock was 0.61 percent,
    1.97 percent, and 3.46 percent, respectively, for
    2006, 2005, and 2004.

Impairment
    of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles

The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination
    of whether an impairment has occurred is based on either a
    specific regulatory disallowance or an estimate of undiscounted
    future cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared with
    the carrying value of the assets. If an impairment has occurred,
    the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by either
    the amount of regulatory disallowance or by estimating the fair
    value of the assets and recording a loss if the carrying value
    is greater than the fair value. For assets identified as held
    for sale, the carrying value is compared to the estimated fair
    value less the cost to sell in order to determine if an
    impairment loss is required. Until the assets are disposed of,
    their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or
    events change.

Property
    Damage Reserve

The Company accrues for the cost of repairing damages from major
    storms and other uninsured property damages, including uninsured
    damages to transmission and distribution facilities, generation
    facilities, and other property. The cost of such damages is
    charged to the reserve. The Florida PSC approved annual accrual
    to the property damage reserve is $3.5 million, with a
    target level for the reserve between $25.1 million and
    $36.0 million. The Florida PSC also authorized the Company
    to make additional accruals above the $3.5 million at the
    Company’s discretion. The Company accrued total expenses of
    $6.5 million in 2006, $9.5 million in 2005, and
    $18.5 million in 2004. At December 31, 2006, the
    unrecovered balance in the property damage reserve totaled
    approximately $45.7 million, of which approximately
    $28.8 million and $16.9 million is included in Current
    Assets and Deferred Charges and Other Assets, respectively, in
    the balance sheets. See Note 3 under “Retail
    Regulatory Matters – Storm Damage Cost Recovery”
    for additional information regarding the surcharge mechanism
    approved by the Florida PSC to replenish these reserves.

Environmental
    Remediation Cost Recovery

The Company must comply with other environmental laws and
    regulations that cover the handling and disposal of waste and
    releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and
    regulations, the Company may also incur substantial costs to
    clean up properties. The Company received authority from the
    Florida PSC to recover approved environmental compliance costs
    through the environmental cost recovery clause. The Florida PSC
    reviews costs and adjusts rates up or down annually.

The Company’s environmental remediation liability balances
    as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 totaled $57.2 million
    and $58.2 million, respectively. These estimated costs
    relate to new regulations and more stringent site closure
    criteria by the Florida Department of Environmental
    Protection (FDEP) for impacts to groundwater from herbicide
    applications at the Company’s substations. The schedule for
    completion of the remediation projects will be subject to FDEP
    approval. The projects have been approved by the Florida

II-224

Gulf Power Company 2006 Annual Report

PSC for recovery, as expended, through the Company’s
    environmental cost recovery clause; therefore, there was no
    impact on the Company’s net income as a result of these
    estimates.

Injuries
    and Damages Reserve

The Company is subject to claims and suits arising in the
    ordinary course of business. As permitted by the Florida PSC,
    the Company accrues for the uninsured costs of injuries and
    damages by charges to income amounting to $1.6 million
    annually. The Florida PSC has also given the Company the
    flexibility to increase its annual accrual above
    $1.6 million to the extent the balance in the reserve does
    not exceed $2 million and to defer expense recognition of
    liabilities greater than the balance in the reserve. The cost of
    settling claims is charged to the reserve. The injuries and
    damages reserve was $2.0 million and $1.7 million at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and are included
    in Current Liabilities in the balance sheets. Liabilities in
    excess of the reserve balance of $1.7 million and
    $3.0 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively, are included in Deferred Credits and Other
    Liabilities in the balance sheets. Corresponding regulatory
    assets of $1.6 million at both December 31, 2006 and
    2005 are included in Current Assets in the balance sheets. At
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, $0.1 million
    and $1.4 million are included in Deferred Charges and Other
    Assets in the balance sheets.

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash
    investments are considered cash equivalents. Temporary cash
    investments are securities with original maturities of
    90 days or less.

Materials
    and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include the average cost of
    transmission, distribution, and generating plant materials.
    Materials are charged to inventory when purchased and then
    expensed or capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when installed.

Fuel
    Inventory

Fuel inventory includes the average costs of oil, coal, natural
    gas, and emission allowances. Fuel is charged to inventory when
    purchased and then expensed as used. Emission allowances granted
    by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are included in
    inventory at zero cost.

Stock
    Options

Southern Company provides non-qualified stock options to a large
    segment of the Company’s employees ranging from line
    management to executives. Prior to January 1, 2006, the
    Company accounted for options granted in accordance with
    Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25; thus, no
    compensation expense was recognized because the exercise price
    of all options granted equaled the fair market value on the date
    of the grant.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair
    value recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123(R),
    “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123(R)),
    using the modified prospective method. Under that method,
    compensation cost for the year ended December 31, 2006 is
    recognized as the requisite service is rendered and includes:
    (a) compensation cost for the portion of share-based awards
    granted prior to and that were outstanding as of January 1,
    2006, for which the requisite service has not been rendered,
    based on the grant-date fair value of those awards as calculated
    in accordance with the original provisions of FASB Statement
    No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-based
    Compensation” (SFAS No. 123), and
    (b) compensation cost for all share-based awards granted
    subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair
    value estimated in accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123(R). Results for prior periods have not
    been restated.

The compensation cost and tax benefit related to the grant and
    exercise of Southern Company stock options to the Company’s
    employees are recognized in the Company’s financial
    statements with a corresponding credit to equity, representing a
    capital contribution from Southern Company.

For the Company, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) has
    resulted in a reduction in earnings before income taxes and net
    income of $1.0 million and $0.6 million, respectively,
    for the year ended December 31, 2006. Additionally,
    SFAS No. 123(R) requires the gross excess tax benefit
    from stock option exercises to be reclassified as a financing
    cash flow as opposed to an operating cash flow; the reduction in
    operating cash flows and increase in financing cash flows for
    the year ended December 31, 2006 was $0.4 million.

For the years prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the
    pro forma impact on net income of fair-value accounting for
    options granted is as follows:

Because historical forfeitures have been insignificant and are
    expected to remain insignificant, no forfeitures are assumed in
    the calculation of compensation expense; rather they are
    recognized when they occur.

The estimated fair values of stock options granted in 2006,
    2005, and 2004 were derived using the Black-Scholes stock option
    pricing model. Expected volatility is based on historical
    volatility of Southern Company’s stock over a period equal
    to the expected term. The Company uses historical exercise data
    to estimate the expected term that represents the period of time
    that options granted to employees are expected to be
    outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on the
    U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant
    that covers the expected term of the stock options. The
    following table shows the assumptions used in the pricing model
    and the weighted average grant-date fair value of stock options
    granted:

Financial
    Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit
    exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, the prices of
    certain fuel purchases, and electricity purchases and sales. All
    derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets
    or liabilities and are measured at fair value. Substantially all
    of the Company’s bulk energy purchases and sales contracts
    that meet the definition of a derivative are exempt from fair
    value accounting requirements and are accounted for under the
    accrual method. Other derivative contracts qualify as cash flow
    hedges of anticipated transactions or are recoverable through
    the Florida PSC-approved hedging program. This results in the
    deferral of related gains and losses in other comprehensive
    income or regulatory assets and liabilities, respectively, until
    the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness arising from
    cash flow hedges is recognized currently in net income. Other
    derivative contracts are marked to market through current period
    income and are recorded on a net basis in the statements of
    income.

The Company is exposed to losses related to financial
    instruments in the event of counterparties’ nonperformance.
    The Company has established controls to determine and monitor
    the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate the
    Company’s exposure to counterparty credit risk.

Other financial instruments for which the carrying amounts did
    not equal fair values at December 31 were as follows:

The fair values were based on either closing market prices or
    closing prices of comparable instruments.

Comprehensive
    Income

The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of
    all changes in common stock equity of an enterprise that result
    from transactions and other economic events of the period other
    than transactions with owners. Comprehensive income consists of
    net income, changes in the fair value of qualifying cash flow
    hedges and marketable securities, and changes in additional
    minimum pension liability, less income taxes and
    reclassifications for amounts included in net income.

Variable
    Interest Entities

The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity must
    consolidate the related assets and liabilities. The Company has
    established certain wholly-owned trusts to issue preferred
    securities. See Note 6 under “Long-Term Debt Payable
    to Affiliated Trusts” for additional information. However,
    the Company is not considered the primary beneficiary of the
    trusts. Therefore, the investments in these trusts are reflected
    as Other Investments for the Company, and the related loans from
    the trusts are reflected as Long-term Debt Payable to Affiliated
    Trusts in the balance sheets.

RETIREMENT
    BENEFITS

The Company has a defined benefit, trusteed, pension plan
    covering substantially all employees. The plan is funded in
    accordance with requirements of the Employee Retirement Income
    Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). No contributions to
    the plan are expected for the year ending December 31,
    2007. The Company also provides a defined benefit pension plan
    for a selected group of management and highly compensated
    employees. Benefits under this non-qualified plan are funded on
    a cash basis. In addition, the Company provides certain medical
    care and life insurance benefits for retired employees through
    other postretirement benefit plans. The Company funds related
    trusts to the extent required by the Florida PSC. For the year
    ending December 31, 2007, postretirement trust
    contributions are expected to total approximately $60,000.

On December 31, 2006, the Company adopted FASB Statement
    No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined
    Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans”
    (SFAS No. 158), which requires recognition of the
    funded status of its defined benefit postretirement plans in its
    balance sheet. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 158,
    the Company generally recognized only the difference between the
    benefit expense recognized and employer contributions to the
    plan as either a prepaid asset or as a liability. With respect
    to its underfunded non-qualified pension plan, the Company
    recognized an additional minimum liability representing the
    difference between the plan’s accumulated benefit
    obligation and its assets.

With the adoption of SFAS No. 158, the Company was
    required to recognize on its balance sheet previously
    unrecognized assets and liabilities related to unrecognized
    prior service cost, unrecognized gains or losses (from changes
    in actuarial assumptions and the difference between actual and
    expected returns on plan assets), and any unrecognized
    transition amounts (resulting from the change from cash-basis
    accounting to accrual accounting). These amounts will continue
    to be amortized as a component of expense over the
    employees’ remaining average service life as
    SFAS No. 158 did not change the recognition of pension
    and other postretirement benefit expense in the statements of
    income. With the adoption of SFAS No. 158, the Company
    recorded an additional prepaid pension asset of
    $23.5 million with respect to its overfunded defined
    benefit plan and additional liabilities of $2.5 million and
    $12.9 million, respectively, related to its underfunded
    non-qualified pension plan and retiree benefit plans. The
    incremental effect of applying SFAS No. 158 on
    individual line items in the balance sheets at December 31,
    2006 follows:

Because the recovery of postretirement benefit expense through
    rates is considered probable, the Company recorded offsetting
    regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities under the provisions
    of SFAS No. 71 with respect to the prepaid assets and
    the liabilities.

The measurement date for plan assets and obligations is
    September 30 for each year presented. Pursuant to
    SFAS No. 158, the Company will be required to change
    the measurement date for its defined benefit postretirement
    plans from September 30 to December 31 beginning with
    the year ending December 31, 2008.

Pension
    Plans

The accumulated benefit obligation for the pension plans was

At December 31, 2006, the projected benefit obligations for
    the qualified and non-qualified pension plans were
    $235.6 million and $10.9 million, respectively. All
    plan assets are related to the qualified pension plan.

Pension plan assets are managed and invested in accordance with
    all applicable requirements, including ERISA and the Internal
    Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Internal Revenue Code). The
    Company’s investment policy covers a diversified mix of
    assets, including equity and fixed income securities, real
    estate, and private equity. Derivative instruments are used
    primarily as hedging tools but may also be used to gain
    efficient exposure to the various asset classes. The Company
    primarily minimizes the risk of large losses through
    diversification but also monitors and manages other aspects of
    risk. The actual composition of the Company’s pension plan

Net periodic pension cost (income) is the sum of service cost,
    interest cost, and other costs netted against the expected
    return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets is
    determined by multiplying the expected rate of return on plan
    assets and the market-related value of plan assets. In
    determining the market-related value of plan assets, the Company
    has elected to amortize changes in the market value of all plan
    assets over five years rather than recognize the changes
    immediately. As a result, the accounting value of plan assets
    that is used to calculate the expected return on plan assets
    differs from the current fair value of the plan assets.

Future benefit payments reflect expected future service and are
    estimated based on assumptions used to measure the projected
    benefit obligation for the pension plans. At December 31,

requires recognition of the impacts of the Medicare Act in the

Actuarial
    Assumptions

The weighted average rates assumed in the actuarial calculations
    used to determine both the benefit obligations as of the
    measurement date and the net periodic costs for the pension and
    other postretirement benefit plans for the following year are
    presented below. Net periodic benefit costs for 2004 were

The Company determined the long-term rate of return based on

    taking into account the diversification benefits of investing in
    multiple asset classes.

An additional assumption used in measuring the APBO was a
    weighted average medical care cost trend rate of
    9.56 percent for 2007, decreasing gradually to
    5.00 percent through the year 2015 and remaining at that
    level thereafter. An annual increase or decrease in the assumed
    medical care cost trend rate of 1 percent would affect the
    APBO and the service and interest cost components at

    employee’s base salary. Prior to November 2006, the Company
    matched employee contributions at a rate of 75 percent up
    to 6 percent of the employee’s base salary. Total
    matching contributions made to the plan for 2006, 2005, and 2004
    were $3.0 million, $2.9 million, and
    $2.7 million, respectively.

CONTINGENCIES
    AND REGULATORY MATTERS

General
    Litigation Matters

The Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions
    arising in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the
    Company’s business activities are subject to extensive
    governmental regulation related to public health and the
    environment. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of
    various types, including property damage, personal injury, and
    citizen enforcement of environmental requirements such as
    opacity and other air quality standards, has increased generally
    throughout the United States. In particular, personal injury
    claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous
    materials have become more frequent. The ultimate outcome of
    such pending or potential litigation against the Company cannot
    be predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not
    specifically reported herein, management does not anticipate
    that the liabilities, if any, arising from such current
    proceedings would have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s financial statements.

Environmental
    Matters

New
    Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the EPA brought a civil action in the
    U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia
    against certain Southern Company subsidiaries, including Alabama
    Power and Georgia Power, alleging that these subsidiaries had
    violated the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air
    Act and related state laws at certain coal-fired generating
    facilities. Through subsequent amendments and other legal
    procedures, the EPA filed a separate action in January 2001
    against Alabama Power in the U.S. District Court for the
    Northern District of Alabama after it was dismissed from the
    original action. In these lawsuits, the EPA alleged that NSR
    violations occurred at eight coal-fired generating facilities
    operated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power (including a
    facility formerly owned by Savannah Electric). The civil actions
    request penalties and injunctive relief, including an order
    requiring the installation of the best available control
    technology at the affected units. The EPA concurrently issued
    notices of violation relating to the Company’s Plant Crist
    and a unit partially owned by the Company at Plant Scherer. See
    Note 4 for information on the Company’s ownership
    interest in Plant Scherer Unit 3. In early 2000, the EPA filed a
    motion to amend its complaint to add the allegations in the
    notices of violation and to add the Company as a defendant.
    However, in March 2001, the court denied the motion based on
    lack of jurisdiction, and the EPA has not refiled.

On June 19, 2006, the U.S. District Court for the
    Northern District of Alabama entered a consent decree between
    Alabama Power and the EPA, resolving the alleged NSR violations
    at Plant Miller. The consent decree required Alabama Power to
    pay $100,000 to resolve the government’s claim for a civil
    penalty and to

donate $4.9 million of sulfur dioxide emission allowances
    to a nonprofit charitable organization and formalized specific
    emissions reductions to be accomplished by Alabama Power,
    consistent with other Clean Air Act programs that require
    emissions reductions. On August 14, 2006, the district
    court in Alabama granted Alabama Power’s motion for summary
    judgment and entered final judgment in favor of Alabama Power on
    the EPA’s claims related to Plants Barry, Gaston, Gorgas,
    and Greene County. The plaintiffs have appealed this decision to
    the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit and, on
    November 14, 2006, the Eleventh Circuit granted the
    plaintiffs’ request to stay the appeal, pending the
    U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in a similar NSR case
    filed by the EPA against Duke Energy. The action against Georgia
    Power has been administratively closed since the spring of 2001,
    and none of the parties has sought to reopen the case.

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and
    the EPA regulations and interpretations in effect at the time
    the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act authorizes
    maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $32,500 per day, per
    violation at each generating unit, depending on the date of the
    alleged violation. An adverse outcome in this matter could
    require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be
    determined at this time and could possibly require payment of
    substantial penalties. Such expenditures could affect future
    results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition if
    such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

Environmental
    Remediation

At December 31, 2006, the Company’s liability for the
    estimated costs of environmental remediation projects for known
    sites was $57.2 million. The schedule for completion of the
    remediation projects will be subject to Florida Department of
    Environmental Protection (FDEP) approval. These projects
    have been approved by the Florida PSC for recovery through the
    environmental cost recovery clause. Therefore, the Company has
    recorded $1.7 million in Current Assets and Current
    Liabilities and $55.5 million in Deferred Charges and Other
    Assets and Deferred Credits and Other Liabilities representing
    the future recoverability of these costs.

The final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.
    However, based on the currently known conditions at these sites
    and the nature and extent of the Company’s activities
    relating to these sites, management does not believe that the
    Company’s additional liability, if any, at these sites
    would be material to the financial statements.

FERC
    Matters

Market-Based
    Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to
    non-affiliates, including short-term opportunity sales, at
    market-based prices. Specific FERC approval must be obtained
    with respect to a market-based contract with an affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess
    Southern Company’s generation dominance within its retail
    service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in
    other markets is not an issue in that proceeding. Any new
    market-based rate sales by the Company in Southern
    Company’s retail service territory entered into during a

15-month

refund period beginning February 27, 2005 could be subject
    to refund to the level of the default cost-based rates, pending
    the outcome of the proceeding. Such sales through May 27,
    2006, the end of the refund period, were approximately
    $0.8 million for the Company. In the event that the
    FERC’s default mitigation measures for entities that are
    found to have market power are ultimately applied, the Company
    may be required to charge cost-based rates for certain wholesale
    sales in the Southern Company retail service territory, which
    may be lower than negotiated market-based rates. The final
    outcome of this matter will depend on the form in which the
    final methodology for assessing generation market power and
    mitigation rules may be ultimately adopted and cannot be
    determined at this time.

In addition, in May 2005, the FERC started an investigation to
    determine whether Southern Company satisfies the other three
    parts of the FERC’s market-based rate analysis:
    transmission market power, barriers to entry, and affiliate
    abuse or reciprocal dealing. The FERC established a new

15-month

refund period related to this expanded investigation. Any new
    market-based rate sales involving any Southern Company
    subsidiary, including the Company, could be subject to refund to
    the extent the FERC orders lower rates as a result of this new
    investigation. Such sales through October 19, 2006, the end
    of the refund period, were approximately $3 million for the
    Company, of which $0.6 million relates to sales inside the
    retail service territory discussed above. The FERC also directed
    that this expanded proceeding be held in abeyance pending the
    outcome of the proceeding on the Intercompany Interchange
    Contract (IIC) discussed below. On January 3, 2007,
    the FERC issued an order noting settlement of the IIC
    proceeding and seeking comment identifying any remaining issues
    and the proper procedure for addressing any such issues.

The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for
    these proceedings and is vigorously defending

II-232

itself in this matter. However, the final outcome of this
    matter, including any remedies to be applied in the event of an
    adverse ruling in these proceedings, cannot now be determined.

Intercompany
    Interchange Contract

The Company’s generation fleet is operated under
    the IIC, as approved by the FERC. In May 2005, the FERC
    initiated a new proceeding to examine (1) the provisions of
    the IIC among Alabama Power, Georgia Power, the Company,
    Mississippi Power, Savannah Electric, Southern Power, and SCS,
    as agent, under the terms of which the power pool of Southern
    Company is operated, and, in particular, the propriety of the
    continued inclusion of Southern Power as a party to
    the IIC, (2) whether any parties to the IIC have
    violated the FERC’s standards of conduct applicable to
    utility companies that are transmission providers, and
    (3) whether Southern Company’s code of conduct
    defining Southern Power as a “system company” rather
    than a “marketing affiliate” is just and reasonable.
    In connection with the formation of Southern Power, the FERC
    authorized Southern Power’s inclusion in the IIC in
    2000. The FERC also previously approved Southern Company’s
    code of conduct.

On October 5, 2006, the FERC issued an order accepting a
    settlement resolving the proceeding subject to Southern
    Company’s agreement to accept certain modifications to the
    settlement’s terms. On October 20, 2006, Southern
    Company notified the FERC that it accepted the modifications.
    The modifications largely involve functional separation and
    information restrictions related to marketing activities
    conducted on behalf of Southern Power. Southern Company filed
    with the FERC on November 6, 2006 an implementation plan to
    comply with the modifications set forth in the order. The impact
    of the modifications is not expected to have a material impact
    on the Company’s financial statements.

Generation
    Interconnection Agreements

In July 2003, the FERC issued its final rule on the
    standardization of generation interconnection agreements and
    procedures (Order 2003). Order 2003 shifts much of the financial
    burden of new transmission investment from the generator to the
    transmission provider. The FERC has indicated that Order 2003,
    which was effective January 20, 2004, is to be applied
    prospectively to new generating facilities interconnecting to a
    transmission system. Order 2003 was affirmed by the
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
    on January 12, 2007. The cost impact resulting from Order
    2003 will vary on a

case-by-case

basis for each new generator interconnecting to the transmission
    system.

On November 22, 2004, generator company subsidiaries of
    Tenaska, Inc (Tenaska), as counterparties to three previously
    executed interconnection agreements with subsidiaries of
    Southern Company filed complaints at the FERC requesting that
    the FERC modify the agreements and that those Southern Company
    subsidiaries refund a total of $19 million previously paid
    for interconnection facilities, with interest. Southern Company
    has also received requests for similar modifications from other
    entities, though no other complaints are pending with the FERC.
    On January 19, 2007, the FERC issued an order granting
    Tenaska’s requested relief. Although the FERC’s order
    requires the modification of Tenaska’s interconnection
    agreements, the order reduces the amount of the refund that had
    been requested by Tenaska. As a result, Southern Company
    estimates indicate that no refund is due to Tenaska. Southern
    Company has requested rehearing of the FERC’s order. The
    final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Right of
    Way Litigation

Southern Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including the
    Company, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Telecom,
    have been named as defendants in numerous lawsuits brought by
    landowners since 2001. The plaintiffs’ lawsuits claim that
    defendants may not use, or sublease to third parties, some or
    all of the fiber optic communications lines on the rights of way
    that cross the plaintiffs’ properties, and that such
    actions exceed the easements or other property rights held by
    defendants. The plaintiffs assert claims for, among other
    things, trespass and unjust enrichment, and seek compensatory
    and punitive damages and injunctive relief. The Company’s
    management believes that it has complied with applicable laws
    and that the plaintiffs’ claims are without merit.

In November 2003, the Second Circuit Court in Gadsden County,
    Florida, ruled in favor of the plaintiffs on their motion for
    partial summary judgment concerning liability in one such
    lawsuit brought by landowners regarding the installation and use
    of fiber optic cable over the Company’s rights of way
    located on the landowners’ property. Subsequently, the
    plaintiffs sought to amend their complaint and asked the court
    to enter a final declaratory judgment and to enter an order
    enjoining the Company from allowing expanded general
    telecommunications use of the fiber optic cables that are the
    subject of this litigation. In January 2005, the trial court
    granted in part the plaintiffs’ motion to amend their
    complaint and denied the requested declaratory and injunctive
    relief. In November 2005, the trial court ruled

II-233


NOTES

(continued)

Gulf Power Company 2006 Annual Report

in favor of the plaintiffs and against the Company on their
    respective motions for partial summary judgment. In that same
    order, the trial court also denied the Company’s motion to
    dismiss certain claims. The court’s ruling allowed for an
    immediate appeal to the Florida First District Court of Appeal,
    which the Company filed in December 2005. On October 26,
    2006, the Florida First District Court of Appeal issued an order
    dismissing the Company’s December 2005 appeal on the basis
    that the trial court’s order was a non-final order and
    therefore not subject to review on appeal at this time. The case
    is once again pending in the trial court for further
    proceedings. The final outcome of this matter cannot now be
    determined. In the event of an adverse verdict in this case, the
    Company could appeal the issues of both liability and damages or
    other relief granted.

In addition, in late 2001, certain subsidiaries of Southern
    Company, including the Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power,
    Mississippi Power, Savannah Electric, and Southern Telecom, were
    named as defendants in a lawsuit brought by a telecommunications
    company that uses certain of the defendants’ rights of way.
    This lawsuit alleges, among other things, that the defendants
    are contractually obligated to indemnify, defend, and hold
    harmless the telecommunications company from any liability that
    may be assessed against it in pending and future right of way
    litigation. The Company believes that the plaintiff’s
    claims are without merit. In the fall of 2004, the trial court
    stayed the case until resolution of the underlying landowner
    litigation discussed above. In January 2005, the Georgia Court
    of Appeals dismissed the telecommunications company’s
    appeal of the trial court’s order for lack of jurisdiction.
    An adverse outcome in this matter, combined with an adverse
    outcome against the telecommunications company in one or more of
    the right of way lawsuits, could result in substantial
    judgments; however, the final outcome of these matters cannot
    now be determined.

Property
    Tax Dispute

Georgia Power and the Company are involved in a significant
    property tax dispute with Monroe County, Georgia (Monroe
    County). The Monroe County Board of Tax Assessors (Monroe Board)
    has issued assessments reflecting substantial increases in the
    ad valorem tax valuation of the Company’s 6.25 percent
    ownership interest in Plant Scherer, which is located in Monroe
    County, for tax years 2003 through 2006. Georgia Power and the
    Company are aggressively pursuing administrative appeals in
    Monroe County and have filed notices of arbitration for all four
    years. The appeals are currently stayed, pending the outcome of
    the litigation discussed below.

In November 2004, Georgia Power filed suit, on its own behalf,
    against the Monroe Board in the Superior Court of Monroe County.
    The suit could impact all co-owners. Georgia Power contends that
    Monroe County acted without statutory authority in changing the
    valuation of a centrally assessed utility as established by the
    Revenue Commissioner of the State of Georgia and requests
    injunctive relief prohibiting Monroe County and the Monroe Board
    from unlawfully changing the value of Plant Scherer and
    ultimately collecting additional ad valorem taxes from Georgia
    Power. In December 2005, the Court granted Monroe County’s
    motion for summary judgment. Georgia Power has filed an appeal
    of the Superior Court’s decision to the Georgia Supreme
    Court.

If Georgia Power is not successful in its administrative appeals
    and if Monroe County is successful in defending the litigation,
    the Company could be subject to total additional taxes through
    December 31, 2006 of up to $4.4 million, plus
    penalties and interest. In accordance with the Company’s
    unit power sales contract for Plant Scherer, such property taxes
    would be recoverable from the customer. The final outcome of
    this matter cannot now be determined.

Retail
    Regulatory Matters

Environmental
    Cost Recovery

The Florida Legislature adopted legislation for an environmental
    cost recovery clause, which allows an electric utility to
    petition the Florida PSC for recovery of prudent environmental
    compliance costs that are not being recovered through base rates
    or any other recovery mechanism. Such environmental costs
    include operation and maintenance expense, emission allowance
    expense, depreciation, and a return on invested capital. This
    legislation also allows recovery of costs incurred as a result
    of an agreement between the Company and the FDEP for the purpose
    of ensuring compliance with ozone ambient air quality standards
    adopted by the EPA. During 2006, 2005, and 2004, the Company
    recorded environmental cost recovery clause revenues of
    $40.9 million, $26.3 million, and $14.7 million,
    respectively. Annually, the Company seeks recovery of projected
    costs including any

true-up

amounts from prior periods. At December 31, 2006, the over
    recovered balance was $6.8 million primarily due to
    operations and maintenance expenses being less than anticipated.

Storm
    Damage Cost Recovery

Under authority granted by the Florida PSC, the Company
    maintains a reserve for property damage to cover the cost of
    uninsured damages from major storms to its transmission and
    distribution facilities, generation facilities, and other
    property.

Hurricanes Dennis and Katrina hit the Gulf Coast of Florida in
    July 2005 and August 2005, respectively, damaging portions of
    the Company’s service area. In September 2004, Hurricane
    Ivan hit the Gulf Coast of Florida, causing substantial damage
    within the Company’s service area. In 2005, the Florida PSC
    issued an order (2005 Order) that approved a stipulation and
    settlement between the Company and several consumer groups and
    thereby authorized the recovery of the Company’s storm
    damage costs related to Hurricane Ivan through the two-year
    surcharge that began in April 2005.

In July 2006, the Florida PSC issued an order (2006 Order)
    approving another stipulation and settlement between the Company
    and several consumer groups that resolved all matters relating
    to the Company’s request for recovery of incurred costs for
    storm-recovery activities related to the 2005 storms and the
    replenishment of the Company’s property damage reserve. The
    2006 Order provides for an extension of the storm-recovery
    surcharge currently being collected by the Company for an
    additional 27 months, expiring in June 2009.

According to the 2006 Order, the funds resulting from the
    extension of the current surcharge will first be credited to the
    unrecovered balance of storm-recovery costs associated with
    Hurricane Ivan until these costs have been fully recovered. The
    funds will then be credited to the property reserve for recovery
    of the storm-recovery costs of $52.6 million associated
    with Hurricanes Dennis and Katrina that were previously charged
    to the reserve. Should revenues collected by the Company through
    the extension of the storm-recovery surcharge exceed the
    storm-recovery costs associated with Hurricanes Dennis and
    Katrina, the excess revenues will be credited to the reserve.

The annual accrual to the reserve of $3.5 million and the
    Company’s limited discretionary authority to make
    additional accruals to the reserve will continue as previously
    approved by the Florida PSC. The Company made discretionary
    accruals to the reserve of $3 million, $6 million, and
    $15 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. As part
    of the 2005 Order regarding Hurricane Ivan costs that
    established the existing surcharge, the Company agreed that it
    would not seek any additional increase in its base rates and
    charges to become effective on or before March 1, 2007. The
    terms of the 2006 Order do not alter or affect that portion of
    the prior agreement.

According to the 2006 Order, in the case of future storms, if
    the Company incurs cumulative costs for storm-recovery
    activities in excess of $10 million during any calendar
    year, the Company will be permitted to file a streamlined formal
    request for an interim surcharge. Any interim surcharge would
    provide for the recovery, subject to refund, of up to
    80 percent of the claimed costs for storm-recovery
    activities. The Company would then petition the Florida PSC for
    full recovery through a final or non-interim surcharge or other
    cost recovery mechanism.

See Note 1 under “Property Damage Reserve” for
    additional information.

JOINT
    OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS

The Company and Mississippi Power jointly own Plant Daniel Units
    1 and 2, which together represent capacity of 1,000
    megawatts (MW). Plant Daniel is a generating plant located in
    Jackson County, Mississippi. In accordance with the operating
    agreement, Mississippi Power acts as the Company’s agent
    with respect to the construction, operation, and maintenance of
    these units.

The Company and Georgia Power jointly own the 818 MW
    capacity Plant Scherer Unit 3. Plant Scherer is a generating
    plant located near Forsyth, Georgia. In accordance with the
    operating agreement, Georgia Power acts as the Company’s
    agent with respect to the construction, operation, and
    maintenance of the unit.

The Company’s pro rata share of expenses related to both
    plants is included in the corresponding operating expense
    accounts in the statements of income.

At December 31, 2006, the Company’s percentage

INCOME
    TAXES

Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return
    and combined State of Mississippi and State of Georgia income
    tax returns. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation
    agreement, each subsidiary’s current and deferred tax
    expense is computed on a stand-alone basis and no subsidiary is
    allocated more expense than would be paid if they filed a
    separate income tax return. In accordance with Internal Revenue
    Service regulations, each company is jointly and severally
    liable for the tax liability.

At December 31, 2006, the tax-related regulatory assets to
    be recovered from customers were $17.1 million. These
    assets are attributable to tax benefits flowed through to
    customers in prior years and to taxes applicable to capitalized
    allowance for funds used during construction. At
    December 31, 2006, the tax-related regulatory liabilities
    to be credited to customers were $17.9 million. These
    liabilities are attributable to deferred taxes previously
    recognized at rates higher than the current enacted tax law and
    to unamortized investment tax credits.

FINANCING

Long-Term
    Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts

The Company has formed certain wholly owned trust subsidiaries
    for the purpose of issuing preferred securities. The proceeds of
    the related equity investments and preferred security sales were
    loaned back to the Company through the issuance of junior
    subordinated notes totaling $41.2 million, which constitute
    substantially all of the assets of these trusts and are
    reflected in the balance sheets as Long-term Debt Payable to
    Affiliated Trusts. The Company considers that the mechanisms and
    obligations relating to the preferred securities issued for its
    benefit, taken together, constitute a full and unconditional
    guarantee by it of the trusts’ payment obligations with
    respect to these securities. At December 31, 2006,
    $41.2 million of these securities were outstanding. See
    Note 1 under “Variable Interest Entities” for
    additional information on the accounting treatment for these
    trusts and the related securities.

Outstanding
    Classes of Capital Stock

The Company currently has preferred stock, Class A
    preferred stock, preference stock, and common stock authorized.
    The Company’s preferred stock and Class A preferred
    stock, without preference between classes, rank senior to the
    Company’s preference stock and common stock with respect to
    the payment of dividends and voluntary or involuntary
    dissolution. No shares of preferred stock or Class A
    preferred stock were outstanding at December 31, 2006. The
    Company’s preference stock ranks senior to the common stock
    with respect to the payment of dividends and voluntary or
    involuntary dissolution. The outstanding preference stock is
    subject to redemption at the option of the Company on or after
    November 15, 2010.

On January 19, 2007, the Company issued to Southern Company
    800,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, without
    par value, and realized proceeds of $80 million. The
    proceeds were used to repay a portion of the Company’s
    short-term indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes.

Pollution
    Control Bonds

Pollution control obligations represent loans to the Company
    from public authorities of funds derived from sales by such
    authorities of revenue bonds issued to finance pollution control
    facilities. The Company is required to make payments sufficient
    for the authorities to meet principal and interest requirements
    of such bonds totaling $157.6 million.

Assets
    Subject to Lien

In January 2007, the Company’s first mortgage bond
    indenture was discharged. As a result, there are no longer any
    first mortgage liens on the Company’s property and the
    Company no longer has to comply with the covenants and
    restrictions of the first mortgage bond indenture. The Company
    has granted a lien on its property at Plant Daniel in connection
    with the issuance of two series of pollution control bonds with
an outstanding principal amount of $41 million.

There are no agreements or other arrangements among the
    affiliated companies under which the assets of one company have
    been pledged or otherwise made available to satisfy obligations
    of Southern Company or any of its subsidiaries.

Bank
    Credit Arrangements

At the beginning of 2007, the Company had $120 million of
    lines of credit with banks subject to renewal each year, all of
    which remained unused. Of the $120 million,
    $116 million provides liquidity support for the
    Company’s commercial paper program and $4 million of
    daily variable rate pollution control bonds. In connection with
    these credit lines, the Company has agreed to pay commitment
    fees.

Certain credit arrangements contain covenants that limit the
    level of indebtedness to capitalization to 65 percent, as
    defined in the arrangements. At December 31, 2006, the
    Company was in compliance with these covenants.

In addition, certain credit arrangements contain cross default
    provisions to other indebtedness that would trigger an event of
    default if the Company defaulted on indebtedness over a

Company. The Company is currently in compliance with all such
    covenants. In the event of a material adverse change, as defined
    in the Company’s credit agreements, the Company would be
    prohibited from borrowing against unused credit arrangements
    totaling $10 million.

The Company borrows primarily through a commercial paper program
    that has the liquidity support of committed bank credit
    arrangements. The Company may also borrow through various other
    arrangements with banks and through an extendible commercial
    note program. At December 31, 2006, the Company had
    $80.4 million in commercial paper and $40 million in
    bank notes outstanding. At December 31, 2005, the Company
    had $14.5 million in commercial paper and $75 million
    in bank notes outstanding. During 2006, the peak amount
    outstanding for short term debt was $181.6 million and the
    average amount outstanding was $113.8 million. The average
    annual interest rate on commercial paper was 5.36 percent.

Financial
    Instruments

The Company enters into energy-related derivatives to hedge
    exposures to electricity, gas, and other fuel price changes.
    However, due to cost-based rate regulations, the Company has
    limited exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices
    and prices of electricity. The Company has implemented
    fuel-hedging programs with the approval of the Florida PSC. The
    Company enters into hedges of forward electricity sales. There
    was no material ineffectiveness recorded in earnings in 2006,
    2005, and 2004.

At December 31, 2006, the fair value gains/(losses) of
    energy-related derivative contracts were reflected in the
    financial statements as follows:

Amounts

Regulatory assets, net

$

(7,186

Total fair value

(7,186

The fair value gains or losses for cash flow hedges that are
    recoverable through the regulatory fuel clauses are recorded as
    regulatory assets and liabilities and are recognized in earnings
    at the same time the hedged items affect earnings. The Company
    has energy-related hedges in place up to and including 2009.

The Company also may enter into derivatives to hedge exposure to
    interest rate changes. The derivatives employed as hedging
    instruments are structured to minimize ineffectiveness. As such,
    no material ineffectiveness has been recorded in earnings.

In 2006, the Company terminated interest rate derivatives, at
    the same time the related debt was issued, with a notional value
    of $80 million at a cost of $5.4 million. The hedge
    cost will be amortized over a

10-year

period. The Company had no interest rate derivatives at
    December 31, 2006. For the years 2006, 2005, and 2004,
    approximately $0.4 million, $0.3 million, and
    $0.3 million, respectively, of pre-tax losses were
    reclassified from other comprehensive income to interest
    expense. For 2007, pre-tax losses of approximately
    $0.9 million are expected to be reclassified from other
    comprehensive income to interest expense. The Company has losses
    that are being amortized through 2016.

COMMITMENTS

Construction
    Program

The Company is engaged in a continuous construction program, the
    cost of which is currently estimated to total $278 million
    in 2007, $458 million in 2008, and $395 million in
    2009. The construction program is subject to periodic review and
    revision, and actual construction costs may vary from the above
    estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include
    changes in business conditions; acquisition of additional
    generating assets; revised load growth estimates; changes in
    environmental regulations; changes in FERC rules and
    regulations; increasing costs of labor, equipment, and
    materials; and cost of capital. At December 31, 2006,
    significant purchase commitments were outstanding in connection
    with the ongoing construction program.

Included in the amounts above are $171 million in 2007,
    $378 million in 2008, and $300 million in 2009 for
    environmental expenditures. The Company does not have any new
    generating capacity under construction. Construction of new
    transmission and distribution facilities and other capital
    improvements, including those needed to meet environmental
    standards for the Company’s existing generation,
    transmission, and distribution facilities, are ongoing.

Long-Term
    Service Agreements

The Company has a Long-Term Service Agreement (LTSA) with
    General Electric (GE) for the purpose of securing maintenance
    support for combined cycle generating facility. The LTSA
    provides that GE will perform all planned inspections on the
    covered equipment, which includes the cost of all labor and
    materials. GE is also obligated to cover the costs of

II-238


NOTES

(continued)

Gulf Power Company 2006 Annual Report

unplanned maintenance on the covered equipment subject to a
    limit specified in the contract.

In general, the LTSA is in effect through two major inspection
    cycles of the unit. Scheduled payments to GE are made at various
    intervals based on actual operating hours of the unit. Total
    remaining payments to GE under this agreement for facilities
    owned are currently estimated at $74.9 million over the
    remaining life of the agreement, which is currently estimated to
    be up to 9 years. However, the LTSA contains various
    cancellation provisions at the option of the Company.

Payments made to GE prior to the performance of any planned
    inspections are recorded as prepayments. These amounts are
    included in Current Assets and Deferred Charges and Other Assets
    in the balance sheets. Inspection costs are capitalized or
    charged to expense based on the nature of the work performed.

Purchased
    Power and Fuel Commitments

The Company has entered into long-term commitments for the
    purchase of electricity.

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of the generating
    plants, the Company has entered into various long-term
    commitments for the procurement of fossil fuel. In most cases,
    these contracts contain provisions for price escalations,
    minimum purchase levels, and other financial commitments. Coal
    commitments include forward contract purchases for sulfur
    dioxide emission allowances. Natural gas purchase commitments
    contain fixed volumes with prices based on various indices at
    the time of delivery. Amounts included in the chart below
    represent estimates based on New York Mercantile Exchange future
    prices at December 31, 2006.

SCS may enter into various types of wholesale energy and natural
    gas contracts acting as an agent for the Company and all of the
    other Southern Company traditional operating companies and
    Southern Power. Under these agreements, each of the traditional
    operating companies and Southern Power may be jointly and
    severally liable. The creditworthiness of Southern Power is
    currently inferior to the creditworthiness of the traditional
    operating companies. Accordingly, Southern Company has entered
    into keep-well agreements with the Company and each of the other
    traditional operating companies to ensure the Company will not
    subsidize or be responsible for any costs, losses, liabilities,
    or damages resulting from the inclusion of Southern Power as a
    contracting party under these agreements.

Operating
    Leases

The Company has operating lease agreements with various terms
    and expiration dates. Total operating lease expenses were
    $4.9 million, $3.0 million, and $2.0 million, for
    2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Included in these lease
    expenses are railcar lease costs which are charged to fuel
    inventory and are allocated to fuel expense as the fuel is used.
    These expenses are then recovered through the Company’s
    fuel cost recovery clause. The Company’s share of the lease
    costs charged to fuel inventories was $4.6 million in 2006,
    $3.0 million in 2005, and $1.9 million in 2004. The
    Company includes any step rents, escalations, and lease
    concessions in its computation of minimum lease payments, which
    are recognized on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease
    term.

At December 31, 2006, estimated minimum rental commitments
    for noncancelable operating leases were as follows:

The Company and Mississippi Power jointly entered into operating
    lease agreements for aluminum railcars for the transportation of
    coal to Plant Daniel. The Company has the option to purchase the
    railcars at the greater of lease termination value or fair
    market value or to renew the leases at the end of each lease
    term. The Company and Mississippi Power also have separate lease
    agreements for other railcars that do not include purchase
    options.

In addition to railcar leases, the Company has other operating
    leases for fuel handling equipment at Plant Daniel. The
    Company’s share of these leases was charged to fuel
    handling expense in the amount of $0.3 million in 2006. The
    Company’s annual lease payments for 2007 to 2010 will
    average approximately $0.2 million.

STOCK
    OPTION PLAN

Southern Company provides non-qualified stock options to a large
    segment of the Company’s employees ranging from line
    management to executives. As of December 31, 2006, there
    were 283 current and former employees of the Company
    participating in the stock option plan. The maximum number of
    shares of Southern Company common stock that may be issued under
    these programs may not exceed 57 million. The prices of
    options granted to date have been at the fair market value of
    the shares on the dates of grant. Options granted to date become
    exercisable pro rata over a maximum period of three years from
    the date of grant. The Company generally recognizes stock option
    expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period which
    equates to the requisite service period; however, for employees
    who are eligible for retirement the total cost is expensed at
    the grant date. Options outstanding will expire no later than
    10 years after the date of grant, unless terminated earlier
    by the Southern Company Board of Directors in accordance with
    the stock option plan. For certain stock option awards a change
    in control will provide accelerated vesting. As part of the
    adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), as discussed in
    Note 1 under “Stock Options,” Southern Company
    has not modified its stock option plan or outstanding stock
    options, nor has it changed the underlying valuation assumptions
    used in valuing the stock options, that were used under
    SFAS No. 123.

The Company’s activity in the stock option plan for 2006 is
    summarized below:

The number of stock options vested, and expected to vest in the
    future, as of December 31, 2006 is not significantly
    different from the number of stock options outstanding at
    December 31, 2006 as stated above.

As of December 31, 2006, the weighted average remaining
    contractual term for options outstanding and options exercisable
    is 6.6 years and 5.5 years, respectively, and the
    aggregate intrinsic value for the options outstanding and
    options exercisable is $9.7 million and $7.8 million,
    respectively.

As of December 31, 2006, there was $0.5 million of
    total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option
    awards not yet vested. That cost is expected to be recognized
    over a weighted average period of approximately 11 months.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years
    ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 was
    $1.6 million, $4.4 million, and $4.6 million,
    respectively.

The actual tax benefit realized by the Company for the tax
    deductions from stock option exercises totaled
    $0.6 million, $1.7 million, and $1.8 million,
    respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005,
    and 2004.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Mississippi
    Power Company

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements
    of capitalization of Mississippi Power Company (the
    “Company”) (a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern
    Company) as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related
    statements of income, comprehensive income, common
    stockholder’s equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2006. These
    financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to
    have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
    control over financial reporting. Our audits included
    consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a
    basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
    circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
    on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An
    audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
    supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
    the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
    our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements (pages II-267 to
    II-294) present fairly, in all material respects, the
    financial position of Mississippi Power Company at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of its
    operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
    period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America.

As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, in 2006
    Mississippi Power Company changed its method of accounting for
    the funded status of the defined benefit pension and other
    postretirement plans.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

Mississippi Power Company 2006
    Annual Report

OVERVIEW

Business
    Activities

Mississippi Power Company (Company) operates as a vertically
    integrated utility providing electricity to retail customers
    within its traditional service area located within the State of
    Mississippi and to wholesale customers in the Southeast.

Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of
    the Company’s business of selling electricity. These
    factors include the ability to maintain a stable regulatory
    environment, to achieve energy sales growth, and to effectively
    manage and secure timely recovery of rising costs. These costs
    include those related to growing demand, increasingly stringent
    environmental standards, fuel prices, and storm restoration
    following Hurricane Katrina.

Appropriately balancing environmental expenditures with
    reasonable retail rates will continue to challenge the Company
    for the foreseeable future. Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast
    of Mississippi in August 2005, causing substantial damage to the
    Company’s service territory as the worst natural disaster
    in the Company’s history. All of the Company’s 195,000
    customers were without service immediately after the storm.
    Through a coordinated effort with Southern Company, as well as
    non-affiliates, the Company restored power to all who could
    receive it within 12 days. However, over 12,000 customers
    remained unable to receive service as of December 31, 2006.
    In October 2006, the Company received from the Mississippi
    Development Authority (MDA) a Community Development Block Grant
    (CDBG) in the amount of $276.4 million for costs related to
    Hurricane Katrina, of which $267.6 million was for the
    retail portion of the Hurricane Katrina restoration costs.

The Company’s retail base rates are set under Performance
    Evaluation Plan (PEP), a rate plan approved by the Mississippi
    Public Service Commission (PSC). PEP was designed with the
    objective to reduce the impact of rate changes on the customer
    and provide incentives for the Company to keep customer prices
    low and customer satisfaction and reliability high. In December
    2005, the Company made its annual PEP filing for the projected
    2006 test period and requested an annual five percent, or
    $32 million, increase in retail base revenues. The retail
    base rate case became effective April 2006.

In December 2006, the Company made its annual PEP filing for the
    projected 2007 test period in which no rate change was
    requested. See Note 3 to the financial statements under
    “Retail Regulatory Matters – Performance
    Evaluation Plan” for more information on PEP.

Key
    Performance Indicators

In striving to maximize shareholder value while providing cost
    effective energy to customers, the Company continues to focus on
    several key indicators. These indicators are used to measure the
    Company’s performance for customers and employees.

Recognizing the critical role in the Company’s success
    played by the Company employees, employee-related measures are a
    significant management focus. These measures include diversity
    and safety. The 2006 safety performance of the Company was the
    best in the history of the Company with an Occupational Safety
    and Health Administration Incidence Rate of 0.39. This
    achievement resulted in the Company being recognized for the
    best safety performance among all utilities in the Southeastern
    Electric Exchange. Inclusion initiatives resulted in a
    performance above target for the year. In recognition that the
    Company’s long-term financial success is dependent upon how
    well it satisfies its customers’ needs, the Company’s
    retail base rate mechanism, PEP, includes performance indicators
    that directly tie customer service indicators to the
    Company’s allowed return. PEP measures the Company’s
    performance on a 10-point scale as a weighted average of results
    in three areas: average customer price, as compared to prices of
    other regional utilities (weighted at 40 percent); service
    reliability, measured in outage minutes per customer
    (40 percent); and customer satisfaction, measured in
    surveys of residential customers (20 percent). See
    Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail
    Regulatory Matters – Performance Evaluation Plan”
    for more information on PEP.

In addition to the PEP performance indicators, the Company
    focuses on other performance measures, including broader
    measures of customer satisfaction, plant availability, system
    reliability, and net income. The Company’s financial
    success is directly tied to the satisfaction of its customers.
    Management uses customer satisfaction surveys to evaluate the
    Company’s results. Peak season equivalent forced outage
    rate (Peak Season EFOR) is an indicator of plant availability
    and efficient generation fleet operations during the months when
    generation needs are greatest. The rate is calculated by
    dividing the number of hours of forced outages by total
    generation hours. Net income is the primary component of the
    Company’s contribution to Southern Company’s earnings
    per share goal.

    the commitment shown by employees in achieving or exceeding
    management’s expectations.

Earnings

The Company’s net income after dividends on preferred stock
    was $82.0 million in 2006 compared to $73.8 million in
    2005. The increase in 2006 is primarily the result of a
    $25.9 million increase in retail base rates which became
    effective April 1, 2006, a $4.7 million increase in
    wholesale base revenues, and a $2.9 million decrease in
    non-fuel related expenses, partially offset by a
    $13.3 million increase in depreciation and amortization
    expenses due to the amortization of a regulatory liability
    related to Plant Daniel capacity and a depreciation rate
    increase effective January 1, 2006, an $8.6 million
    decrease in total other income and expense as a result of
    charitable contributions, and higher interest rates on long-term
    debt.

Net income after dividends on preferred stock of
    $73.8 million in 2005 decreased when compared to
    $76.8 million in 2004 primarily due to a $15.7 million
    decrease in retail base revenue due to the loss of customers as
    a result of Hurricane Katrina and a $2.5 million increase
    in non-fuel related expenses primarily resulting from increased
    employee benefit expenses, partially offset by a
    $5.8 million decrease in depreciation and amortization
    expenses due to the amortization of a regulatory liability
    related to Plant Daniel capacity, a $3.3 million increase
    in wholesale base revenues, a $1.2 million increase in
    other revenues, and a $2.0 million decrease in dividends on
    preferred stock as compared to 2004 resulting from the loss on
    redemption of preferred stock recognized in the third quarter
    2004.

The net income after dividends on preferred stock of
    $76.8 million in 2004 increased when compared to
    $73.5 million in 2003 due to retail sales growth and higher
    non-territorial energy sales.

Total retail revenues for 2006 increased 4.6 percent when
    compared to 2005 primarily as a result of a retail base rate
    increase effective April 1, 2006. Higher fuel costs also
    contributed to the increase. Total retail revenues for 2005
    increased 5.9 percent when compared to 2004 as a result of
    higher fuel revenue due to the increase in fuel cost. This
    increase in retail revenues was partially offset by reductions
    for the loss of customers in all major classes as a result of
    Hurricane Katrina. Total retail revenues for 2004 increased
    13.2 percent when compared to 2003. While higher fuel costs
    accounted for 92 percent of this increase, sales growth,
    particularly in the industrial class, also contributed to the
    increase.

Electric rates for the Company include provisions to adjust
    billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy
    component of purchased power costs. Under these provisions, fuel
    revenues generally equal fuel expenses, including the fuel
    component of purchased power, and do not affect net income. The
    fuel cost recovery and other revenues increased in 2006 when
    compared to 2005 as a result of higher fuel costs and an
    increase in

kilowatt-hours

(KWH) generated. In 2005, fuel cost recovery and other revenues
    increased as compared to 2004 due to higher fuel costs. During
    2004, fuel cost recovery and other revenues increased as
    compared to 2003 due to an increase in fuel expenses resulting
    from consistently higher fuel prices.

Sales for resale to non-affiliates are influenced by the
    non-affiliate utilities’ own customer demand, plant
    availability, and fuel costs. Total revenues from sales for
    resale to non-affiliates decreased $14.6 million, or
    5.1 percent, in 2006 as compared to 2005 as a result of a
    $14.7 million decrease in energy revenues, of which
    $10.1 million was associated with decreased sales and
    $4.6 million was associated with lower fuel prices. In
    2005, total revenues from sales for resale to non-affiliates
    increased $17.5 million, or 6.6 percent, compared to
    2004. This increase primarily resulted from an increase in price
    per KWH resulting from higher fuel costs. Total revenues from
    sales for resale to non-affiliates increased in 2004 by
    $15.9 million, or 6.4 percent. This increase primarily
    resulted from a $34.1 million increase in energy revenues,
    of which approximately $6 million was associated with
    increased KWH sales and $27.8 million was associated with
    higher fuel prices. The increase in energy revenues was offset
    by an $18.3 million decrease in capacity revenues due to
    the termination of a contract with Dynegy, Inc. in 2003.

Included in sales for resale to non-affiliates are revenues from
    rural electric cooperative associations and municipalities
    located in southeastern Mississippi. Compared to the prior year,
    KWH sales to these utilities increased 8.9 percent due to
    growth in the service territory and recovery from Hurricane
    Katrina in 2006, decreased 5.0 percent due to Hurricane
    Katrina in 2005, and increased 3.3 percent in 2004, with
    the related revenues increasing 7.1 percent,
    16.2 percent, and 12.4 percent, respectively. The
    customer demand experienced by these utilities is determined by
    factors very similar to those experienced by the Company.
    Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in sales
    for resale to non-affiliates. These opportunity sales are made
    at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above the
    Company’s variable cost to produce the energy. KWH sales to
    non-territorial customers decreased 33.0 percent compared
    to 2005 primarily due to less off-system sales resulting from
    increased territorial load.

Revenue from energy sales to affiliated companies within the
    Southern Company system will vary from year to year depending on
    demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at
    each company. These sales are made in accordance with the
    Intercompany Interchange Contract (IIC), as approved by the
    Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). These energy sales
    do not have a significant impact on earnings since the energy is
    generally sold at marginal cost.

Total retail KWH sales increased in 2006 when compared to 2005
    due to restoration of customers lost after Hurricane Katrina in
    2005. Total retail KWH sales decreased in 2005 when compared to
    2004 as the result of the loss of customers following Hurricane
    Katrina. Total retail KWH sales increased in 2004 when compared
    to 2003 as a result of economic recovery in the area which
    affected all customer classes, particularly the industrial class.

Expenses

Total operating expenses increased $21.0 million, or
    2.5 percent, in 2006 when compared to 2005 as a result of
    increases in fuel and purchased power and depreciation and
    amortization expenses. In 2005 and 2004, total operating
    expenses increased $71.2 million, or 9.3 percent, and
    $31.8 million, or 4.3 percent, respectively, primarily
    as the result of increases in fuel and purchased power,
    administrative and general expenses, and taxes other than income.

Fuel
    and Purchased Power

Fuel costs constitute the single largest expense for the
    Company. The mix of fuel sources for generation of electricity
    is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel
    consumed, and the availability of generation.

Details of the Company’s generation, fuel, and purchased
    power are as follows:

Fuel and purchased power expenses were $511.9 million in
    2006, an increase of $9.8 million, or 2.0 percent,
    above the prior year costs. This increase was primarily due to
    an increase of $9.7 million in the cost of fuel and
    purchased power. In 2005, fuel and purchased power expenses were
    $502.1 million, an increase of $70.4 million, or
    16.3 percent, above the prior year costs. This increase was
    the result of a $127.6 million increase in the cost of fuel
    and purchased power and a $57.2 million decrease related to
    total KWH generated and purchased. Fuel and purchased power
    expenses in 2004 were $431.6 million, an increase of
    $108.8 million, or 33.7 percent, above the prior year
    costs. This increase was the result of a $95.4 million
    increase in the cost of fuel and purchased power and a
    $13.3 million increase related to total KWH generated and
    purchased.

Fuel expense increased $80.1 million in 2006 as compared to
    2005 as a result of increases in fuel costs and an increase in
    generation. This increase in fuel expense is due to a
    $30.0 million increase in the cost of fuel due to higher
    coal, gas, transportation, and emission allowance prices and a
    $50.0 million increase related to more KWH generated. Fuel
    expense increased $33.7 million in 2005 as compared to
    2004. Approximately $71 million in additional fuel expenses
    resulted from higher coal, gas, transportation prices, and
    emission allowances, which were partially offset by a
    $36 million decrease resulting from unit outages that
    reduced generation. Fuel expense for 2004 increased
    $95.2 million as compared to 2003. Approximately
    $25 million of the increase was associated with increased

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Mississippi Power Company 2006 Annual Report

generation and approximately $70 million of the increase
    was due to higher coal and gas prices.

Purchased power expense decreased $70.2 million, or
    49 percent, in 2006 when compared to 2005. The decrease was
    primarily due to more generation being available to meet
    customer demand and a decrease in the cost of purchased power.
    Purchased power expense increased $36.7 million, or
    34.4 percent, in 2005 when compared to 2004. The increase
    is primarily the result of the reduction in generation due to
    the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina. In 2004, purchased power
    expense increased $13.6 million, or 14.6 percent, when
    compared to 2003. The increase was primarily due to an increase
    in purchases from non-affiliates to meet increased customer
    demand at lower prices than self-generation. Energy purchases
    vary from year to year depending on demand and the availability
    and cost of the Company’s generating resources. These
    expenses do not have a significant impact on earnings since the
    energy purchases are generally offset by energy revenues through
    the Company’s fuel cost recovery clause.

While prices have moderated somewhat in 2006, a significant
    upward trend in the cost of coal and natural gas has emerged
    since 2003, and volatility in these markets is expected to
    continue. Increased coal prices have been influenced by a
    worldwide increase in demand as a result of rapid economic
    growth in China, as well as by increases in mining and fuel
    transportation costs. Higher natural gas prices in the United
    States are the result of increased demand and slightly lower gas
    supplies despite increased drilling activity. Natural gas
    production and supply interruptions, such as those caused by the
    2004 and 2005 hurricanes, result in an immediate market
    response; however, the long-term impact of this price volatility
    may be reduced by imports of liquefied natural gas if new
    liquefied gas facilities are built. Fuel expenses generally do
    not affect net income, since they are offset by fuel revenues
    under the Company’s fuel cost recovery clause. See FUTURE
    EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “PSC Matters –
    Fuel Cost Recovery” and Note 1 to the financial
    statements under “Fuel Costs” for additional
    information.

Other
    Operations and Maintenance

Total other operations and maintenance expense decreased
    $2.9 million from 2005 to 2006. Other operations expense
    increased $1.9 million, or 1.1 percent, in 2006
    compared to 2005 primarily as a result of a $1.8 million
    increase in distribution operations expense and a
    $1.5 million increase in employee benefit expenses,
    partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in bad debt
    expense. In 2005, other operations expense increased
    $7.9 million, or 4.9 percent, compared to 2004
    primarily as a result a $5.2 million increase in employee
    benefit expenses, a $1.7 million increase in rent expense
    on the Plant Daniel combined cycle lease, and higher bad debt
    expense of $1.0 million primarily resulting from Hurricane
    Katrina. In 2004, other operations expense decreased
    $69.2 million, or 30 percent, due to approximately
    $11 million incurred in 2003 to restructure the Plant
    Daniel combined cycle lease agreement and $60 million in
    expense recorded in 2003 in connection with the recognition of a
    regulatory liability following an accounting order from the
    Mississippi PSC related to Plant Daniel capacity expense. See
    FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – “Off-Balance
    Sheet Financing Arrangements” and Notes 3 and 7 to the
    financial statements under “Retail Regulatory
    Matters – Performance Evaluation Plan” and
    “Operating Leases – Plant Daniel Combined Cycle
    Generating Units,” respectively, for additional information.

Maintenance expense decreased $4.9 million, or
    6.8 percent, in 2006, primarily due to the
    $3.4 million accrual of certain expenses arising from
    Hurricane Katrina related to the wholesale portion of the
    business in 2005 and the $2.8 million partial recovery of
    these expenses from the CDBG in 2006, partially offset by a
    $0.5 million increase in 2006 due to the increased
    operation of combined cycle units as gas costs decreased in 2006
    when compared to 2005. Maintenance expense decreased
    $5.7 million, or 7.5 percent, in 2005 primarily as a
    result of a $1.1 million decrease in the operation of
    combined cycle units due to higher gas prices in 2005 when
    compared to 2004 and a $4.5 million decrease in maintenance
    expense associated with changes in scheduled maintenance as a
    result of restoration efforts. These restoration expenses have
    been deferred in accordance with a Mississippi PSC order. See
    FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “PSC
    Matters – Storm Damage Cost Recovery” herein and
    Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail
    Regulatory Matters – Storm Damage Cost Recovery”
    for additional information. In 2004, maintenance expense
    increased $7.0 million, or 9.9 percent, over the prior
    year, primarily resulting from higher operation of combined
    cycle units and increased distribution line maintenance during
    2004 as compared to 2003. See Note 7 to the financial
    statements under “Long-Term Service Agreements” for
    further information.

Depreciation
    and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased
    $13.3 million in 2006 compared to 2005 due to amortization
    related to a regulatory liability recorded in 2003 in connection
    with the Mississippi PSC’s accounting order on Plant Daniel
    capacity and the impact of a new depreciation study effective
    January 1, 2006. Depreciation

Mississippi Power Company 2006 Annual Report

and amortization expenses decreased $5.8 million in 2005
    and $16.3 million in 2004 as compared to the prior years
    primarily as a result of amortization related to a regulatory
    liability recorded in 2003 in connection with the Mississippi
    PSC’s accounting order on the Plant Daniel capacity. See
    Note 3 under “Retail Regulatory Matters –
    Performance Evaluation Plan” for additional information.

Taxes
    Other Than Income Taxes

Taxes other than income taxes increased 1.4 percent in 2006
    compared to 2005 primarily as a result of a $0.5 million
    increase in ad valorem taxes and a $0.3 million increase in
    municipal franchise taxes. The retail portion, or approximately
    83 percent, of the increase in ad valorem taxes is
    recoverable under the Company’s ad valorem tax cost
    recovery clause and, therefore, does not affect net income. The
    increase in municipal franchise taxes is directly related to the
    increase in total retail revenues. In 2005, taxes other than
    income taxes increased 8.1 percent over the prior year
    primarily due to a $2.9 million increase in ad valorem
    taxes and a $1.1 million increase in municipal franchise
    taxes. Taxes other than income taxes increased 2.9 percent
    in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to additional
    municipal franchise taxes.

Total
    Other Income and (Expense)

The $8.6 million decrease in total other income and expense
    in 2006 compared to 2005 is primarily due to charitable
    contributions and higher interest rates on long-term debt. The
    increases in total other income and expense in 2005 compared to
    2004 are due to a reversal, as a result of changes in the legal
    and regulatory environment, of a $2.5 million liability
    originally recorded for the potential assessment of interest
    associated with a customer advance. This amount was partially
    offset by expenses related to recovery from Hurricane Katrina.
    In 2004, the increase in total other income and expense compared
    to 2003 was due to interest rates on long-term debt decreasing
    and lower principal amount of debt outstanding.

Effects
    of Inflation

The Company is subject to rate regulation that is based on the
    recovery of costs. PEP is based on annual projected costs,
    including estimates for inflation. When historical costs are
    included, or when inflation exceeds projected costs used in rate
    regulation, the effects of inflation can create an economic loss
    since the recovery of costs could be in dollars that have less
    purchasing power. In addition, the income tax laws are based on
    historical costs. The inflation rate has been relatively low in
    recent years and any adverse effect of inflation on the Company
    has not been significant.

FUTURE
    EARNINGS POTENTIAL

General

The Company operates as a vertically integrated utility
    providing electricity to retail customers within its traditional
    service area located in southeast Mississippi and wholesale
    customers in the southeastern United States. Prices for
    electricity relating to purchased power agreements,
    interconnecting transmission lines and the exchange of electric
    power are regulated by the FERC. Prices for electricity provided
    by the Company to retail customers are set by the Mississippi
    PSC under cost-based regulatory principles. Retail rates and
    earnings are reviewed and may be adjusted periodically within
    certain limitations. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES –
    “Application of Critical Accounting Policies and
    Estimates – Electric Utility Regulation” herein
    and Note 3 to the financial statements under “FERC
    Matters” and “Retail Regulatory Matters” for
    additional information about regulatory matters.

The results of operations for the past three years are not
    necessarily indicative of future earnings potential. The level
    of the Company’s future earnings depends on numerous
    factors that affect the opportunities, challenges and risks of
    the Company’s business of selling electricity. These
    factors include the ability of the Company to maintain a stable
    regulatory environment that continues to allow for the recovery
    of all prudently incurred costs during a time of increasing
    costs. Future earnings in the near term will depend, in part,
    upon growth in energy sales, which is subject to a number of
    factors. These factors include weather, competition, new energy
    contracts with neighboring utilities, energy conservation
    practiced by customers, the price of electricity, the price
    elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic growth in the
    Company’s service area in the aftermath of Hurricane
    Katrina.

Environmental
    Matters

Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other
    environmental regulations could affect earnings if such costs
    cannot be fully recovered in rates on a timely basis.
    Environmental compliance spending over the next several years
    may exceed amounts estimated. Some of the factors driving the
    potential for such an increase are higher commodity costs,
    market demand for labor, and scope additions and clarifications.
    The timing, specific requirements, and estimated costs could
    also change as

environmental regulations are modified. See Note 3 to the
    financial statements under “Environmental Matters” for
    additional information.

New
    Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
    brought a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the
    Northern District of Georgia against certain Southern Company
    subsidiaries, including Alabama Power and Georgia Power,
    alleging violations of the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of
    the Clean Air Act and related state laws at certain coal-fired
    generating facilities. Through subsequent amendments and other
    legal procedures, the EPA filed a separate action in January
    2001 against Alabama Power in the U.S. District Court for
    the Northern District of Alabama after Alabama Power was
    dismissed from the original action. In these lawsuits, the EPA
    alleged that NSR violations occurred at eight coal-fired
    generating facilities operated by Alabama Power and Georgia
    Power (including a facility formerly owned by Savannah
    Electric), including one co-owned by the Company. The civil
    actions requested penalties and injunctive relief, including an
    order requiring the installation of the best available control
    technology at the affected units.

On June 19, 2006, the U.S. District Court for the
    Northern District of Alabama entered a consent decree between
    Alabama Power and the EPA, resolving the alleged NSR violations
    at Plant Miller. The consent decree required Alabama Power to
    pay $100,000 to resolve the government’s claim for a civil
    penalty and to donate $4.9 million of sulfur dioxide
    emission allowances to a nonprofit charitable organization and
    formalized specific emissions reductions to be accomplished by
    Alabama Power, consistent with other Clean Air Act programs that
    require emissions reductions. On August 14, 2006, the
    district court in Alabama granted Alabama Power’s motion
    for summary judgment and entered final judgment in favor of
    Alabama Power on the EPA’s claims related to Plants Barry,
    Gaston, Gorgas, and Greene County. The plaintiffs have appealed
    this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
    Circuit and, on November 14, 2006, the Eleventh Circuit
    granted plaintiffs’ request to stay the appeal, pending the
    U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in a similar NSR case
    filed by the EPA against Duke Energy. The action against Georgia
    Power has been administratively closed since the spring of 2001,
    and none of the parties has sought to reopen the case.

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and
    the EPA regulations and interpretations in effect at the time
    the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act authorizes
    maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $32,500 per day, per
    violation at each generating unit, depending on the date of the
    alleged violation. An adverse outcome in this matter could
    require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be
    determined at this time and could possibly require payment of
    substantial penalties. Such expenditures could affect future
    results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition if
    such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

The EPA has issued a series of proposed and final revisions to
    its NSR regulations under the Clean Air Act, many of which have
    been subject to legal challenges by environmental groups and
    states. On June 24, 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals
    for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld, in part, the
    EPA’s revisions to NSR regulations that were issued in
    December 2002 but vacated portions of those revisions addressing
    the exclusion of certain pollution control projects. The
    Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) formally
    adopted the 2002 NSR rules effective in July 2005, but did not
    adopt the provisions vacated by the District of Columbia
    Circuit. On March 17, 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals
    for the District of Columbia Circuit also vacated an EPA rule
    which sought to clarify the scope of the existing Routine
    Maintenance, Repair and Replacement exclusion. In October 2005
    and September 2006, the EPA also published proposed rules
    clarifying the test for determining when an emissions increase
    subject to the NSR permitting requirements has occurred. The
    impact of these proposed rules will depend on adoption of the
    final rules by the EPA and the State of Mississippi’s
    implementation of such rules, as well as the outcome of any
    additional legal challenges, and, therefore, cannot be
    determined at this time.

Carbon
    Dioxide Litigation

In July 2004, attorneys general from eight states, each outside
    of Southern Company’s service territory, and the
    corporation counsel for New York City filed a complaint in the
    U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
    New York against Southern Company and four other electric
    power companies. A nearly identical complaint was filed by three
    environmental groups in the same court. The complaints allege
    that the companies’ emissions of carbon dioxide, a
    greenhouse gas, contribute to global warming, which the
    plaintiffs assert is a public nuisance. Under common law public
    and private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs seek a judicial
    order (1) holding each defendant jointly and severally
    liable for creating, contributing to,

and/or

maintaining global warming and (2) requiring each of the
    defendants to cap its emissions of carbon dioxide and then
    reduce those emissions by a

specified percentage each year for at least a decade. Plaintiffs
    have not, however, requested that damages be awarded in
    connection with their claims. Southern Company believes these
    claims are without merit and notes that the complaint cites no
    statutory or regulatory basis for the claims. In September 2005,
    the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
    York granted Southern Company’s and the other
    defendants’ motions to dismiss these cases. The plaintiffs
    filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
    Circuit in October 2005. The ultimate outcome of these matters
    cannot be determined at this time.

Environmental
    Statutes and Regulations

General

The Company’s operations are subject to extensive
    regulation by state and federal environmental agencies under a
    variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental
    media, including air, water, and land resources. Applicable
    statutes include the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the
    Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
    Liability Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the
    Toxic Substances Control Act; the Emergency Planning &
    Community

Right-to-Know

Act; and the Endangered Species Act.

Compliance with these environmental requirements involves
    significant capital and operating costs, a major portion of
    which is expected to be recovered through the Company’s
    Environmental Compliance Overview Plan (ECO) Plan. See
    Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail
    Regulatory Matters – Environmental Compliance Overview
    Plan” for additional information. Through 2006, the Company
    had invested approximately $144.0 million in capital
    projects to comply with these requirements, with annual totals
    of $4.8 million, $4.0 million, and $2.9 million
    for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The Company expects that
    capital expenditures to assure compliance with existing and new
    regulations will be an additional $21.0 million,
    $91.1 million, and $81.8 million for 2007, 2008, and
    2009, respectively. Because the Company’s compliance
    strategy is impacted by changes to existing environmental laws
    and regulations, the cost, availability, and existing inventory
    of emission allowances, and the Company’s fuel mix, the
    ultimate outcome cannot be determined at this time.
    Environmental costs that are known and estimable at this time
    are included in capital expenditures discussed under FINANCIAL
    CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – “Capital Requirements
    and Contractual Obligations” herein.

Compliance with possible additional federal or state legislation
    or regulations related to global climate change, air quality, or
    other environmental and health concerns could also significantly
    affect the Company. New environmental legislation or
    regulations, or changes to existing statutes or regulations,
    could affect many areas of the Company’s operations;
    however, the full impact of any such changes cannot be
    determined at this time.

Air
    Quality

Compliance with the Clean Air Act and resulting regulations has
    been and will continue to be a significant focus for the
    Company. Through 2006, the Company had spent approximately
    $77.5 million in reducing sulfur dioxide
    (SO


)
    and nitrogen oxide
    (NO

x

)
    emissions and in monitoring emissions pursuant to the Clean Air
    Act.

In 2005, the EPA revoked the

one-hour

ozone air quality standard and published the second of two sets
    of final rules for implementation of the new, more stringent

eight-hour

ozone standard. During 2005, the EPA’s fine particulate
    matter nonattainment designations also became effective for
    several areas across the United States. No areas within the
    Company’s service area, however, have been designated as
    nonattainment under either the

eight-hour

ozone standard or the fine particulate matter standard.

The EPA issued the final Clean Air Interstate Rule in March
    2005. This

cap-and-trade

rule addresses power plant
    SO


and
    NO

x

emissions that were found to contribute to nonattainment of the

eight-hour

ozone and fine particulate matter standards in downwind states.
    Twenty-eight eastern states, including the State of Mississippi,
    are subject to the requirements of the rule. The rule calls for
    additional reductions of
    NO

x

and/or

SO


to be achieved in two phases, 2009/2010 and 2015. These
    reductions will be accomplished by the installation of
    additional emission controls at the Company’s coal-fired
    facilities or by the purchase of emission allowances from a

cap-and-trade

program.

The Clean Air Visibility Rule (formerly called the Regional Haze
    Rule) was finalized in July 2005. The goal of this rule is to
    restore natural visibility conditions in certain areas
    (primarily national parks and wilderness areas) by 2064. The
    rule involves (1) the application of Best Available
    Retrofit Technology (BART) to certain sources built between 1962
    and 1977 and (2) the application of any additional
    emissions reductions which may be deemed necessary for each
    designated area to achieve reasonable progress toward the
    natural conditions goal by 2018. Thereafter, for each

10-year

planning period, additional emissions reductions will be
    required to continue to demonstrate reasonable progress in each
    area during that period. For power plants, the Clean Air

Visibility Rule allows states to determine that the Clean Air
    Interstate Rule satisfies BART requirements for

x

.
    However, additional BART requirements for particulate matter
    could be imposed, and the reasonable progress provisions could
    result in requirements for additional
    SO


controls. By December 17, 2007, states must submit
    implementation plans that contain strategies for BART and any
    other control measures required to achieve the first phase of
    reasonable progress.

In March 2005, the EPA published the final Clean Air Mercury
    Rule, a

cap-and-trade

program for the reduction of mercury emissions from coal-fired
    power plants. The rule sets caps on mercury emissions to be
    implemented in two phases, 2010 and 2018, and provides for an
    emission allowance trading market. The Company anticipates that
    emission controls installed to achieve compliance with the Clean
    Air Interstate Rule and the

eight-hour

ozone and fine-particulate air quality standards will also
    result in mercury emission reductions. However, the long-term
    capability of emission control equipment to reduce mercury
    emissions is still being evaluated, and the installation of
    additional control technologies may be required.

The impacts of the

eight-hour

ozone and the fine particulate matter nonattainment
    designations, the Clean Air Interstate Rule, the Clean Air
    Visibility Rule, and the Clean Air Mercury Rule on the Company
    will depend on the development and implementation of rules at
    the state level. States implementing the Clean Air Mercury Rule
    and the Clean Air Interstate Rule, in particular, have the
    option not to participate in the national

cap-and-trade

programs and could require reductions greater than those
    mandated by the federal rules. Impacts will also depend on
    resolution of pending legal challenges to these rules.
    Therefore, the full effects of these regulations on the Company
    cannot be determined at this time. The Company has developed and
    continually updates a comprehensive environmental compliance
    strategy to comply with the continuing and new environmental
    requirements discussed above. As part of this strategy, the
    Company plans to install additional
    SO


,
    NO

x

,
    and mercury emission controls within the next several years to
    assure continued compliance with applicable air quality
    requirements.

Water
    Quality

In July 2004, the EPA published its final technology-based
    regulations under the Clean Water Act for the purpose of
    reducing impingement and entrainment of fish, shellfish, and
    other forms of aquatic life at existing power plant cooling
    water intake structures. The rules require baseline biological
    information and, perhaps, installation of fish protection
    technology near some intake structures at existing power plants.
    On January 25, 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
    Second Circuit overturned and remanded several provisions of the
    rule to the EPA for revisions. Among other things, the court
    rejected the EPA’s use of “cost-benefit” analysis
    and suggested some ways to incorporate cost considerations. The
    full impact of these regulations will depend on subsequent legal
    proceedings, further rulemaking by the EPA, the results of
    studies and analyses performed as part of the rules’
    implementation, and the actual requirements established by state
    regulatory agencies and, therefore, cannot now be determined.

One facility within the Southern Company system is retrofitting
    a closed-loop recirculating cooling tower under the Clean Water
    Act to cool water prior to discharge and similar projects are
    being considered at other facilities.

Environmental
    Remediation

The Company must comply with other environmental laws and
    regulations that cover the handling and disposal of waste and
    release of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and
    regulations, the Company could incur substantial costs to clean
    up properties. The Company conducts studies to determine the
    extent of any required cleanup and has recognized in the
    financial statements the costs to clean up known sites. Amounts
    for cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs were not material for
    any year presented. The Company may be liable for some or all
    required cleanup costs for additional sites that may require
    environmental remediation. The Company has received authority
    from the Mississippi PSC to recover approved environmental
    compliance costs through specific retail rate clauses. Within
    limits approved by the Mississippi PSC, these rates are adjusted
    annually. See Note 3 to the financial statements under
    “Environmental Matters – Environmental
    Remediation” and “Retail Regulatory
    Matters – Environmental Compliance Overview Plan”
    for additional information.

Global
    Climate Issues

Domestic efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions have been
    spurred by international negotiations under the Framework
    Convention on Climate Change and specifically the Kyoto
    Protocol, which proposes a binding limitation on the emissions
    of greenhouse gases for industrialized countries. The Bush
    Administration has not supported U.S. ratification of the
    Kyoto Protocol or other mandatory carbon dioxide reduction
    legislation; however, in 2002, it did announce a goal to reduce
    the greenhouse gas intensity of the U.S. economy, the ratio
    of greenhouse

II-254


MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Mississippi Power Company 2006 Annual Report

gas emissions to the value of U.S. economic output, by
    18 percent by 2012. Southern Company is participating in
    the voluntary electric utility sector climate change initiative,
    known as Power Partners, under the Bush Administration’s
    Climate VISION program. The utility sector pledged to reduce its
    greenhouse gas emissions rate by 3 percent to
    5 percent by

2010-2012.

Southern Company continues to evaluate future energy and
    emission profiles relative to the Power Partners program and is
    participating in voluntary programs to support the industry
    initiative. In addition, Southern Company is participating in
    the Bush Administration’s Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean
    Development and Climate, a public/private partnership to work
    together to meet goals for energy security, national air
    pollution reduction, and climate change in ways that promote
    sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction. Legislative
    proposals that would impose mandatory restrictions on carbon
    dioxide emissions continue to be considered in Congress. The
    ultimate outcome cannot be determined at this time; however,
    mandatory restrictions on the Company’s carbon dioxide
    emissions could result in significant additional compliance
    costs that could affect future results of operations, cash
    flows, and financial condition if such costs are not recovered
    through regulated rates.

FERC
    Matters

Market-Based
    Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to
    non-affiliates, including short-term opportunity sales, at
    market-based prices. Specific FERC approval must be obtained
    with respect to a market-based contract with an affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess
    Southern Company’s generation dominance within its retail
    service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in
    other markets is not an issue in that proceeding. Any new
    market-based rate sales by the Company in Southern
    Company’s retail service territory entered into during a

15-month

refund period beginning February 27, 2005 could be subject
    to refund to the level of the default cost-based rates, pending
    the outcome of the proceeding. Such sales through May 27,
    2006, the end of the refund period, were approximately
    $8.4 million for the Company. In the event that the
    FERC’s default mitigation measures for entities that are
    found to have market power are ultimately applied, the Company
    may be required to charge cost-based rates for certain wholesale
    sales in the Southern Company retail service territory, which
    may be lower than negotiated market-based rates. The final
    outcome of this matter will depend on the form in which the
    final methodology for assessing generation market power and
    mitigation rules may be ultimately adopted and cannot be
    determined at this time.

In addition, in May 2005, the FERC started an investigation to
    determine whether Southern Company satisfies the other three
    parts of the FERC’s market-based rate analysis:
    transmission market power, barriers to entry, and affiliate
    abuse or reciprocal dealing. The FERC established a new

15-month

refund period related to this expanded investigation. Any new
    market-based rate sales involving any Southern Company
    subsidiary, including the Company, could be subject to refund to
    the extent the FERC orders lower rates as a result of this new
    investigation. Such sales through October 19, 2006, the end
    of the refund period, were approximately $14.5 million for
    the Company, of which $7.3 million relates to sales inside
    the retail service territory as discussed above. The FERC also
    directed that this expanded proceeding be held in abeyance
    pending the outcome of the proceeding on the IIC discussed
    below. On January 3, 2007, the FERC issued an order noting
    settlement of the IIC proceeding and seeking comment
    identifying any remaining issues and the proper procedure for
    addressing any such issues.

The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for
    these proceedings and is vigorously defending itself in this
    matter. However, the final outcome of this matter, including any
    remedies to be applied in the event of an adverse ruling in
    these proceedings, cannot now be determined.

Intercompany
    Interchange Contract

The Company’s generation fleet is operated under
    the IIC, as approved by the FERC. In May 2005, the FERC
    initiated a new proceeding to examine (1) the provisions of
    the IIC among Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, the
    Company, Savannah Electric, Southern Power, and Southern Company
    Services, Inc. (SCS) as agent, under the terms of which the
    power pool of Southern Company is operated, and, in particular,
    the propriety of the continued inclusion of Southern Power as a
    party to the IIC, (2) whether any parties to
    the IIC have violated the FERC’s standards of conduct
    applicable to utility companies that are transmission providers,
    and (3) whether Southern Company’s code of conduct
    defining Southern Power as a “system company” rather
    than a “marketing affiliate” is just and reasonable.
    In connection with the formation of Southern Power, the FERC
    authorized Southern Power’s inclusion in the IIC in
    2000. The FERC also previously approved Southern Company’s
    code of conduct.

II-255

Mississippi Power Company 2006 Annual Report

On October 5, 2006, the FERC issued an order accepting a
    settlement resolving the proceeding subject to Southern
    Company’s agreement to accept certain modifications to the
    settlement’s terms. On October 20, 2006, Southern
    Company notified the FERC that it accepted the modifications.
    The modifications largely involve functional separation and
    information restrictions related to marketing activities
    conducted on behalf of Southern Power. Southern Company filed
    with the FERC on November 6, 2006 an implementation plan to
    comply with the modifications set forth in the order. The impact
    of the modifications is not expected to have a material impact
    on the Company’s financial statements.

Generation
    Interconnection Agreements

In July 2003, the FERC issued its final rule on the
    standardization of generation interconnection agreements and
    procedures (Order 2003). Order 2003 shifts much of the financial
    burden of new transmission investment from the generator to the
    transmission provider. The FERC has indicated that Order 2003,
    which was effective January 20, 2004, is to be applied
    prospectively to new generating facilities interconnecting to a
    transmission system. Order 2003 was affirmed by the
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
    on January 12, 2007. The cost impact resulting from Order
    2003 will vary on a

case-by-case

basis for each new generator interconnecting to the transmission
    system.

On November 22, 2004, generator company subsidiaries of
    Tenaska, Inc. (Tenaska), as counterparties to three previously
    executed interconnection agreements with subsidiaries of
    Southern Company, filed complaints at the FERC requesting that
    the FERC modify the agreements and that those Southern Company
    subsidiaries refund a total of $19 million previously paid
    for interconnection facilities, with interest. Southern Company
    has also received requests for similar modifications from other
    entities, though no other complaints are pending with the FERC.
    On January 19, 2007, the FERC issued an order granting
    Tenaska’s requested relief. Although the FERC’s order
    requires the modification of Tenaska’s interconnection
    agreements, the order reduces the amount of the refund that had
    been requested by Tenaska. As a result, Southern Company
    estimates indicate that no refund is due to Tenaska. Southern
    Company has requested rehearing of the FERC’s order. The
    final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Transmission

In December 1999, the FERC issued its final rule on Regional
    Transmission Organizations (RTOs). Since that time, there have
    been a number of additional proceedings at the FERC designed to
    encourage further voluntary formation of RTOs or to mandate
    their formation. However, at the current time, there are no
    active proceedings that would require the Company to participate
    in an RTO. Current FERC efforts that may potentially change the
    regulatory

and/or

operational structure of transmission include rules related to
    the standardization of generation interconnection, as well as an
    inquiry into, among other things, market power by vertically
    integrated utilities. See “Market-Based Rate
    Authority” and “Generation Interconnection
    Agreements” above for additional information. The final
    outcome of these proceedings cannot now be determined. However,
    the Company’s financial condition, results of operations,
    and cash flows could be adversely affected by future changes in
    the federal regulatory or operational structure of transmission.

PSC
    Matters

Performance
    Evaluation Plan

See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail
    Regulatory Matters – Performance Evaluation Plan”
    for information on the Company’s base rates. In May 2004,
    the Mississippi PSC approved the Company’s request to
    reclassify 266 megawatts of Plant Daniel Units 3 and 4 capacity
    to jurisdictional cost of service effective January 1,
    2004, and authorized the Company to include the related costs
    and revenue credits in jurisdictional rate base, cost of
    service, and revenue requirement calculations for purposes of
    retail rate recovery. The Company is amortizing the regulatory
    liability established pursuant to the Mississippi PSC’s
    order to earnings as follows: $16.5 million in 2004,
    $25.1 million in 2005, $13.0 million in 2006, and
    $5.7 million in 2007, resulting in reductions of costs in
    each of those years.

In December 2006, the Company submitted its annual PEP filing
    for 2007, which resulted in no rate change. Pursuant to the PEP
    rate schedule, an order is not required from the Mississippi PSC
    for the Company to continue to bill the filed rate in effect. In
    March 2006, the Mississippi PSC approved the Company’s 2006
    PEP filing, which included an annual retail base rate increase
    of 5 percent, or $32 million, that was effective in
    April 2006. Ordinarily, PEP limits annual rate increases to
    4 percent; however, the Company had requested that the
    Mississippi PSC approve a temporary change to allow it to exceed
    this cap as a result of the ongoing effects of Hurricane Katrina.

    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Mississippi Power Company 2006 Annual Report

System
    Restoration Rider

In September 2006, the Company filed with the Mississippi PSC a
    request to implement a System Restoration Rider (SRR) to
    increase the Company’s cap on the property damage reserve
    and to authorize the calculation of an annual property damage
    accrual based on a formula. The purpose of the SRR is to provide
    for recovery of costs associated with property damage (property
    insurance and the costs of self insurance) and to facilitate the
    Mississippi PSC’s review of these costs. The Company would
    be required to make annual SRR filings to determine the revenue
    requirement associated with any property damage. The Company
    recorded a regulatory liability in the amount of approximately
    $2.4 million in 2006 for the estimated amount due to retail
    customers that would be passed through SRR. In February 2007, the
Company received an order from the Mississippi PSC approving the SRR.

Environmental
    Compliance Overview Plan

In February 2007, the Company filed with the Mississippi PSC its
    annual Environmental Compliance Overview (ECO) Plan evaluation
    for 2007. The Company requested an 86 cent per 1,000 KWH
    increase for retail customers. This increase represents
    approximately $7.5 million in annual revenues for the
    Company. Hearings with the Mississippi PSC are expected to be
    held in April 2007. In April 2006 the Mississippi PSC approved
    the Company’s 2006 ECO Plan, which included a 12 cent per
    1,000 KWH reduction for retail customers. This decrease
    represented a reduction of approximately $1.3 million in
    annual revenues for the Company. The new rates were effective in
    April 2006. See Note 3 to the financial statements under
    “Retail Regulatory Matters – Environmental
    Compliance Overview Plan” for additional information. The
    outcome of the 2007 filing cannot now be determined.

Fuel
    Cost Recovery

The Company establishes annually a fuel cost recovery factor
    that is approved by the Mississippi PSC. Over the past two
    years, the Company has continued to experience higher than
    expected fuel costs for coal and natural gas. The Company is
    required to file for an adjustment to the fuel cost recovery
    factor annually; such filing occurred in November 2006. As a
    result, the Mississippi PSC approved an increase in the fuel
    cost recovery factor effective January 2007 in an amount equal
    to 4.6 percent of total retail revenues. The Company’s
    operating revenues are adjusted for differences in actual
    recoverable fuel cost and amounts billed in accordance with the
    currently approved cost recovery rate. Accordingly, this
    increase to the billing factor will have no significant effect
    on the Company’s revenues or net income, but will increase
    annual cash flow.

Storm
    Damage Cost Recovery

In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast of
    Mississippi and caused significant damage within the
    Company’s service area. The Company maintains a reserve for
    property damage to cover the cost of damage from major storms to
    its transmission and distribution lines and the cost of
    uninsured damage to its generation facilities and other
    property. A 1999 Mississippi PSC order allowed the Company to
    accrue $1.5 million to $4.6 million to the reserve
    annually, with a maximum reserve totaling $23 million. In
    October 2006, in conjunction with the Hurricane Katrina-related
    financing order, the Mississippi PSC ordered the Company to
    cease all accruals to the retail property damage reserve until a
    new reserve cap is established. However, in the same financing
    order, the Mississippi PSC approved the replenishment of the
    property damage reserve with $60 million to be funded with
    a portion of the proceeds of bonds to be issued by the
    Mississippi Development Bank on behalf of the State of
    Mississippi and reported as liabilities by the State of
    Mississippi.

In June 2006, the Mississippi PSC issued an order based upon a
    stipulation between the Company and the Mississippi Public
    Utilities Staff. The stipulation and the associated order
    certified actual storm restoration costs relating to Hurricane
    Katrina through April 30, 2006, of $267.9 million and
    affirmed estimated additional costs through December 31,
    2007, of $34.5 million, for total storm restoration costs
    of $302.4 million, which was net of expected insurance
    proceeds of approximately $77 million, without offset for
    the property damage reserve of $3.0 million. Of the total
    amount, $292.8 million applies to the Company’s retail
    jurisdiction. The order directed the Company to file an
    application with the MDA for a CDBG.

The Company filed the CDBG application with the MDA in September
    2006. On October 30, 2006, the Company received from the
    MDA a CDBG in the amount of $276.4 million. The Company has
    appropriately allocated and applied these CDBG proceeds to both
    retail and wholesale storm restoration cost recovery. The retail
    portion of $267.6 million was applied to the retail
    regulatory asset in the balance sheets. For the remaining

II-257


MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

(continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2006 Annual Report

wholesale portion of $8.8 million, $3.3 million was
    credited to operations and maintenance expense in the statements
    of income and $5.5 million was applied to accumulated
    provision for depreciation in the balance sheets. The CDBG
    proceeds related to capital of $152.7 million and
    $120.3 million related to retail operations and maintenance
    expense are included in the statements of cash flows as separate
    line items. The cash portions of storm costs are included in the
    statements of cash flows under Hurricane Katrina accounts
    payable, property additions, and cost of removal, net of salvage
    and totaled approximately $50.5 million,
    $54.2 million, and $4.6 million, respectively, for
    2006 and totaled approximately $82.1 million,
    $81.7 million, and $18.4 million, respectively, for
    2005.

The balance in the retail regulatory asset account at
    December 31, 2006, was $4.7 million, which is net of
    the retail portion of insurance proceeds of $80.9 million,
    CDBG proceeds of $267.6 million, and tax credits of
    $0.3 million. Retail costs incurred through
    December 31, 2006 include approximately $148.1 million
    of capital and $124.5 million of operations and maintenance
    expenditures. Of the $302.4 million total storm costs
    affirmed by the Mississippi PSC, the Company has incurred total
    storm costs of $280.5 million as of December 31, 2006.

The Company filed an application for a financing order with the
    Mississippi PSC on July 3, 2006 for system restoration
    costs under the state bond program. On October 27, 2006,
    the Mississippi PSC issued a financing order that authorizes the
    issuance of $121.2 million of system restoration bonds.
    This amount includes $25.2 million for the retail storm
    recovery costs not covered by the CDBG, $60 million for a
    property damage reserve, and $36 million for the retail
    portion of the construction of the storm operations facility.
    The bonds will be issued by the Mississippi Development Bank on
    behalf of the State of Mississippi and will be reported as
    liabilities by the State of Mississippi. Periodic

true-up

mechanisms will be structured to comply with terms and
    requirements of the legislation. Details regarding the issuance
    of the bonds have not been finalized. The final outcome of this
    matter cannot now be determined.

The Mississippi PSC order also granted continuing authority to
    record a regulatory asset in an amount equal to the retail
    portion of the recorded Hurricane Katrina restoration costs. For
    any future event causing damage to property beyond the balance
    in the reserve, the order also granted the Company the authority
    to record a regulatory asset. The Company would then apply to
    the Mississippi PSC for recovery of such amounts or for
    authority to otherwise dispose of the regulatory asset. The
    Company continues to report actual storm expenses to the
    Mississippi PSC periodically.

See Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements under
    “Provision for Property Damage” and “Retail
    Regulatory Matters – Storm Damage Cost Recovery,”
    respectively, for additional information.

Other
    Matters

In June 2006, the Company filed an application with the
    U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for certain tax credits
    available to projects using clean coal technologies under the
    Energy Policy Act of 2005. The proposed project is an advanced
    coal gasification facility located in Kemper County, Mississippi
    that would use locally mined lignite coal. The proposed
    693 megawatt plant, excluding the mine cost, is expected to
    require an approximate investment of $1.5 billion and is
    expected to be completed in 2013. The DOE subsequently certified
    the project and in November 2006, the Internal Revenue Service
    (IRS) allocated Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
    (Internal Revenue Code), Section 48A tax credits to the
    Company of $133 million. The utilization of these credits
    is dependent upon meeting the certification requirements for the
    project under the Internal Revenue Code. The plant would use an
    air-blown integrated gasification combined cycle technology that
    generates power from low-rank coals and coals with high moisture
    or high ash content. These coals, which include lignite, make up
    half the proven U.S. and worldwide coal reserves. The Company is
    still undergoing a feasibility assessment of the project which
    could take up to two years. On December 21, 2006, the
    Mississippi PSC approved the Company’s request for
    accounting treatment of the costs associated with the
    Company’s generation resource planning, evaluation, and
    screening activities. The Mississippi PSC gave the Company the
    authority to create and recognize a regulatory asset for such
    costs. The Company estimates that in order to reach the next
    major milestone in the evaluation process, it may spend up to
    $12 million by the third quarter of 2007. These costs will
    be charged to and remain as a regulatory asset until the
    Mississippi PSC determines the prudence and ultimate recovery of
    such costs either in conjunction with a certificate proceeding
    filed by the Company for approval of its next generating asset
    or by June 30, 2008, which ever occurs first. The balance
    of such regulatory asset will be included in the Company’s
    rate base for ratemaking purposes. Approval by various
    regulatory agencies, including the Mississippi PSC, will also be
    required if the project proceeds. The final outcome of this
    matter cannot now be determined.

II-258


MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

(continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2006 Annual Report

The Company is involved in various other matters being litigated
    and regulatory matters that could affect future earnings. See
    Note 3 to the financial statements for information
    regarding material issues.

ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES

Application
    of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
    Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to
    the financial statements. In the application of these policies,
    certain estimates are made that may have a material impact on
    the Company’s results of operations and related
    disclosures. Different assumptions and measurements could
    produce estimates that are significantly different from those
    recorded in the financial statements. Senior management has
    reviewed and discussed critical accounting policies and
    estimates described below with the Audit Committee of Southern
    Company’s Board of Directors.

Electric
    Utility Regulation

The Company is subject to retail regulation by the Mississippi
    PSC and wholesale regulation by the FERC. These regulatory
    agencies set the rates the Company is permitted to charge
    customers based on allowable costs. As a result, the Company
    applies Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement
    No. 71, “Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types
    of Regulation” (SFAS No. 71), which requires the
    financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation.
    Through the ratemaking process, the regulators may require the
    inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when
    they would be recognized by a non-regulated company. This
    treatment may result in the deferral of expenses and the
    recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated
    future recovery through rates or the deferral of gains or
    creation of liabilities and the recording of related regulatory
    liabilities. The application of SFAS No. 71 has a
    further effect on the Company’s financial statements as a
    result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the
    ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from those
    actually incurred by the Company; therefore, the accounting
    estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation and
    pension and postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact
    on the Company’s results of operations than they would on a
    non-regulated company.

As reflected in Note 1 to the financial statements,
    significant regulatory assets and liabilities have been
    recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of
    these regulatory assets and liabilities based on applicable
    regulatory guidelines and accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States. However, adverse legislative,
    judicial, or regulatory actions could materially impact the
    amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could
    adversely impact the Company’s financial statements.

Contingent
    Obligations

The Company is subject to a number of federal and state laws and
    regulations, as well as other factors and conditions that
    potentially subject it to environmental, litigation, income tax,
    and other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and
    Note 3 to the financial statements for more information
    regarding certain of these contingencies. The Company
    periodically evaluates its exposure to such risks and records
    reserves for those matters where a loss is considered probable
    and reasonably estimable in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles. The adequacy of reserves can be
    significantly affected by external events or conditions that can
    be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters
    could materially affect the Company’s financial statements.
    These events or conditions include the following:

•

Changes in existing state or federal regulation by governmental
    authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality,
    control of toxic substances, hazardous and solid wastes, and
    other environmental matters.

•

Changes in existing income tax regulations or changes in IRS or
    state revenue department interpretations of existing regulations.

•

Identification of additional sites that require environmental
    remediation or the filing of other complaints in which the
    Company may be asserted to be a potentially responsible party.

•

Identification and evaluation of other potential lawsuits or
    complaints in which the Company may be named as a defendant.

•

Resolution or progression of existing matters through the
    legislative process, the court systems, the IRS, or the EPA.

Unbilled
    Revenues

Revenues related to the sale of electricity are recorded when
    electricity is delivered to customers. However, the
    determination of KWH sales to individual customers is based on
    the reading of their meters, which is performed

II-259


MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

(continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2006 Annual Report

on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each
    month, amounts of electricity delivered to customers, but not
    yet metered and billed, are estimated. Components of the
    unbilled revenue estimates include total KWH territorial supply,
    total KWH billed, estimated total electricity lost in delivery,
    and customer usage. These components can fluctuate as a result
    of a number of factors including weather, generation patterns,
    power delivery volume, and other operational constraints. These
    factors can be unpredictable and can vary from historical
    trends. As a result, the overall estimate of unbilled revenues
    could be significantly affected, which could have a material
    impact on the Company’s results of operations.

Plant
    Daniel Operating Lease

As discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements under
    “Operating Leases – Plant Daniel Combined Cycle
    Generating Units,” the Company leases a 1,064 megawatt
    natural gas combined cycle facility at Plant Daniel (Facility)
    from Juniper Capital L.P. (Juniper). For both accounting and
    rate recovery purposes, this transaction is treated as an
    operating lease, which means that the related obligations under
    this agreement are not reflected in the balance sheets. See
    FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – “Off-Balance
    Sheet Financing Arrangements” herein for further
    information. The operating lease determination was based on
    assumptions and estimates related to the following:

•

Fair market value of the Facility at lease inception.

•

The Company’s incremental borrowing rate.

•

Timing of debt payments and the related amortization of the
    initial acquisition cost during the initial lease term.

•

Residual value of the Facility at the end of the lease term.

•

Estimated economic life of the Facility.

•

Juniper’s status as a voting interest entity.

The determination of operating lease treatment was made at the
    inception of the lease agreement and is not subject to change
    unless subsequent changes are made to the agreement. However the
    Company also is required to monitor Juniper’s ongoing
    status as a voting interest entity. Changes in that status could
    require the Company to consolidate the Facility’s assets
    and the related debt and to record interest and depreciation
    expense of approximately $37 million annually, rather than
    annual lease expense of approximately $27 million.

New
    Accounting Standards

Stock
    Options

On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted FASB Statement
    No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” using the
    modified prospective method. This statement requires that
    compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions
    be recognized in financial statements. That cost is measured
    based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability
    instruments issued. Although the compensation expense required
    under the revised statement differs slightly, the impacts on the
    Company’s financial statements are similar to the pro forma
    disclosures included in Note 1 to the financial statements
    under “Stock Options.”

Pensions
    and Other Postretirement Plans

On December 31, 2006, the Company adopted FASB Statement
    No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined
    Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans”
    (SFAS No. 158), which requires recognition of the
    funded status of its defined benefit postretirement plans in its
    balance sheet. With the adoption of SFAS No. 158, the
    Company recorded an additional prepaid pension asset of
    $21.3 million with respect to its overfunded defined
    benefit plan and additional liabilities of $1.5 million and
    $29.1 million, respectively, related to its underfunded
    non-qualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit
    plans. Additionally, SFAS No. 158 will require the
    Company to change the measurement date for its defined benefit
    postretirement plan assets and obligations from
    September 30 to December 31 beginning with the year
    ending December 31, 2008. See Note 2 to the financial
    statements for additional information.

Guidance
    on Considering the Materiality of Misstatements

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
    issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,
    “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when
    Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
    Statements” (SAB 108). SAB 108 addresses how the
    effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be
    considered when quantifying misstatements in current year
    financial statements. SAB 108 requires companies to
    quantify misstatements using both a balance sheet and an income
    statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach
    results in quantifying an error that is material in light of
    relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. When the effect
    of initial adoption is material, companies will record the
    effect as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of

II-260


MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

(continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2006 Annual Report

year retained earnings. The provisions of SAB 108 were
    effective for the Company for the year ended December 31,
    2006. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material
    impact on the Company’s financial statements.

Income
    Taxes

In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”
    (FIN 48). This interpretation requires that tax benefits
    must be “more likely than not” of being sustained in
    order to be recognized. The Company adopted FIN 48
    effective January 1, 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 did
    not have a material impact on the Company’s financial
    statements.

Fair
    Value Measurement

The FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157, “Fair Value
    Measurements” (SFAS No. 157), in September 2006.
    SFAS No. 157 provides guidance on how to measure fair
    value where it is permitted or required under other accounting
    pronouncements. SFAS No. 157 also requires additional
    disclosures about fair value measurements. The Company plans to
    adopt SFAS No. 157 on January 1, 2008 and is currently
    assessing its impact.

Fair
    Value Option

In February 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 159,
    “Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115” (SFAS No. 159). This standard
    permits an entity to choose to measure many financial
    instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company
    plans to adopt SFAS No. 159 on January 1, 2008
    and is currently assessing its impact.

FINANCIAL
    CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

The Company’s financial condition remained stable at
    December 31, 2006. Net cash flow from operations increased
    from 2005 by $153.0 million. The increase was primarily due
    to the proceeds received from the CDBG program. The
    $77.4 million decrease in 2005 compared to 2004 resulted
    primarily from the storm damage costs related to Hurricane
    Katrina. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “PSC
    Matters – Storm Damage Cost Recovery” for
    additional information.

Significant changes in the balance sheet as of December 31,
    2006, compared to 2005, primarily relate to Hurricane Katrina
    storm restoration activities. These storm-related changes
    include a reduction in the retail regulatory asset primarily as
    a result of the CDBG proceeds of $267.6 million, the decrease in
    insurance receivable primarily as a result of the receipt of
    external insurance proceeds of $58 million, a reduction to
    affiliated payables in the amount of $98.3 million
    primarily due to the payment of storm-related charges, and a
    reduction in notes payable in the amount of $151 million.
    Additional changes include a $54.7 million decrease in
    under recovered regulatory clause revenues primarily due to fuel
    cost recovery in 2006. For additional information regarding
    significant changes in the balance sheets, see Note 2 to
    the financial statements under “Retirement Benefits.”
    See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “PSC
    Matters – Storm Damage Cost Recovery” herein and
    Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail
    Regulatory Matters – Storm Damage Recovery” for
    additional information related to the deferral of the
    restoration costs, including both capital and operation and
    maintenance expenditures.

The Company’s ratio of common equity to total
    capitalization, excluding long-term debt due within one year,
    increased from 64.3 percent in 2005 to 65.4 percent at
    December 31, 2006. The Company has received investment
    grade ratings from the major rating agencies with respect to
    debt, preferred securities, and preferred stock.

Sources
    of Capital

The Company plans to obtain the funds required for construction,
    continued storm damage restoration, and other purposes from
    sources similar to those used in the past, which were primarily
    from operating cash flows, security issuances, term loans, and
    short-term borrowings. See Note 3 to the financial
    statements under “Storm Damage Cost Recovery” for
    additional information. The amount, type, and timing of any
    financings, if needed, will depend upon regulatory approval,
    prevailing market conditions, and other factors.

The issuance of securities by the Company is subject to
    regulatory approval by the FERC. Additionally, with respect to
    the public offering of securities, the Company files
    registration statements with the SEC under the Securities Act of
    1933, as amended (1933 Act). The amount of securities
    authorized by the FERC, as well as the amounts registered under
    the 1933 Act, are continuously monitored and appropriate
    filings are made to ensure flexibility in the capital markets.

The Company obtains financing separately without credit support
    from any affiliate. The Southern Company system does not
    maintain a centralized cash or money

II-261

    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

pool. Therefore, funds of the Company are not commingled with
    funds of any other company.

To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the Company has
    various sources of liquidity. At December 31, 2006, the
    Company had approximately $4.2 million of cash and cash
    equivalents and $181 million of unused credit arrangements
    with banks. See Note 6 to the financial statements under
    “Bank Credit Arrangements” for additional information.

The Company may also meet short-term cash needs through a
    Southern Company subsidiary organized to issue and sell
    commercial paper and extendible commercial notes at the request
    and for the benefit of the Company and the other traditional
    operating companies. Proceeds from such issuances for the
    benefit of the Company are loaned directly to the Company and
    are not commingled with proceeds from such issuances for the
    benefit of any other traditional operating company. The
    obligations of each company under these arrangements are
    several; there is no cross affiliate credit support. At
    December 31, 2006, the Company had $51.4 million
    outstanding in commercial paper.

Financing
    Activities

During 2006, a portion of the CDBG funds was used to repay
    short-term debt incurred to fund storm restoration efforts.

In addition to any financings that may be necessary to meet
    capital requirements and contractual obligations, the Company
    plans to continue, when economically feasible, a program to
    retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with
    lower-cost capital if market conditions permit.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Financing Arrangements

In 2001, the Company began an initial

10-year

term
    of a lease agreement for a combined cycle generating facility
    built at Plant Daniel. In June 2003, the Company entered into a
    restructured lease agreement for the Facility with Juniper, as
    discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements under
    “Operating Leases – Plant Daniel Combined Cycle
    Generating Units.” Juniper has also entered into leases
    with other parties unrelated to the Company. The assets leased
    by the Company comprise less than 50 percent of
    Juniper’s assets. The Company does not consolidate the
    leased assets and related liabilities, and the lease with
    Juniper is considered an operating lease. Accordingly, the lease
    is not reflected in the balance sheets.

The initial lease term ends in 2011, and the lease includes a
    renewal and a purchase option based on the cost of the Facility
    at the inception of the lease, which was approximately
    $370 million. The Company is required to amortize
    approximately four percent of the initial acquisition cost over
    the initial lease term. Eighteen months prior to the end of the
    initial lease, the Company may elect to renew for 10 years.
    If the lease is renewed, the agreement calls for the Company to
    amortize an additional 17 percent of the initial completion
    cost over the renewal period. Upon termination of the lease, at
    the Company’s option, it may either exercise its purchase
    option or the Facility can be sold to a third party.

The lease also provides for a residual value guarantee,
    approximately 73 percent of the acquisition cost, by the
    Company that is due upon termination of the lease in the event
    that the Company does not renew the lease or purchase the
    Facility and that the fair market value is less than the
    unamortized cost of the Facility.

Credit
    Rating Risk

The Company does not have any credit arrangements that would
    require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as
    a result of a credit rating downgrade. However, the Company,
    along with all members of the Southern Company power pool, is
    party to certain derivative agreements that could require
    collateral

and/or

accelerated payment in the event of a credit rating change to
    below investment grade for Alabama Power

and/or

Georgia Power. These agreements are primarily for natural gas
    and power price risk management activities. At December 31,
    2006, the Company’s total exposure to these types of
    agreements was approximately $27.4 million.

Market
    Price Risk

Due to cost-based rate regulation, the Company has limited
    exposure to market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel
    prices, and prices of electricity. To manage the volatility
    attributable to these exposures, the Company nets the exposures
    to take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various
    derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to
    the Company’s policies in areas such as counterparty
    exposure and hedging practices. Company policy is that
    derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and
    mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management
    policies. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques
    that include, but are not limited to, market valuation, value at
    risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis.

The Company does not currently hedge interest rate risk. The
    weighted average interest rate on variable long-

term debt at January 1, 2007 was 4.41 percent. If the
    Company sustained a 100 basis point change in interest
    rates for all unhedged variable rate long-term debt, the change
    would affect annualized interest expense by approximately
    $1.2 million at December 31, 2006. The Company is not
    aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly
    affect such exposures in the near term. See Notes 1 and 6
    to the financial statements under “Financial
    Instruments” for additional information.

To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity
    prices, the Company enters into fixed-price contracts for the
    purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale
    electricity market. At December 31, 2006, exposure from
    these activities was not material to the Company’s
    financial statements.

In addition, at the instruction of the Mississippi PSC, the
    Company has implemented a fuel-hedging program. At
    December 31, 2006, exposure from these activities was not
    material to the Company’s financial statements.

The changes in fair value of energy contracts and year-end
    valuations were as follows:

These contracts are related primarily to fuel hedging programs
    under which unrealized gains and losses from mark to market
    adjustments are recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities.
    Realized gains and losses from these programs are included in
    fuel expense and are recovered through the Company’s energy
    cost management clause.

Gains and losses on forward contracts for the sale of
    electricity that do not represent hedges are recognized in the
    statements of income as incurred. For the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, these amounts were not
    material.

At December 31, 2006, the fair value gains/(losses) of
    energy-related derivative contracts were reflected in the
    financial statements as follows:

Unrealized pre-tax gains and losses from energy-related
    derivative contracts recognized in income were not material for
    any year presented. The Company is exposed to market price risk
    in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the
    energy-related derivative contracts. The Company’s policy
    is to enter into agreements with counterparties that have
    investment grade credit ratings by Moody’s and
    Standard & Poor’s or with counterparties who have
    posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. Therefore,
    the Company does not anticipate market risk exposure from
    nonperformance by the counterparties. See Notes 1 and 6 to
    the financial statements under “Financial Instruments”
    for additional information.

Capital
    Requirements and Contractual Obligations

The construction program of the Company is currently estimated
    to be $146 million for 2007, of which $6 million is
    related to Hurricane Katrina restoration, $258 million for
    2008, and $161 million for 2009. Environmental expenditures
    included in these amounts are $21 million,
    $91 million, and $82 million for 2007, 2008, and 2009,
    respectively. Actual construction costs may vary from this
    estimate because of changes in such factors as: business
    conditions; environmental regulations; FERC rules and
    regulations; load projections; storm impacts; the cost and
    efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; and
    the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that
    costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered.

In addition, as discussed in Note 2 to the financial
    statements, the Company provides postretirement benefits to
    substantially all employees and funds trusts to the extent
    required by the Mississippi PSC and the FERC.

•

internal restructuring or other restructuring options that may
    be pursued;

•

potential business strategies, including acquisitions or
    dispositions of assets or businesses, which cannot be assured to
    be completed or beneficial to the Company;

•

the ability of counterparties of the Company to make payments as
    and when due;

•

the ability to obtain new short- and long-term contracts with
    neighboring utilities;

•

the direct or indirect effect on the Company’s business
    resulting from terrorist incidents and the threat of terrorist
    incidents;

•

interest rate fluctuations and financial market conditions and
    the results of financing efforts, including the Company’s
    credit ratings;

•

the ability of the Company to obtain additional generating
    capacity at competitive prices;

•

catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions,
    floods, hurricanes, pandemic health events such as an avian
    influenza, or other similar occurrences;

•

the direct or indirect effects on the Company’s business
    resulting from incidents similar to the August 2003 power outage
    in the Northeast;

•

the effect of accounting pronouncements issued periodically by
    standard setting bodies; and

•

other factors discussed elsewhere herein and in other reports
    (including the

Form 10-K)

filed by the Company from time to time with the SEC.

The
    Company expressly disclaims any obligation to update any
    forward-looking statements.

NOTES TO
    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Mississippi Power Company
    2006 Annual Report

1.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General

Mississippi Power Company (Company) is a wholly owned subsidiary
    of Southern Company, which is the parent company of four
    traditional operating companies, Southern Power Company
    (Southern Power), Southern Company Services (SCS), Southern
    Communications Services (SouthernLINC Wireless), Southern
    Company Holdings (Southern Holdings), Southern Nuclear Operating
    Company (Southern Nuclear), Southern Telecom, and other direct
    and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional operating companies,
    Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, and the Company,
    provide electric service in four Southeastern states. The
    Company operates as a vertically integrated utility providing
    service to retail customers in southeast Mississippi and to
    wholesale customers in the Southeast. Southern Power constructs,
    acquires, and manages generation assets, and sells electricity
    at market-based rates in the wholesale market. SCS, the system
    service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to
    Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. SouthernLINC
    Wireless provides digital wireless communications services to
    the traditional operating companies and also markets these
    services to the public within the Southeast. Southern Telecom
    provides fiber cable services within the Southeast. Southern
    Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary for
    Southern Company’s investments in synthetic fuels and
    leveraged leases and various other energy related businesses.
    Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to Southern
    Company’s nuclear power plants. On January 4, 2006,
    Southern Company completed the sale of substantially all of the
    assets of Southern Company Gas, its competitive retail natural
    gas marketing subsidiary.

The equity method is used for subsidiaries which are variable
    interest entities and for which the Company is not the primary
    beneficiary. Certain prior years’ data presented in the
    financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the
    current year presentation.

The Company is subject to regulation by the Federal Energy
    Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Mississippi Public Service
    Commission (PSC). The Company follows accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States and complies with the
    accounting policies and practices prescribed by its regulatory
    commissions. The preparation of financial statements in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States requires the use of estimates, and the actual
    results may differ from those estimates.

Affiliate
    Transactions

The Company has an agreement with SCS under which the following
    services are rendered to the Company at direct or allocated
    cost: general and design engineering, purchasing, accounting and
    statistical analysis, finance and treasury, tax, information
    resources, marketing, auditing, insurance and pension
    administration, human resources, systems and procedures, and
    other services with respect to business and operations and power
    pool transactions. Costs for these services amounted to
    $55.2 million, $51.6 million, and $45.3 million
    during 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Cost allocation
    methodologies used by SCS were approved by the Securities and
    Exchange Commission prior to the repeal of the Public Utility
    Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended, and management believes
    they are reasonable. The FERC permits services to be rendered at
    cost by system service companies.

The Company provides incidental services to and receives such
    services from other Southern Company subsidiaries which are
    generally minor in duration and amount. However, with the
    hurricane damage experienced in the last two years, assistance
    for storm restoration has caused an increase in these
    activities. The total amount of storm restoration provided to
    Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Gulf Power in 2004 and 2005
    was $3.3 million and $1.0 million, respectively. These
    activities were billed at cost. The Company received storm
    restoration assistance from other Southern Company subsidiaries
    totaling $1.5 million and $73.5 million in 2006 and
    2005, respectively.

The Company has an agreement with Alabama Power under which the
    Company owns a portion of Greene County Steam Plant. Alabama
    Power operates Greene County Steam Plant, and the Company
    reimburses Alabama Power for its proportionate share of all
    associated expenditures and costs. The Company reimbursed
    Alabama Power for the Company’s proportionate share of
    related expenses which totaled $8.6 million,
    $8.2 million, and $7.2 million in 2006, 2005, and
    2004, respectively. The Company also has an agreement with Gulf
    Power under which Gulf Power owns a portion of Plant Daniel. The
    Company operates Plant Daniel, and Gulf Power reimburses the
    Company for its proportionate share of all associated
    expenditures and costs. Gulf Power reimbursed the Company for
    Gulf Power’s proportionate share of related expenses which
    totaled $19.7 million, $19.5 million, and
    $17.4 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. See
    Notes 4 and 5 for

II-273


NOTES

(continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2006
    Annual Report

additional information on certain deferred tax liabilities
    payable to affiliates.

In 2006, for purposes of filing the consolidated Southern
    Company tax return, the Company treated certain items as tax
    capital gains rather than deferring those gains over the life of
    the related assets. This allowed two Southern Holdings entities
    to utilize certain tax capital losses in the current year rather
    than carry them forward to future years. The Company has
    recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately
    $22.8 million related to these Southern Holdings entities
    in “Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes” on the balance
    sheets.

The traditional operating companies, including the Company, and
    Southern Power may jointly enter into various types of wholesale
    energy, natural gas, and certain other contracts, either
    directly or through SCS, as agent. Each participating company
    may be jointly and severally liable for the obligations incurred
    under these agreements. See Note 7 under “Fuel
    Commitments” for additional information.

Regulatory
    Assets and Liabilities

The Company is subject to the provisions of Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 71, “Accounting
    for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation”
    (SFAS No. 71). Regulatory assets represent probable
    future revenues associated with certain costs that are expected
    to be recovered from customers through the ratemaking process.
    Regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in
    revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be
    credited to customers through the ratemaking process.

Regulatory assets and (liabilities) reflected in the balance
    sheets at December 31 relate to:

II-274


NOTES

(continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2006
    Annual Report

In the event that a portion of the Company’s operations is
    no longer subject to the provisions of SFAS No. 71,
    the Company would be required to write off related regulatory
    assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable
    through regulated rates. In addition, the Company would be
    required to determine if any impairment to other assets,
    including plant, exists and write down the assets, if impaired,
    to their fair values. All regulatory assets and liabilities are
    to be reflected in rates. See Note 3 under “Retail
    Regulatory Matters – Storm Damage Cost Recovery.”

Government
    Grants

The Company received a grant in October 2006 from the
    Mississippi Development Authority (MDA) for $276.4 million,
    primarily for storm damage cost recovery. The grant proceeds do
    not represent a future obligation of the Company. The portion of
    any grants received related to retail storm recovery is applied
    to the retail regulatory asset that is established as
    restoration costs are incurred. The portion related to wholesale
    storm recovery is recorded either as a reduction to operations
    and maintenance expense or as a reduction in accumulated
    depreciation depending on the restoration work performed and the
    appropriate allocations of cost of service.

Revenues

Energy and other revenues are recognized as services are
    rendered. Wholesale capacity revenues from long-term contracts
    are recognized at the lesser of the levelized amount or the
    amount billable under the contract over the respective contract
    period. Unbilled revenues related to retail sales are accrued at
    the end of each fiscal period. The Company’s retail and
    wholesale rates include provisions to adjust billings for
    fluctuations in fuel costs, fuel hedging, the energy component
    of purchased power costs, and certain other costs. Retail rates
    also include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in
    costs for ad valorem taxes and certain qualifying environmental
    costs. Revenues are adjusted for differences between these
    actual costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates.
    Under or over recovered regulatory clause revenues are recorded
    in the balance sheets and are recovered or returned to customers
    through adjustments to the billing factors. The Company is
    required to file with the Mississippi PSC for an adjustment to
    the fuel cost recovery factor annually.

The Company has a diversified base of customers.  For
    years ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005,
    no single customer or industry comprises 10 percent or more
    of revenue. For all periods presented, uncollectible accounts
    averaged less than 1 percent of revenues.

Fuel
    Costs

Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is used. Fuel expense
    generally includes the cost of purchased emission allowances as
    they are used. Fuel costs also included gains

and/or

losses from fuel hedging programs as approved by the Mississippi
    PSC.

Income
    and Other Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred
    income taxes and provides deferred income taxes for all
    significant income tax temporary differences. Investment tax
    credits utilized are deferred and amortized to income over the
    average life of the related property. Taxes that are collected
    from customers on behalf of governmental agencies to be remitted
    to these agencies are presented net on the statements of income.

Property,
    Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost less
    regulatory disallowances and impairments. Original cost
    includes: materials; labor; minor items of property; appropriate
    administrative and general costs; payroll-related costs such as
    taxes, pensions, and other benefits; and the interest
    capitalized

and/or

cost
    of funds used during construction for projects over
    $10 million.

The Company’s property, plant, and equipment consisted of

    Annual Report

railway track maintenance costs, which are charged to fuel stock
    and recovered through the Company’s fuel clause.

Depreciation
    and Amortization

Depreciation of the original cost of plant in service is
    provided primarily by using composite straight-line rates, which
    approximated 3.2 percent in 2006 and 3.4 percent in
    each of 2005 and 2004. Depreciation studies are conducted
    periodically to update the composite rates. In March 2006, the
    Mississippi PSC approved the study filed by the Company in 2005,
    with new rates effective January 1, 2006. The new
    depreciation rates did not result in a material change to annual
    depreciation expense. When property subject to depreciation is
    retired or otherwise disposed of in the normal course of
    business, its cost, together with the cost of removal, less
    salvage, is charged to the accumulated depreciation provision.
    Minor items of property included in the original cost of the
    plant are retired when the related property unit is retired.
    Depreciation expense includes an amount for the expected cost of
    removal of facilities.

In January 2006, the Mississippi PSC issued an accounting order
    directing the Company to exclude from its calculation of
    depreciation expense approximately $1.2 million related to
    capitalized Hurricane Katrina costs since these costs will be
    recovered separately.

In December 2003, the Mississippi PSC issued an interim
    accounting order directing the Company to expense and record a
    regulatory liability of $60.3 million while it considered
    the Company’s request to include 266 megawatts of
    Plant Daniel Units 3 and 4 generating capacity in jurisdictional
    cost of service. In May 2004, the Mississippi PSC approved the
    Company’s request effective January 1, 2004 and
    ordered the Company to amortize the regulatory liability
    previously established to reduce depreciation and amortization
    expenses as follows: $16.5 million in 2004,
    $25.1 million in 2005, $13.0 million in 2006, and
    $5.7 million in 2007.

Asset
    Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of Removal

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted FASB
    Statement No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
    Obligations” (SFAS No. 143), which established
    new accounting and reporting standards for legal obligations
    associated with the ultimate cost of retiring long-lived assets.
    The present value of the ultimate cost of an asset’s future
    retirement is recorded in the period in which the liability is
    incurred. The costs are capitalized as part of the related
    long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset’s useful
    life. In addition, effective December 31, 2005, the Company
    adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 47,
    “Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations”
    (FIN 47), which requires that an asset retirement
    obligation be recorded even though the timing

and/or

method of settlement are conditional on future events. Prior to
    December 2005, the Company did not recognize asset retirement
    obligations for asbestos removal and disposal of polychlorinated
    biphenyls in certain transformers because the timing of their
    retirements was dependent on future events. The Company has
    received accounting guidance from the Mississippi PSC allowing
    the continued accrual of other future retirement costs for
    long-lived assets that the Company does not have a legal
    obligation to retire. Accordingly, the accumulated removal costs
    for these obligations will continue to be reflected in the
    balance sheets as a regulatory liability. Therefore, the Company
    had no cumulative effect to net income resulting from the
    adoption of SFAS No. 143 or FIN 47.

The Company has retirement obligations related to various
    landfill sites and underground storage tanks. In connection with
    the adoption of FIN 47, the Company also recorded
    additional asset retirement obligations (and assets) of
    $9.5 million, primarily related to asbestos. The Company
    also has identified retirement obligations related to certain
    transmission and distribution facilities, co-generation
    facilities, certain wireless communication towers, and certain
    structures authorized by the United States Army Corps of
    Engineers. However, liabilities for the removal of these assets
    have not been recorded because the range of time over which the
    Company may settle these obligations is unknown and cannot be
    reasonably estimated. The Company will continue to recognize in
    the statements of income allowed removal costs in accordance
    with its regulatory treatment. Any differences between costs
    recognized under SFAS No. 143 and FIN 47 and
    those reflected in rates are recognized as either a regulatory
    asset or liability, as ordered by the Mississippi PSC, and are
    reflected in the balance sheets.

Impairment
    of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles

The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination
    of whether an impairment has occurred is based on either a
    specific regulatory disallowance or an estimate of undiscounted
    future cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared with
    the carrying value of the assets. If an impairment has occurred,
    the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by either
    the amount of regulatory disallowance or by estimating the fair
    value of the asset and recording a loss for the amount if the
    carrying value is greater than the fair value. For assets
    identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to
    the estimated fair value less the cost to sell in order to
    determine if an impairment loss is required. Until the assets
    are disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when
    circumstances or events change.

Provision
    for Property Damage

The Company carries insurance for the cost of certain types of
    damage to generation plants and general property. However, the
    Company is self-insured for the cost of storm, fire, and other
    uninsured casualty damage to its property, including
    transmission and distribution facilities. As permitted by the
    Mississippi PSC and the FERC, the Company accrues for the cost
    of such damage through an annual expense accrual credited to a
    regulatory liability account. The cost of repairing actual
    damage resulting from such events that individually exceed
    $50,000 is charged to the reserve. A 1999 Mississippi PSC order
    allowed the Company to accrue $1.5 million to
    $4.6 million to the reserve annually, with a maximum
    reserve totaling $23 million. In October 2006, in
    conjunction with the Mississippi PSC Hurricane Katrina-related
    financing order, the Mississippi PSC ordered the Company to
    cease all accruals to the retail property damage reserve until a
    new reserve cap is established. However, in the same financing
    order, the Mississippi PSC approved the replenishment of the
    property damage reserve with $60 million to be funded with
    a portion of the proceeds of bonds to be issued by the
    Mississippi Development Bank on behalf of the State of
    Mississippi and reported as liabilities by the State of
    Mississippi. The Company accrued $1.2 million in 2006,
    $1.5 million in 2005, and $4.6 million in 2004. The
    Company made no discretionary accruals in 2006 as a result of
    the order. See Note 3 under “Storm Damage Cost
    Recovery” and “System Restoration Rider” for
    additional information regarding the depletion of these reserves
    following Hurricane Katrina and the deferral of additional
    costs, as well as additional rate riders or other cost recovery
    mechanisms which have

and/or

may
    be approved by the Mississippi PSC to replenish these reserves.

Environmental
    Cost Recovery

The Company must comply with other environmental laws and
    regulations that cover the handling and disposal of waste and
    releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and
    regulations, the Company may also incur substantial costs to
    clean up properties. The Company has authority from the
    Mississippi PSC to recover approved environmental compliance
    costs through retail rates. In February 2007, the Company filed
    with the Mississippi PSC its annual Environmental Compliance
    Overview (ECO) Plan evaluation for 2007. The Company requested
    an 86 cent per 1,000

kilowatt-hour

(KWH) increase for retail customers. This increase represents
    approximately $7.5 million in annual revenues for the
    Company. Hearings with the Mississippi PSC are expected to be
    held in April 2007. In April 2006 the Mississippi PSC approved
    the Company’s 2006 ECO Plan, which included a 12 cent per
    1,000 KWH reduction for retail customers. This decrease
    represented a reduction of approximately $1.3 million per
    year in annual revenues for Mississippi Power. The new rates
    were effective in April 2006. The outcome of the 2007 filing
    cannot now be determined.

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash
    investments are considered cash equivalents. Temporary cash
    investments are securities with original maturities of
    90 days or less.

Materials
    and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include the average cost of
    transmission, distribution, and generating plant materials.
    Materials are charged to inventory when

    Annual Report

purchased and then expensed or capitalized to plant, as
    appropriate, when installed or used.

Fuel
    Inventory

Fuel inventory includes the average costs of oil, coal, natural
    gas, and emission allowances. Fuel is charged to inventory when
    purchased and then expensed as used and recovered by the Company
    through fuel cost recovery rates approved by the Mississippi
    PSC. Emission allowances granted by the Environmental Protection
    Agency (EPA) are included in inventory at zero cost.

Stock
    Options

Southern Company provides non-qualified stock options to a large
    segment of the Company’s employees ranging from line
    management to executives. Prior to January 1, 2006, the
    Company accounted for options granted in accordance with
    Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25; thus, no
    compensation expense was recognized because the exercise price
    of all options granted equaled the fair market value on the date
    of the grant.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair
    value recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123(R),
    “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123(R)),
    using the modified prospective method. Under that method,
    compensation cost for the year ended December 31, 2006 is
    recognized as the requisite service is rendered and includes:
    (a) compensation cost for the portion of share-based awards
    granted prior to and that were outstanding as of January 1,
    2006, for which the requisite service had not been rendered,
    based on the grant-date fair value of those awards as calculated
    in accordance with the original provisions of FASB Statement
    No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-based
    Compensation” (SFAS No. 123), and
    (b) compensation cost for all share-based awards granted
    subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair
    value estimated in accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123(R). Results for prior periods have not
    been restated.

The compensation cost and tax benefits related to the grant and
    exercise of Southern Company stock options to the Company’s
    employees are recognized in the Company’s financial
    statements with a corresponding credit to equity, representing a
    capital contribution from Southern Company.

For the Company, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) has
    resulted in a reduction in earnings before income taxes and net
    income of $1.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively,
    for the year ended December 31, 2006. Additionally,
    SFAS No. 123(R) requires the gross excess tax benefit
    from stock option exercises to be reclassified as a financing
    cash flow as opposed to an operating cash flow; the reduction in
    operating cash flows and increase in financing cash flows for
    the year ended December 31, 2006 was $0.7 million.

For the years prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the
    pro forma impact on net income of fair-value accounting for
    options granted is as follows:

Because historical forfeitures have been insignificant and are
    expected to remain insignificant, no forfeitures are assumed in
    the calculation of compensation expense; rather they are
    recognized when they occur.

The estimated fair values of stock options granted in 2006,
    2005, and 2004 were derived using the Black-Scholes stock option
    pricing model. Expected volatility is based on historical
    volatility of Southern Company’s stock over a period equal
    to the expected term. The Company uses historical exercise data
    to estimate the expected term that represents the period of time
    that options granted to employees are expected to be
    outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on the
    U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant
    that covers the expected term of the stock options.

The following table shows the assumptions used in the pricing
    model and the weighted average grant-date fair value of stock
    options granted:

Financial
    Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit
    exposure to fluctuations in the prices of certain fuel purchases
    and electricity purchases and sales. All derivative financial
    instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and
    are measured at fair value.

II-278


NOTES

(continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2006
    Annual Report

Substantially all of the Company’s bulk energy purchases
    and sales contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are
    exempt from fair value accounting requirements and are accounted
    for under the accrual method. Other derivative contracts qualify
    as cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions or are
    recoverable through the Mississippi PSC approved fuel hedging
    program as discussed below. This results in the deferral of
    related gains and losses in other comprehensive income or
    regulatory assets and liabilities, respectively, as appropriate
    until the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness arising
    from cash flow hedges is recognized currently in net income.
    Other derivative contracts are marked to market through current
    period income and are recorded on a net basis in the statements
    of income.

The Mississippi PSC has approved the Company’s request to
    implement an ECM which, among other things, allows the Company
    to utilize financial instruments to hedge its fuel commitments.
    Changes in the fair value of these financial instruments are
    recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities. Amounts paid or
    received as a result of financial settlement of these
    instruments are classified as fuel expense and are included in
    the ECM factor applied to customer billings. The Company’s
    jurisdictional wholesale customers have a similar ECM mechanism,
    which has been approved by the FERC.

The Company is exposed to losses related to financial
    instruments in the event of counterparties’ nonperformance.
    The Company has established controls to determine and monitor
    the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate the
    Company’s exposure to counterparty credit risk.

Other financial instruments for which the carrying amounts did
    not equal the fair values at December 31 were as follows:

The fair values were based on either closing market prices or

Comprehensive
    Income

The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of
    all changes in common stock equity of an enterprise that result
    from transactions and other economic events of the period other
    than transactions with owners. Comprehensive income consists of
    net income, changes in the fair value of qualifying cash flow
    hedges and marketable securities, and changes in the additional
    minimum pension liability, less income taxes and
    reclassifications for amounts included in net income.

Variable
    Interest Entities

The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity must
    consolidate the related assets and liabilities. The Company has
    established a wholly-owned trust to issue preferred securities.
    See Note 6 under “Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred
    Securities/Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trust” for
    additional information. However, the Company is not considered
    the primary beneficiary of the trust. Therefore, the investments
    in this trust are reflected as Other Investments and the related
    loan from the trust is reflected as Long-term Debt Payable to
    Affiliated Trust in the balance sheets.

2.

RETIREMENT
    BENEFITS

The Company has a defined benefit, trusteed pension plan
    covering substantially all employees. The plan is funded in
    accordance with requirements of the Employee Retirement Income
    Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). No contributions to
    the plan are expected for the year ending December 31,
    2007. The Company also provides certain defined benefit pension
    plans for a selected group of management and highly compensated
    employees. Benefits under these non-qualified plans are funded
    on a cash basis. In addition, the Company provides certain
    medical care and life insurance benefits for retired employees
    through other postretirement benefit plans. The Company funds
    related trusts to the extent required by the Mississippi PSC and
    the FERC. For the year ending December 31, 2007,
    postretirement trust contributions are expected to total
    approximately $0.2 million.

On December 31, 2006, the Company adopted FASB Statement
    No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined
    Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans”
    (SFAS No. 158), which requires recognition of the
    funded status of its defined benefit postretirement plans in its
    balance sheet. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 158,
    the Company generally recognized only the difference between the
    benefit expense recognized and employer contributions to the
    plan as either a prepaid asset or as a liability. With respect
    to its underfunded non-qualified pension plan, the Company
    recognized an additional minimum liability representing the
    difference between each plan’s accumulated benefit
    obligation and its assets.

II-279


NOTES

(continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2006
    Annual Report

With the adoption of SFAS No. 158, the Company was
    required to recognize on its balance sheet previously
    unrecognized assets and liabilities related to unrecognized
    prior service cost, unrecognized gains or losses (from changes
    in actuarial assumptions and the difference between actual and
    expected returns on plan assets), and any unrecognized
    transition amounts (resulting from the change from cash-basis
    accounting to accrual accounting). These amounts will continue
    to be amortized as a component of expense over the
    employees’ remaining average service life as
    SFAS No. 158 did not change the recognition of pension
    and other postretirement benefit expense in the statements of
    income. With the adoption of SFAS No. 158, the Company
    recorded an additional prepaid pension asset of
    $21.3 million with respect to its overfunded defined
    benefit plan and additional liabilities of $1.5 million and
    $29.1 million, respectively, related to its underfunded
    non-qualified pension plans and retiree benefit plans.

The incremental effect of applying SFAS No. 158 on
    individual line items in the balance sheet at December 31,
    2006 follows:

Because the recovery of postretirement benefit expense through

    of SFAS No. 71 with respect to the prepaid assets and
    the liabilities.

The measurement date for plan assets and obligations is
    September 30 for each year presented. Pursuant to
    SFAS No. 158, the Company will be required to change
    the measurement date for its defined benefit postretirement
    plans from September 30 to December 31 beginning with
    the year ending December 31, 2008.

    policy covers a diversified mix of assets, including equity and
    fixed income securities, real estate, and private equity.
    Derivative instruments are used primarily as hedging tools but
    may also be used to gain efficient exposure to the various asset
    classes. The Company primarily minimizes the risk of large

Net periodic pension cost (income) is the sum of service cost,
    interest cost, and other costs netted against the expected
    return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets is
    determined by multiplying the expected rate of return on plan
    assets and the market-related value of plan assets. In
    determining the market-related value of plan assets, the Company
    has elected to amortize changes in the market value of all plan
    assets over five years rather than recognize the changes
    immediately. As a result, the accounting value of plan assets
    that is used to calculate the expected return on plan assets
    differs from the current fair value of the plan assets.

Future benefit payments reflect expected future service and are
    estimated based on assumptions used to measure the projected
    benefit obligation for the pension plans. At December 31,
    2006, estimated benefit payments were as follows:

Other postretirement benefits plan assets are managed and
    invested in accordance with all applicable requirements,
    including ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code. The
    Company’s investment policy covers a diversified mix of
    assets, including equity and fixed income securities, real
    estate, and private equity. Derivative instruments are used
    primarily as hedging tools but may also be used to gain
    efficient exposure to the various asset classes. The Company
    primarily minimizes the risk of large losses through
    diversification but also monitors and manages other aspects of
    risk. The actual composition of the Company’s other

Mississippi Power Company 2006
    Annual Report

In the third quarter 2004, the Company prospectively adopted
    FASB Staff Position

106-2,

“Accounting and Disclosure Requirements” (FSP

106-2),

related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and
    Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act). The Medicare Act
    provides a 28 percent prescription drug subsidy for
    Medicare eligible retirees. FSP

106-2

requires recognition of the impacts of the Medicare Act in the
    APBO and future cost of service for postretirement medical plan.
    The effect of the subsidy reduced the Company’s expenses
    for the six months ended December 31, 2004 and for the
    years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006 by approximately
    $0.5 million, $1.2 million, and $2.0 million,
    respectively, and is expected to have a similar impact on future
    expenses.

Future benefit payments, including prescription drug benefits,
    reflect expected future service and are estimated based on
    assumptions used to measure the APBO for the postretirement
    plans. Estimated benefit payments are reduced by drug subsidy
    receipts expected as a result of the Medicare Act as follows:

The weighted average rates assumed in the actuarial calculations
    used to determine both the benefit obligations as of the
    measurement date and the net periodic costs for the pension and
    other postretirement benefit plans for the following year are
    presented below. Net periodic benefit costs for 2004 were
    calculated using a discount rate of 6.00 percent.

The Company determined the long-term rate of return based on

    taking into account the diversification benefits of investing in
    multiple asset classes.

An additional assumption used in measuring the APBO was a
    weighted average medical care cost trend rate of
    9.56 percent for 2007, decreasing gradually to
    5.00 percent through the year 2015, and remaining at that
    level thereafter. An annual increase or decrease in the assumed
    medical care cost trend rate of 1 percent would affect the
    APBO and the service and interest cost components at

    85 percent matching contribution up to 6 percent of an
    employee’s base salary. Prior to November 2006, the Company
    matched employee contributions at a rate of 75 percent up
    to six percent of the employee’s base salary. Total
    matching contributions made to the plan for 2006, 2005, and 2004
    were $3.0 million, $2.9 million, and
    $2.8 million, respectively.

CONTINGENCIES
    AND REGULATORY MATTERS

General
    Litigation Matters

The Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions
    arising in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the
    Company’s business activities are subject to extensive
    governmental regulation related to public health and the
    environment. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of
    various types, including property damage, personal injury, and
    citizen enforcement of environmental requirements such as
    opacity and other air quality standards, has increased generally
    throughout the United States. In particular, personal injury
    claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous
    materials have become more frequent. The ultimate outcome of
    such pending or potential litigation against the Company cannot
    be predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not
    specifically reported herein, management does not anticipate
    that the liabilities, if any, arising from such current
    proceedings would have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s financial statements.

Environmental
    Matters

New
    Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the EPA brought a civil action in the
    U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia
    against certain Southern Company subsidiaries, including Alabama
    Power and Georgia Power alleging that these subsidiaries had
    violated the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air
    Act and related state laws at certain coal-fired generating
    facilities. Through subsequent amendments and other legal
    procedures, the EPA filed a separate action in January 2001
    against Alabama Power in the U.S. District Court for the
    Northern District of Alabama after Alabama Power was dismissed
    from the original action. In these lawsuits, the EPA alleged
    that NSR violations occurred at eight coal-fired generating
    facilities operated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power
    (including a facility formerly owned by Savannah Electric),
    including one co-owned by the Company. The civil actions request
    penalties and injunctive relief, including an order requiring
    the installation of the best available control technology at the
    affected units.

On June 19, 2006, the U.S. District Court for the
    Northern District of Alabama entered a consent decree between
    Alabama Power and the EPA, resolving the alleged NSR violations
    at Plant Miller. The consent decree required Alabama Power to
    pay $100,000 to resolve the government’s claim for a civil
    penalty and to donate $4.9 million of sulfur dioxide
    emission allowances to a nonprofit charitable organization and
    formalized specific emissions reductions to be accomplished by
    Alabama Power, consistent with other Clean Air Act programs that
    require emissions reductions. On August 14, 2006, the
    district court in Alabama granted Alabama Power’s motion
    for summary judgment and entered final judgment in favor of
    Alabama Power on the EPA’s claims related to Plants Barry,
    Gaston, Gorgas, and Greene County. The plaintiffs have appealed
    this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
    Circuit and, on November 14, 2006, the Eleventh Circuit
    granted plaintiffs’ request to stay the appeal, pending the
    U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in a similar NSR case
    filed by the EPA against Duke Energy. The action against Georgia
    Power has been administratively closed since the spring of 2001,
    and none of the parties has sought to reopen the case.

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and
    the EPA regulations and interpretations in effect at the time
    the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act authorizes
    maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $32,500 per day, per
    violation at each generating unit, depending on the date of the
    alleged violation. An adverse outcome in any one of these
    matters could require substantial capital expenditures that
    cannot be determined at this time and could possibly require
    payment of substantial penalties. Such expenditures could affect
    future results of operations, cash flows, and financial
    condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated
    rates.

Environmental
    Remediation

In 2003, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ)
    designated the Company as a potentially responsible party at a
    site in Texas. The site was owned by an electric transformer
    company that handled the Company’s transformers as well as
    those of many other entities. The site owner is now in
    bankruptcy and the State of Texas has entered into an agreement
    with the Company and several other utilities to investigate and
    remediate the site. Amounts expensed during 2004, 2005, and 2006
    related to this work were not material. Hundreds of entities
    have received notices from the TCEQ requesting their
    participation in the anticipated site remediation. The final
    outcome of this matter to the Company will depend upon further
    environmental assessment and the ultimate number of potentially
    responsible parties and cannot now be determined. The
    remediation expenses incurred by the Company are expected to be
    recovered through the ECO Plan.

FERC
    Matters

Market-Based
    Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to
    non-affiliates, including short-term opportunity sales, at
    market-based prices. Specific FERC approval must be obtained
    with respect to a market-based contract with an affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess
    Southern Company’s generation dominance within its retail
    service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in
    other markets is not an issue in that proceeding. Any new
    market-based rate sales by the Company in Southern
    Company’s retail service territory entered into during a

15-month

refund period beginning February 27, 2005 could be subject
    to refund to the level of the default cost-based rates, pending
    the outcome of the proceeding. Such sales through May 27,
    2006, the end of the refund period, were approximately
    $8.4 million for the Company. In the event that the
    FERC’s default mitigation measures for entities that are
    found to have

II-284


NOTES

(continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2006
    Annual Report

market power are ultimately applied, the Company may be required
    to charge cost-based rates for certain wholesale sales in the
    Southern Company retail service territory, which may be lower
    than negotiated market-based rates. The final outcome of this
    matter will depend on the form in which the final methodology
    for assessing generation market power and mitigation rules may
    be ultimately adopted and cannot be determined at this time.

In addition, in May 2005, the FERC started an investigation to
    determine whether Southern Company satisfies the other three
    parts of the FERC’s market-based rate analysis:
    transmission market power, barriers to entry, and affiliate
    abuse or reciprocal dealing. The FERC established a new

15-month

refund period related to this expanded investigation. Any new
    market-based rate sales involving any Southern Company
    subsidiary, including the Company, could be subject to refund to
    the extent the FERC orders lower rates as a result of this new
    investigation. Such sales through October 19, 2006, the end
    of the refund period, were approximately $14.5 million for
    the Company, of which $7.3 million relates to sales inside
    the retail service territory discussed above. The FERC also
    directed that this expanded proceeding be held in abeyance
    pending the outcome of the proceeding on the Intercompany
    Interchange Contract (IIC) discussed below. On
    January 3, 2007, the FERC issued an order noting settlement
    of the IIC proceeding and seeking comment identifying any
    remaining issues and the proper procedure for addressing any
    such issues.

The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for
    these proceedings and is vigorously defending itself in this
    matter. However, the final outcome of this matter, including any
    remedies to be applied in the event of an adverse ruling in
    these proceedings, cannot now be determined.

Intercompany
    Interchange Contract

The Company’s generation fleet is operated under
    the IIC, as approved by the FERC. In May 2005, the FERC
    initiated a new proceeding to examine (1) the provisions of
    the IIC among Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, the
    Company, Savannah Electric, Southern Power, and SCS, as agent,
    under the terms of which the power pool of Southern Company is
    operated and, in particular, the propriety of the continued
    inclusion of Southern Power as a party to the IIC,
    (2) whether any parties to the IIC have violated the
    FERC’s standards of conduct applicable to utility companies
    that are transmission providers, and (3) whether Southern
    Company’s code of conduct defining Southern Power as a
    “system company” rather than a “marketing
    affiliate” is just and reasonable. In connection with the
    formation of Southern Power, the FERC authorized Southern
    Power’s inclusion in the IIC in 2000. The FERC also
    previously approved Southern Company’s code of conduct.

On October 5, 2006, the FERC issued an order accepting a
    settlement resolving the proceeding subject to Southern
    Company’s agreement to accept certain modifications to the
    settlement’s terms. On October 20, 2006, Southern
    Company notified the FERC that it accepted the modifications.
    The modifications largely involve functional separation and
    information restrictions related to marketing activities
    conducted on behalf of Southern Power. Southern Company filed
    with the FERC on November 6, 2006 an implementation plan to
    comply with the modifications set forth in the order. The impact
    of the modifications is not expected to have a material impact
    on the Company’s financial statements.

Generation
    Interconnection Agreements

In July 2003, the FERC issued its final rule on the
    standardization of generation interconnection agreements and
    procedures (Order 2003). Order 2003 shifts much of the financial
    burden of new transmission investment from the generator to the
    transmission provider. The FERC has indicated that Order 2003,
    which was effective January 20, 2004, is to be applied
    prospectively to new generating facilities interconnecting to a
    transmission system. Order 2003 was affirmed by the
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
    on January 12, 2007. The cost impact resulting from Order
    2003 will vary on a

case-by-case

basis for each new generator interconnecting to the transmission
    system.

On November 22, 2004, generator company subsidiaries of
    Tenaska, Inc. (Tenaska), as counterparties to three previously
    executed interconnection agreements with subsidiaries of
    Southern Company, filed complaints at the FERC requesting that
    the FERC modify the agreements and that those Southern Company
    subsidiaries refund a total of $19 million previously paid
    for interconnection facilities, with interest. Southern Company
    has also received requests for similar modifications from other
    entities, though no other complaints are pending with the FERC.
    On January 19, 2007, the FERC issued an order granting
    Tenaska’s requested relief. Although the FERC’s order
    requires the modification of Tenaska’s interconnection
    agreements, the order reduces the amount of the refund that had
    been requested by Tenaska. As a result, Southern Company
    estimates indicate that no refund is due to Tenaska. Southern
    Company has requested rehearing of the FERC’s

II-285

order. The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Right of
    Way Litigation

Southern Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including the
    Company, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, and Southern Telecom, have
    been named as defendants in numerous lawsuits brought by
    landowners since 2001. The plaintiffs’ lawsuits claim that
    defendants may not use, or sublease to third parties, some or
    all of the fiber optic communications lines on the rights of way
    that cross the plaintiffs’ properties and that such actions
    exceed the easements or other property rights held by
    defendants. The plaintiffs assert claims for, among other
    things, trespass and unjust enrichment and seek compensatory and
    punitive damages and injunctive relief. Management of the
    Company believes that it has complied with applicable laws and
    that the plaintiffs’ claims are without merit.

To date, the Company has entered into agreements with plaintiffs
    in approximately 90 percent of the actions pending against
    the Company to clarify the Company’s easement rights in the
    State of Mississippi. These agreements have been approved by the
    Circuit Courts of Harrison County and Jasper County, Mississippi
    (First Judicial Circuit) and dismissals of the related cases are
    in progress. These agreements have not had any material impact
    on the Company’s financial statements.

In addition, in late 2001, certain subsidiaries of Southern
    Company, including Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, the
    Company, Savannah Electric, and Southern Telecom, were named as
    defendants in a lawsuit brought by a telecommunications company
    that uses certain of the defendants’ rights of way. This
    lawsuit alleges, among other things, that the defendants are
    contractually obligated to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless
    the telecommunications company from any liability that may be
    assessed against it in pending and future right of way
    litigation. The Company believes that the plaintiff’s
    claims are without merit. In the fall of 2004, the trial court
    stayed the case until resolution of the underlying landowner
    litigation discussed above. In January 2005, the Georgia Court
    of Appeals dismissed the telecommunications company’s
    appeal of the trial court’s order for lack of jurisdiction.
    An adverse outcome in this matter, combined with an adverse
    outcome against the telecommunications company in one or more of
    the right of way lawsuits, could result in substantial
    judgments; however, the final outcome of these matters cannot
    now be determined.

Retail
    Regulatory Matters

Performance
    Evaluation Plan

The Company’s retail base rates are set under Performance
    Evaluation Plan (PEP), a rate plan approved by the Mississippi
    PSC. PEP was designed with the objective that PEP would reduce
    the impact of rate changes on the customer and provide
    incentives for the Company to keep customer prices low and
    customer satisfaction and reliability high. PEP is a mechanism
    for rate adjustments based on three indicators: price, customer
    satisfaction, and service reliability.

In May 2004, the Mississippi PSC approved the Company’s
    request to modify certain portions of its PEP and to reclassify,
    to jurisdictional cost of service the 266 megawatts of Plant
    Daniel Units 3 and 4 capacity, effective January 1, 2004.
    The Mississippi PSC authorized the Company to include the
    related costs and revenue credits in jurisdictional rate base,
    cost of service, and revenue requirement calculations for
    purposes of retail rate recovery. The Company is amortizing the
    regulatory liability established pursuant to the Mississippi
    PSC’s interim December 2003 accounting order, as approved
    in the May 2004 order, to earnings as follows:
    $16.5 million in 2004, $25.1 million in 2005,
    $13.0 million in 2006, and $5.7 million in 2007,
    resulting in increases to earnings in each of those years.

In addition, the Mississippi PSC also approved the
    Company’s requested changes to PEP, including the use of a
    forward-looking test year, with appropriate oversight; annual,
    rather than semi-annual, filings; and certain changes to the
    performance indicator mechanisms. Rate changes will be limited
    to four percent of retail revenues annually under the revised
    PEP. The Mississippi PSC will review all aspects of PEP in 2007.
    PEP will remain in effect until the Mississippi PSC modifies,
    suspends, or terminates the plan.

In March 2006, the Mississippi PSC approved the Company’s
    2006 PEP filing, which included an annual retail base rate
    increase of 5 percent, or $32 million, to be effective
    in April 2006. Ordinarily, PEP limits annual rate increases to
    4 percent; however, the Company had requested that the
    Mississippi PSC approve a temporary change to allow it to exceed
    this cap as a result of the ongoing effects of Hurricane Katrina.

In December 2006, the Company submitted its annual PEP filing
    for 2007, which resulted in no rate change. Pursuant to the PEP
    rate schedule, an order is not required from the Mississippi PSC
    for the Company to continue to bill the filed rate in effect.

System
    Restoration Rider

In September 2006, the Company filed with the Mississippi PSC a
    request to implement a System Restoration Rider (SRR), to
    increase the Company’s cap on the property damage reserve
    and to authorize the calculation of an annual property damage
    accrual based on a formula. The purpose of the SRR is to provide
    for recovery of costs associated with property damage (property
    insurance and the costs of self insurance) and to facilitate the
    Mississippi PSC’s review of these costs. The Company would
    be required to make annual SRR filings to determine the revenue
    requirement associated with the property damage. The Company
    recorded a regulatory liability in the amount of approximately
    $2.4 million in 2006 for the estimated amount due to retail
    customers that would be passed through SRR. In February 2007, the
Company received an order from the Mississippi PSC approving the SRR.

Environmental
    Compliance Overview Plan

The ECO Plan establishes procedures to facilitate the
    Mississippi PSC’s overview of the Company’s
    environmental strategy and provides for recovery of costs
    (including cost of capital) associated with environmental
    projects approved by the Mississippi PSC. Under the ECO Plan,
    any increase in the annual revenue requirement is limited to two
    percent of retail revenues. However, the ECO Plan also provides
    for carryover of any amount over the two percent limit into the
    next year’s revenue requirement. The Company conducts
    studies, when possible, to determine the extent of any required
    environmental remediation. Should such remediation be determined
    to be probable, reasonable estimates of costs to clean up such
    sites are developed and recognized in the financial statements.
    In accordance with the Mississippi PSC order, the Company
    recovers such costs under the ECO Plan as they are incurred.

In February 2007, the Company filed with the Mississippi PSC its
    annual ECO Plan evaluation for 2007. The Company requested an 86
    cent per 1,000 KWH increase for retail customers. This increase
    represents approximately $7.5 million in annual revenues
    for the Company. Hearings with the Mississippi PSC are expected
    to be held in April 2007. In April 2006 the Mississippi PSC
    approved the Company’s 2006 ECO Plan, which included a 12
    cent per 1,000 KWH reduction for retail customers. This decrease
    represented a reduction of approximately $1.3 million in
    annual revenues for the Company. The new rates were effective in
    April 2006. The outcome of the 2007 filing cannot now be
    determined.

Storm
    Damage Cost Recovery

In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast of the
    United States and caused significant damage within the
    Company’s service area. The Company maintains a reserve to
    cover the cost of damage from major storms to its transmission
    and distribution facilities and the cost of uninsured damage to
    its generation facilities and other property. A 1999 Mississippi
    PSC order allowed the Company to accrue $1.5 million to
    $4.6 million to the reserve annually, with a maximum
    reserve totaling $23 million. In October 2006, in
    conjunction with the Mississippi PSC Hurricane Katrina-related
    financing order, the Mississippi PSC ordered the Company to
    cease all accruals to the retail property damage reserve, until
    a new reserve cap is established. However, in the same financing
    order, the Mississippi PSC approved the replenishment of the
    property damage reserve with $60 million to be funded with
    a portion of the proceeds of bonds to be issued by the
    Mississippi Development Bank on behalf of the State of
    Mississippi and reported as liabilities by the State of
    Mississippi.

In June 2006, the Mississippi PSC issued an order based upon a
    stipulation between the Company and the Mississippi Public
    Utilities Staff. The stipulation and the associated order
    certified actual storm restoration costs relating to Hurricane
    Katrina through April 30, 2006 of $267.9 million and
    affirmed estimated additional costs through December 31,
    2007 of $34.5 million, for total storm restoration costs of
    $302.4 million, which was net of expected insurance proceeds of
    approximately $77 million, without offset for the property
    damage reserve of $3.0 million. Of the total amount,
    $292.8 million applies to the Company’s retail
    jurisdiction. The order directed the Company to file an
    application with the MDA for a Community Development Block Grant
    (CDBG).

The Company filed the CDBG application with the MDA in September
    2006. On October 30, 2006, the Company received from the
    MDA a CDBG in the amount of $276.4 million. The Company has
    appropriately allocated and applied these CDBG proceeds to both
    retail and wholesale storm restoration cost recovery. The retail
    portion of $267.6 million was applied to the retail
    regulatory asset in the balance sheets. For the remaining

wholesale portion of $8.8 million, $3.3 million was
    credited to operations and maintenance expense in the statements
    of income, and $5.5 million was applied to accumulated
    provision for depreciation in the balance sheets. The CDBG
    proceeds related to capital of $152.7 million and
    $120.3 million related to retail operations and maintenance
    expense are included in the statement of cash flows as separate
    line items. The cash portions of storm costs are included in the
    statements of cash flows under Hurricane Katrina accounts
    payable, property additions, and cost of removal, net of salvage
    and totaled approximately $50.5 million,
    $54.2 million, and $4.6 million, respectively, for
    2006 and totaled approximately $82.1 million,
    $81.7 million, and $18.4 million, respectively, for
    2005.

The balance in the retail regulatory asset account at
    December 31, 2006, was $4.7 million, which is net of
    the retail portion of insurance proceeds of $80.9 million,
    CDBG proceeds of $267.6 million, and tax credits of
    $0.3 million. Retail costs incurred through
    December 31, 2006, include approximately
    $148.1 million of capital and $124.5 million of
    operations and maintenance expenditures. Of the
    $302.4 million total storm costs affirmed by the
    Mississippi PSC, the Company has incurred total storm costs of
    $280.5 million as of December 31, 2006.

The Company filed an application for a financing order with the
    Mississippi PSC on July 3, 2006 for system restoration
    costs under the state bond program. On October 27, 2006,
    the Mississippi PSC issued a financing order that authorizes the
    issuance of $121.2 million of system restoration bonds.
    This amount includes $25.2 million for the retail storm
    recovery costs not covered by the CDBG, $60 million for a
    property damage reserve, and $36 million for the retail
    portion of the construction of the storm operations facility.
    The bonds will be issued by the Mississippi Development Bank on
    behalf of the State of Mississippi and will be reported as
    liabilities by the State of Mississippi. Periodic

true-up

mechanisms will be structured to comply with terms and
    requirements of the legislation. Details regarding the issuance
    of the bonds have not been finalized. The final outcome of this
    matter cannot now be determined.

The Mississippi PSC order also granted continuing authority to
    record a regulatory asset in an amount equal to the retail
    portion of the recorded Hurricane Katrina restoration costs. For
    any future event causing damage to property beyond the balance
    in the reserve, the order also granted the Company the authority
    to record a regulatory asset. The Company would then apply to
    the Mississippi PSC for recovery of such amounts or for
    authority to otherwise dispose of the regulatory asset. The
    Company continues to report actual storm expenses to the
    Mississippi PSC periodically.

INCOME
    TAXES

Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return
    and combined income tax returns for the State of Alabama and the
    State of Mississippi. Under a joint consolidated income tax
    allocation agreement, each subsidiary’s current and
    deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis and no
    subsidiary is allocated more expense than would be paid if they
    filed a separate income tax return. In accordance with Internal
    Revenue Service regulations, each company is jointly and
    severally liable for the tax liability.

At December 31, 2006, the tax-related regulatory assets and
    liabilities were $9.9 million and $18.2 million,
    respectively. These assets are attributable to tax benefits
    flowed through to customers in prior years and to taxes
    applicable to capitalized interest. These liabilities are
    attributable to deferred taxes previously recognized at rates
    higher than the current enacted tax law and to unamortized
    investment tax credits.

Mississippi Power Company 2006
    Annual Report

In 2006, for purposes of filing the consolidated Southern
    Company tax return, the Company treated certain items as tax
    capital gains rather than deferring those gains over the life of
    the related assets. This allowed two Southern Holdings entities
    to utilize certain tax capital losses in the current year rather
    than carry them forward to future years. The Company has
    recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately
    $22.8 million related to these Southern Holdings entities
    in “Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes” in the balance
    sheets.

The provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income
    taxes determined by applying the applicable U.S. federal
    statutory rate to earnings before income taxes and preferred

FINANCING

Mandatorily
    Redeemable Preferred

Securities/Long-Term

Debt Payable to Affiliated Trust

The Company has formed a wholly-owned trust subsidiary for the
    purpose of issuing preferred securities. The proceeds of the
    related equity investment and preferred security sale were
    loaned back to the Company through the issuance of junior
    subordinated notes totaling $36 million, which constitute
    substantially all of the assets of the trust and are reflected
    in the balance sheets as Long-term Debt Payable to Affiliated
    Trust (including Securities Due Within One Year). The Company
    considers that the mechanisms and obligations relating to the
    preferred securities issued for its benefit, taken together,
    constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by it of the
    trust’s payment obligations with respect to these
    securities. At December 31, 2006, preferred securities of
    $35 million were outstanding. See Note 1 under
    “Variable Interest Entities” for additional
    information on the accounting treatment for the trust and the
    related securities.

Pollution
    Control Bonds

Pollution control obligations represent loans to the Company
    from public authorities of funds derived from sales by such
    authorities of revenue bonds issued to finance pollution control
    facilities. The Company is required to make payments sufficient
    for authorities to meet principal and interest requirements of
    such bonds. The amount of tax-exempt pollution control revenue
    bonds outstanding at December 31, 2006, was
    $82.7 million.

Outstanding
    Classes of Capital Stock

The Company currently has preferred stock, depositary preferred
    stock (each share of depositary preferred stock representing
    one-fourth of a share of preferred stock), and common stock
    outstanding. The Company’s preferred stock and depositary
    preferred stock, without preference between classes, rank senior
    to the Company’s common stock with respect to payment of
    dividends and voluntary or involuntary dissolution. Certain
    series of the preferred stock and depositary preferred stock are
    subject to redemption at the option of the Company on or after a
    specified date.

Bank
    Credit Arrangements

At the beginning of 2007, the Company had total unused committed
    credit agreements with banks of $181 million. Of the total,
    $101 million expires in 2007 and $80 million in 2008.
    The facilities contain $39 million

2-year

term
    loan options and $15 million

1-year

term
    loan options. The Company expects to renew its credit
    facilities, as needed, prior to expiration.

In connection with these credit arrangements, the Company agrees
    to pay commitment fees based on the unused portions of the
    commitments or to maintain compensating balances with the banks.
    Commitment fees are


/


of 1 percent or less for the Company. Compensating balances
    are not legally restricted from withdrawal.

This $181 million in unused credit arrangements provides
    required liquidity support to the Company’s borrowings
    through a commercial paper program. At December 31, 2006,
    the Company had $51.4 million outstanding in commercial
    notes. The credit arrangements also provide support to the
    Company’s variable daily rate tax-exempt pollution control
    bonds totaling $40.1 million.

During 2006, the peak amount outstanding for short-term debt was
    $372.3 million and the average amount outstanding was
    $256.8 million. The average annual

    Annual Report

interest rate on short-term debt was 5.19 percent for 2006
    and 3.85 percent for 2005.

Financial
    Instruments

The Company also enters into energy-related derivatives to hedge
    exposures to electricity, gas, and other fuel price changes.
    However, due to cost-based rate regulations, the Company has
    limited exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices
    and prices of electricity. The Company has implemented
    fuel-hedging programs with the approval of the Mississippi PSC.
    The Company enters into hedges of forward electricity sales.
    There was no material ineffectiveness recorded in earnings in
    2006, 2005, or 2004.

At December 31, 2006, the fair value gains/(losses) of
    energy-related derivative contracts were reflected in the
    financial statements as follows:

The fair value gains or losses for cash flow hedges are recorded
    as regulatory assets and liabilities if they are recoverable
    through the regulatory clauses, otherwise they are recorded in
    other comprehensive income, and are recognized in earnings at
    the same time the hedged items affect earnings. For the year
    2007, approximately $1.0 million of pre-tax gains are
    expected to be reclassified from other comprehensive income to
    fuel expense. The Company has energy-related hedges in place up
    to and including 2009.

COMMITMENTS

Construction
    Program

The Company is engaged in continuous construction programs,
    currently estimated to total $146 million in 2007, of which
    $6 million is related to Hurricane Katrina restoration,
    $258 million in 2008, and $161 million in 2009. The
    construction program is subject to periodic review and revision,
    and actual construction costs may vary from the above estimates
    because of numerous factors. These factors include changes in
    business conditions; acquisition of additional generation
    assets; revised load growth estimates; changes in environmental
    regulations; changes in FERC rules and regulations; increasing
    costs of labor, equipment, and materials; and cost of capital.
    At December 31, 2006, significant purchase commitments were
    outstanding in connection with the construction program. The
    Company has no generating plants under construction. Capital
    improvements to generating, transmission, and distribution
    facilities, including those to meet environmental standards,
    will continue.

Long-Term
    Service Agreements

The Company has entered into a Long-Term Service Agreement
    (LTSA) with General Electric (GE) for the purpose of securing
    maintenance support for the leased combined cycle units at Plant
    Daniel. The LTSA provides that GE will perform all planned
    inspections on the covered equipment, which includes the cost of
    all labor and materials. GE is also obligated to cover the costs
    of unplanned maintenance on the covered equipment subject to a
    limit specified in the contract.

In general, the LTSA is in effect through two major inspection
    cycles of the units. Scheduled payments to GE are made monthly
    based on estimated operating hours of the units and are
    recognized as expense based on actual hours of operation. The
    Company has recognized $8.4 million, $7.9 million, and
    $9.0 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, which
    is included in maintenance expense in the statements of income.
    Remaining payments to GE under this agreement are currently
    estimated to total $154 million over the next
    13 years. However, the LTSA contains various cancellation
    provisions at the option of the Company.

The Company also has entered into a LTSA with ABB Power
    Generation Inc. (ABB) for the purpose of securing maintenance
    support for its Chevron Unit 5 combustion turbine plant. In
    summary, the LTSA stipulates that ABB will perform all planned
    maintenance on the covered equipment, which includes the cost of
    all labor and materials. ABB is also obligated to cover the
    costs of unplanned maintenance on the covered equipment subject
    to a limit specified in the contract.

In general, this LTSA is in effect through two major inspection
    cycles. Scheduled payments to ABB are made at various intervals
    based on actual operating hours of the unit. Payments to ABB
    under this agreement are currently estimated to total
    $0.6 million over the remaining term of the agreement,
    which is approximately three months. However, the LTSA contains
    various cancellation provisions at the option of the Company.
    Payments made to ABB prior to the performance of any planned
    maintenance are recorded as a prepayment in the balance

    based on the nature of the work performed. After this contract
    expires, the Company expects to replace it with a new contract
    with similar terms.

Fuel
    Commitments

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of the generating
    plants, the Company has entered into various long-term
    commitments for the procurement of fuel. In most cases, these
    contracts contain provisions for price escalations, minimum
    purchase levels, and other financial commitments. Coal
    commitments include forward contract purchases for sulfur
    dioxide emission allowances. Natural gas purchase commitments
    contain fixed volumes with prices based on various indices at
    the time of delivery. Amounts included in the chart below
    represent estimates based on New York Mercantile Exchange future
    prices at December 31, 2006.

SCS may enter into various types of wholesale energy and natural
    gas contracts acting as an agent for the Company and the other
    traditional operating companies and Southern Power. Under these
    agreements, each of the traditional operating companies and
    Southern Power may be jointly and severally liable. The
    creditworthiness of Southern Power is currently inferior to the
    creditworthiness of the traditional operating companies.
    Accordingly, Southern Company has entered into keep-well
    agreements with the Company and each of the other traditional
    operating companies to ensure the Company will not subsidize or
    be responsible for any costs, losses, liabilities, or damages
    resulting from the inclusion of Southern Power as a contracting
    party under these agreements.

Operating
    Leases

Railcar
    Leases

The Company and Gulf Power have jointly entered into operating
    lease agreements for the use of 745 aluminum railcars. The
    Company has the option to purchase the railcars at the greater
    of lease termination value or fair market value, or to renew the
    leases at the end of the lease term. The Company also has
    multiple operating lease agreements for the use of an additional
    120 aluminum railcars that do not contain a purchase
    option. All of these leases are for the transport of coal to
    Plant Daniel.

The Company’s share (50 percent) of the leases,
    charged to fuel stock and recovered through the fuel cost
    recovery clause, was $4.6 million in 2006,
    $3.0 million in 2005, and $1.9 million in 2004. The
    Company’s annual lease payments for 2007 through 2011 will
    average approximately $2.4 million and after 2012, lease
    payments total in aggregate approximately $3.6 million.

In addition to railcar leases, the Company has other operating
    leases for fuel handling equipment at Plants Daniel and Watson
    and operating leases for barges and tow/shift boats for the
    transport of coal at Plant Watson. The Company’s share
    (50 percent at Plant Daniel and 100 percent at Plant
    Watson) of the leases for fuel handling was charged to fuel
    handling expense in the amount of $0.9 million in 2006 and
    $0.6 million in 2005. The Company’s annual lease
    payments for 2007 through 2011 will average approximately
    $0.5 million. The Company charged to fuel stock and
    recovered through fuel cost recovery the barge transportation
    leases in the amount of $4.9 million in 2006 related to
    barges and

tow/shift

boats. The Company’s annual lease payments for 2007 through
    2009, with regards to these barge transportation leases, will
    average approximately $4.9 million.

Plant
    Daniel Combined Cycle Generating Units

In May 2001, the Company began the initial

10-year

term
    of the lease agreement for a 1,064 megawatt natural gas combined
    cycle generating facility built at Plant Daniel (Facility). The
    Company entered into this transaction during a period when
    retail access was under review by the Mississippi PSC. The lease
    arrangement provided a lower cost alternative to its cost based
    rate regulated customers than a traditional rate base asset. See
    Note 3 under “Retail Regulatory Matters –
    Performance Evaluation Plan” for a description of the
    Company’s formula rate plan.

Mississippi Power Company 2006
    Annual Report

In 2003, the Facility was acquired by Juniper Capital L.P.
    (Juniper), whose partners are unaffiliated with the Company.
    Simultaneously, Juniper entered into a restructured lease
    agreement with the Company. Juniper has also entered into leases
    with other parties unrelated to the Company. The assets leased
    by the Company comprise less than 50 percent of
    Juniper’s assets. The Company is not required to
    consolidate the leased assets and related liabilities, and the
    lease with Juniper is considered an operating lease. The lease
    agreement is treated as an operating lease for accounting
    purposes, as well as for both retail and wholesale rate recovery
    purposes. For income tax purposes, the Company retains tax
    ownership. The initial lease term ends in 2011 and the lease
    includes a purchase and renewal option based on the cost of the
    Facility at the inception of the lease, which was
    $370 million. The Company is required to amortize
    approximately four percent of the initial acquisition cost over
    the initial lease term. Eighteen months prior to the end of the
    initial lease, the Company may elect to renew for 10 years.
    If the lease is renewed, the agreement calls for the Company to
    amortize an additional 17 percent of the initial completion
    cost over the renewal period. Upon termination of the lease, at
    the Company’s option, it may either exercise its purchase
    option or the Facility can be sold to a third party.

The lease provides for a residual value guarantee, approximately
    73 percent of the acquisition cost, by the Company that is
    due upon termination of the lease in the event that the Company
    does not renew the lease or purchase the Facility and that the
    fair market value is less than the unamortized cost of the
    Facility. A liability of approximately $9 million and
    $11 million for the fair market value of this residual
    value guarantee is included in the balance sheets at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Lease expenses
    were $27 million, $27 million, and $25 million in
    2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

The Company estimates that its annual amount of future minimum
    operating lease payments under this arrangement, exclusive of
    any payment related to the residual value guarantee, as of
    December 31, 2006, are as follows:

STOCK
    OPTION PLAN

Southern Company provides non-qualified stock options to a large
    segment of the Company’s employees ranging from line
    management to executives. As of December 31, 2006, there
    were 272 current and former employees of the Company
    participating in the stock option plan. The maximum number of
    shares of Southern Company common stock that may be issued under
    these programs may not exceed 57 million. The prices of
    options granted to date have been at the fair market value of
    the shares on the dates of grant. Options granted to date become
    exercisable pro rata over a maximum period of three years from
    the date of grant. The Company generally recognizes stock option
    expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period which
    equates to the requisite service period; however, for employees
    who are eligible for retirement the total cost is expensed at
    the grant date. Options outstanding will expire no later than
    10 years after the date of grant, unless terminated earlier
    by the Southern Company Board of Directors in accordance with
    the stock option plan. For certain stock option awards a change
    in control will provide accelerated vesting. As part of the
    adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), as discussed in
    Note 1 under “Stock Options,” Southern Company
    has not modified its stock option plan or outstanding stock
    options, nor has it changed the underlying valuation assumptions
    used in valuing the stock options that were used under
    SFAS No. 123.

    future as of December 31, 2006, is not significantly
    different from the number of stock options outstanding at
    December 31, 2006 as stated above.

As of December 31, 2006, the weighted average remaining
    contractual term for the options outstanding and options
    exercisable is 6.1 years and 5.0 years, respectively,
    and the aggregate intrinsic value for the options outstanding
    and options exercisable is $12.2 million and
    $10.3 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2006, there was $0.4 million of
    total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option
    awards not yet vested. That cost is expected to be recognized
    over a weighted-average period of approximately 11 months.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years
    ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 was
    $2.4 million, $4.3 million, and $2.3 million,
    respectively.

The actual tax benefit realized by the Company for the tax
    deductions from stock option exercises totaled
    $0.9 million, $1.7 million, and $0.9 million,
    respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005,
    and 2004.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Southern
    Power Company

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies (the
    “Company”) (a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern
    Company) as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related
    consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, common
    stockholder’s equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2006. These
    financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to
    have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
    control over financial reporting. Our audits included
    consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a
    basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
    circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
    on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An
    audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
    supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
    the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
    our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements
    (pages II-313 to II-326) present fairly, in all material
    respects, the financial position of Southern Power Company and
    Subsidiary Companies at December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the
    results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
    three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

Southern Power Company and
    Subsidiary Companies 2006 Annual Report

OVERVIEW

Business
    Activities

Southern Power Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the
    Company) construct, acquire, own, and manage generation assets
    and sell electricity at market-based prices in the
    Super-Southeast wholesale market. The Company focused on
    executing its regional strategy in 2006 by signing purchased
    power agreements (PPAs) with investor owned utilities and
    electric cooperatives as well as acquiring generation with
    existing PPAs.

In June 2006, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
    membership interests of DeSoto County Generating Company, LLC
    (DeSoto) from a subsidiary of Progress Energy, Inc. DeSoto owns
    a 344 megawatt (MW) nameplate capacity dual-fueled simple cycle
    combustion turbine plant in Arcadia, Florida. The Company has
    PPAs with Florida Power & Light Company (FP&L)
    covering the entire output of the plant.

In September 2006, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
    membership interests of Rowan County Power, LLC (Rowan) from the
    same subsidiary of Progress Energy, Inc. Rowan was merged into
    the Company and the Company now owns a 986 MW nameplate
    capacity dual-fired generating plant near Salisbury, North
    Carolina. The Company currently has PPAs with Duke Power, LLC
    (Duke), North Carolina Municipal Power Agency No. 1
    (NCMPA1), and Energy United Electric Membership Corporation
    (EnergyUnited) covering much of the output of the plant.

In 2006, the Company continued construction on three ongoing
    projects. One project is Franklin Unit 3, a combined cycle
    unit with an expected capacity of 621 MW near Smiths,
    Alabama. This plant is expected to be completed in 2008. The
    second project is Oleander Unit 5, a combustion turbine
    with an expected capacity of 160 MW, in Brevard County,
    Florida, which is expected to be completed in late 2007. The
    third project is an Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle
    (IGCC) project in Orlando, Florida, expected to be completed in
    2010. This project is a partnership with the Orlando Utilities
    Commission (OUC) and is located at OUC’s Stanton Energy
    Center site. A cooperative agreement with the
    U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) provides up to
    $235 million in funding to be applied by the joint owners
    for the construction and demonstration of the gasification
    portion of this project.

As of December 31, 2006, the Company had 6,733 MW
    nameplate capacity in commercial operation. The weighted average
    duration of the Company’s wholesale contracts exceeds
    10 years, which reduces re-marketing risk. The Company
    continues to face challenges at the federal regulatory level
    relative to market power and affiliate transactions. See FUTURE
    EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “FERC Matters” for
    additional information.

Key
    Performance Indicators

To evaluate operating results and to ensure the Company’s
    ability to meet its contractual commitments to customers, the
    Company focuses on several key performance indicators. These
    indicators consist of plant availability, peak season equivalent
    forced outage rate (EFOR), and net income. Plant availability
    shows the percentage of time during the year that the
    Company’s generating units are available to be called upon
    to generate (the higher the better), whereas the EFOR more
    narrowly defines the hours during peak demand times when the
    Company’s generating units are not available due to forced
    outages (the lower the better). Net income is the primary
    component of the Company’s contribution to Southern
    Company’s earnings per share goal. The Company’s
    actual performance in 2006 surpassed targets in these key
    performance areas. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for
    additional information on the Company’s financial
    performance.

Earnings

The Company’s 2006 earnings were $124.5 million, a
    $9.7 million increase over 2005. This increase was
    primarily the result of new PPAs starting or acquired in the
    period, including contracts with Piedmont Municipal Power
    Authority (PMPA) and EnergyUnited and the PPAs related to the
    acquisition of Plants DeSoto and Rowan in June 2006 and
    September 2006, respectively. Short-term energy sales and
    increased sales from existing resources also contributed to this
    increase.

The Company’s 2005 earnings were $114.8 million, a
    $3.3 million increase over 2004. The 2005 increase was
    primarily attributed to the acquisition of Oleander in June 2005
    and additional revenues associated with energy margins from
    fully contracted units, which were partially offset by the
    expiration of PPAs at Plant Dahlberg. In addition, interest
    expense increased in connection with the Oleander acquisition as
    well as the reduction in interest capitalized related to the
    conclusion of the Company’s initial construction program.

The Company’s 2004 earnings were $111.5 million. This
    was a decrease of $43.6 million from 2003 primarily the
    result of a one time $50 million gain in May 2003 from the
    termination of PPAs with Dynegy Inc.

Revenues

Operating revenues in 2006 were $777 million, a
    $4.0 million (0.5 percent) decrease from 2005. This
    decrease was primarily due to reduced energy revenues as a
    result of lower natural gas prices. This reduction is
    accompanied by a reduction in related fuel costs and does not
    have a significant net income impact. Offsetting this energy
    related reduction were increased sales from a full year of
    operations at Plant Oleander and new sales under PPAs with PMPA,
    EnergyUnited and those PPAs acquired in the DeSoto and Rowan
    acquisitions. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL –
    “Power Sales Agreements” and Note 2 to the
    financial statements under “DeSoto and Rowan
    Acquisitions.”

Operating revenues in 2005 were $781.0 million, a
    $79.7 million (11.4 percent) increase from 2004. This
    increase was primarily due to PPAs related to the Oleander
    acquisition, a new PPA with Flint Energies (Flint EMC), and a
    full year of revenue from PPAs with Georgia Power at Plant
    Franklin Unit 2 and Plant Harris Unit 2. The Georgia Power PPA
    for Plant Franklin Unit 2 had a scheduled sales increase in June
    2004, while the PPA for Plant Harris Unit 2 became effective in
    June 2004. These increases were partially offset by the
    expiration of PPAs at Plant Dahlberg.

Operating revenues in 2004 were $701.3 million, a
    $19.5 million (2.9 percent) increase from 2003. The
    increase was primarily related to a full year of revenues under
    PPAs from new units. Plant Harris Units 1 and 2 and Plant
    Franklin Unit 2 were placed in service in June 2003. Plant
    Stanton A was placed in service in October 2003.

Capacity revenues are an integral component of the
    Company’s PPAs with both affiliate and non-affiliate
    customers and represent the greatest contribution to net income.
    Energy under PPAs is generally sold at variable cost or is
    indexed to published gas indices. Energy revenues also include
    fees for support services, fuel storage, and unit start charges.
    Details of these PPA capacity and energy revenues are as follows:

    accordance with the Intercompany Interchange Contract (IIC), as
    approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and
    will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of
    generating resources at each company that participates in the
    centralized operation and dispatch of the Southern Company fleet
    of generating plants (Southern Pool). These transactions do not
    have a significant impact on earnings since the energy is
    generally sold at variable cost.

Other operating revenues increased by $4.6 million
    (360.4 percent) from 2005. This increase reflects new PPAs
    in 2006 with PMPA and EnergyUnited and is primarily the result
    of additional transmission revenues. These transmission revenues
    are largely offset by additional transmission expenses included
    in operations and maintenance expenses and do not contribute
    substantially to net income.

    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2006 Annual
    Report

Expenses

Fuel
    and Purchased Power

In 2006, fuel expense decreased by $63.8 million
    (30.5 percent) compared to 2005. The decrease was driven by
    a 25.4 percent reduction in the average cost of natural gas. Gas
    prices in 2006 were lower and had less weather-driven volatility
    than the previous two years. The fuel price decrease was
    partially offset by volume increases primarily from increased
    generation at Plants Wansley and Dahlberg.

In 2005, fuel expense increased by $81.9 million
    (64.4 percent). The increase was driven by a
    54.2 percent increase in the average cost of natural gas
    per decatherm. In 2004, fuel expense increased by
    $11.8 million (10.3 percent), primarily due to
    increased gas transportation expenses associated with Plant
    Harris Unit 2 prior to its commitment with Georgia Power. The
    average cost of natural gas per decatherm also increased
    8.3 percent from 2003 to 2004.

While prices for fuel have moderated somewhat in 2006, a
    significant upward trend in the cost of natural gas has emerged
    since 2003, and volatility in this market is expected to
    continue. Higher natural gas prices in the United States are the
    result of increased demand and slightly lower gas supplies
    despite increased drilling activity. Natural gas production and
    supply interruptions, such as those caused by 2004 and 2005
    hurricanes, result in an immediate market response; however, the
    long-term impact of this price volatility may be reduced by
    imports of liquefied natural gas if new liquefied gas facilities
    are built. The Company’s PPAs generally provide that the
    counterparties are responsible for substantially all of the cost
    of fuel and fuel costs do not significantly affect net income.
    Under most of the PPAs, either the Company incurs the fuel
    expense and concurrently recovers the cost through energy
    revenues or the counterparty purchases the fuel directly.

Purchased power increased $10.6 million (6.6 percent)
    in 2006, primarily due to increased purchases of lower cost
    energy resources from the Southern Pool and contracts with PMPA
    and Dalton Utilities. Purchased power volume in 2006 increased
    51 percent compared to 2005. This follows a
    $28.4 million (15.1 percent) decrease in 2005, due to
    limited short term market energy sales as the Company’s
    generating resources were employed for increased PPA commitments.

Purchased power increased $3.2 million (1.7 percent)
    in 2004 over 2003, consisting of a $15.4 million increase
    for non-affiliates and a $12.3 million decrease for
    affiliates as a result of the availability of lower cost energy
    from contracts with Georgia electric membership corporations
    (EMC) and North Carolina municipalities, in addition to other
    market sources. Purchased power may change markedly year to year
    as weather, fuel prices, and availability of lower cost energy
    resources influence the demand and optimal economics to serve
    the Company’s contracts.

Purchased power expenses will vary depending on demand and the
    availability and cost of generating resources available
    throughout the Southern Company system and other contract
    resources. Load requirements are submitted to the Southern Pool
    on an hourly basis and are fulfilled with the lowest cost
    alternative, whether that is generation owned by the Company,
    affiliate-owned generation, or external purchases.

Other
    Operations and Maintenance

Other operations and maintenance expenses have increased during
    the period from 2003 through 2006. In 2006, other operations and
    maintenance expenses increased $14.5 million
    (17.9 percent). In 2005 and 2004, other operations and
    maintenance increased $5.6 million and $13.0 million,
    respectively. The

year-to-year

increases are primarily the result of the operation of new
    generating units. In 2003, Plant Franklin Unit 2, Plant
    Harris Units 1 and 2, and Plant Stanton A were placed in
    service at differing dates. Unit additions from acquisitions
    began in 2005 with Plant Oleander and have continued in 2006
    with Plant DeSoto and Plant Rowan. See Note 2 to the
    financial statements under “DeSoto and Rowan
    Acquisitions” and “Oleander Acquisition.”

Depreciation
    and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization increased by $11.7 million
    (21.6 percent) from 2005. This increase was primarily the
    result of higher depreciation rates from a new depreciation
    study adopted in March 2006. The change in rates contributed an
    additional $6.3 million of expense. Additional plant in
    service from acquisitions also contributed $5.4 million to
    the increase. Additions have included Plant Oleander in June
    2005, Plant DeSoto in June 2006, and Plant Rowan in September
    2006.

Depreciation and amortization increased by $3.1 million in
    2005 and by $12.1 million in 2004. Prior increases have
    been primarily through additional plant in service.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

(continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2006 Annual
    Report

Taxes
    Other than Income Taxes

Taxes other than income taxes increased $2.3 million
    (17.4 percent) in 2006. This was primarily due to
    incremental ad valorem taxes on new assets. In 2005 and 2004,
    taxes other than income taxes increased $2.0 million and
    $4.6 million, respectively. Increases in taxes other than
    income taxes have followed additions to plant in service since
    2002. Plant in service additions have come through completed
    construction activities or acquisitions.

Interest

Interest expense has increased by $0.8 million,
    $13.2 million, and $34.4 million in 2006, 2005, and
    2004, respectively. The 2006 increase was primarily the result
    of additional debt incurred for acquisitions. This increase was
    offset by higher levels of interest capitalized during
    construction reflecting the Company’s construction program.
    Prior year increases were due to incremental debt incurred for
    the Oleander acquisition and construction. Additional factors
    for prior year increases included a lower percentage of interest
    costs being capitalized as projects reached completion, were
    sold, or were suspended during those periods. Plant McIntosh
    Units 10 and 11 were transferred to Georgia Power and Savannah
    Electric and construction was suspended on Plant Franklin Unit 3
    during 2004, effectively ceasing all capitalized interest. For
    additional information, see FUTURE EARNINGS
    POTENTIAL – “Construction Projects —
    Plant Franklin Unit 3, Plant Oleander Unit 5, and
    IGCC” and Note 3 to the financial statements under
    “Plant Franklin Unit 3 Construction Project” and
    Note 4 to the financial statements under “IGCC.”

Other
    Income (Expense), net

Changes in other income, net in 2006, 2005, and 2004 were
    primarily the result of unrealized gains and losses on
    derivative energy contracts. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    LIQUIDITY – “Market Price Risk” herein and
    Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements under
    “Financial Instruments.”

Income
    Taxes

Income taxes increased by $10.0 million (13.9 percent)
    in 2006. Income taxes decreased $1.1 million
    (1.5 percent) in 2005 and $12.2 million
    (14.4 percent) in 2004. Fluctuations in income taxes are
    primarily the result of changes to pre-tax income. Other factors
    may include new tax provisions or additional tax jurisdictions.

Effects
    of Inflation

When inflation exceeds projections used in market, term, and
    cost evaluations performed at contract initiation, the effects
    of inflation can create an economic loss. In addition, the
    income tax laws are based on historical costs. Therefore
    inflation creates an economic loss as the Company is recovering
    its costs of investments in dollars that could have less
    purchasing power. While the inflation rate has been relatively
    low in recent years, it continues to have an adverse effect on
    the Company due to large investment in utility plant with long
    economic lives. Conventional accounting for historical costs
    does not recognize this economic loss or the partially
    offsetting gain that arises through financing facilities with
    fixed money obligations such as long-term debt.

FUTURE
    EARNINGS POTENTIAL

General

The results of operations for the past three years are not
    necessarily indicative of future earnings potential. Several
    factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the
    Company’s competitive wholesale energy business. These
    factors include the ability to achieve sales growth while
    containing costs. Another major factor is federal regulatory
    policy, which may impact the Company’s level of
    participation in this market. The level of future earnings
    depends on numerous factors including regulatory matters such as
    those related to affiliate contracts, sales, creditworthiness of
    customers, total generating capacity available in the Southeast,
    and the successful remarketing of capacity as current contracts
    expire.

Power
    Sales Agreements

The Company’s sales are primarily through long-term PPAs.
    The Company is working to maintain and expand its share of the
    wholesale market in the Southeastern power markets. Although
    there is currently an oversupply of generating capacity in the
    Super-Southeast, opportunities remain in certain areas.

In February 2007, the Company entered into a PPA with Progress
    Energy Carolinas, Inc for 150 MW annually from January 2010
    through December 2019 from Plant Rowan.

In October 2006, the Company entered into a PPA with Gulf Power
    for 292 MW annually from June 2009 through May 2014 from
    Plant Dahlberg. This contract was filed with the Florida Public
    Service Commission (PSC) in December 2006 and is subject to
    Florida PSC and FERC approval.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

(continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2006 Annual
    Report

In September 2006, the Company acquired PPAs with Duke for
    456 MW annually and PPAs with NCMPA1 for an average of
    130 MW annually as part of the Rowan acquisition. These
    PPAs expire at various times through 2030.

In May 2006, the Company entered into three PPAs with
    EnergyUnited. Under two full requirements PPAs, the Company will
    sell an average monthly capacity of 177 MW from September
    2006 through December 2010 and 351 MW from January 2011
    through December 2025. The Company will also sell 205 MW of
    annual capacity through a block contract to be served from Plant
    Rowan from January 2011 through December 2025. See Note 2
    to the financial statements under “DeSoto and Rowan
    Acquisitions” for additional information.

In June 2006, the Company acquired PPAs with FP&L as part of
    the DeSoto acquisition. These PPAs cover the plant’s
    capacity and energy through May 2007. See Note 2 to the
    financial statements under “DeSoto and Rowan
    Acquisitions” for additional information.

In April 2006, the Company entered into a PPA with Progress
    Ventures, Inc. for 621 MW of annual capacity from 2009
    through 2015 with an option to extend through 2020. This
    capacity is expected to be provided from the expected
    621 MW capacity of Plant Franklin Unit 3. See Note 3
    to the financial statements under “Plant Franklin Unit 3
    Construction Project” for additional information.

In February 2006, the Company entered into a PPA with Florida
    Municipal Power Agency (FMPA) for the expected 160 MW
    capacity from Plant Oleander Unit 5. The PPA will commence upon
    the completion of the plant, which is scheduled for late 2007,
    and will extend through 2022.

In June 2005 as part of the Oleander acquisition, the Company
    acquired existing PPAs with FP&L and Seminole Electric
    Cooperative, Inc. (Seminole). The FP&L PPA is for one unit
    and extends through the end of May 2007. The Seminole PPA is for
    three units at Plant Oleander and extends through the end of
    2009. In February 2006, the Company signed an extension of the
    FP&L PPA for approximately 160 MW of annual capacity
    through May 2012. Also in February 2006, the Company signed an
    additional PPA with Seminole for approximately 465 MW of
    annual capacity through December 2015. See Note 2 to the
    financial statements under “Oleander Acquisition” for
    additional information.

In August 2004, the Company entered into two PPAs with FP&L.
    Under the PPAs, the Company will provide FP&L with a total
    of 790 MW of annual capacity from Plant Harris Unit 1 and
    Plant Franklin Unit 1 for the period from June 2010 through
    December 2015. A similar PPA with Progress Energy Florida was
    signed in November 2004 for 350 MW of annual capacity from
    Franklin Unit 1 for the period June 2010 through December 2015.
    The Florida PSC has approved these contracts.

Also in 2004, the Company executed multiple agreements with
    existing customers. For the years 2007 through 2009, the Company
    will sell an average of approximately 132 MW of additional
    wholesale capacity from existing resources to Flint EMC. The
    Company also agreed to a

10-year

extension of the OUC PPA for Stanton Unit A through October 2023.

The Company has entered into long-term power sales agreements

The Company has PPAs with some of the traditional operating
    companies and with other investor owned utilities and electric
    cooperatives. Although some of the Company’s PPAs are with
    Southern Company’s traditional operating companies, the
    Company’s generating facilities are not in the traditional
    operating companies’ regulated rate bases, and the Company
    is not able to seek recovery from the traditional operating
    companies’ ratepayers for construction, repair,
    environmental, or maintenance costs. The Company expects that
    the capacity payments in the PPAs will produce sufficient cash
    flow to cover costs, pay debt service, and provide an equity
    return. However, the Company’s overall profit will depend
    on numerous factors, including efficient operation of its
    generating facilities.

As a general matter, existing PPAs provide that the purchasers
    are responsible for substantially all of the cost of fuel
    relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. To the extent
    a particular generating facility does not meet the operational
    requirements contemplated in the PPAs, the Company may be
    responsible for excess fuel costs. With respect to fuel
    transportation risk, most of the Company’s PPAs provide
    that the counterparties are responsible for procuring and
    transporting the fuel to the particular generating facility.

Fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs will be
    recovered through capacity charges based on

dollars-per-kilowatt

year or

dollars-per-megawatt

hour. In general, the Company has long-term service contracts
    with General Electric (GE) to reduce its exposure to certain
    operation and maintenance costs relating to GE equipment. See
    Note 7 to the financial statements under “Long-Term
    Service Agreements” for additional information.

Many of the Company’s PPAs have provisions that require the
    posting of collateral or an acceptable substitute guarantee in
    the event that Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s
    downgrades the credit ratings of such counterparty to an
    unacceptable credit rating or the counterparty is not rated or
    fails to maintain a minimum coverage ratio. The PPAs are
    expected to provide the Company with a stable source of revenue
    during their respective terms.

FERC
    Matters

Market-Based
    Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to
    non-affiliates, including short-term opportunity sales, at
    market-based prices. Specific FERC approval must be obtained
    with respect to a market-based contract with an affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess
    Southern Company’s generation dominance within its retail
    service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in
    other markets is not an issue in that proceeding. Any new
    market-based rate sales by the Company in Southern
    Company’s retail service territory entered into during a

15-month

refund period beginning February 27, 2005 could be subject
    to refund to the level of the default cost-based rates, pending
    the outcome of the proceeding. Such sales through May 27,
    2006, the end of the refund period, were approximately
    $0.7 million for the Company. In the event that the
    FERC’s default mitigation measures for entities that are
    found to have market power are ultimately applied, the Company
    may be required to charge cost-based rates for certain wholesale
    sales in the Southern Company retail service territory, which
    may be lower than negotiated market-based rates. The final
    outcome of this matter will depend on the form in which the
    final methodology for assessing generation market power and
    mitigation rules may be ultimately adopted and cannot be
    determined at this time.

In addition, in May 2005, the FERC started an investigation to
    determine whether Southern Company satisfies the other three
    parts of the FERC’s market-based rate analysis:
    transmission market power, barriers to entry, and affiliate
    abuse or reciprocal dealing. The FERC established a new

15-month

refund period related to this expanded investigation. Any new
    market-based rate sales involving any Southern Company
    subsidiary, including the Company, could be subject to refund to
    the extent the FERC orders lower rates as a result of this new
    investigation. Such sales through October 19, 2006, the end
    of the refund period, were approximately $4.5 million for
    the Company, of which $0.6 million relates to sales

inside the retail service territory discussed above. The FERC
    also directed that this expanded proceeding be held in abeyance
    pending the outcome of the proceeding on the IIC discussed
    below. On January 3, 2007, the FERC issued an order noting
    settlement of the IIC proceeding and seeking comment
    identifying any remaining issues and the proper procedure for
    addressing any such issues.

The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for
    these proceedings and is vigorously defending itself in this
    matter. However, the final outcome of this matter, including any
    remedies to be applied in the event of an adverse ruling in
    these proceedings, cannot now be determined.

Intercompany
    Interchange Contract

The majority of the Company’s generation fleet is operated
    under the IIC, as approved by the FERC. In May 2005, the
    FERC initiated a new proceeding to examine (1) the
    provisions of the IIC among Alabama Power, Georgia Power,
    Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, Savannah Electric, the Company,
    and Southern Company Services, Inc. (SCS), as agent, under the
    terms of which the Southern Pool is operated, and, in
    particular, the propriety of the continued inclusion of the
    Company as a party to the IIC, (2) whether any parties
    to the IIC have violated the FERC’s standards of
    conduct applicable to utility companies that are transmission
    providers, and (3) whether Southern Company’s code of
    conduct defining the Company as a “system company”
    rather than a “marketing affiliate” is just and
    reasonable. In connection with the formation of the Company, the
    FERC authorized the Company’s inclusion in the IIC in
    2000. The FERC also previously approved Southern Company’s
    code of conduct.

On October 5, 2006, the FERC issued an order accepting a
    settlement resolving the proceeding subject to Southern
    Company’s agreement to accept certain modifications to the
    settlement’s terms. On October 20, 2006, Southern
    Company notified the FERC that it accepted the modifications.
    The modifications largely involve functional separation and
    information restrictions related to marketing activities
    conducted on behalf of the Company. Southern Company filed with
    the FERC on November 6, 2006 an implementation plan to
    comply with the modifications set forth in the order. The
    Company’s cost of the modifications is expected to be
    approximately $9 million per year.

Environmental
    Matters

The Company’s operations are subject to extensive
    regulation by state and federal environmental agencies under a
    variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental
    media, including air, water, and land resources. Applicable
    statutes include the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the
    Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
    Liability Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the
    Toxic Substances Control Act; the Emergency Planning &
    Community

Right-to-Know

Act; the Endangered Species Act; and related federal and state
    regulations. Compliance with possible additional federal or
    state legislation or regulations related to global climate
    change, air quality, or other environmental and health concerns
    could also affect the Company.

New environmental legislation or regulations, or changes to
    existing statutes or regulations could affect many areas of the
    Company’s operations. While the Company’s PPAs
    generally contain provisions that permit charging the
    counterparty with some of the new costs incurred as a result of
    changes in environmental laws and regulations, the full impact
    of any such regulatory or legislative changes cannot be
    determined at this time.

Because each of the Company’s units are newer gas-fired
    generating facilities, costs associated with environmental
    compliance for these facilities have been less significant than
    for similarly situated coal-fired generating facilities or older
    gas-fired generating facilities. Environmental, natural
    resource, and land use concerns, including the applicability of
    air quality limitations, the availability of water withdrawal
    rights, uncertainties regarding aesthetic impacts such as
    increased light or noise, and concerns about potential adverse
    health impacts, can, however, increase the cost of siting and
    operating any type of future electric generating facility. The
    impact of such statutes and regulations on the Company as a
    result of generating facilities that may be acquired or
    constructed in the future cannot be predicted at this time.

Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various
    types, including property damage, personal injury and citizen
    enforcement of environmental requirements such as opacity and
    other air quality standards, has increased generally throughout
    the United States. In particular, personal injury claims for
    damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have
    become more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such potential
    litigation against the Company cannot be predicted at this time.

Construction
    Projects

Plant
    Franklin Unit 3

The Company restarted construction activities on Plant Franklin
    Unit 3 in 2006, with an expected completion date in late 2008.
    The total cost is expected to be approximately
    $338.8 million, of which $198.3 million had been spent
    as of December 31, 2006. The expected capacity of this unit
    is 621 MW and will be used to provide annual capacity for a
    PPA with Progress Ventures, Inc. from 2009 through 2015. See
    Note 3 to the financial statements under “Plant
    Franklin Unit 3 Construction Project” for more information.

Plant
    Oleander Unit 5

The Company is constructing an additional unit at Plant
    Oleander. Oleander Unit 5 is a combustion turbine with an
    expected capacity of 160 MW and is expected to be completed
    in December 2007. The unit’s capacity will be used to
    provide annual capacity for a PPA with FMPA. The total cost of
    this project is expected to be approximately $59 million,
    of which $18.9 million had been spent as of
    December 31, 2006.

Integrated
    Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC)

In December 2005, the Company and OUC executed definitive
    agreements for development of the IGCC, a project of
    approximately 285 MW in Orlando, Florida, adjacent to Plant
    Stanton Unit A, which is co-owned by the Company, OUC, and
    others. The definitive agreements provide that the Company will
    own at least 65 percent of the gasifier portion of the
    project. OUC will own the remainder of the gasifier portion and
    100 percent of the combined cycle portion of the project.
    OUC will make capacity payments for all of the Company’s
    gasifier capacity once the plant is in commercial operation. The
    Company will construct the project and bill OUC a fixed price
    for its share in the project. The Company will manage operations
    after construction is completed using a joint staff of OUC and
    SCS employees. The Company signed a cooperative agreement with
    the DOE in February 2006, which provides for up to
    $235 million in grant funding for the construction and
    demonstration of the gasification portion of the project. The
    IGCC project is subject to National Environmental Policy Act
    review as well as state environmental review, requires certain
    regulatory approvals, and is expected to begin commercial
    operation in 2010. The total cost related to the gasifier
    portion of the IGCC project is currently being reviewed, and may
    be higher than earlier estimates due to increases in commodity
    costs and increased market demand for labor. The Company had
    spent $7.8 million as of December 31, 2006. The
    Company has the option under the agreements to end its
    participation in the project at the end of the project
    definition phase which is expected to be during 2007. The final
    outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Other
    Matters

The Company completed a depreciation study in 2006 and updated
    the composite depreciation rates for its property, plant, and
    equipment. This change in estimate arises from changes in useful
    life assumptions for certain components of plant in service
    determined by a detailed engineering study. This change
    increased depreciation expense and reduced net income. The 2006
    income impact of this change was $3.8 million. See
    Note 1 to the financial statements under
    “Depreciation” for additional information.

From time to time, the Company is involved in various other
    matters being litigated and regulatory matters that could affect
    future earnings. See Note 3 to the financial statements for
    information regarding material issues.

ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES

Application
    of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States. Significant accounting policies are described in
    Note 1 to the financial statements. In the application of
    these policies, certain estimates are made that may have a
    material impact on the Company’s results of operations and
    related disclosures. Different assumptions and measurements
    could produce estimates that are significantly different from
    those recorded in the financial statements. Senior management
    has reviewed and discussed the critical accounting policies and
    estimates described below with the Audit Committee of Southern
    Company’s Board of Directors.

Revenue
    Recognition

The Company’s revenue recognition depends on appropriate
    classification and documentation of transactions in accordance
    with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement
    No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging Activities,” as amended and interpreted
    (SFAS No. 133). In general, the Company’s power
    sale transactions can be classified in

II-306


MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

(continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2006 Annual
    Report

one of four categories: non-derivatives, normal sales, cash flow
    hedges, and mark to market. For more information on derivative
    transactions, see FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY –
    “Market Price Risk” and Notes 1 and 6 to the
    financial statements under “Financial Instruments.”
    The Company’s revenues are dependent upon significant
    judgments used to determine the appropriate transaction
    classification, which must be documented upon the inception of
    each contract. Factors that must be considered in making these
    determinations include:

•

Assessing whether a sales contract meets the definition of a
    lease

•

Assessing whether a sales contract meets the definition of a
    derivative

•

Assessing whether a sales contract meets the definition of a
    capacity contract

•

Assessing the probability at inception and throughout the term
    of the individual contract that the contract will result in
    physical delivery

•

Ensuring that the contract quantities do not exceed available
    generating capacity

•

Identifying the hedging instrument, the hedged transaction, and
    the nature of the risk being hedged

•

Assessing hedge effectiveness at inception and throughout the
    contract term.

Normal
    Sale and Non-Derivative Transactions

The Company has capacity contracts that provide for the sale of
    electricity and that involve physical delivery in quantities
    within the Company’s available generating capacity. These
    contracts either do not meet the definition of a derivative or
    are designated as normal sales thus exempting them from fair
    value accounting under SFAS No. 133. As a result, such
    transactions are accounted for as executory contracts;
    additionally the related revenue is recognized in accordance
    with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF)

No. 91-6,

“Revenue Recognition of Long-Term Power Sales
    Contracts” on an accrual basis in amounts equal to the
    lesser of the levelized amount or the amount billable under the
    contract, over the respective contract periods. Revenues are
    recorded on a gross basis in accordance with EITF

No. 99-19

“Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an
    Agent.” Revenues from transactions that do not meet the
    definition of a derivative are also recorded in this manner.
    Contracts recorded on the accrual basis represented the majority
    of the Company’s operating revenues for the year ended
    December 31, 2006.

Cash Flow
    Hedge Transactions

The Company designates other derivative contracts for the sale
    of electricity as cash flow hedges of anticipated sale
    transactions. These contracts are marked to market through other
    comprehensive income over the life of the contract. Realized
    gains and losses are then recognized in revenues as incurred.

Mark to
    Market Transactions

Contracts for sales of electricity that are not normal sales and
    are not designated as cash flow hedges are marked to market and
    recorded directly through net income. Net unrealized gains on
    such contracts were not material for the year ended
    December 31, 2006.

Percentage
    of Completion

The Company is currently engaged in a long term contract for
    engineering, procurement, and construction services to build a
    combined cycle unit for OUC. Construction activities commenced
    in 2006 and are expected to be complete by the end of 2010.
    Revenue and costs are recognized using the

percentage-of-completion

method. The Company utilizes the

cost-to-cost

approach as this method is less subjective than relying on
    assessments of physical progress. The percentage of completion
    represents the percentage of the total costs incurred to the
    estimated total cost of the contract. Revenues and costs are
    recognized by applying this percentage to the total revenues and
    estimated costs of the contract.

Asset
    Impairments

The Company’s investments in long-lived assets are
    primarily generation assets, whether in service or under
    construction. The Company evaluates the carrying value of these
    assets under FASB Statement No. 144, “Accounting for
    the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets,” whenever
    indicators of potential impairment exist. Examples of impairment
    indicators could include significant changes in construction
    schedules, current period losses combined with a history of
    losses, or a projection of continuing losses or a significant
    decrease in market prices. If an indicator exists, the asset is
    tested for recoverability by comparing the asset carrying value
    to the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows
    directly attributable to the asset. A high degree of judgment is
    required in developing estimates related to

II-307


MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

(continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2006 Annual
    Report

these evaluations, which are based on projections of various
    factors, including the following:

•

Future demand for electricity based on projections of economic
    growth and estimates of available generating capacity

•

Future power and natural gas prices, which have been quite
    volatile in recent years

•

Future operating costs.

To date, the Company’s evaluations of its assets have not
    required any impairment to be recorded. See Note 2 to the
    financial statements under “Plant Franklin Unit 3
    Construction Project” for additional information.

Acquisition
    Accounting

The Company has been engaged in a strategy of acquiring assets.
    The Company has accounted for these acquisitions under the
    purchase method in accordance with FASB Statement
    No. 141,“Business Combinations.” Accordingly, the
    Company has included these operations in the consolidated
    financial statements from the respective date of acquisition.
    The purchase price of each acquisition was allocated to the
    identifiable assets and liabilities based on a valuation
    prepared by a third party.

New
    Accounting Standards

Guidance
    on Considering the Materiality of Misstatements

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
    issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,
    “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when
    Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
    Statements” (SAB 108). SAB 108 addresses how the
    effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be
    considered when quantifying misstatements in current year
    financial statements. SAB 108 requires companies to
    quantify misstatements using both a balance sheet and an income
    statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach
    results in quantifying an error that is material in light of
    relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. When the effect
    of initial adoption is material, companies will record the
    effect as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year
    retained earnings. The provisions of SAB 108 were effective
    for the Company for the year ended December 31, 2006. The
    adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s financial statements.

Income
    Taxes

In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”
    (FIN 48). This interpretation requires that tax benefits
    must be “more likely than not” of being sustained in
    order to be recognized. The Company adopted FIN 48
    effective January 1, 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 did
    not have a material impact on the Company’s financial
    statements.

Fair
    Value Measurement

The FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157 “Fair Value
    Measurements” (SFAS No. 157) in September
    2006. This standard provides guidance on how to measure fair
    value where it is permitted or required under other accounting
    pronouncements. SFAS No. 157 also requires additional
    disclosures about fair value measurements. The Company plans to
    adopt SFAS No. 157 on January 1, 2008 and is
    currently assessing its impact.

Fair
    Value Option

In February 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 159,
    “Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115” (SFAS No. 159). This standard
    permits an entity to choose to measure many financial
    instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company
    plans to adopt SFAS No. 159 on January 1, 2008
    and is currently assessing its impact.

FINANCIAL
    CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

The major changes in the Company’s financial condition
    during 2006 have been the acquisitions of Plant DeSoto in June
    and Plant Rowan in September, the continued construction of
    Plant Franklin Unit 3, Plant Oleander Unit 5, and the
    IGCC, and the completion of the sale of Cherokee Falls
    Development of South Carolina LLC (a former subsidiary of the
    Company) and its assets to Southern Company’s nuclear
    development affiliate. The acquisitions of Plant DeSoto and
    Plant Rowan resulted in $409.2 million of utility plant and
    working capital in 2006. Total expenditures on current
    construction projects are $225.0 million. Other changes
    have included the payment of $77.7 million in dividends to
    Southern Company and the issuance of $200 million of senior
    notes. The Company has received investment grade ratings from
    the major rating agencies with respect to its debt.

II-308


MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

(continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2006 Annual
    Report

Sources
    of Capital

The Company may use operating cash flows, external funds, or
    equity capital from Southern Company to finance any new
    projects, acquisitions, and ongoing capital requirements. The
    Company expects to generate external funds from the issuance of
    unsecured senior debt and commercial paper or utilization of
    credit arrangements from banks.

The Company’s current liabilities frequently exceed current
    assets due to the use of short-term debt as a funding source. At
    December 31, 2006, the Company had approximately
    $29.9 million of cash and cash equivalents to meet
    short-term cash needs and contingencies. To meet liquidity and
    capital resource requirements, the Company had at
    December 31, 2006, $400 million of unused committed
    credit arrangements with banks that expire in 2011. Proceeds
    from these credit arrangements may be used for working capital
    and general corporate purposes as well as liquidity support for
    the Company’s commercial paper program. See Note 6 to
    the financial statements under “Bank Credit
    Arrangements” for additional information.

The Company’s commercial paper program is used to finance
    acquisition and construction costs related to electric
    generating facilities and for general corporate purposes. At
    December 31, 2006, there was $123.8 million of
    commercial paper outstanding. See Note 6 to the financial
    statements under “Commercial Paper” for additional
    information.

Financing
    Activities

During 2006, the Company issued $200 million of

30-year

unsecured long-term senior notes. The proceeds of the issuance
    were used to repay a portion of the Company’s outstanding
    short-term indebtedness and for other general corporate
    purposes, including the Company’s continuous construction
    program. In conjunction with issuing the securities, the Company
    terminated $200 million in interest swaps at a cost of
    $8.1 million. This cost will be amortized over a

10-year

period.

The issuance of all securities by the Company is generally
    subject to regulatory approval by the FERC. Additionally, with
    respect to the public offering of securities, the Company files
    registration statements with the SEC under the Securities Act of
    1933, as amended (1933 Act). The amounts of securities
    authorized by the FERC, as well as the amounts registered under
    the 1933 Act, are continuously monitored and appropriate filings
    are made to ensure flexibility in the capital markets.

Credit
    Rating Risk

The Company does not have any credit arrangements that would
    require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as
    a result of a credit downgrade. There are certain contracts that
    could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the
    event of a credit rating change to BBB and Baa2 or to BBB- or
    Baa3 or below. Generally, collateral may be provided with a
    Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. These
    contracts are primarily for physical electricity purchases and
    sales. At December 31, 2006, the maximum potential
    collateral requirements at BBB and Baa2 ratings were
    approximately $8.6 million, at BBB- or Baa3 ratings were
    approximately $264.7 million, and below BBB- or Baa3
    ratings were approximately $424.2 million. In addition,
    through the acquisition of Plant Rowan, the Company assumed a
    PPA with Duke that could require collateral, but not accelerated
    payment, in the event of a downgrade to the Company’s
    credit rating to below BBB- or Baa3. The amount of collateral
    required would depend upon actual losses, if any, resulting from
    a credit downgrade, limited to the Company’s remaining
    obligations under the contract. The Company, along with the
    other members of the Southern Pool, is also party to certain
    derivative agreements that could require collateral

and/or

accelerated payment in the event of a credit rating change to
    below investment grade for Alabama Power

and/or

Georgia Power. These agreements are primarily for natural gas
    and power price risk management activities. At December 31,
    2006, the Company’s total exposure to these types of
    agreements was approximately $27.4 million

Market
    Price Risk

The Company is exposed to market risks, including changes in
    interest rates, certain energy-related commodity prices, and,
    occasionally, currency exchange rates. To manage the volatility
    attributable to these exposures, the Company nets the exposures
    to take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various
    derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to
    the Company’s policies in areas such as counterparty
    exposure and hedging practices. Company policy is that
    derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes.
    Derivative positions are monitored using techniques that include
    market valuation and sensitivity analysis.

Because energy from the Company’s facilities is primarily
    sold under long-term PPAs with tolling agreements and provisions
    shifting substantially all of the responsibility for fuel cost
    to the counterparties, the Company’s exposure to market
    volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity is
    limited. To mitigate

residual risks in those areas, the Company enters into

    represent hedges are recognized in the income statement as
    incurred.

Unrealized pre-tax gains and losses from energy-related
    derivative contracts recognized in income were not material for
    any year presented. The Company is exposed to market-price risk
    in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the
    derivative energy contracts. The Company’s policy is to
    enter into agreements with counterparties that have investment
    grade credit ratings by Standard & Poor’s and
    Moody’s or with counterparties who have posted collateral
    to cover potential credit exposure. Therefore, the Company does
    not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the
    counterparties. For additional information, see Notes 1 and
    6 to the financial statements under “Financial
    Instruments.”

At December 31, 2006, the Company had no variable long-term
    debt outstanding. Therefore, there would be no effect on
    annualized interest expense related to long-term debt if the
    Company sustained a 100 basis point change in interest
    rates. The Company is not aware of any facts or circumstances
    that would significantly affect such exposures in the near term.

Capital
    Requirements and Contractual Obligations

The capital program of the Company is currently estimated to be
    $240.7 million for 2007, $481.9 million for 2008, and
    $844.4 million for 2009. These amounts include estimates
    for potential plant acquisitions

and/or

new
    construction. Actual construction costs may vary from these
    estimates because of changes in factors such as: business
    conditions; environmental regulations; FERC rules and
    transmission regulations; load projections; the cost and
    efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; and
    the cost of capital. Currently, there are three plants under
    construction.

Other funding requirements related to obligations associated
    with scheduled maturities of long-term debt, as well as the
    related interest, leases, and other purchase commitments are as
    follows. See Notes 1, 6, and 7 to the financial
    statements for additional information.

NOTES TO
    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Southern Power Company and
    Subsidiary Companies 2006 Annual Report

1.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General

Southern Power Company (the Company) is a wholly-owned
    subsidiary of Southern Company, which is also the parent company
    of four traditional operating companies, Southern Company
    Services (SCS), Southern Communications Services (SouthernLINC
    Wireless), Southern Company Holdings (Southern Holdings),
    Southern Nuclear Operating Company (Southern Nuclear), Southern
    Telecom and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The
    traditional operating companies, Alabama Power Company (APC),
    Georgia Power Company (GPC), Gulf Power Company, and Mississippi
    Power Company, are vertically integrated utilities providing
    electric service in four Southeastern states. The Company
    constructs, acquires, and manages generation assets and sells
    electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. SCS,
    the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized
    services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies.
    SouthernLINC Wireless provides digital wireless communications
    services to the traditional operating companies and also markets
    these services to the public within the Southeast. Southern
    Telecom provides fiber cable services within the Southeast.
    Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary
    for Southern Company’s investments in synthetic fuels and
    leveraged leases and various other energy-related businesses.
    Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to Southern
    Company’s nuclear power plants. On January 4, 2006,
    Southern Company completed the sale of substantially all of the
    assets of Southern Company Gas, its competitive retail natural
    gas marketing subsidiary.

The Company is subject to regulation by the Federal Energy
    Regulatory Commission (FERC). The Company follows accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States. The
    preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ
    from those estimates.

The financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
    its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Southern Company-Florida LLC
    (SCF), Oleander Power Project, LP (Oleander), DeSoto County
    Generating Company, LLC (DCGC), and Southern Power
    Company – Orlando Gasification LLC (SPC-OG), which
    were own, operate, and maintain the Company’s ownership
    interests in Plant Stanton Unit A, Plant Oleander, Plant DeSoto,
    and the integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plant,
    respectively. See Note 2 under “DeSoto and Rowan
    Acquisitions” and “Oleander Acquisition” and
    Note 4 under “IGCC” for further information. All
    intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
    consolidation.

Affiliate
    Transactions

The Company has an agreement with SCS under which the following
    services are rendered to the Company at direct or allocated
    cost: general and design engineering, purchasing, accounting and
    statistical analysis, finance and treasury, tax, information
    resources, marketing, auditing, insurance and pension
    administration, human resources, systems and procedures and
    other services with respect to business and operations and power
    pool transactions. SCS also enters into fuel purchase and
    transportation arrangements and contracts, financial instruments
    for purposes of hedging and wholesale energy purchase and sale
    transactions for the benefit of the Company. Because the Company
    has no employees, all employee related charges are rendered at
    cost under agreements with SCS or the traditional operating
    companies. Costs for these services from SCS amounted to
    approximately $77.8 million in 2006, $51.9 million in
    2005, and $46.7 million in 2004. Approximately
    $59.7 million in 2006, $47.8 million in 2005, and
    $40.3 million in 2004 were general, administrative,
    operations and maintenance expenses; the remainder was
    capitalized to construction work in progress and other deferred
    assets. Cost allocation methodologies used by SCS were approved
    by the Securities and Exchange Commission prior to the repeal of
    the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended, and
    management believes they are reasonable. The FERC permits
    services to be rendered at cost by system service companies.

The Company has agreements with GPC and APC to provide
    operations and maintenance services for Plants Dahlberg,
    Wansley, Franklin, and Harris. GPC has also supplied various
    services for other plants. These services are billed at cost on
    a monthly basis and are recorded as operations and maintenance
    expense in the accompanying statements of income. For the
    periods ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, these
    services totaled approximately $7.6 million,
    $7.1 million, and $6.6 million, respectively.

Total billings for all purchased power agreements (PPAs) in
    effect with affiliates totaled $467.9 million,
    $531.5 million, and $383.0 million in 2006, 2005, and
    2004, respectively. Included in these billings were
    $36.3 million, $37.5 million, and $39.1 million
    of “Deferred capacity revenues – affiliated”
    recorded on the balance sheets at December 31, 2006,
    December 31, 2005, and December 31, 2004, respectively.

II-318


NOTES

(continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2006 Annual
    Report

The Company and the traditional operating companies may jointly
    enter into various types of wholesale energy, natural gas, and
    certain other contracts, either directly or through SCS as
    agent. Each participating company may be jointly and severally
    liable for the obligations incurred under these agreements.

The Company and the traditional operating companies generally
    settle amounts related to the above transactions on a monthly
    basis in the month following the performance of such services or
    the purchase or sale of electricity.

In 2006, the Company sold its membership interests in Cherokee
    Falls Development of South Carolina LLC at cost to Southern
    Company’s nuclear development affiliate. The sales price
    was $15.7 million and is recorded in “Sale of property
    to affiliates” on the statements of cash flows.

Revenues

Capacity is sold at rates specified under contractual terms and
    is recognized at the lesser of the levelized amount or the
    amount billable under the contract over the respective contract
    periods. Energy is generally sold at market-based rates and the
    associated revenue is recognized as the energy is delivered.
    Transmission revenues and other fees are recognized as incurred
    as other operating revenue. Revenues are recorded on a gross
    basis for all full requirements PPAs. See “Financial
    Instruments” herein for additional information.

Significant portions of the Company’s revenues have been
    derived from certain customers. For the year ended
    December 31, 2006, GPC accounted for 52.7 percent of
    revenues, APC accounted for 8.2 percent of revenues and
    Flint Electric Membership Corporation accounted for
    4.6 percent of revenues. For the year ended
    December 31, 2005, GPC accounted for 53.6 percent of
    revenues, with APC and Savannah Electric accounting for
    8.2 percent and 6.5 percent of revenues, respectively.
    For the year ended December 31, 2004, GPC accounted for
    approximately 40.3 percent of revenues, with APC and
    Savannah Electric accounting for 8.4 percent and
    4.5 percent, respectively. Savannah Electric was merged
    into GPC effective July 1, 2006.

The Company has a long-term contract for engineering,
    procurement, and construction services to build a combined cycle
    unit for the Orlando Utilities Commission (OUC). Construction
    activities commenced in 2006 and are expected to be complete by
    the end of 2010. Revenue and costs are recognized using the

percentage-of-completion

method. The Company utilizes the

cost-to-cost

approach as this method is less subjective than relying on
    assessments of physical progress. The percentage of completion
    represents the percentage of the total costs incurred to the
    estimated total cost of the contract. Revenues and costs are
    recognized by applying this percentage to the total revenues and
    estimated costs of the contract.

Fuel
    Costs

Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is consumed.

Income
    and Other Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred
    income taxes and provides deferred income taxes for all
    significant income tax temporary differences. Investment tax
    credits utilized are deferred and amortized to income over the
    average life of the related property.

Property,
    Plant, and Equipment

The Company’s property, plant, and equipment consist
    entirely of generation assets.

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost.
    Original cost includes materials, direct labor incurred by
    affiliated companies, minor items of property, and interest
    capitalized. Interest is capitalized on qualifying projects
    during the development and construction period. The cost to
    replace significant items of property defined as retirement
    units is capitalized. The cost of maintenance, repairs, and
    replacement of minor items of property is charged to maintenance
    expense as incurred.

Depreciation

Depreciation of the original cost of assets is computed under
    the straight-line method and applies a composite depreciation
    rate based on the assets’ estimated useful lives determined
    by the Company. The primary assets in property, plant, and
    equipment are power plants, all of which have an estimated
    useful life of 35 years, except combustion turbines at
    Plant Dahlberg, Plant Oleander, Plant Rowan, and Plant DeSoto,
    all of which have an estimated useful life of 40 years.
    These lives reflect a composite of the significant components
    (retirement units) that make up the plants. Depreciation studies
    are conducted periodically to update the composite rates.

A new depreciation study was completed and the applicable
    remaining plant lives and associated depreciation rates were
    revised in March 2006. This change in estimate was due to
    revised useful life assumptions for certain components of plant
    in service. Depreciation rates by generating facility increased
    from a range of 2.5 to 2.9 percent to an adjusted range of
    2.8 to

II-319


NOTES

(continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2006 Annual
    Report

3.8 percent. These changes increase depreciation expense
    and reduce net income. The result of these changes decreased
    2006 net income by $3.8 million.

When property subject to composite depreciation is retired or
    otherwise disposed of in the normal course of business, its cost
    is charged to accumulated depreciation. For other property
    dispositions, the applicable cost and accumulated depreciation
    is removed from the accounts and a gain or loss is recognized.

Asset
    Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of Removal

The present value of the ultimate costs for an asset’s
    future retirement is recorded in the period in which the
    liability is incurred. The costs are capitalized as part of the
    related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset’s
    useful life.

At December 31, 2006, the Company had no liability for
    asset retirement obligations.

Interest
    Capitalized

Interest related to the construction of new facilities is
    capitalized in accordance with standard interest capitalization
    requirements per Financial Accounting Standards Board
    Statement No. 34, “Capitalization of Interest
    Cost.”

Impairment
    of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles

The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination
    of whether impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of
    undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as
    compared with the carrying value of the assets. If an impairment
    has occurred, the amount of the impairment recognized is
    determined by estimating the fair value of the assets and
    recording a loss for the amount if the carrying value is greater
    than the fair value. For assets identified as held for sale, the
    carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value less the
    cost to sell in order to determine if an impairment loss is
    required. Until the assets are disposed of, their estimated fair
    value is re-evaluated when circumstances or events change.

Deferred
    Project Development Costs

The Company capitalizes project development costs once it is
    determined that it is probable that a specific site will be
    acquired and a power plant constructed. These costs include
    professional services, permits, and other costs directly related
    to the construction of a new project. These costs are generally
    transferred to construction work in progress upon commencement
    of construction. The total deferred project development costs
    were $1.3 million at December 31, 2006,
    $3.8 million at December 31, 2005, and
    $3.2 million at December 31, 2004.

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash
    investments are considered cash equivalents. Temporary cash
    investments are securities with original maturities of
    90 days or less.

Materials
    and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include generating plant
    materials. Materials are charged to inventory when purchased and
    then expensed or capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when
    installed. Materials and supplies are recorded at average cost.

Fuel
    Inventory

Fuel inventory includes the cost of oil and emission allowances.
    The Company maintains minimal oil levels for use at Plant
    Dahlberg, Plant Oleander, Plant DeSoto, and Plant Rowan.
    Inventory is maintained using the weighted average cost method.
    Fuel inventory and emissions allowances are recorded at actual
    cost when purchased and then expensed at weighted average cost
    as used.

Financial
    Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit
    exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, the prices of
    certain fuel purchases and electricity purchases and sales. All
    derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets
    or liabilities and are measured at fair value. Substantially all
    of the Company’s bulk energy purchases and sales contracts
    that meet the definition of a derivative are exempt from fair
    value accounting requirements and are accounted for under the
    accrual method. Other derivative contracts qualify as cash flow
    hedges of anticipated transactions. This results in the deferral
    of related gains and losses in other comprehensive income until
    the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness is recognized
    currently in net income. Other derivative contracts are marked
    to market through current period income and are recorded on a
    net basis in the statements of income.

The Company is exposed to losses related to financial
    instruments in the event of counterparties’ nonperformance.
    The Company has established controls to

Comprehensive
    Income

The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of
    all changes in common stock equity of an enterprise that result
    from transactions and other economic events of the period other
    than transactions with owners. Comprehensive income consists of
    net income and changes in the fair value of qualifying cash flow
    hedges, less income taxes and reclassifications of amounts
    included in net income.

2. ACQUISITIONS

Oleander
    Acquisition

In June 2005, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
    general and limited partnership interests of Oleander from
    subsidiaries of Constellation Energy Group, Inc. The results of
    Oleander’s operations have been included in the financial
    statements since that date. The Company’s acquisition of
    the general and limited partnership interests in Oleander was
    pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement dated April 8,
    2005, for an aggregate total cost of approximately
    $218.1 million, including approximately $11.9 million
    of working capital and other adjustments. Plant Oleander is a
    dual-fueled generating plant in Brevard County, Florida with a
    nameplate capacity of 628 megawatts (MW). The entire output of
    Plant Oleander is sold under separate PPAs with Florida
    Power & Light Company (FP&L) and Seminole Electric
    Cooperative, Inc. (Seminole). The PPA with FP&L is for one
    unit and extends through the end of May 2007. The Seminole PPA
    is for three units at Oleander and extends through the end of
    2009. In February 2006, FP&L extended its PPA for
    approximately 160 MW through 2012 and Seminole signed an
    additional PPA for approximately 465 MW of capacity through
    2015. The Oleander acquisition was in accordance with the
    Company’s overall regional growth strategy.

Subsequent to the acquisition, the Company has started
    construction on an additional unit at the Oleander site. This
    will be Plant Oleander Unit 5 with an expected capacity of
    160 MW. This unit will be used to supply a new Florida
    Municipal Power Agency (FMPA) contract starting in 2007 through
    the end of 2022.

Desoto
    and Rowan Acquisitions

Effective June 1, 2006, the Company acquired all of the
    outstanding membership interests of DeSoto County Generating
    Company, LLC (DeSoto) from a subsidiary of Progress Energy, Inc.
    The results of DeSoto’s operations have been included in
    the Company’s consolidated financial statements since that
    date. The Company’s acquisition of the membership interest
    in DeSoto was pursuant to an agreement dated May 8, 2006,
    for an aggregate total cost of $79.7 million. DeSoto owns a
    dual-fired generating plant near Arcadia, Florida with a
    nameplate capacity of 344 MW. The plant’s capacity and
    associated energy is sold under PPAs with FP&L that expire
    in 2007. The DeSoto acquisition was in accordance with the
    Company’s overall regional growth strategy.

Effective September 1, 2006, the Company acquired all of
    the outstanding membership interests of Rowan County Power, LLC
    (Rowan) from a subsidiary of Progress Energy, Inc. Rowan was
    merged into the Company, and the results of Rowan’s
    operations have been included in the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements since that date. The Company’s
    acquisition of the membership interests in Rowan was pursuant to
    an agreement dated May 8, 2006 for an aggregate total cost
    of $329.5 million. Through the Rowan acquisition, the
    Company owns a dual-fired generating plant near Salisbury, North
    Carolina with a nameplate capacity of 986 MW. Portions of
    Plant Rowan capacity and associated energy are sold under PPAs
    with Duke Power, LLC, North Carolina Municipal Power Agency
    No. 1, and Energy United Electric Membership Corporation
    (EnergyUnited). Substantially all of Plant Rowan’s capacity
    is under contract from 2011 through 2025. The Rowan acquisition
    was in accordance with the Company’s overall regional
    growth strategy.

The pro forma data of the Company below is unaudited and gives
    effect to the DeSoto and Rowan plant acquisitions as if they had
    occurred at January 1, 2005. The unaudited pro forma
    financial information is not intended to represent or be

CONTINGENCIES
    AND REGULATORY MATTERS

General
    Litigation Matters

The Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions
    arising in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the
    Company’s business activities are subject to extensive
    governmental regulation related to public health and the
    environment. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of
    various types, including property damage, personal injury and
    citizen enforcement of environmental requirements such as
    opacity and other air quality standards, has increased generally
    throughout the United States. In particular, personal injury
    claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous
    materials have become more frequent. The ultimate outcome of
    such pending or potential litigation against the Company and its
    subsidiaries cannot be predicted at this time; however, for
    proceedings not specifically reported herein, management does
    not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such
    proceedings would have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s financial statements.

FERC
    Matters

Market-Based
    Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to
    non-affiliates, including short-term opportunity sales, at
    market-based prices. Specific FERC approval must be obtained
    with respect to a market-based contract with an affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess
    Southern Company’s generation dominance within its retail
    service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in
    other markets is not an issue in that proceeding. Any new
    market-based rate sales by the Company in Southern
    Company’s retail service territory entered into during a

15-month

refund period beginning February 27, 2005 could be subject
    to refund to the level of the default cost-based rates, pending
    the outcome of the proceeding. Such sales through May 27,
    2006, the end of the refund period, were approximately
    $0.7 million for the Company. In the event that the
    FERC’s default mitigation measures for entities that are
    found to have market power are ultimately applied, the Company
    may be required to charge cost-based rates for certain wholesale
    sales in the Southern Company retail service territory, which
    may be lower than negotiated market-based rates. The final
    outcome of this matter will depend on the form in which the
    final methodology for assessing generation market power and
    mitigation rules may be ultimately adopted and cannot be
    determined at this time.

In addition, in May 2005, the FERC started an investigation to
    determine whether Southern Company satisfies the other three
    parts of the FERC’s market-based rate analysis:
    transmission market power, barriers to entry, and affiliate
    abuse or reciprocal dealing. The FERC established a new

15-month

refund period related to this expanded investigation. Any new
    market-based rate sales involving transactions involving any
    Southern Company subsidiary, including the Company, could be
    subject to refund to the extent the FERC orders lower rates as a
    result of this new investigation. Such sales through
    October 19, 2006, the end of the refund period, were
    approximately $4.5 million for the Company, of which
    $0.6 million relates to sales inside the retail service
    territory discussed above. The FERC also directed that this
    expanded proceeding be held in abeyance pending the outcome of
    the proceeding on the Intercompany Interchange Contract
    (IIC) discussed below. On January 3, 2007 the FERC
    issued an order noting settlement of the IIC proceeding and
    seeking comment identifying any remaining issues and the proper
    procedure for addressing any such issues.

The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for
    these proceedings and is vigorously defending itself in this
    matter. However, the final outcome of this matter, including any
    remedies to be applied in the event of an adverse ruling in
    these proceedings, cannot now be determined.

Intercompany
    Interchange Contract

The majority of the Company’s generation fleet is operated
    under the IIC, as approved by the FERC. In May 2005, the
    FERC initiated a new proceeding to examine (1) the
    provisions of the IIC among APC, GPC, Gulf Power,
    Mississippi Power, Savannah Electric, the Company and SCS, as
    agent, under the terms of which the power pool of Southern
    Company is operated, and, in particular, the propriety of the
    continued inclusion of the Company as a party to the IIC,
    (2) whether any parties to

II-322


NOTES

(continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2006 Annual
    Report

the IIC have violated the FERC’s standards of conduct
    applicable to utility companies that are transmission providers,
    and (3) whether Southern Company’s code of conduct
    defining the Company as a “system company” rather than
    a “marketing affiliate” is just and reasonable. In
    connection with the formation of the Company, the FERC
    authorized the Company’s inclusion in the IIC in 2000.
    The FERC also previously approved Southern Company’s code
    of conduct.

On October 5, 2006, the FERC issued an order accepting a
    settlement resolving the proceeding subject to Southern
    Company’s agreement to accept certain modifications to the
    settlement’s terms. On October 20, 2006, Southern
    Company notified the FERC that it accepted the modifications.
    The modifications largely involve functional separation and
    information restrictions related to marketing activities
    conducted on behalf of the Company. Southern Company filed with
    the FERC on November 6, 2006 an implementation plan to
    comply with the modifications set forth in the order. The
    Company’s cost of the modifications is expected to be
    approximately $9 million per year.

Plant
    Franklin Unit 3 Construction Project

In May 2003, the Company entered into an agreement with Dynegy
    Inc. to resolve all outstanding matters related to capacity
    sales contracts with subsidiaries of Dynegy, Inc. As a result of
    the contract termination, the Company completed limited
    construction activities on Plant Franklin Unit 3 to preserve the
    long-term viability of the project. On May 6, 2006, the
    Company signed a PPA with Progress Ventures, Inc. for
    621 MW of capacity from Plant Franklin. To supply the
    annual capacity for this contract, the Company restarted
    construction of Plant Franklin Unit 3. The completion of this
    project is expected to be in late 2008 at an approximate cost of
    $338.8 million. As of December 31, 2006, the
    Company’s investment in Plant Franklin Unit 3 was
    $198.3 million.

4. JOINT
    OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS

Plant
    Stanton A

The Company is a 65 percent owner of Plant Stanton A, a
    combined-cycle project with 630 MW. The unit is co-owned by
    the OUC (28 percent), FMPA (3.5 percent), and
    Kissimmee Utility Authority (3.5 percent). The Company has
    a service agreement with SCS whereby SCS is responsible for the
    operations and maintenance of Plant Stanton A. As of
    December 31, 2006, $154.7 million was recorded in
    plant in service with associated accumulated depreciation of
    $13.1 million. The Company’s proportionate share of
    Plant Stanton A’s operating expense is included in the
    corresponding operating expenses in the statements of income.

IGCC

The Company is a 65 percent owner of the gasifier island
    portion of the ongoing IGCC project at OUC’s Stanton Energy
    Center site. OUC will own the remaining 35 percent of the
    gasifier and 100 percent of the combined cycle portion of
    the IGCC project. The Company is constructing the project for
    OUC at a fixed price. OUC will purchase the Company’s
    65 percent capacity in the gasification island for
    20 years after the date of commercial operation. In
    addition, the Company will manage the operations of the project
    after construction is completed using a joint staff of OUC and
    SCS employees.

A cooperative agreement with the U.S. Department of Energy
    (DOE) was signed in February 2006, which provides for up to
    $235 million in funding from the DOE to be applied by the
    joint owners for the construction and demonstration of the
    gasification portion of the project. The DOE will provide the
    funding in four phases throughout the development and
    demonstration of the gasifier. The total cost of the gasifier
    portion of the IGCC project is currently being reviewed and may
    be higher than earlier estimates due to increases in commodity
    costs and increased market demand for labor. The Company had
    spent $7.8 million as of December 31, 2006. The IGCC
    project, subject to National Environmental Policy Act review and
    state environmental reviews and certain regulatory approvals, is
    expected to begin commercial operation in 2010. The Company has
    the option to end its participation in the project at the end of
    the project definition phase which is expected to be during
    2007. The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

5. INCOME
    TAXES

Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return
    and combined tax returns for the State of Georgia, the State of
    Alabama, and the State of Mississippi. Under a joint
    consolidated income tax allocation agreement, each
    subsidiary’s current and deferred tax expense is computed
    on a stand-alone basis, and no subsidiary is allocated more
    expense than would be paid if they filed a separate income tax
    return. In accordance with Internal Revenue Service regulations,
    each company is jointly and severally liable for the tax
    liability.

Deferred tax liabilities are primarily the result of property
    related timing differences and derivative hedging instruments.
    The transfer of the Plant McIntosh construction project to GPC
    and Savannah Electric in 2004 resulted in a deferred gain for
    federal income tax purposes. Savannah Electric was merged in GPC
    as of July 1, 2006. GPC is reimbursing the Company for the
    related tax liability balance of $5.0 million. Of this
    total, $0.5 million is included in the balance sheets in
    “Receivables – Affiliated companies” and the
    remainder is included in “Deferred Charges and Other
    Assets: Other – Affiliated.”

Deferred tax assets consist primarily of timing differences
    related to the recognition of capacity revenues, and the tax
    impact related to the deferred loss on interest rate swaps
    reflected in other comprehensive income. The transfer of Plants
    Dahlberg, Wansley, and Franklin to the Company from GPC in 2001
    also resulted in a deferred gain for federal income tax
    purposes. The Company will reimburse GPC for the related tax
    asset of $9.9 million. Of this total, $1.3 million is
    included in the balance sheets in “Accounts
    payable – Affiliated” and the remainder is
    included in “Deferred Credits and Other Liabilities:
    Other – Affiliated.”

6. FINANCING

Senior
    Notes

The Company issued a total of $200 million unsecured
    30-year senior notes in 2006. The proceeds of the issuance were
    used to repay a portion of the Company’s short-term
    indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes, including
    the Company’s construction program.

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had
    $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, of senior
    notes outstanding.

Bank
    Credit Arrangements

The Company has a $400 million unsecured syndicated
    revolving credit facility (Facility) expiring in July 2011. The
    purpose of the Facility is to provide liquidity support to the
    Company’s commercial paper program and other general
    corporate purposes. At December 31, 2006, the entire
    $400 million was available.

The Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the unused
    balance of the Facility. This fee is less than


/


of 1 percent. For the period ended December 31, 2006,
    the Company incurred approximately $0.5 million in expense
    from commitment fees under the Facility. Under a previous credit
    facility, for the periods ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
    the Company incurred expenses of $0.8 million and
    $2.1 million, respectively, from commitment fees.

II-324


NOTES

(continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2006 Annual
    Report

The Facility contains a covenant that requires a maximum
    65 percent debt to capitalization ratio, as defined in the
    Facility. The Facility also contains a cross default provision
    that would be triggered if the Company defaulted on other
    indebtedness above a specified threshold. As of
    December 31, 2006, the Company was in compliance with all
    such covenants.

Dividend
    Restriction

The Facility also contains certain limitations on the payment of
    common stock dividends. No dividends may be paid unless, as of
    the end of any calendar quarter, the Company’s projected
    cash flows from fixed priced capacity PPAs (as defined in the
    agreement) are at least 80 percent of total projected cash
    flows for the next 12 months or the Company’s debt to
    capitalization ratio is no greater than 60 percent. At
    December 31, 2006, the Company was in compliance with these
    ratios and had no restrictions on its ability to pay dividends.

Commercial
    Paper

The Company has the ability to borrow under a commercial paper
    program. For the period ended December 31, 2006, the peak
    commercial paper balance outstanding was $380.3 million.
    The average amount outstanding was $166.3 million in 2006.
    The average annual interest rate was 5.3 percent in 2006.
    As of December 31, 2006, the commercial paper program had
    an outstanding balance of $123.8 million. The outstanding
    balance on December 31, 2005 was $110.7 million.

Financial
    Instruments

The Company enters into energy related derivatives to hedge
    exposures to electricity, gas, and other fuel price changes. The
    Company’s exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel
    prices and prices of electricity is limited because its
    long-term sales contracts shift substantially all fuel cost
    responsibility to the purchaser.

At December 31, 2006, the fair value gains/(losses) of
    derivative energy contracts was reflected in the financial
    statements as follows:

Amounts

(in thousands)

Net Income

Fair value gains or losses for cash flow hedges are recorded in
    other comprehensive income and reclassified to fuel expense.
    There were no material amounts reclassified during any year
    presented. For the year 2007, the reclassifications from other
    comprehensive income to fuel expense are also expected to be
    immaterial. There was no significant ineffectiveness recorded in
    earnings for any period presented. The Company has
    energy-related hedges in place through 2007. At
    December 31, 2006, there were approximately
    $9.9 million of deferred pre-tax realized net hedging gains
    relating to capitalized costs and revenues during the
    construction of specific plants. This will be reclassified from
    other comprehensive income to depreciation and amortization over
    the remaining life of the respective plants, which is
    approximately 31 years. For any year presented, the pre-tax
    gains reclassified from other comprehensive income to
    depreciation and amortization have been immaterial.

The Company may enter into derivatives to limit exposure to
    interest rate changes. The derivatives related to variable rate
    securities or forecasted transactions are accounted for as cash
    flow hedges. The derivatives employed as hedging instruments are
    structured to minimize ineffectiveness. As such, no material
    ineffectiveness has been recorded in earnings. In 2006, the
    Company terminated interest rate derivatives at a cost of
    $8.1 million at the same time as the related debt was
    issued. The hedge cost will be amortized over 10 years.

At December 31, 2006, the Company had no interest
    derivatives outstanding. The Company has deferred losses
    totaling $78.5 million in other comprehensive income that
    will be amortized to interest expense through 2016. For the
    years 2006, 2005, and 2004, approximately $12.0 million,
    $11.2 million, and $10.4 million, respectively, of
    pre-tax losses were reclassified from other comprehensive income
    to interest expense. During 2007, approximately
    $13.4 million of pre-tax losses are expected to be
    reclassified from other comprehensive income to interest expense.

7. COMMITMENTS

Construction
    Program

The Company currently estimates property additions to be
    $240.7 million, $481.9 million, and
    $844.4 million in 2007, 2008, and 2009, respectively. There
    are currently three plants actively under construction. See

Long-Term
    Service Agreements

The Company has entered into Long-Term Service Agreements
    (LTSAs) with General Electric (GE) for the purpose of securing
    maintenance support for its combined cycle and combustion
    turbine generating facilities with the exception of newly
    acquired Plants DeSoto and Rowan. In summary, the LTSAs provide
    that GE will perform all planned inspections on the covered
    equipment, which includes the cost of all labor and materials.
    GE is also obligated to cover the costs of unplanned maintenance
    on the covered equipment subject to a limit specified in each
    contract.

In general, except for Plants Dahlberg and Oleander, these LTSAs
    are in effect through two major inspection cycles per unit. The
    Dahlberg and Oleander agreements are in effect through the first
    hot gas path inspections and last combustion inspections,
    respectively, of each unit. Scheduled payments to GE are made at
    various intervals based on actual operating hours of the
    respective units. Total remaining payments to GE under these
    agreements are currently estimated at $1.1 billion over the
    remaining term of the agreements, which may range up to
    30 years per unit. However, the LTSAs contain various
    cancellation provisions at the Company’s option.

Payments made to GE prior to the performance of any planned
    inspections are recorded as a long-term prepayment in deferred
    charges and other assets on the balance sheets. Inspection costs
    are capitalized or charged to expense based on the nature of the
    work performed.

Fuel
    Commitments

SCS, as agent for the traditional operating companies and the
    Company, has entered into various fuel transportation and
    procurement agreements to supply a portion of the fuel
    (primarily natural gas) requirements for the operating
    facilities. In most cases, these contracts contain provisions
    for firm transportation costs, storage costs, minimum purchase
    levels, and other financial commitments.

Natural gas purchase commitments contain given volumes with
    prices based on various indices at the actual time of delivery.
    Amounts included in the chart below represent estimates based on
    the New York Mercantile Exchange future prices at
    December 31, 2006.

Additional commitments for fuel will be required to supply the

Acting as an agent for all of Southern Company’s
    traditional operating companies and the Company, SCS may enter
    into various types of wholesale energy and natural gas
    contracts. Under these agreements, each of the traditional
    operating companies and the Company may be jointly and severally
    liable. The creditworthiness of the Company is currently
    inferior to the creditworthiness of the traditional operating
    companies; therefore, Southern Company has entered into
    keep-well agreements with each of the traditional operating
    companies to ensure they will not subsidize nor be responsible
    for any costs, losses, liabilities or damages resulting from the
    inclusion of the Company as a contracting party under these
    agreements.
