PART I

Item 1.

BUSINESS

Southern Company was incorporated under the laws of Delaware on November 9, 1945. Southern Company owns all of the outstanding common stock of Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power, each of which is an operating public utility company. The traditional electric operating companies supply electric service in the states of Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi. More particular information relating to each of the traditional electric operating companies is as follows:

Alabama Power

is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Alabama on November 10, 1927, by the consolidation of a predecessor Alabama Power Company, Gulf Electric Company, and Houston Power Company. The predecessor Alabama Power Company had been in continuous existence since its incorporation in 1906.

Georgia Power

was incorporated under the laws of the State of Georgia on June 26, 1930.

Mississippi Power

was incorporated under the laws of the State of Mississippi on July 12, 1972 and effective December 21, 1972, by the merger into it of the predecessor Mississippi Power Company, succeeded to the business and properties of the latter company. The predecessor Mississippi Power Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Maine on November 24, 1924.

On January 1, 2019, Southern Company completed its sale of Gulf Power to NextEra Energy for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately $5.8 billion (less $1.3 billion of indebtedness assumed), subject to customary working capital adjustments. Gulf Power is an electric utility serving retail customers in the northwestern portion of Florida. See Note


to the financial statements under "

Southern Company's Sale of Gulf Power

" in Item 8 herein for additional information.

In addition, Southern Company owns all of the common stock of Southern Power Company, which is also an operating public utility company. The term "Southern Power" when used herein refers to Southern Power Company and its subsidiaries, while the term "Southern Power Company" when used herein refers only to the Southern Power parent company. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Power Company is a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware on January 8, 2001. On May 22, 2018, Southern Power sold a noncontrolling 33% equity interest in SP Solar, a limited partnership indirectly owning substantially all of Southern Power's solar facilities, for approximately $1.2 billion and, on December 11, 2018, Southern Power sold a noncontrolling tax equity interest in SP Wind, a holding company owning a portfolio of eight operating wind facilities, for approximately $1.2 billion. Southern Power also sold all of its equity interests in Plant Oleander and Plant Stanton Unit A (together, the Florida Plants) to NextEra Energy on December 4, 2018 for $203 million. On November 5, 2018, Southern Power entered into an agreement to sell all of its equity interests in Plant Mankato (including the 385-MW expansion currently under construction) for approximately $650 million. The transaction is subject to FERC and state commission approvals and is expected to close mid-2019. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See "The Southern Company System – Southern Power" herein and Note


to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for additional information.

Southern Company acquired all of the common stock of Southern Company Gas in July 2016. Southern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas in four states - Illinois, Georgia, Virginia, and Tennessee - through the natural gas distribution utilities. Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other businesses that are complementary to the distribution of natural gas. Southern Company Gas was incorporated under the laws of the State of Georgia on November 27, 1995 for the primary purpose of becoming the holding company for Atlanta Gas Light, which was founded in 1856. In July 2018, Southern Company Gas completed sales of three of its natural gas distribution utilities (Elizabethtown Gas, Florida City Gas, and Elkton Gas). In June 2018, Southern Company Gas also completed the sale of Pivotal Home Solutions, which provided home equipment protection products and services. See "The Southern Company System – Southern Company Gas" herein and Note

The Southern Company System

Traditional Electric Operating Companies

The traditional electric operating companies are vertically integrated utilities that own generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. See PROPERTIES in Item 2 herein for additional information on the traditional electric operating companies' generating facilities. Each company's transmission facilities are connected to the respective company's own generating plants and other sources of power (including certain generating plants owned by Southern Power) and are interconnected with the transmission facilities of the other traditional electric operating companies and SEGCO. For information on the State of Georgia's integrated transmission system, see "Territory Served by the Southern Company System – Traditional Electric Operating Companies and Southern Power" herein.

Agreements in effect with principal neighboring utility systems provide for capacity and energy transactions that may be entered into from time to time for reasons related to reliability or economics. Additionally, the traditional electric operating companies have entered into various reliability agreements with certain neighboring utilities, each of which provides for the establishment and periodic review of principles and procedures for planning and operation of generation and transmission facilities, maintenance schedules, load retention programs, emergency operations, and other matters affecting the reliability of bulk power supply. The traditional electric operating companies have joined with other utilities in the Southeast to form the SERC to augment further the reliability and adequacy of bulk power supply. Through the SERC, the traditional electric operating companies are represented on the North American Electric Reliability Council.

The utility assets of the traditional electric operating companies and certain utility assets of Southern Power Company are operated as a single integrated electric system, or power pool, pursuant to the IIC. Activities under the IIC are administered by SCS, which acts as agent for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company. The fundamental purpose of the power pool is to provide for the coordinated operation of the electric facilities in an effort to achieve the maximum possible economies consistent with the highest practicable reliability of service. Subject to service requirements and other operating limitations, system resources are committed and controlled through the application of centralized economic dispatch. Under the IIC, each traditional electric operating company and Southern Power Company retains its lowest cost energy resources for the benefit of its own customers and delivers any excess energy to the power pool for use in serving customers of other traditional electric operating companies or Southern Power Company or for sale by the power pool to third parties. The IIC provides for the recovery of specified costs associated with the affiliated operations thereunder, as well as the proportionate sharing of costs and revenues resulting from power pool transactions with third parties. In connection with the sale of Gulf Power, an appendix was added to the IIC setting forth terms and conditions governing Gulf Power's continued participation in the IIC for a defined transition period that, subject to certain potential adjustments, is scheduled to end on January 1, 2024.

Southern Power and Southern Linc have secured from the traditional electric operating companies certain services which are furnished in compliance with FERC regulations.

Alabama Power and Georgia Power each have agreements with Southern Nuclear to operate the Southern Company system's existing nuclear plants, Plants Farley, Hatch, and Vogtle. In addition, Georgia Power has an agreement with Southern Nuclear to develop, license, construct, and operate Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See "Regulation – Nuclear Regulation" herein for additional information.

Southern Power

Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy facilities, and sells electricity at market-based rates (under authority from the FERC) in the wholesale market. Southern Power continually seeks opportunities to execute its strategy to create value through various transactions including acquisitions, dispositions, and sales of partnership interests, development and construction of new generating facilities, and entry into PPAs primarily with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. Southern Power's business activities are not subject to traditional state regulation like the traditional electric operating companies, but the majority of its business activities are subject to regulation by the FERC. Southern Power has attempted to insulate itself from significant fuel supply, fuel transportation, and electric transmission risks by generally making such risks the responsibility of the counterparties to its PPAs. However, Southern Power's future earnings will depend on the parameters of the wholesale market and the efficient operation of its wholesale generating assets, as well as Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy and to develop and construct generating facilities. For additional information on Southern Power's business activities, see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – OVERVIEW – "Business Activities" of Southern Power in Item 7 herein.

Southern Power Company directly owns and manages generation assets primarily in the Southeast, which are included in the power pool, and has various subsidiaries, which were created to own and operate natural gas and renewable generation facilities either wholly or in partnership with various third parties. At

December 31, 2018

, Southern Power's generation fleet, which is owned in part with its various partners, totaled

11,888

MWs of nameplate capacity in commercial operation (including

4,508

MWs of nameplate capacity owned by its subsidiaries and including Plant Mankato, which is classified as held for sale in the financial statements). In addition, Southern Power Company has other subsidiaries that are pursuing additional natural gas generation and other renewable generation development opportunities. The generation assets of Southern Power Company's subsidiaries are not included in the power pool.

On May 22, 2018, Southern Power sold a noncontrolling 33% equity interest in SP Solar, a limited partnership indirectly owning substantially all of Southern Power's solar facilities. On December 11, 2018, Southern Power sold a noncontrolling tax equity interest in SP Wind, a holding company which owns a portfolio of eight operating wind farms.

In addition, on December 4, 2018, Southern Power sold all of its equity interests in the Florida Plants and, in November 2018, entered into an agreement to sell Plant Mankato. The completion of the disposition of Plant Mankato is subject to the expansion unit reaching commercial operation as well as various other customary conditions to closing, including FERC and state commission approvals, and is expected to close mid-2019. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

A majority of Southern Power's partnerships in renewable facilities allow for the sharing of cash distributions and tax benefits at differing percentages, with Southern Power being the controlling member and thus consolidating the assets and operations of the partnerships. At December 31, 2018, Southern Power has three tax-equity partnership arrangements where the tax-equity investors receive substantially all of the tax benefits, including ITCs and PTCs. In addition, Southern Power holds controlling interests in eight partnerships in solar facilities through SP Solar. For seven of these solar partnerships, Southern Power and its new 33% partner, Global Atlantic, are entitled to 51% of all cash distributions and the respective partner that holds the Class B membership interests is entitled to 49% of all cash distributions. For the Desert Stateline partnership, Southern Power and Global Atlantic are entitled to 66% of all cash distributions and the Class B member is entitled to 34% of all cash distributions. In addition, Southern Power and Global Atlantic are entitled to substantially all of the federal tax benefits with respect to these eight partnership entities. Finally, for the Roserock partnership, Southern Power is entitled to 51% of all cash distributions and substantially all of the federal tax benefits, with the Class B member entitled to 49% of all cash distributions.

See PROPERTIES in Item 2 herein and Note


to the financial statements under "Southern Power" in Item 8 herein for additional information regarding Southern Power's acquisitions, dispositions, construction, and development projects.

Southern Power calculates an investment coverage ratio for its generating assets based on the ratio of investment under contract to total investment using the respective generation facilities' net book value (or expected in-service value for facilities under construction or being acquired) as the investment amount. With the inclusion of investments associated with the wind and natural gas facilities currently under construction, as well as other capacity and energy contracts, Southern Power has an average investment coverage ratio, at December 31, 2018, of


% through 2023 and


% through 2028, with an average remaining contract duration of approximately


years (including Plant Mankato, which is classified as held for sale in the financial statements).

Southern Power's natural gas and biomass sales are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated plant unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serves

I-3


Index to Financial Statements

the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable. Capacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year and to provide a return on investment.

Southern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are predominantly through long-term PPAs; however, these solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors.

Southern Company Gas

Southern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas through the natural gas distribution utilities. Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other businesses that are complementary to the distribution of natural gas, including gas pipeline investments, wholesale gas services, and gas marketing services.

During the fourth quarter 2018, Southern Company Gas changed its reportable segments to further align with the way its new Chief Operating Decision Maker reviews operating results and has reclassified prior years' data to conform to the new reportable segment presentation. This change resulted in a new reportable segment, gas pipeline investments, which was formerly included in gas midstream operations. Gas pipeline investments consists primarily of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including a 50% interest in SNG, two significant pipeline construction projects, and a 50% joint ownership interest in the Dalton Pipeline. Gas distribution operations, wholesale gas services, and gas marketing services continue to remain as separate reportable segments and reflect the impact of the Southern Company Gas Dispositions. The all other non-reportable segment includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure, including the storage and fuels operations that were formerly included in gas midstream operations, and other subsidiaries that fall below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure.

Gas distribution operations, the largest segment of Southern Company Gas' business, operates, constructs, and maintains approximately

75,200

miles of natural gas pipelines and 14 storage facilities, with total capacity of 158 Bcf, to provide natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers. Gas distribution operations serves approximately 4.2 million customers across four states.

On July 1, 2018, a Southern Company Gas subsidiary, Pivotal Utility Holdings, completed the sales of the assets of two of its natural gas distribution utilities, Elizabethtown Gas and Elkton Gas, to South Jersey Industries, Inc. On July 29, 2018, Southern Company Gas and its wholly-owned direct subsidiary, NUI Corporation, completed the stock sale of Pivotal Utility Holdings, which then primarily consisted of Florida City Gas, to NextEra Energy. The transactions raised approximately $2.3 billion in proceeds. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" in Item 8 herein for additional information.

Gas pipeline investments includes joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments that enable the provision of diverse sources of natural gas supplies to the customers of Southern Company Gas. SNG, the largest natural gas pipeline investment, is the owner of a 7,000-mile pipeline connecting natural gas supply basins in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama to markets in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee.

Wholesale gas services consists of Sequent and engages in natural gas storage and gas pipeline arbitrage and provides natural gas asset management and related logistical services to most of the natural gas distribution utilities as well as non-affiliate companies.

Gas marketing services is comprised of SouthStar and provides natural gas commodity and related services to customers in competitive markets or markets that provide for customer choice. SouthStar, serving approximately 697,000 natural gas commodity customers, markets gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers and offers energy-related products that provide natural gas price stability and utility bill management.

On June 4, 2018, Southern Company Gas completed the stock sale of Pivotal Home Solutions to American Water Enterprises LLC for $365 million. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" in Item 8 herein for additional information.

Other Businesses

Construction Programs

The subsidiary companies of Southern Company are engaged in continuous construction programs to accommodate existing and estimated future loads on their respective systems. For estimated construction and environmental expenditures for the periods


through


, see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations" of each registrant in Item 7 herein. The Southern Company system's construction program consists of capital investment and capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. In


, the construction program is expected to be apportioned approximately as follows:

(a)

Totals may not add due to rounding.

(b)

Includes the Subsidiary Registrants, as well as the other subsidiaries. See "Other Businesses" herein for additional information.

(c)

Reflects cost estimates for environmental regulations. These estimated expenditures do not include any potential compliance costs associated with pending regulation of CO


emissions from fossil-fuel-fired electric generating units or costs associated with ash pond closure and groundwater monitoring under the CCR Rule and the related state rules. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and Regulations" and FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations" of Southern Company and each traditional electric operating company in Item 7 herein for additional information.

(d)

Excludes up to approximately $0.5 billion for planned expenditures for plant acquisitions and placeholder growth, which may vary materially due to market opportunities and Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy.

(e)

Fuel Supply

Electric

The traditional electric operating companies' and SEGCO's supply of electricity is primarily fueled by natural gas and coal. Southern Power's supply of electricity is primarily fueled by natural gas. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – RESULTS OF OPERATION – "Electricity Business – Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses" of Southern Company and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – RESULTS OF OPERATION – "Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses" of each traditional electric operating company in Item 7 herein for information regarding the electricity generated and the average cost of fuel in cents per net KWH generated for the years


through


.

The traditional electric operating companies have agreements in place from which they expect to receive substantially all of their


coal burn requirements. These agreements have terms ranging between one and four years. In


, the weighted average sulfur content of all coal burned by the traditional electric operating companies was 1.06%. This sulfur level, along with banked SO


allowances, allowed the traditional electric operating companies to remain within limits set by Phase I of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) under the Clean Air Act. In


, the Southern Company system did not purchase any SO


allowances, annual NOx emission allowances, or seasonal NOx emission allowances from the market. As any additional environmental regulations are proposed that impact the utilization of coal, the traditional electric operating companies' fuel mix will be monitored to help ensure that the traditional electric operating companies remain in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies will continue to evaluate the need to purchase additional emissions allowances, the timing of capital expenditures for emissions control equipment, and potential unit retirements and replacements. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Environmental Matters" of Southern Company, each traditional electric operating company, and Southern Power in Item 7 herein for additional information on environmental matters.

SCS, acting on behalf of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company, has agreements in place for the natural gas burn requirements of the Southern Company system. For


, SCS has contracted for 557 Bcf of natural gas supply under agreements with remaining terms up to 15 years. In addition to natural gas supply, SCS has contracts in place for both firm natural gas transportation and storage. Management believes these contracts provide sufficient natural gas supplies, transportation, and storage to ensure normal operations of the Southern Company system's natural gas generating units.

Alabama Power and Georgia Power have multiple contracts covering their nuclear fuel needs for uranium, conversion services, enrichment services, and fuel fabrication. The uranium, conversion services, and fuel fabrication contracts have remaining

I-9


Index to Financial Statements

terms ranging from one to 17 years. The remaining term lengths for the enrichment services contracts range from five to 10 years. Management believes suppliers have sufficient nuclear fuel production capability to permit the normal operation of the Southern Company system's nuclear generating units.

Changes in fuel prices to the traditional electric operating companies are generally reflected in fuel adjustment clauses contained in rate schedules. See "Rate Matters – Rate Structure and Cost Recovery Plans" herein for additional information. Southern Power's natural gas and biomass PPAs generally provide that the counterparty is responsible for substantially all of the cost of fuel.

Alabama Power and Georgia Power have contracts with the United States, acting through the DOE, that provide for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin disposing of spent fuel in 1998, as required by the contracts, and Alabama Power and Georgia Power have pursued and are pursuing legal remedies against the government for breach of contract. See Note


to the financial statements under "

Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs

" in Item 8 herein for additional information.

Natural Gas

Advances in natural gas drilling in shale producing regions of the United States have resulted in historically high supplies of natural gas and relatively low prices for natural gas. Procurement plans for natural gas supply and transportation to serve regulated utility customers are reviewed and approved by the regulatory agencies in the states where Southern Company Gas operates. Southern Company Gas purchases natural gas supplies in the open market by contracting with producers and marketers and, for the natural gas distribution utilities except Nicor Gas, from its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sequent, under asset management agreements approved by the applicable state regulatory agency. Southern Company Gas also contracts for transportation and storage services from interstate pipelines that are regulated by the FERC. When firm pipeline services are temporarily not needed, Southern Company Gas may release the services in the secondary market under FERC-approved capacity release provisions or utilize asset management arrangements, thereby reducing the net cost of natural gas charged to customers for most of the natural gas distribution utilities. Peak-use requirements are met through utilization of company-owned storage facilities, pipeline transportation capacity, purchased storage services, peaking facilities, and other supply sources, arranged by either transportation customers or Southern Company Gas.

As of

December 31, 2018

,


municipally-owned electric distribution systems and

one

county-owned system received their requirements through MEAG Power, which was established by a Georgia state statute in 1975. MEAG Power serves these requirements from self-owned generation facilities, some of which are jointly-owned with Georgia Power, and purchases from other resources. MEAG Power also has a pseudo scheduling and services agreement with Georgia Power. Dalton serves its requirements from self-owned generation facilities, some of which are jointly-owned with Georgia Power, and through purchases from Southern Power through a service agreement. See PROPERTIES – "Jointly-Owned Facilities" in Item 2 herein and Note

For information relating to the sources of revenue for Southern Company Gas, see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – RESULTS OF OPERATIONS and – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL of Southern Company Gas in Item 7 herein.

Competition

Electric

The electric utility industry in the U.S. is continuing to evolve as a result of regulatory and competitive factors. Among the early primary agents of change was the Energy Policy Act of 1992, which allowed IPPs to access a utility's transmission network in order to sell electricity to other utilities.

The competition for retail energy sales among competing suppliers of energy is influenced by various factors, including price, availability, technological advancements, service, and reliability. These factors are, in turn, affected by, among other influences, regulatory, political, and environmental considerations, taxation, and supply.

The retail service rights of all electric suppliers in the State of Georgia are regulated by the Territorial Electric Service Act of 1973. Pursuant to the provisions of this Act, all areas within existing municipal limits were assigned to the primary electric supplier therein. Areas outside of such municipal limits were either to be assigned or to be declared open for customer choice of supplier by action of the Georgia PSC pursuant to standards set forth in this Act. Consistent with such standards, the Georgia PSC has assigned substantially all of the land area in the state to a supplier. Notwithstanding such assignments, this Act provides that any new customer locating outside of 1973 municipal limits and having a connected load of at least 900 KWs may exercise a one-time choice for the life of the premises to receive electric service from the supplier of its choice.

Pursuant to the 1956 Utility Act, the Mississippi PSC issued "Grandfather Certificates" of public convenience and necessity to Mississippi Power and to six distribution rural cooperatives operating in southeastern Mississippi, then served in whole or in part by Mississippi Power, authorizing them to distribute electricity in certain specified geographically described areas of the state. The six cooperatives serve approximately

325,000

retail customers in a certificated area of approximately

10,300

square miles. In areas included in a "Grandfather Certificate," the utility holding such certificate may extend or maintain its electric system subject to certain regulatory approvals; extensions of facilities by such utility, or extensions of facilities into that area by other utilities, may not be made except upon a showing of, and a grant of a certificate of, public convenience and necessity. Areas included in a CPCN that are subsequently annexed to municipalities may continue to be served by the holder of the CPCN, irrespective of whether it has a franchise in the annexing municipality. On the other hand, the holder of the municipal franchise may not extend service into such newly annexed area without authorization by the Mississippi PSC.

Generally, the traditional electric operating companies have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, competition in their respective retail service territories in varying degrees from the development and deployment of alternative energy sources such as self-generation (as described below) and distributed generation technologies, as well as other factors.

Southern Power competes with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, and others for wholesale energy sales across various U.S. utility markets. The needs of these markets are driven by the demands of end users and the generation available. Southern Power's success in wholesale energy sales is influenced by various factors including reliability and availability of Southern Power's plants, availability of transmission to serve the demand, price, and Southern Power's ability to contain costs.

Natural Gas

Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities do not compete with other distributors of natural gas in their exclusive franchise territories but face competition from other energy products. Their principal competitors are electric utilities and fuel oil and propane providers serving the residential, commercial, and industrial markets in their service areas for customers who are considering switching to or from a natural gas appliance.

Competition for heating as well as general household and small commercial energy needs generally occurs at the initial installation phase when the customer or builder makes decisions as to which types of equipment to install. Customers generally use the chosen energy source for the life of the equipment.

Customer demand for natural gas could be affected by numerous factors, including:

•

changes in the availability or price of natural gas and other forms of energy;

•

general economic conditions;

•

energy conservation, including state-supported energy efficiency programs;

•

legislation and regulations;

•

the cost and capability to convert from natural gas to alternative energy products; and

•

technological changes resulting in displacement or replacement of natural gas appliances.

The natural gas-related programs generally emphasize natural gas as the fuel of choice for customers and seek to expand the use of natural gas through a variety of promotional activities. In addition, Southern Company Gas partners with third-party entities to market the benefits of natural gas appliances.

The availability and affordability of natural gas have provided cost advantages and further opportunity for growth of the businesses.

Seasonality

The demand for electric power and natural gas supply is affected by seasonal differences in the weather. While the electric power sales of some of the traditional electric operating companies peak in the summer, others peak in the winter. In the aggregate, electric power sales peak during the summer with a smaller peak during the winter. In most of the areas Southern Company Gas serves, natural gas demand peaks during the winter. As a result, the overall operating results of Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. In addition, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas have historically sold less power and natural gas when weather conditions are milder.

Regulation

States

The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are subject to the jurisdiction of their respective state PSCs or applicable state regulatory agencies. These regulatory bodies have broad powers of supervision and regulation over public utilities operating in the respective states, including their rates, service regulations, sales of securities (except for the Mississippi PSC), and, in the cases of the Georgia PSC and the Mississippi PSC, in part, retail service territories. See "Territory Served by the Southern Company System" and "Rate Matters" herein for additional information.

I-13


Index to Financial Statements

Federal Power Act

The traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power Company and certain of its generation subsidiaries, and SEGCO are all public utilities engaged in wholesale sales of energy in interstate commerce and, therefore, are subject to the rate, financial, and accounting jurisdiction of the FERC under the Federal Power Act. The FERC must approve certain financings and allows an "at cost standard" for services rendered by system service companies such as SCS and Southern Nuclear. The FERC is also authorized to establish regional reliability organizations which enforce reliability standards, address impediments to the construction of transmission, and prohibit manipulative energy trading practices.

Alabama Power and Georgia Power are also subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act or the earlier Federal Water Power Act applicable to licensees with respect to their hydroelectric developments. As of

December 31, 2018

, among the hydroelectric projects subject to licensing by the FERC are


existing Alabama Power generating stations having an aggregate installed capacity of

1,670,000

KWs and


existing Georgia Power generating stations and

one

generating station partially owned by Georgia Power, with a combined aggregate installed capacity of

1,101,402

KWs.

In 2013, the FERC issued a new 30-year license to Alabama Power for Alabama Power's seven hydroelectric developments on the Coosa River (Weiss, Henry, Logan Martin, Lay, Mitchell, Jordan, and Bouldin). Alabama Power filed a petition requesting rehearing of the FERC order granting the relicense seeking revisions to several conditions of the license. Alabama Rivers Alliance, American Rivers, the Georgia Environmental Protection Division, and the Atlanta Regional Commission also filed petitions for rehearing of the FERC order. In 2016, the FERC issued an order granting in part and denying in part Alabama Power's rehearing request. The order also denied all of the other rehearing requests. Also in 2016, Alabama Rivers Alliance and American Rivers filed a second rehearing request and also filed a petition with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for review of the license and the rehearing denial order. The FERC issued an order in 2016 denying the second rehearing request, and American Rivers and Alabama Rivers Alliance subsequently filed an appeal of that order at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit consolidated the two appeals into one proceeding and, on July 6, 2018, vacated the FERC's 2013 order for the new 30-year license and remanded the proceeding to the FERC. Alabama Power continues to operate the Coosa River developments under annual licenses issued by the FERC. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

In


, Alabama Power continued the process of developing an application to relicense the Harris Dam project on the Tallapoosa River, which is expected to be filed with the FERC by November 30, 2021. The current Harris Dam project license will expire on November 30, 2023.

On May 31,


, Georgia Power filed an application to relicense the Wallace Dam project on the Oconee River. The current Wallace Dam project license will expire on June 1, 2020. On July 3, 2018, Georgia Power filed a Notice of Intent to relicense the Lloyd Shoals project on the Ocmulgee River. The application to relicense the Lloyd Shoals project is expected to be filed with the FERC by December 31, 2021. The current Lloyd Shoals project license will expire on December 31, 2023. On December 18, 2018, Georgia Power filed applications to surrender the Langdale and Riverview hydroelectric projects on the Chattahoochee River upon their license expirations on December 31, 2023. Both projects together represent 1,520 KWs of Georgia Power's hydro fleet capacity.

Georgia Power and OPC also have a license, expiring in 2027, for the Rocky Mountain project, a pure pumped storage facility of

903,000

KW installed capacity. See PROPERTIES – "Jointly-Owned Facilities" in Item 2 herein for additional information.

Licenses for all projects, excluding those discussed above, expire in the years 2034-2066 in the case of Alabama Power's projects and in the years 2035-2044 in the case of Georgia Power's projects.

Upon or after the expiration of each license, the U.S. Government, by act of Congress, may take over the project or the FERC may relicense the project either to the original licensee or to a new licensee. In the event of takeover or relicensing to another, the original licensee is to be compensated in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Power Act, such compensation to reflect the net investment of the licensee in the project, not in excess of the fair value of the property, plus reasonable damages to other property of the licensee resulting from the severance therefrom of the property. The FERC may grant relicenses subject to certain requirements that could result in additional costs.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Nuclear Regulation

Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Southern Nuclear are subject to regulation by the NRC. The NRC is responsible for licensing and regulating nuclear facilities and materials and for conducting research in support of the licensing and regulatory process, as mandated by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended; the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended; and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 1978, as amended; and in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and other applicable statutes. These responsibilities also include protecting public health and safety, protecting the

I-14

Environmental Laws and Regulations

The Southern Company system's operations are regulated by state and federal environmental agencies through a variety of laws and regulations governing air, water, land, and protection of other natural resources. Compliance with these existing environmental requirements involves significant capital and operating costs, a major portion of which is expected to be recovered through existing ratemaking provisions or through market-based contracts. There is no assurance, however, that all such costs will be recovered.

For Southern Company Gas, substantially all of these costs are related to former MGP sites, which are generally recovered through existing ratemaking provisions. See Note


to the financial statements under "Environmental Matters" in Item 8 herein for additional information.

Compliance with environmental laws and resulting regulations, including, but not limited to, proposed and existing regulations related to air quality, water quality, CCR, and global climate issues, has been, and will continue to be, a significant focus for each of the registrants and SEGCO. Compliance with any new or revised environmental laws and regulations could affect many areas of the traditional electric operating companies', Southern Power's, SEGCO's, and Southern Company Gas' operations. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Environmental Matters" of each of the registrants in Item 7 herein for additional information about environmental issues.

The Southern Company system's ultimate environmental compliance strategy and future environmental expenditures will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements, the availability and cost of any deployed control technology, fuel prices, and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges. Compliance costs may result from the installation of additional environmental controls, closure and monitoring of CCR facilities, unit retirements, or changing fuel sources for certain existing units, as well as related upgrades to the transmission and distribution (electric and natural gas) systems. Environmental compliance spending over the next several years may differ materially from the amounts estimated. Such expenditures could affect results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition if such costs are not recovered on a timely basis through regulated rates for the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities or through long-term wholesale agreements for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power. Further, higher costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for energy, which could negatively affect results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. Additionally, many commercial and industrial customers may also be affected by existing and future environmental requirements, which for some may have the potential to ultimately affect their demand for electricity and natural gas. See "Construction Program" herein and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Environmental Matters" of each of the registrants in Item 7 herein for additional information. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Electric

The rates and service regulations of the traditional electric operating companies are uniform for each class of service throughout their respective retail service territories. Rates for residential electric service are generally of the block type based upon KWHs used and include minimum charges. Residential and other rates contain separate customer charges. Rates for commercial service are presently of the block type and, for large customers, the billing demand is generally used to determine capacity and minimum bill charges. These large customers' rates are generally based upon usage by the customer and include rates with special features to encourage off-peak usage. Additionally, Alabama Power and Mississippi Power are generally allowed by

I-15


Index to Financial Statements

their respective state PSCs to negotiate the terms and cost of service to large customers. Such terms and cost of service, however, are subject to final state PSC approval.

The traditional electric operating companies recover certain costs through a variety of forward-looking, cost-based rate mechanisms. Fuel and net purchased energy costs are recovered through specific fuel cost recovery provisions. These fuel cost recovery provisions are adjusted to reflect increases or decreases in such costs as needed or on schedules as required by the respective PSCs. Approved compliance, storm damage, and certain other costs are recovered at Alabama Power and Mississippi Power through specific cost recovery mechanisms approved by their respective PSCs. Certain similar costs at Georgia Power are recovered through various base rate tariffs as approved by the Georgia PSC. Costs not recovered through specific cost recovery mechanisms are recovered at Alabama Power and Mississippi Power through annual, formulaic cost recovery proceedings and at Georgia Power through periodic base rate proceedings.

The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company and certain of its generation subsidiaries are authorized by the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates, including short-term opportunity sales, at market-based prices. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a market-based contract with an affiliate.

Mississippi Power serves long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and a municipality located in southeastern Mississippi under cost-based electric tariffs which are subject to regulation by the FERC. The contracts with these wholesale customers represented

17.3%

of Mississippi Power's total operating revenues in


and are generally subject to 10-year rolling cancellation notices. Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any changes in contractual relationships for one customer are likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers.

Natural Gas

Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities are subject to regulation and oversight by their respective state regulatory agencies. Rates charged to these customers vary according to customer class (residential, commercial, or industrial) and rate jurisdiction. These agencies approve rates designed to provide each natural gas distribution utility the opportunity to generate revenues to recover all prudently-incurred costs, including a return on rate base sufficient to pay interest on debt, and provide a reasonable return.

With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, which operates in a deregulated environment in which Marketers rather than a traditional utility sell natural gas to end-use customers and earns revenue by charging rates to its customers based primarily on monthly fixed charges that are set by the Georgia PSC, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are largely a function of weather conditions and price levels for natural gas.

The natural gas distribution utilities, excluding Atlanta Gas Light, are authorized to use natural gas cost recovery mechanisms that adjust rates to reflect changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas and ensure recovery of all costs prudently incurred in purchasing natural gas for customers. In addition to natural gas cost recovery mechanisms, the natural gas distribution utilities have other cost recovery mechanisms, such as regulatory riders, which vary by utility but allow recovery of certain costs, such as those related to infrastructure replacement programs as well as environmental remediation and energy efficiency plans.

See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Regulatory Matters – Utility Regulation and Rate Design" of Southern Company Gas in Item 7 herein and Note

Integrated Resource Planning

Each of the traditional electric operating companies continually evaluates its electric generating resources in order to ensure that it maintains a cost-effective and reliable mix of resources to meet the existing and future demand requirements of its customers. See "Environmental Laws and Regulations" above for a discussion of existing and potential environmental regulations that may impact the future generating resource needs of the traditional electric operating companies.

Alabama Power

Triennially, Alabama Power provides an IRP report to the Alabama PSC. This report overviews Alabama Power's resource planning process and contains information that serves as the foundation for certain decisions affecting Alabama Power's portfolio of supply-side and demand-side resources. The IRP report facilitates Alabama Power's ability to provide reliable and cost-effective electric service to customers, while accounting for the risks and uncertainties inherent in planning for resources sufficient to meet expected customer demand. Under State of Alabama law, a CPCN must be obtained from the Alabama PSC before Alabama Power constructs any new generating facility, unless such construction is deemed an ordinary extension in the usual course of business.

Georgia Power

Triennially, Georgia Power must file an IRP with the Georgia PSC that specifies how it intends to meet the future electric service needs of its customers through a combination of demand-side and supply-side resources. The Georgia PSC, under state law, must certify any new demand-side or supply-side resources for Georgia Power to receive cost recovery. Once certified, the lesser of actual or certified construction costs and purchased power costs is recoverable through rates. Certified costs may be excluded from recovery only on the basis of fraud, concealment, failure to disclose a material fact, imprudence, or criminal misconduct. See Note


to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Rate Plans," " – Integrated Resource Plan," and " –

Nuclear Construction

" in Item 8 herein for additional information.

Mississippi Power

On February 6, 2018, the Mississippi PSC approved a settlement agreement related to cost recovery for the Kemper County energy facility, pursuant to which Mississippi Power filed a Reserve Margin Plan (RMP) on August 6, 2018. The RMP includes many of the same aspects of a traditional IRP, but the RMP also contains alternatives proposed by Mississippi Power to address its existing reserve capacity, which is greater than the level required to meet Mississippi Power's projected summer peak demand. Mississippi Power developed the alternatives by evaluating the economics of each unit in Mississippi Power's fleet, the opportunities currently available in the wholesale market, and the operational constraints of the Southern Company system. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. For additional information, see Note


to the financial statements under "Kemper County Energy Facility" in Item 8 herein.

Employee Relations

The Southern Company system had a total of

29,192

employees on its payroll at January 1, 2019.

The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities have separate agreements with local unions of the IBEW and the Utilities Workers Union of America generally covering wages, working conditions, and procedures for handling grievances and arbitration. These agreements apply with certain exceptions to operating, maintenance, and construction employees.

I-17

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS

In addition to the other information in this Form 10-K, including

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL in Item 7 of

each registrant, and other documents filed by Southern Company and/or its

subsidiaries with the SEC from time to time, the following factors should be

carefully considered in evaluating Southern Company and its subsidiaries. Such

factors could affect actual results and cause results to differ materially from

those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, Southern

Company and/or its subsidiaries.

UTILITY REGULATORY, LEGISLATIVE, AND LITIGATION RISKS

Southern Company and its subsidiaries are subject to substantial state and federal governmental

regulation. Compliance with current and future regulatory requirements and

procurement of necessary approvals, permits, and certificates may result in

substantial costs to Southern Company and its subsidiaries.

Southern Company and its subsidiaries are subject to substantial regulation from federal, state, and local regulatory agencies and are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations and to obtain numerous permits, approvals, and certificates from governmental agencies. The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities seek to recover their costs (including a reasonable return on invested capital) through their retail rates, which must be approved by the applicable state PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency. A state PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency, in a future rate proceeding, may alter the timing or amount of certain costs for which recovery is allowed or modify the current authorized rate of return. Rate refunds may also be required. Additionally, the rates charged to wholesale customers by the traditional electric operating companies and by Southern Power and the rates charged to natural gas transportation customers by Southern Company Gas' pipeline investments and for some of its storage assets must be approved by the FERC. These wholesale rates could be affected by changes to Southern Power's and the traditional electric operating companies' ability to conduct business pursuant to FERC market-based rate authority. Retaining this authority from the FERC is important to the traditional electric operating companies' and Southern Power's ability to remain competitive in the wholesale electric markets.

The impact of any future revision or changes in interpretations of existing regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations applicable to Southern Company or any of its subsidiaries is uncertain. Changes in regulation or the imposition of additional regulations could influence the operating environment of Southern Company and its subsidiaries and may result in substantial costs or otherwise negatively affect their results of operations.

The Southern Company system's costs of compliance with environmental laws and satisfying related AROs are significant. The costs of compliance with current and future environmental laws and related AROs and the incurrence of environmental liabilities could negatively impact the net income, cash flows, and financial condition of the registrants.

The Southern Company system's operations are subject to extensive regulation by state and federal environmental agencies through a variety of laws and regulations. Compliance with existing environmental requirements involves significant capital and operating costs including the settlement of AROs, a major portion of which is expected to be recovered through existing ratemaking provisions or through market-based contracts. There is no assurance, however, that all such costs will be recovered. The registrants expect future compliance expenditures will continue to be significant.

The EPA has adopted and is implementing regulations governing air and water quality under the Clean Air Act and regulations governing cooling water intake structures and effluent guidelines for steam electric generating plants under the Clean Water Act. The EPA has also adopted regulations governing the disposal of CCR, including coal ash and gypsum, in landfills and surface impoundments at active generating power plants. The cost estimates for AROs related to the disposal of CCR are based on information using various assumptions related to closure and post-closure costs, timing of future cash outlays, inflation and discount rates, and the potential methods for complying with the CCR Rule. The traditional electric operating companies will continue to periodically update their ARO cost estimates.

Additionally, environmental laws and regulations covering the handling and disposal of waste and release of hazardous substances could require the Southern Company system to incur substantial costs to clean up affected sites, including certain current and former operating sites, and locations affected by historical operations or subject to contractual obligations.

Existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised or new environmental laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to the Southern Company system. In addition, existing environmental laws and regulations may be impacted by related legal challenges.

Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements has occurred throughout the U.S. This litigation has included claims for damages alleged to have been caused by CO


and other emissions, CCR, releases of regulated substances, and alleged exposure to regulated substances, and/or requests for injunctive relief in connection with such matters.

I-19


Index to Financial Statements

Compliance with any new or revised environmental laws or regulations could affect many areas of the Southern Company system's operations. The Southern Company system's ultimate environmental compliance strategy and future environmental expenditures will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements, the availability and cost of any deployed control technology, and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges. Compliance costs may result from the installation of additional environmental controls, closure and monitoring of CCR facilities, unit retirements, or changing fuel sources for certain existing units, as well as related upgrades to the Southern Company system's transmission and distribution (electric and natural gas) systems. Environmental compliance spending over the next several years may differ materially from the amounts estimated. Such expenditures could affect results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition if such costs are not recovered on a timely basis through regulated rates for the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities or through long-term wholesale agreements for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power. Further, higher costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for energy, which could negatively affect results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. Additionally, many commercial and industrial customers may also be affected by existing and future environmental requirements, which for some may have the potential to ultimately affect their demand for electricity or natural gas.

The Southern Company system may be exposed to regulatory and financial risks related to the impact of GHG legislation, regulation, and emission reduction goals.

The EPA has published rules limiting CO


emissions from new, modified, and reconstructed fossil fuel-fired electric generating units and guidelines for states to develop plans to meet EPA-mandated CO


emission performance standards for existing units (known as the Clean Power Plan or CPP). On August 31, 2018, the EPA published a proposed rule known as the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule, which is intended to replace a regulation enacted in 2015 known as the Clean Power Plan (CPP), that would limit CO


emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. The CPP has been stayed by the U.S. Supreme Court since 2016. The ACE Rule would require states to develop GHG unit-specific emission rate standards based on heat-rate efficiency improvements for existing fossil fuel-fired steam units. As proposed, combustion turbines, including natural gas combined cycles, are not affected sources. As of January 1, 2019, the Southern Company system has ownership interests in 40 fossil fuel-fired steam units to which the proposed ACE Rule is applicable. The ultimate impact of this rule to the Southern Company system is currently unknown and will depend on changes between the proposal and the final rule, subsequent state plan developments and requirements, and any associated legal challenges.

The EPA also has proposed a review of final rules adopted in 2015 to establish performance standards for new, modified, and reconstructed electric utility generating units. The impact of any changes will depend on the content of any final rule adopted by the EPA and the outcome of any related legal challenges.

In April 2018, Southern Company established an intermediate goal of a 50% reduction in carbon emissions from 2007 levels by 2030 and a long-term goal of low- to no-carbon operations by 2050. To achieve these goals, the Southern Company system expects to continue growing its renewable energy portfolio, optimize technology advancements to modernize its transmission and distribution systems, increase the use of natural gas for generation, complete ongoing construction projects, including Georgia Power's interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, invest in energy efficiency, and continue research and development efforts focused on technologies to lower GHG emissions. The Southern Company system's ability to achieve these goals also will be dependent on many external factors, including supportive national energy policies, low natural gas prices, and the development, deployment, and advancement of relevant energy technologies.

Costs associated with GHG legislation, regulation, and emission reduction goals could be significant. However, the ultimate impact will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements, low natural gas prices, the development, deployment, and advancement of relevant energy technologies, the ability to recover costs through existing ratemaking provisions, and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges.

Because natural gas is a fossil fuel with lower carbon content relative to other fossil fuels, future GHG constraints, including, but not limited to, the imposition of a carbon tax, may create additional demand for natural gas, both for production of electricity and direct use in homes and businesses. Future GHG constraints designed to minimize emissions from natural gas could likewise result in increased costs to the Southern Company system and affect the demand for natural gas as well as the prices charged to customers and the competitive position of natural gas.

Index to Financial Statements

The net income of Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Power could be negatively impacted by changes in regulations related to transmission planning processes and competition in the wholesale electric markets.

The traditional electric operating companies currently own and operate transmission facilities as part of a vertically integrated utility. A small percentage of transmission revenues are collected through the wholesale electric tariff but the majority are collected through retail rates. FERC rules pertaining to regional transmission planning and cost allocation present challenges to transmission planning and the wholesale market structure. The key impacts of these rules include:

•

possible disruption of the integrated resource planning processes within the states in the Southern Company system's service territory;

•

delays and additional processes for developing transmission plans; and

•

possible impacts on state jurisdiction of approving, certifying, and pricing new transmission facilities.

The FERC rules related to transmission are intended to spur the development of new transmission infrastructure to promote and encourage the integration of renewable sources of supply as well as facilitate competition in the wholesale market by providing more choices to wholesale power customers. Technology changes in the power and fuel industries continue to create significant impacts to wholesale transaction cost structures. The impact of these and other such developments and the effect of changes in levels of wholesale supply and demand are uncertain. The financial condition, net income, and cash flows of Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Power could be adversely affected by these and other changes.

The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power could be subject to higher costs as a result of implementing and maintaining compliance with the North American Electric Reliability Corporation mandatory reliability standards along with possible associated penalties for non-compliance.

Owners and operators of bulk power systems, including the traditional electric operating companies, are subject to mandatory reliability standards enacted by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and enforced by the FERC. Compliance with or changes in the mandatory reliability standards may subject the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures. If any traditional electric operating company or Southern Power is found to be in noncompliance with these standards, such traditional electric operating company or Southern Power could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties.

OPERATIONAL RISKS

The financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries may be adversely

affected if the subsidiaries are unable to successfully operate their facilities or perform certain corporate functions.

The financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries depends on the successful operation of the electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities and natural gas distribution and storage facilities and the successful performance of necessary corporate functions. There are many risks that could affect these operations and performance of corporate functions, including:

•

operator error or failure of equipment or processes;

•

accidents;

•

operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements or in connection with joint owner arrangements;

•

labor disputes;

•

physical attacks;

•

fuel or material supply interruptions and/or shortages;

•

transmission disruption or capacity constraints, including with respect to the Southern Company system's and third parties' transmission, storage, and transportation facilities;

•

compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards;

•

implementation of new technologies;

•

information technology system failures;

•

cyber intrusions;

•

environmental events, such as spills or releases; and

•

catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and other storms, droughts, pandemic health events, or other similar occurrences.

A decrease or elimination of revenues from the electric generation, transmission, or distribution facilities or natural gas distribution or storage facilities or an increase in the cost of operating the facilities would reduce the net income and cash flows and could adversely impact the financial condition of the affected registrant.

I-21


Index to Financial Statements

Operation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental,

safety, health, regulatory, natural disasters, cyber intrusions or physical attacks, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the

closure of the nuclear units owned by Alabama Power or Georgia Power

and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage.

Alabama Power owns, and contracts for the operation of, two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and contracts for the operation of, four existing nuclear units. The six existing units are operated by Southern Nuclear and represent approximately 3,680 MWs, or 8% of the Southern Company system's electric generation capacity at January 1, 2019. In addition, these units generated approximately 25% of the total KWHs generated by each of Alabama Power and Georgia Power in the year ended

December 31, 2018

. In addition, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners, is managing the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Due solely to the increase in nuclear generating capacity, the below risks are expected to increase incrementally once Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are operational. Nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, safety, health, operational, and financial risks such as:

•

the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and safety resulting from a release of radioactive materials in connection with the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling, and disposal of radioactive material, including spent nuclear fuel;

•

uncertainties with respect to the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and the need for longer term on-site storage;

•

uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of licensed lives and the ability to maintain and anticipate adequate capital reserves for decommissioning;

•

limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with the nuclear operations of Alabama Power and Georgia Power or those of other commercial nuclear facility owners in the U.S.;

•

potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities;

•

significant capital expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair of these facilities, including repairs and upgrades required by the NRC;

•

actual or threatened cyber intrusions or physical attacks; and

•

the potential impact of an accident or natural disaster.

It is possible that damages, decommissioning, or other costs could exceed the amount of decommissioning trusts or external insurance coverage, including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance.

The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down any unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. NRC orders or regulations related to increased security measures and any future safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could result in substantial costs to Alabama Power or Georgia Power and Southern Company. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to delay or prohibit construction of new nuclear units or require additional safety measures at new and existing units. Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S., including facilities owned and operated by third parties, could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make material contributory payments.

In addition, actual or potential threats of cyber intrusions or physical attacks could result in increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs that are difficult to predict.

Transporting and storing natural gas involves risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.

Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidents, explosions, and mechanical problems, which could result in serious injury to employees and non-employees, loss of life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, and impairment of its operations. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas could increase the level of damage resulting from these risks. Additionally, these pipeline and storage facilities are subject to various state and other regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties or potential early retirement of storage facilities, which could trigger an associated impairment. The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance or otherwise could adversely affect Southern Company Gas' and Southern Company's financial condition and results of operations.

Physical attacks, both threatened and actual, could impact the ability of the Subsidiary Registrants to operate and could adversely affect financial results and liquidity.

The Subsidiary Registrants face the risk of physical attacks, both threatened and actual, against their respective generation and storage facilities and the transmission and distribution infrastructure used to transport energy, which could negatively impact

I-22


Index to Financial Statements

their ability to generate, transport, and deliver power, or otherwise operate their respective facilities, or, with respect to Southern Company Gas, its ability to distribute or store natural gas, or otherwise operate its facilities, in the most efficient manner or at all. In addition, physical attacks against third-party providers could have a similar effect on Southern Company and its subsidiaries.

Despite the implementation of robust security measures, all assets are potentially vulnerable to disability, failures, or unauthorized access due to human error, natural disasters, technological failure, or internal or external physical attacks. If assets were to fail, be physically damaged, or be breached and were not restored in a timely manner, the affected Subsidiary Registrant may be unable to fulfill critical business functions. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance maintained against losses resulting from any such events or physical security breaches may not be sufficient to cover losses or otherwise adequately compensate for any disruptions to business that could result.

These events could harm the reputation of and negatively affect the financial results of the registrants through lost revenues and costs to repair damage, if such costs cannot be recovered.

An information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, or the failure of one or more key information technology systems, networks, or processes could impact the ability of the registrants to operate and could adversely affect financial results and liquidity.

Information security risks have generally increased in recent years as a result of the proliferation of new technology and increased sophistication and frequency of cyber attacks and data security breaches. The Subsidiary Registrants operate in highly regulated industries that require the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure, which are part of interconnected distribution systems. Because of the critical nature of the infrastructure, increased connectivity to the internet, and technology systems' inherent vulnerability to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism, or other types of data security breaches, Southern Company and its subsidiaries face a heightened risk of cyberattack. Parties that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system or Southern Company system operations could view these computer systems, software, or networks as targets. The registrants and their third-party vendors have been subject, and will likely continue to be subject, to attempts to gain unauthorized access to their information technology systems and confidential data or to attempts to disrupt utility operations. As a result, Southern Company and its subsidiaries face on-going threats to their assets, including assets deemed critical infrastructure, where databases and systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to advanced computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, phishing, and other cyber attacks. While there have been immaterial incidents of phishing and attempted financial fraud across the Southern Company system, there has been no material impact on business or operations from these attacks. However, the registrants cannot guarantee that security efforts will prevent breaches, operational incidents, or other breakdowns of information technology systems and network infrastructure and cannot provide any assurance that such incidents will not have a material adverse effect in the future.

In addition, in the ordinary course of business, Southern Company and its subsidiaries collect and retain sensitive information, including personally identifiable information about customers, employees, and stockholders, and other confidential information. In some cases, administration of certain functions may be outsourced to third-party service providers that could also be targets of cyber attacks. Generally, Southern Company and its subsidiaries enter certain contractual security guarantees and assurances with these third parties to help ensure the security and safety of this information.

Despite the implementation of robust security measures, all assets are potentially vulnerable to disability, failures, or unauthorized access due to human error, natural disasters, technological failure, or internal or external cyber attacks. If assets were to fail or be breached and were not restored in a timely manner, the affected registrant may be unable to fulfill critical business functions, and sensitive and other data could be compromised. Any cyber breach or theft, damage, or improper disclosure of sensitive electronic data may also subject the affected registrant to penalties and claims from regulators or other third parties. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance maintained against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches may not be sufficient to cover losses or otherwise adequately compensate for any disruptions to business that could result. In addition, as cybercriminals become more sophisticated, the cost of proactive defensive measures may increase.

These events could negatively affect the financial results of the registrants through lost revenues, costs to recover and repair damage, costs associated with governmental actions in response to such attacks, and litigation costs if such costs cannot be recovered through insurance or otherwise.

The Southern Company system may not be able to obtain

adequate natural gas, fuel supplies, and other resources required to operate the traditional electric operating companies' and Southern Power's electric generating plants or serve Southern Company Gas' natural gas customers.

The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power purchase fuel, including coal, natural gas, uranium, fuel oil, and biomass, as applicable, from a number of suppliers. Additionally, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern

I-23


Index to Financial Statements

Power need adequate access to water, which is drawn from nearby sources to aid in the production of electricity and, once it is used, returned to its source. Disruption in the delivery of fuel, including disruptions as a result of, among other things, transportation delays, weather, labor relations, force majeure events, or environmental regulations affecting any of these fuel suppliers, or the availability of water, could limit the ability of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power to operate certain facilities, which could result in higher fuel and operating costs and potentially reduce the net income of the affected traditional electric operating company or Southern Power and Southern Company.

Southern Company Gas' primary business is the distribution and sale of natural gas through its regulated and unregulated subsidiaries. Natural gas supplies can be subject to disruption in the event production or distribution is curtailed, such as in the event of a hurricane or a pipeline failure. Southern Company Gas also relies on natural gas pipelines and other storage and transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties to deliver natural gas to wholesale markets and to Southern Company Gas' distribution systems. The availability of shale gas and potential regulations affecting its accessibility may have a material impact on the supply and cost of natural gas. Disruption in natural gas supplies could limit the ability to fulfill these contractual obligations.

The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power have become more dependent on natural gas for a portion of their electric generating capacity and expect to continue to increase such dependence. In many instances, the cost of purchased power for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power is influenced by natural gas prices. Historically, natural gas prices have been more volatile than prices of other fuels. In recent years, domestic natural gas prices have been depressed by robust supplies, including production from shale gas. These market conditions, together with additional regulation of coal-fired generating units, have increased the traditional electric operating companies' reliance on natural gas-fired generating units.

The traditional electric operating companies are also dependent on coal for a portion of their electric generating capacity. The traditional electric operating companies depend on coal supply contracts, and the counterparties to these agreements may not fulfill their obligations to supply coal to the traditional electric operating companies. The suppliers may experience financial or technical problems that inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations. In addition, the suppliers may not be required to supply coal under certain circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster. If the traditional electric operating companies are unable to obtain their coal requirements under these contracts, they may be required to purchase their coal requirements at higher prices, which may not be recoverable through rates.

The revenues of Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern

Power depend in

part on sales under PPAs. The failure of a counterparty to one of these PPAs to

perform its obligations, the failure of the traditional electric operating companies or Southern Power to satisfy minimum requirements under the PPAs, or the failure to renew the PPAs or successfully remarket the related generating capacity could have a negative

impact on the net income and cash flows of the affected traditional electric operating company

or Southern Power and of Southern Company.

Most of Southern Power's generating capacity has been sold to purchasers under PPAs. Southern Power's top three customers, Georgia Power, Duke Energy Corporation, and Southern California Edison accounted for 9.8%, 6.8%, and 6.2%, respectively, of Southern Power's total revenues for the year ended

December 31, 2018

. In addition, the traditional electric operating companies enter into PPAs with non-affiliated parties. Revenues are dependent on the continued performance by the purchasers of their obligations under these PPAs. The failure of one of the purchasers to perform its obligations, including as a result of a general default or bankruptcy, could have a negative impact on the net income and cash flows of the affected traditional electric operating company or Southern Power and of Southern Company. Although the credit evaluations undertaken and contractual protections implemented by Southern Power and the traditional electric operating companies take into account the possibility of default by a purchaser, actual exposure to a default by a purchaser may be greater than predicted or specified in the applicable contract. See Note 1 to the financial statements under "

Revenues

–

Concentration of Revenue

" in Item 8 herein for additional information on Pacific Gas & Electric Company's bankruptcy filing.

Additionally, neither Southern Power nor any traditional electric operating company can predict whether the PPAs will be renewed at the end of their respective terms or on what terms any renewals may be made. The failure of the traditional electric operating companies or Southern Power to satisfy minimum operational or availability requirements under these PPAs could result in payment of damages or termination of the PPAs.

The asset management arrangements between Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas services and its customers, including the natural gas distribution utilities, may not be renewed or may be renewed at lower levels, which could have a significant impact on Southern Company Gas' financial results.

Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas services currently manages the storage and transportation assets of the natural gas distribution utilities (except Nicor Gas) as well as certain non-affiliated customers. Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas

Index to Financial Statements

services has a concentration of credit risk for services it provides to its counterparties, which is generally concentrated in 20 of its counterparties.

The profits earned from the management of affiliate assets are shared with the respective affiliate's customers (and for Atlanta Gas Light with the Georgia PSC's Universal Service Fund), except for Chattanooga Gas where wholesale gas services are provided under annual fixed-fee agreements. These asset management agreements are subject to regulatory approval and such agreements may not be renewed or may be renewed with less favorable terms.

The financial results of Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas services could be significantly impacted if any of its agreements with its affiliated or non-affiliated customers are not renewed or are amended or renewed with less favorable terms. Sustained low natural gas prices could reduce the demand for these types of asset management arrangements.

Increased competition could negatively impact Southern Company's and its subsidiaries' revenues, results of operations, and financial condition.

The Southern Company system faces increasing competition from other companies that supply energy or generation and storage technologies. Changes in technology may make the Southern Company system's electric generating facilities owned by the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power less competitive. Southern Company Gas' business is dependent on natural gas prices remaining competitive as compared to other forms of energy. Southern Company Gas also faces competition in its unregulated markets.

A key element of the business models of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power is that generating power at central station power plants achieves economies of scale and produces power at a competitive cost. There are distributed generation and storage technologies that produce and store power, including fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines, solar cells, and batteries. Advances in technology or changes in laws or regulations could reduce the cost of these or other alternative methods of producing power to a level that is competitive with that of most central station power electric production or result in smaller-scale, more fuel efficient, and/or more cost effective distributed generation that allows for increased self-generation by customers. Broader use of distributed generation by retail energy customers may also result from customers' changing perceptions of the merits of utilizing existing generation technology or tax or other economic incentives. Additionally, a state PSC or legislature may modify certain aspects of the traditional electric operating companies' business as a result of these advances in technology.

It is also possible that rapid advances in central station power generation technology could reduce the value of the current electric generating facilities owned by the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power. Changes in technology could also alter the channels through which electric customers buy or utilize power, which could reduce the revenues or increase the expenses of Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, or Southern Power.

Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services is affected by competition from other energy marketers providing similar services in Southern Company Gas' service territories, most notably in Illinois and Georgia. Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas services competes for sales with national and regional full-service energy providers, energy merchants and producers, and pipelines based on the ability to aggregate competitively-priced commodities with transportation and storage capacity. Southern Company Gas competes with natural gas facilities in the Gulf Coast region of the U.S., as the majority of the existing and proposed high deliverability salt-dome natural gas storage facilities in North America are located in the Gulf Coast region.

If new technologies become cost competitive and achieve sufficient scale, the market share of the Subsidiary Registrants could be eroded, and the value of their respective electric generating facilities or natural gas distribution and storage facilities could be reduced. Additionally, Southern Company Gas' market share could be reduced if Southern Company Gas cannot remain price competitive in its unregulated markets. If state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies fail to adjust rates to reflect the impact of any changes in loads, increasing self-generation, and the growth of distributed generation, the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of Southern Company and the affected traditional electric operating company or Southern Company Gas could be materially adversely affected.

Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could negatively impact Southern Company's and its subsidiaries' results of operations.

Events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, mismatch of skill sets to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges such as lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and a lengthy time period associated with skill development, including with the workforce needs associated with major construction projects and ongoing operations. The Southern Company system's costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs, and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately obtain replacement employees, including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect Southern Company and its subsidiaries' ability to manage and operate their businesses. If Southern Company

I-25

and its subsidiaries are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, results of operations could be negatively impacted.

CONSTRUCTION RISKS

The registrants may incur

additional costs or delays in the construction of new plants or other facilities and may not be able to recover their investments. Also, existing facilities of

the Subsidiary Registrants require

ongoing expenditures, including those to meet AROs and other environmental standards and goals.

General

The businesses of the registrants require substantial expenditures for investments in new facilities and, for the traditional electric operating companies, capital improvements to transmission, distribution, and generation facilities, for Southern Power, capital improvements to generation facilities, and, for Southern Company Gas, capital improvements to natural gas distribution and storage facilities. These expenditures also include those to meet AROs and environmental standards and goals. Certain of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power are in the process of constructing new generating facilities and adding environmental controls equipment at existing generating facilities. Southern Company Gas is replacing certain pipelines in its natural gas distribution system and is involved in two new gas pipeline construction projects. The Southern Company system intends to continue its strategy of developing and constructing other new facilities, expanding or updating existing facilities, and adding environmental control equipment. These types of projects are long term in nature and in some cases may include the development and construction of facilities with designs that have not been finalized or previously constructed. The completion of these types of projects without delays or significant cost overruns is subject to substantial risks, including:

•

shortages, increased costs, or inconsistent quality of equipment, materials, and labor;

•

changes in labor costs, availability, and productivity;

•

challenges related to management of contractors, subcontractors, or vendors;

•

work stoppages;

•

contractor or supplier delay;

•

non-performance under construction, operating, or other agreements;

•

delays in or failure to receive necessary permits, approvals, tax credits, and other regulatory authorizations;

•

delays in start-up activities (including major equipment failure and system integration) and/or operational performance;

•

operational readiness, including specialized operator training and required site safety programs;

•

impacts of new and existing laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations;

•

the outcome of any legal challenges to projects, including legal challenges to regulatory approvals;

•

failure to construct in accordance with permitting and licensing requirements (including satisfaction of NRC requirements);

•

failure to satisfy any environmental performance standards and the requirements of tax credits and other incentives;

•

continued public and policymaker support for projects;

•

adverse weather conditions or natural disasters;

•

engineering or design problems;

•

changes in project design or scope;

•

environmental and geological conditions;

•

delays or increased costs to interconnect facilities to transmission grids; and

•

increased financing costs as a result of changes in market interest rates or as a result of project delays.

If a Subsidiary Registrant is unable to complete the development or construction of a project or decides to delay or cancel construction of a project, it may not be able to recover its investment in that project and may incur substantial cancellation payments under equipment purchase orders or construction contracts, as well as other costs associated with the closure and/or abandonment of the construction project. See Note


to the financial statements under "Kemper County Energy Facility" for information related to the abandonment of and related closure activities and costs for the mine and gasifier-related assets at the Kemper County energy facility.

Additionally, each Southern Company Gas pipeline construction project involves separate joint venture participants, Southern Power participates in partnership agreements with respect to renewable energy projects, and Georgia Power jointly owns Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 with other co-owners. Any failure by a partner or co-owner to perform its obligations under the applicable agreements could have a material negative impact on the applicable project under construction. In addition, partnership and joint ownership agreements may provide partners or co-owners with certain decision-making authority in connection with projects under construction, including rights to cause the cancellation of a construction project under certain circumstances.

Even if a construction project (including a joint venture construction project) is completed, the total costs may be higher than estimated and may not be recoverable through regulated rates, if applicable. In addition, construction delays and contractor

I-26


Index to Financial Statements

performance shortfalls can result in the loss of revenues and may, in turn, adversely affect the net income and financial position of the affected registrant. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "FERC Matters – Southern Company Gas" for information regarding the Atlantic Coast Pipeline construction delays and the associated cost increase.

Construction delays could result in the loss of otherwise available tax credits and incentives. Furthermore, if construction projects are not completed according to specification, a registrant may incur liabilities and suffer reduced plant efficiency, higher operating costs, and reduced net income.

Once facilities become operational, ongoing capital expenditures are required to maintain reliable levels of operation. Significant portions of the traditional electric operating companies' existing facilities were constructed many years ago. Older equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant expenditures to maintain efficiency, to comply with changing environmental requirements, to provide safe and reliable operations, and/or to meet related retirement obligations.

The largest construction project currently underway in the Southern Company system is Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.

Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 construction and rate recovery

Background

In 2009, the Georgia PSC certified construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Georgia Power holds a 45.7% ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. In 2012, the NRC issued the related combined construction and operating licenses, which allowed full construction of the two AP1000 nuclear units (with electric generating capacity of approximately 1,100 MWs each) and related facilities to begin. Until March 2017, construction on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 continued under the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement, which was a substantially fixed price agreement. In March 2017, the EPC Contractor filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

In connection with the EPC Contractor's bankruptcy filing, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the Vogtle Owners, entered into the Interim Assessment Agreement with the EPC Contractor to allow construction to continue. The Interim Assessment Agreement expired in July 2017 when Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the other Vogtle Owners, and the EPC Contractor entered into the Vogtle Services Agreement. Under the Vogtle Services Agreement, Westinghouse provides facility design and engineering services, procurement and technical support, and staff augmentation on a time and materials cost basis.

In October 2017, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the other Vogtle Owners, executed the Bechtel Agreement, a cost reimbursable plus fee arrangement, whereby Bechtel is reimbursed for actual costs plus a base fee and an at-risk fee, which is subject to adjustment based on Bechtel's performance against cost and schedule targets.

Cost and Schedule

Georgia Power's approximate proportionate share of the remaining estimated capital cost to complete Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 by the expected in-service dates of November 2021 and November 2022, respectively, is as follows:

(a)

Excludes financing costs expected to be capitalized through AFUDC of approximately

$315 million

.

(b)

Net of

$1.7 billion

received from Toshiba under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately

$188 million

in related Customer Refunds.

Georgia Power estimates that its financing costs for construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 will total approximately

$3.1 billion

, of which $1.9 billion had been incurred through December 31, 2018.

As construction continues, challenges with management of contractors, subcontractors, and vendors; labor productivity, availability, and/or cost escalation; procurement, fabrication, delivery, assembly, and/or installation and testing, including any required engineering changes, of plant systems, structures, and components (some of which are based on new technology that only recently began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale); or other issues could arise and change the projected schedule and estimated cost. Monthly construction production targets required to maintain the current project schedule will continue to increase significantly throughout 2019. To meet these increasing monthly targets, existing craft construction productivity must improve and additional craft laborers must be retained and deployed.

Index to Financial Statements

Georgia Power and Southern Nuclear believe it is a leading practice in connection with a construction project of this size and complexity to periodically validate recent construction progress in comparison to the projected schedule and to verify and update quantities of commodities remaining to install, labor productivity, and forecasted staffing needs. This verification process, led by Southern Nuclear, was underway as of December 31, 2018 and is expected to be completed during the second quarter 2019. Georgia Power currently does not anticipate any material changes to the total estimated project capital cost forecast for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 or the expected in-service dates of November 2021 and November 2022, respectively, resulting from this verification process. However, the ultimate impact on cost and schedule, if any, will not be known until the verification process is completed. Georgia Power is required to report the results and any project impacts to the Georgia PSC by May 15, 2019.

There have been technical and procedural challenges to the construction and licensing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 at the federal and state level and additional challenges may arise. Processes are in place that are designed to assure compliance with the requirements specified in the Westinghouse Design Control Document and the combined construction and operating licenses, including inspections by Southern Nuclear and the NRC that occur throughout construction. As a result of such compliance processes, certain license amendment requests have been filed and approved or are pending before the NRC. Various design and other licensing-based compliance matters, including the timely resolution of ITAAC and the related approvals by the NRC, may arise, which may result in additional license amendments or require other resolution. If any license amendment requests or other licensing-based compliance issues are not resolved in a timely manner, there may be delays in the project schedule that could result in increased costs.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. However, any extension of the project schedule is currently estimated to result in additional base capital costs of approximately $50 million per month, based on Georgia Power's ownership interests, and AFUDC of approximately $12 million per month. While Georgia Power is not precluded from seeking recovery of any future capital cost forecast increase, management will ultimately determine whether or not to seek recovery. Any further changes to the capital cost forecast that are not expected to be recoverable through regulated rates will be required to be charged to income and such charges could be material.

Joint Owner Contracts

In November 2017, the Vogtle Owners entered into an amendment to their joint ownership agreements for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to provide for, among other conditions, additional Vogtle Owner approval requirements. Effective August 31, 2018, the Vogtle Owners further amended the joint ownership agreements to clarify and provide procedures for certain provisions of the joint ownership agreements related to adverse events that require the vote of the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to continue construction (as amended, and together with the November 2017 amendment, the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements).

As a result of the increase in the total project capital cost forecast and Georgia Power's decision not to seek rate recovery of the increase in the base capital costs as described below, the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 were required to vote to continue construction. On September 26, 2018, the Vogtle Owners unanimously voted to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.

Amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements

In connection with the vote to continue construction, Georgia Power entered into (i) a binding term sheet (Vogtle Owner Term Sheet) with the other Vogtle Owners and MEAG's wholly-owned subsidiaries MEAG Power SPVJ, LLC (MEAG SPVJ), MEAG Power SPVM, LLC (MEAG SPVM), and MEAG Power SPVP, LLC (MEAG SPVP) to take certain actions which partially mitigate potential financial exposure for the other Vogtle Owners, including additional amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements and the purchase of PTCs from the other Vogtle Owners, and (ii) a term sheet (MEAG Term Sheet) with MEAG and MEAG SPVJ to provide funding with respect to MEAG SPVJ's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (Project J) under certain circumstances. On January 14, 2019, Georgia Power, MEAG, and MEAG SPVJ entered into an agreement to implement the provisions of the MEAG Term Sheet (MEAG Funding Agreement). On February 18, 2019, Georgia Power, the other Vogtle Owners, and MEAG's wholly-owned subsidiaries MEAG SPVJ, MEAG SPVM, and MEAG SPVP entered into certain amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements to implement the provisions of the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet (Global Amendments).

Pursuant to the Global Amendments, and consistent with the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet, the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements were modified as follows: (i) each Vogtle Owner must pay its proportionate share of qualifying construction costs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 based on its ownership percentage up to the estimated cost at completion (EAC) for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 which formed the basis of Georgia Power's forecast of $8.4 billion in the nineteenth VCM plus $800 million; (ii) Georgia Power will be responsible for 55.7% of actual qualifying construction costs between $800 million and $1.6 billion over the EAC in the nineteenth VCM (resulting in $80 million of potential additional costs to Georgia Power), with the remaining Vogtle Owners responsible for 44.3% of such costs pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests; and (iii) Georgia

I-28


Index to Financial Statements

Power will be responsible for 65.7% of qualifying construction costs between $1.6 billion and $2.1 billion over the EAC in the nineteenth VCM (resulting in a further $100 million of potential additional costs to Georgia Power), with the remaining Vogtle Owners responsible for 34.3% of such costs pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests.

If the EAC is revised and exceeds the EAC in the nineteenth VCM by more than $2.1 billion, each of the other Vogtle Owners will have a one-time option at the time the project budget forecast is so revised to tender a portion of its ownership interest to Georgia Power in exchange for Georgia Power's agreement to pay 100% of such Vogtle Owner's remaining share of total construction costs in excess of the EAC in the nineteenth VCM plus $2.1 billion. In this event, Georgia Power will have the option of cancelling the project in lieu of purchasing a portion of the ownership interest of any other Vogtle Owner. If Georgia Power accepts the offer to purchase a portion of another Vogtle Owner's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, the ownership interest(s) to be conveyed from the tendering Vogtle Owner(s) to Georgia Power will be calculated based on the proportion of the cumulative amount of construction costs paid by each such tendering Vogtle Owner(s) and by Georgia Power as of the COD of Plant Vogtle Unit 4. For purposes of this calculation, payments made by Georgia Power on behalf of another Vogtle Owner in accordance with the second and third items described in the paragraph above will be treated as payments made by the applicable Vogtle Owner.

In the event the actual costs of construction at completion of a Unit are less than the EAC reflected in the nineteenth VCM report and such Unit is placed in service in accordance with the schedule projected in the nineteenth VCM report (i.e., Plant Vogtle Unit 3 is placed in service by November 2021 or Plant Vogtle Unit 4 is placed in service by November 2022), Georgia Power will be entitled to 60.7% of the cost savings with respect to the relevant Unit and the remaining Vogtle Owners will be entitled to 39.3% of such savings on a pro rata basis in accordance with their respective ownership interests.

For purposes of the foregoing provisions, qualifying construction costs will not include costs (i) resulting from force majeure events, including governmental actions or inactions (or significant delays associated with issuance of such actions) that affect the licensing, completion, start-up, operations, or financing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, administrative proceedings or litigation regarding ITAAC or other regulatory challenges to commencement of operation of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, and changes in laws or regulations governing Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, (ii) legal fees and legal expenses incurred due to litigation with contractors or subcontractors that are not subsidiaries or affiliates of Southern Company, and (iii) additional costs caused by requests from the Vogtle Owners other than Georgia Power, except for the exercise of a right to vote granted under the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements, that increase costs by $100,000 or more.

Pursuant to the Global Amendments, and consistent with the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet, the provisions of the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements requiring that Vogtle Owners holding 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 vote to continue construction following certain adverse events (Project Adverse Events) were modified. Pursuant to the Global Amendments, the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 must vote to continue construction if certain Project Adverse Events occur, including: (i) the bankruptcy of Toshiba; (ii) the termination or rejection in bankruptcy of certain agreements, including the Vogtle Services Agreement, the Bechtel Agreement, or the agency agreement with Southern Nuclear; (iii) Georgia Power publicly announces its intention not to submit for rate recovery any portion of its investment in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 or the Georgia PSC determines that any of Georgia Power's costs relating to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 will not be recovered in retail rates, excluding any additional amounts paid by Georgia Power on behalf of the other Vogtle Owners pursuant to the Global Amendments described above and the first 6% of costs during any six-month VCM reporting period that are disallowed by the Georgia PSC for recovery, or for which Georgia Power elects not to seek cost recovery, through retail rates; and (iv) an incremental extension of one year or more over the most recently approved schedule. Under the Global Amendments, Georgia Power may cancel the project at any time in its sole discretion.

In addition, pursuant to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements, the required approval of holders of ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is at least (i) 90% for a change of the primary construction contractor and (ii) 67% for material amendments to the Vogtle Services Agreement or agreements with Southern Nuclear or the primary construction contractor, including the Bechtel Agreement.

The Global Amendments provide that if the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests fail to vote in favor of continuing the project following any future Project Adverse Event, work on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 will continue for a period of 30 days if the holders of more than 50% of the ownership interests vote in favor of continuing construction (Majority Voting Owners). In such a case, the Vogtle Owners (i) have agreed to negotiate in good faith towards the resumption of the project, (ii) if no agreement is reached during such 30-day period, the project will be cancelled, and (iii) in the event of such a cancellation, the Majority Voting Owners will be obligated to reimburse any other Vogtle Owner for the incremental costs it incurred during such 30-day negotiation period.

Purchase of PTCs During Commercial Operation

Pursuant to the Global Amendments, and consistent with the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet, Georgia Power has agreed to purchase additional PTCs from OPC, Dalton, MEAG SPVM, MEAG SPVP, and MEAG SPVJ (to the extent any MEAG SPVJ PTC rights remain after any purchases required under the MEAG Funding Agreement as described below) at varying purchase prices dependent upon the actual cost to complete construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 as compared to the EAC reflected in the nineteenth VCM report. The purchases are at the option of the applicable Vogtle Owner.

Potential Funding to MEAG Project J

Pursuant to the MEAG Funding Agreement, and consistent with the MEAG Term Sheet, if MEAG SPVJ is unable to make its payments due under the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements solely as a result of the occurrence of one of the following situations that materially impedes access to capital markets for MEAG for Project J: (i) the conduct of JEA or the City of Jacksonville, such as JEA's legal challenges of its obligations under a PPA with MEAG (PPA-J), or (ii) PPA-J is declared void by a court of competent jurisdiction or rejected by JEA under the applicable provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (each of (i) and (ii), a JEA Default), at MEAG's request, Georgia Power will purchase from MEAG SPVJ the rights to PTCs attributable to MEAG SPVJ's share of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (approximately 206 MWs) within 30 days of such request at varying prices dependent upon the stage of construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. The aggregate purchase price of the PTCs, together with any advances made as described in the next paragraph, shall not exceed $300 million.

At the option of MEAG, as an alternative or supplement to Georgia Power's purchase of PTCs as described above, Georgia Power has agreed to provide up to $250 million in funding to MEAG for Project J in the form of advances (either advances under the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements or the purchase of MEAG Project J bonds, at the discretion of Georgia Power), subject to any required approvals of the Georgia PSC and the DOE.

In the event MEAG SPVJ certifies to Georgia Power that it is unable to fund its obligations under the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements as a result of a JEA Default and Georgia Power becomes obligated to provide funding as described above, MEAG is required to (i) assign to Georgia Power its right to vote on any future Project Adverse Event and (ii) diligently pursue JEA for its breach of PPA-J. In addition, Georgia Power agreed that it will not sue MEAG for any amounts due from MEAG SPVJ under MEAG's guarantee of MEAG SPVJ's obligations so long as MEAG SPVJ complies with the terms of the MEAG Funding Agreement as to its payment obligations and the other non-payment provisions of the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements.

Under the terms of the MEAG Funding Agreement, Georgia Power may cancel the project in lieu of providing funding in the form of advances or PTC purchases.

Regulatory Matters

In December 2017, the Georgia PSC voted to approve (and issued its related order on January 11, 2018) Georgia Power's recommendation to continue construction and resolved the following regulatory matters related to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4: (i) none of the $3.3 billion of costs incurred through December 31, 2015 and reflected in the fourteenth VCM report should be disallowed from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (ii) the Contractor Settlement Agreement was reasonable and prudent and none of the amounts paid pursuant to the Contractor Settlement Agreement should be disallowed from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (iii) (a) capital costs incurred up to $5.68 billion would be presumed to be reasonable and prudent with the burden of proof on any party challenging such costs, (b) Georgia Power would have the burden to show that any capital costs above $5.68 billion were prudent, and (c) a revised capital cost forecast of $7.3 billion (after reflecting the impact of payments received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and related Customer Refunds) was found reasonable; (iv) construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 should be completed, with Southern Nuclear serving as project manager and Bechtel as primary contractor; (v) approved and deemed reasonable Georgia Power's revised schedule placing Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in service in November 2021 and November 2022, respectively; (vi) confirmed that the revised cost forecast does not represent a cost cap and that prudence decisions on cost recovery will be made at a later date, consistent with applicable Georgia law; (vii) reduced the ROE used to calculate the NCCR tariff (a) from 10.95% (the ROE rate setting point authorized by the Georgia PSC in the 2013 ARP) to 10.00% effective January 1, 2016, (b) from 10.00% to 8.30%, effective January 1, 2020, and (c) from 8.30% to 5.30%, effective January 1, 2021 (provided that the ROE in no case will be less than Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt); (viii) reduced the ROE used for AFUDC equity for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from 10.00% to Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt, effective January 1, 2018; and (ix) agreed that upon Unit 3 reaching commercial operation, retail base rates would be adjusted to include carrying costs on those capital costs deemed prudent in the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement. The January 11, 2018 order also stated that if Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are not commercially operational by June 1, 2021 and June 1, 2022, respectively, the ROE used to calculate the NCCR tariff will be further reduced by 10 basis points each month (but not lower than Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt) until the respective Unit is commercially operational. The ROE reductions negatively impacted earnings by approximately $100 million, $25 million, and $20 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, and are estimated to have negative earnings impacts of approximately $75 million in 2019 and an aggregate of approximately $615 million from 2020 to 2022.

Index to Financial Statements

In its January 11, 2018 order, the Georgia PSC also stated if other conditions change and assumptions upon which Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report are based do not materialize, the Georgia PSC reserved the right to reconsider the decision to continue construction.

On February 12, 2018, Georgia Interfaith Power & Light, Inc. (GIPL) and Partnership for Southern Equity, Inc. (PSE) filed a petition appealing the Georgia PSC's January 11, 2018 order with the Fulton County Superior Court. On March 8, 2018, Georgia Watch filed a similar appeal to the Fulton County Superior Court for judicial review of the Georgia PSC's decision and denial of Georgia Watch's motion for reconsideration. On December 21, 2018, the Fulton County Superior Court granted Georgia Power's motion to dismiss the two appeals. On January 9, 2019, GIPL, PSE, and Georgia Watch filed an appeal of this decision with the Georgia Court of Appeals. Georgia Power believes the appeal has no merit; however, an adverse outcome in the appeal combined with subsequent adverse action by the Georgia PSC could have a material impact on Southern Company's and Georgia Power's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

In preparation for its nineteenth VCM filing, Georgia Power requested Southern Nuclear to perform a full cost reforecast for the project. This reforecast, performed prior to the nineteenth VCM filing, resulted in a $0.7 billion increase to the base capital cost forecast reported in the second quarter 2018. This base cost increase primarily resulted from changed assumptions related to the finalization of contract scopes and management responsibilities for Bechtel and over 60 subcontractors, labor productivity rates, and craft labor incentives, as well as the related levels of project management, oversight, and support, including field supervision and engineering support.

Although Georgia Power believes these incremental costs are reasonable and necessary to complete the project and the Georgia PSC's order in the seventeenth VCM proceeding specifically states that the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is not subject to a cost cap, Georgia Power did not seek rate recovery for these cost increases included in the current base capital cost forecast (or any related financing costs) in the nineteenth VCM report. In connection with future VCM filings, Georgia Power may request the Georgia PSC to evaluate costs currently included in the construction contingency estimate for rate recovery as and when they are appropriately included in the base capital cost forecast. After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of costs included in the construction contingency estimate since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in these future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded a total pre-tax charge to income of $1.1 billion ($0.8 billion after tax) in the second quarter 2018, which includes the total increase in the base capital cost forecast and construction contingency estimate.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power –

Nuclear Construction

" in Item 8 herein for additional information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.

Southern Company Gas' significant investments in pipelines and pipeline development projects involve financial and execution risks.

Southern Company Gas has made significant investments in existing pipelines and pipeline development projects. Many of the existing pipelines are, and when completed many of the pipeline development projects will be, operated by third parties. If one of these agents fails to perform in a proper manner, the value of the investment could decline and Southern Company Gas could lose part or all of its investment. In addition, from time to time, Southern Company Gas may be required to contribute additional capital to a pipeline joint venture or guarantee the obligations of such joint venture.

With respect to certain pipeline development projects, Southern Company Gas will rely on its joint venture partners for construction management and will not exercise direct control over the process. All of the pipeline development projects are dependent on contractors for the successful and timely completion of the projects. Further, the development of pipeline projects involves numerous regulatory, environmental, construction, safety, political, and legal uncertainties and may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital. These projects may not be completed on schedule, at the budgeted cost, or at all. There may be cost overruns and construction difficulties that cause Southern Company Gas' capital expenditures to exceed its initial expectations. Moreover, Southern Company Gas' income will not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a pipeline project. Pipeline construction occurs over an extended period of time and Southern Company Gas will not receive material increases in income until the project is placed in service.

Work continues with state and federal agencies to obtain the required permits to begin construction on the PennEast Pipeline. Any material delays may impact forecasted capital expenditures and the expected in-service date.

The Atlantic Coast Pipeline has experienced challenges to its permits since construction began in 2018. During the third and fourth quarters 2018, a FERC stop work order, together with delays in obtaining permits necessary for construction and construction delays due to judicial actions, impacted the cost and schedule for the project. As a result, total project cost estimates have increased and the operator of the joint venture currently expects to achieve a late 2020 in-service date for at least

I-31


Index to Financial Statements

key segments of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, while the remainder may extend into early 2021. Abnormal weather, work delays (including due to judicial or regulatory action), and other conditions may result in additional cost or schedule modifications, which could result in an impairment of Southern Company Gas' investment and could have a material impact on Southern Company's and Southern Company Gas' financial statements.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time and the occurrence of these or any other of the foregoing events could adversely affect the results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition of Southern Company Gas and Southern Company.

FINANCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND MARKET RISKS

The electric generation and energy marketing operations of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power and the natural gas operations of Southern Company Gas are subject to risks, many of which are beyond

their control, including changes in energy prices and fuel costs, which may reduce revenues and increase costs.

The generation, energy marketing, and natural gas operations of the Southern Company system are subject to changes in energy prices and fuel costs, which could increase the cost of producing power, decrease the amount received from the sale of energy, and/or make electric generating facilities less competitive. The market prices for these commodities may fluctuate significantly over relatively short periods of time. Among the factors that could influence energy prices and fuel costs are:

•

prevailing market prices for coal, natural gas, uranium, fuel oil, biomass, and other fuels, as applicable, used in the generation facilities of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power and, in the case of natural gas, distributed by Southern Company Gas, including associated transportation costs, and supplies of such commodities;

•

demand for energy and the extent of additional supplies of energy available from current or new competitors;

•

liquidity in the general wholesale electricity and natural gas markets;

•

weather conditions impacting demand for electricity and natural gas;

•

seasonality;

•

transmission or transportation constraints, disruptions, or inefficiencies;

•

availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources;

•

forced or unscheduled plant outages for the Southern Company system, its competitors, or third party providers;

•

the financial condition of market participants;

•

the economy in the Southern Company system's service territory, the nation, and worldwide, including the impact of economic conditions on demand for electricity and the demand for fuels, including natural gas;

•

natural disasters, wars, embargos, physical or cyber attacks, and other catastrophic events; and

•

federal, state, and foreign energy and environmental regulation and legislation.

These factors could increase the expenses and/or reduce the revenues of the registrants. For the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas' regulated gas distribution operations, such impacts may not be fully recoverable through rates.

Historically, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas from time to time have experienced underrecovered fuel and/or purchased gas cost balances and may experience such balances in the future. While the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas are generally authorized to recover fuel and/or purchased gas costs through cost recovery clauses, recovery may be denied if costs are deemed to be imprudently incurred, and delays in the authorization of such recovery, both of which could negatively impact the cash flows of the affected traditional electric operating company or Southern Company Gas and of Southern Company.

The registrants are subject to risks associated with a changing economic environment, customer behaviors, including increased energy conservation, and adoption patterns of technologies by the customers of the Subsidiary Registrants.

The consumption and use of energy are fundamentally linked to economic activity. This relationship is affected over time by changes in the economy, customer behaviors, and technologies. Any economic downturn could negatively impact customer growth and usage per customer, thus reducing the sales of energy and revenues. Additionally, any economic downturn or disruption of financial markets, both nationally and internationally, could negatively affect the financial stability of customers and counterparties of the Subsidiary Registrants.

Outside of economic disruptions, changes in customer behaviors in response to energy efficiency programs, changing conditions and preferences, or changes in the adoption of technologies could affect the relationship of economic activity to the consumption of energy.

Both federal and state programs exist to influence how customers use energy, and several of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas have PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency mandates to promote energy efficiency. Conservation programs could impact the financial results of the registrants in different ways. For example, if any traditional electric operating company or Southern Company Gas is required to invest in conservation measures that result in

I-32


Index to Financial Statements

reduced sales from effective conservation, regulatory lag in adjusting rates for the impact of these measures could have a negative financial impact on such traditional electric operating company or Southern Company Gas and Southern Company. Customers could also voluntarily reduce their consumption of energy in response to decreases in their disposable income, increases in energy prices, or individual conservation efforts.

In addition, the adoption of technology by customers can have both positive and negative impacts on sales. Many new technologies utilize less energy than in the past. However, electric and natural gas technologies such as electric and natural gas vehicles can create additional demand. The Southern Company system uses best available methods and experience to incorporate the effects of changes in customer behavior, state and federal programs, PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency mandates, and technology, but the Southern Company system's planning processes may not appropriately estimate and incorporate these effects.

All of the factors discussed above could adversely affect a registrant's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

The operating results of the registrants are affected by weather conditions and may fluctuate on a seasonal and

quarterly basis. In addition, catastrophic events, such as fires, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts, and storms, could result in substantial damage to or limit the operation of the properties of a Subsidiary Registrant and could negatively impact results of operation, financial condition, and liquidity.

Electric power and natural gas supply are generally seasonal businesses. In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time. In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter months. While the electric power sales of some of the traditional electric operating companies peak in the summer, others peak in the winter. In the aggregate, electric power sales peak during the summer with a smaller peak during the winter. Additionally, Southern Power has variability in its revenues from renewable generation facilities due to seasonal weather patterns primarily from wind and sun. In most of the areas Southern Company Gas serves, natural gas demand peaks during the winter. As a result, the overall operating results of the registrants may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. In addition, the Subsidiary Registrants have historically sold less power and natural gas when weather conditions are milder. Unusually mild weather in the future could reduce the revenues, net income, and available cash of the affected registrant.

Further, volatile or significant weather events could result in substantial damage to the transmission and distribution lines of the traditional electric operating companies, the generating facilities of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, and the natural gas distribution and storage facilities of Southern Company Gas. The Subsidiary Registrants have significant investments in the Atlantic and Gulf Coast regions and Southern Power and Southern Company Gas have investments in various states which could be subject to severe weather and natural disasters, including wildfires. Further, severe drought conditions can reduce the availability of water and restrict or prevent the operation of certain generating facilities. There have been multiple significant hurricanes in the Southern Company system service territory in recent years.

In the event a traditional electric operating company or Southern Company Gas experiences any of these weather events or any natural disaster or other catastrophic event, recovery of costs in excess of reserves and insurance coverage is subject to the approval of its state PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency. Historically, the traditional electric operating companies from time to time have experienced deficits in their storm cost recovery reserve balances and may experience such deficits in the future. For example, at December 31, 2018, Georgia Power had a substantial underrecovered balance in its storm cost recovery balance as a result of multiple recent significant hurricanes in its service territory. Any denial by the applicable state PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency or delay in recovery of any portion of such costs could have a material negative impact on a traditional electric operating company's or Southern Company Gas' and on Southern Company's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

In addition, damages resulting from significant weather events within the service territory of any traditional electric operating company or Southern Company Gas or affecting Southern Power's customers may result in the loss of customers and reduced demand for energy for extended periods and may impact customers' ability to perform under existing PPAs. See Note 1 to the financial statements under "

Revenues

–

Concentration of Revenue

" in Item 8 herein for additional information on Pacific Gas & Electric Company's bankruptcy filing. Any significant loss of customers or reduction in demand for energy could have a material negative impact on a registrant's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

Acquisitions, dispositions, or other strategic ventures or investments may not result in anticipated benefits and may present risks not originally contemplated, which may have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition of Southern Company and its subsidiaries.

Southern Company and its subsidiaries have made significant acquisitions and investments in the past, as well as recent dispositions, and may in the future make additional acquisitions, dispositions, or other strategic ventures or investments, including the pending disposition by Southern Power of Plant Mankato, which cannot be assured to be completed or beneficial to Southern Company or its subsidiaries. Southern Company and its subsidiaries continually seek opportunities to create value

I-33


Index to Financial Statements

through various transactions, including acquisitions or sales of assets. Specifically, Southern Power continually seeks opportunities to execute its strategy to create value through various transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions, and sales of partnership interests, development and construction of new generating facilities, and entry into PPAs primarily with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers.

Southern Company and its subsidiaries may face significant competition for transactional opportunities and anticipated transactions may not be completed on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, these transactions are intended to, but may not, result in the generation of cash or income, the realization of savings, the creation of efficiencies, or the reduction of risk. These transactions may also affect the liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition of Southern Company and its subsidiaries.

These transactions also involve risks, including:

•

they may not result in an increase in income or provide adequate or expected funds or return on capital or other anticipated benefits;

•

they may result in Southern Company or its subsidiaries entering into new or additional lines of business, which may have new or different business or operational risks;

•

they may not be successfully integrated into the acquiring company's operations and/or internal control processes;

•

the due diligence conducted prior to a transaction may not uncover situations that could result in financial or legal exposure or may not appropriately evaluate the likelihood or quantify the exposure from identified risks;

•

they may result in decreased earnings, revenues, or cash flow;

•

Southern Company, Southern Company Gas, and certain of their subsidiaries have retained obligations in connection with transitional agreements related to dispositions that subject these companies to additional risk;

•

Southern Company or the applicable subsidiary may not be able to achieve the expected financial benefits from the use of funds generated by any dispositions;

•

expected benefits of a transaction may be dependent on the cooperation or performance of a counterparty; or

•

for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas, costs associated with such investments that were expected to be recovered through regulated rates may not be recoverable.

Southern Company and Southern Company Gas are holding companies and Southern Power owns many of its assets indirectly through subsidiaries. Each of these companies is dependent on cash flows from their respective subsidiaries to meet their ongoing and future financial obligations, including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness and, for Southern Company, to pay dividends on its common stock.

Southern Company and Southern Company Gas are holding companies and, as such, they have no operations of their own. Substantially all of Southern Company's and Southern Company Gas' and many of Southern Power's respective consolidated assets are held by subsidiaries. A significant portion of Southern Company Gas' debt is issued by its 100%-owned subsidiary, Southern Company Gas Capital, and is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Southern Company Gas. Southern Company's, Southern Company Gas' and, to a certain extent, Southern Power's ability to meet their respective financial obligations, including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness, and, for Southern Company, to pay dividends on its common stock, is dependent on the net income and cash flows of their respective subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends or to repay borrowed funds. Prior to funding Southern Company, Southern Company Gas, or Southern Power, the respective subsidiaries have financial obligations and, with respect to Southern Company and Southern Company Gas, regulatory restrictions that must be satisfied, including among others, debt service and preferred stock dividends. These subsidiaries are separate legal entities and, except as described below, have no obligation to provide Southern Company, Southern Company Gas, or Southern Power with funds. Certain of Southern Power's assets are held through controlling interests in subsidiaries. In certain cases, distributions without partner consent are limited to available cash, and the subsidiaries are obligated to distribute all available cash to their owners each quarter. In addition, Southern Company, Southern Company Gas, and Southern Power may provide capital contributions or debt financing to subsidiaries under certain circumstances, which would reduce the funds available to meet their respective financial obligations, including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness, and to pay dividends on Southern Company's common stock.

A downgrade in the credit ratings of any of the registrants, Southern Company Gas Capital, or Nicor Gas could negatively affect their ability to access capital at reasonable costs and/or could require posting of collateral or replacing certain indebtedness.

There are a number of factors that rating agencies evaluate to arrive at credit ratings for the registrants, Southern Company Gas Capital, and Nicor Gas, including capital structure, regulatory environment, the ability to cover liquidity requirements, and other commitments for capital. The registrants, Southern Company Gas Capital, and Nicor Gas could experience a downgrade in their ratings if any rating agency concludes that the level of business or financial risk of the industry or the applicable company has deteriorated. Changes in ratings methodologies by the agencies could also have a negative impact on credit ratings. If one or more rating agencies downgrade any registrant, Southern Company Gas Capital, or Nicor Gas, borrowing

I-34


Index to Financial Statements

costs likely would increase, including automatic increases in interest rates under applicable term loans and credit facilities, the pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and, particularly for any downgrade to below investment grade, significant collateral requirements may be triggered in a number of contracts. Any credit rating downgrades could require altering the mix of debt financing currently used, and could require the issuance of secured indebtedness and/or indebtedness with additional restrictive covenants binding the applicable company.

Uncertainty in demand for energy can result in lower earnings or higher costs. If demand for energy falls short of expectations, it could result in potentially stranded assets. If demand for energy exceeds expectations, it could result in increased costs for

purchasing capacity in the open market or building additional electric generation and transmission

facilities or natural gas distribution and storage facilities.

Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Power each engage in a long-term planning process to estimate the optimal mix and timing of new generation assets required to serve future load obligations. Southern Company Gas engages in a long-term planning process to estimate the optimal mix and timing of building new pipelines and storage facilities, replacing existing pipelines, rewatering storage facilities, and entering new markets and/or expanding in existing markets. These planning processes must look many years into the future in order to accommodate the long lead times associated with the permitting and construction of new generation and associated transmission facilities and natural gas distribution and storage facilities. Inherent risk exists in predicting demand as future loads are dependent on many uncertain factors, including economic conditions, customer usage patterns, efficiency programs, and customer technology adoption. Because regulators may not permit the traditional electric operating companies or Southern Company Gas' regulated operating companies to adjust rates to recover the costs of new generation and associated transmission assets and/or new pipelines and related infrastructure in a timely manner or at all, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may not be able to fully recover these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the incurrence of costs and the recovery in customers' rates. In addition, under Southern Power's model of selling capacity and energy at negotiated market-based rates under long-term PPAs, Southern Power might not be able to fully execute its business plan if market prices drop below original forecasts. Southern Power and/or the traditional electric operating companies may not be able to extend existing PPAs or find new buyers for existing generation assets as existing PPAs expire, or they may be forced to market these assets at prices lower than originally intended. These situations could have negative impacts on net income and cash flows for the affected registrant.

The traditional electric operating companies are currently obligated to supply power to retail customers and wholesale customers under long-term PPAs. Southern Power is currently obligated to supply power to wholesale customers under long-term PPAs. At peak times, the demand for power required to meet this obligation could exceed the Southern Company system's available generation capacity. Market or competitive forces may require that the traditional electric operating companies purchase capacity on the open market or build additional generation and transmission facilities and that Southern Power purchase energy or capacity on the open market. Because regulators may not permit the traditional electric operating companies to pass all of these purchase or construction costs on to their customers, the traditional electric operating companies may not be able to recover some or all of these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the incurrence of costs of purchased or constructed capacity and the traditional electric operating companies' recovery in customers' rates. Under Southern Power's long-term fixed price PPAs, Southern Power may not be able to recover all of these costs. These situations could have negative impacts on net income and cash flows for the affected registrant.

The businesses of the registrants, SEGCO, and Nicor Gas are dependent on their ability to successfully access funds through capital markets and financial institutions. The

inability of any of the registrants, SEGCO, or Nicor Gas to access funds may limit its ability to execute its business plan by impacting its ability to fund capital investments or acquisitions that it may otherwise rely on to achieve future earnings and cash flows.

The registrants, SEGCO, and Nicor Gas rely on access to both short-term money markets and longer-term capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from their respective operations. If any of the registrants, SEGCO, or Nicor Gas is not able to access capital at competitive rates or on favorable terms, its ability to implement its business plan will be limited by impacting its ability to fund capital investments or acquisitions that it may otherwise rely on to achieve future earnings and cash flows. In addition, the registrants, SEGCO, and Nicor Gas rely on committed bank lending agreements as back-up liquidity which allows them to access low cost money markets. Each of the registrants, SEGCO, and Nicor Gas believes that it will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets based upon current credit ratings. However, certain events or market disruptions may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to raise capital through the issuance of securities or other borrowing arrangements or the ability to secure committed bank lending agreements used as back-up sources of capital. Such disruptions could include:

•

an economic downturn or uncertainty;

•

bankruptcy or financial distress at an unrelated energy company, financial institution, or sovereign entity;

•

capital markets volatility and disruption, either nationally or internationally;

•

changes in tax policy, including further interpretation and guidance on tax reform;

I-35


Index to Financial Statements

•

volatility in market prices for electricity and natural gas;

•

actual or threatened cyber or physical attacks on the Southern Company system's facilities or unrelated energy companies' facilities;

•

war or threat of war; or

•

the overall health of the utility and financial institution industries.

Georgia Power's ability to make future borrowings through its term loan credit facility with the FFB is subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, as well as certification of compliance with the requirements of the loan guarantee program under Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, including accuracy of project-related representations and warranties, delivery of updated project-related information and evidence of compliance with the prevailing wage requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act of 1931, as amended, and certification from the DOE's consulting engineer that proceeds of the advances are used to reimburse certain costs of construction relating to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 that are eligible for financing under the Title XVII Loan Guarantee Program. Prior to obtaining any further advances under Georgia Power's loan guarantee agreement with the DOE, Georgia Power is required to obtain the DOE's approval of the Bechtel Agreement.

Failure to comply with debt covenants or conditions could adversely affect the ability of the registrants, SEGCO, Southern Company Gas Capital, or Nicor Gas to execute future borrowings.

The debt and credit agreements of the registrants, SEGCO, Southern Company Gas Capital, and Nicor Gas contain various financial and other covenants. Georgia Power's loan guarantee agreement with the DOE contains additional covenants, events of default, and mandatory prepayment events relating to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements, which would negatively affect the applicable company's financial condition and liquidity.

Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan costs and the funding available for nuclear decommissioning.

The costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent on a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plan, changes in actuarial assumptions, government regulations, and/or life expectancy, and the frequency and amount of the Southern Company system's required or voluntary contributions made to the plans. Changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual values, as well as a significant decline in the value of investments that fund the pension and other postretirement plans, if not offset or mitigated by a decline in plan liabilities, could increase pension and other postretirement expense, and the Southern Company system could be required from time to time to fund the pension plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on liquidity by reducing cash flows and could negatively affect results of operations. Additionally, Alabama Power and Georgia Power each hold significant assets in their nuclear decommissioning trusts to satisfy obligations to decommission Alabama Power's and Georgia Power's nuclear plants. The rate of return on assets held in those trusts can significantly impact both the funding available for decommissioning and the funding requirements for the trusts.

The registrants are subject to risks associated with their ability to obtain adequate insurance at acceptable costs.

The financial condition of some insurance companies, actual or threatened physical or cyber attacks, and natural disasters, among other things, could have disruptive effects on insurance markets. The availability of insurance covering risks that the registrants and their respective competitors typically insure against may decrease, and the insurance that the registrants are able to obtain may have higher deductibles, higher premiums, and more restrictive policy terms. Further, the insurance policies may not cover all of the potential exposures or the actual amount of loss incurred.

Any losses not covered by insurance, or any increases in the cost of applicable insurance, could adversely affect the results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition of the affected registrant.

The use of derivative contracts by Southern Company and its subsidiaries in the

normal course of business could result in financial losses that negatively impact the

net income of the registrants or in reported net income volatility.

Southern Company and its subsidiaries use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures, and forwards, to manage their commodity and interest rate exposures and, to a lesser extent, manage foreign currency exchange rate exposure and engage in limited trading activities. The registrants could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform. These risks are managed through risk management policies, limits, and procedures, which might not work as planned and cannot entirely eliminate the risks associated with these activities. In addition, derivative contracts entered into for hedging purposes might not offset the underlying exposure being hedged as expected, resulting in financial losses. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management's judgment or use of estimates. The factors used in the valuation of these instruments become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable further into the

I-36


Index to Financial Statements

future. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.

In addition, Southern Company Gas utilizes derivative instruments to lock in economic value in wholesale gas services, which may not qualify as, or may not be designated as, hedges for accounting purposes. The difference in accounting treatment for the underlying position and the financial instrument used to hedge the value of the contract can cause volatility in reported net income of Southern Company and Southern Company Gas while the positions are open due to mark-to-market accounting.

Future impairments of goodwill or long-lived assets could have a material adverse effect on the registrants' results of operations.

Goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually and more frequently if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value and long-lived assets are assessed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. In connection with the completion of the Merger, the application of the acquisition method of accounting was pushed down to Southern Company Gas. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of Southern Company Gas' assets and liabilities was recorded as goodwill. This resulted in a significant increase in the goodwill recorded on Southern Company's and Southern Company Gas' consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2018, goodwill was

$5.3 billion

and

$5.0 billion

for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas, respectively.

In addition, Southern Company and its subsidiaries have long-lived assets recorded on their balance sheets. To the extent the value of goodwill or long-lived assets become impaired, the affected registrant may be required to incur impairment charges that could have a material impact on their results of operations. For example, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Company Gas owns and operates a natural gas storage facility consisting of two salt dome caverns where recent seismic mapping indicates that proximity of one of the caverns to the edge of the salt dome may be less than the required minimum and could result in Southern Company Gas retiring the cavern early. Early retirement of the cavern could trigger impairment of other long-lived assets associated with the natural gas storage facility. In addition, a subsidiary of Southern Company has several leveraged lease agreements, with terms ranging up to 45 years, which relate to international and domestic energy generation, distribution, and transportation assets. Southern Company receives federal income tax deductions for depreciation and amortization, as well as interest on long-term debt related to these investments. Southern Company reviews all important lease assumptions at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that a change in assumptions has occurred or may occur. With respect to Southern Company's subsidiary's investments in leveraged leases, the recovery of its investment is dependent on the profitable operation of the leased assets by the respective lessees. A significant deterioration in the performance of the leased asset could result in the impairment of the related lease receivable.

Index to Financial Statements

Except as discussed below under "Titles to Property," the principal plants and other important units of the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and SEGCO are owned in fee by the respective companies. It is the opinion of management of each such company that its operating properties are adequately maintained and are substantially in good operating condition, and suitable for their intended purpose.

Mississippi Power owns a 79-mile length of 500-kilovolt transmission line which is leased to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, LLC. The line extends from Plant Daniel to the Louisiana state line. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, LLC is paying a use fee over a 40-year period through 2024 covering all expenses and the amortization of the original cost. At

December 31, 2018

, the unamortized portion was approximately $12 million.

Mississippi Power owns a lignite mine and equipment that were intended to provide fuel for the Kemper IGCC. Mississippi Power also has acquired mineral reserves located around the Kemper County energy facility. Liberty Fuels Company, LLC, the operator of the mine, has a legal obligation to perform mine reclamation and Mississippi Power has a contractual obligation to fund all reclamation activities. As a result of the abandonment of the Kemper IGCC, final mine reclamation began in 2018 and is expected to be substantially completed in 2020, with monitoring expected to continue through 2027. Mississippi Power is currently evaluating its options regarding the final disposition of the CO


pipeline, including removal of the pipeline. This evaluation is expected to be complete later in 2019. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. See Note


to the financial statements under "

pipeline.

In August 2018, Mississippi Power filed a RMP which identified alternatives that, if implemented, could impact Mississippi Power's generating stations as well as Plant Greene County, jointly owned by Mississippi Power and Alabama Power. See BUSINESS in Item 1 herein under "Rate Matters – Integrated Resource Planning – Mississippi Power" for additional information.

In conjunction with Southern Company's sale of Gulf Power, Mississippi Power and Gulf Power have committed to seek a restructuring of their 50% undivided ownership interests in Plant Daniel such that each of them would, after the restructuring, own 100% of a generating unit. On January 15, 2019, Gulf Power provided notice to Mississippi Power that Gulf Power will retire its share of the generating capacity of Plant Daniel on January 15, 2024. Mississippi Power has the option to purchase Gulf Power's ownership interest for $1 on January 15, 2024, provided that Mississippi Power exercises the option no later than 120 days prior to that date. Mississippi Power is assessing the potential operational and economic effects of Gulf Power's notice. The ultimate outcome of these matters remains subject to completion of Mississippi Power's evaluations and applicable regulatory approvals, including the FERC and the Mississippi PSC, and cannot now be determined. See Note

Distribution and Transmission Mains

– Southern Company Gas' distribution systems transport natural gas from its pipeline suppliers to customers in its service areas. These systems consist primarily of distribution and transmission mains, compressor stations, peak shaving/storage plants, service lines, meters, and regulators. At

December 31, 2018

, Southern Company Gas' gas distribution operations segment owned approximately 75,200 miles of underground distribution and transmission mains, which are located on easements or rights-of-way that generally provide for perpetual use.

Storage Assets – Gas Distribution Operations

– Southern Company Gas owns and operates eight underground natural gas storage fields in Illinois with a total working capacity of approximately 150 Bcf, approximately 135 Bcf of which is usually cycled on an annual basis. This system is designed to meet about 50% of the estimated peak-day deliveries and approximately 40% of the normal winter deliveries in Illinois. This level of storage capability provides Nicor Gas with supply flexibility, improves the reliability of deliveries, and helps mitigate the risk associated with seasonal price movements.

Southern Company Gas also has four LNG plants located in Georgia and Tennessee with total LNG storage capacity of approximately 7.4 Bcf. In addition, Southern Company Gas owns two propane storage facilities in Virginia, each with storage capacity of approximately 0.3 Bcf. The LNG plants and propane storage facility are used by Southern Company Gas' gas distribution operations segment to supplement natural gas supply during peak usage periods.

Storage Assets – All Other

– Southern Company Gas subsidiaries own three high-deliverability natural gas storage and hub facilities that are included in the all other segment. Jefferson Island Storage & Hub, LLC operates a storage facility in Louisiana consisting of two salt dome gas storage caverns. Golden Triangle Storage, Inc. operates a storage facility in Texas consisting of two salt dome caverns. Central Valley Gas Storage, LLC operates a depleted field storage facility in California. In addition, Southern Company Gas has a LNG facility in Alabama that produces LNG for Pivotal LNG, Inc. to support its business of selling LNG as a substitute fuel in various markets.

In August 2017, in connection with an ongoing integrity project into the salt dome gas storage caverns in Louisiana, updated seismic mapping indicated the proximity of one of the caverns to the edge of the salt dome may be less than the required minimum and could result in Southern Company Gas retiring the cavern e

arly. See

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

OVERVIEW

Business Activities

Southern Company is a holding company that owns all of the common stock of the traditional electric operating companies and the parent entities of Southern Power and Southern Company Gas and owns other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The primary businesses of the Southern Company system are electricity sales by the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power and the distribution of natural gas by Southern Company Gas.

•

The traditional electric operating companies are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in three Southeastern states as of January 1, 2019. On January 1, 2019, Southern Company completed its sale of Gulf Power to NextEra Energy for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately $5.8 billion (less $1.3 billion of indebtedness assumed), subject to customary working capital adjustments. At December 31, 2018, the assets and liabilities of Gulf Power were classified as held for sale on Southern Company's balance sheet. Unless otherwise noted, the disclosures herein related to specific asset and liability balances at December 31, 2018 exclude assets and liabilities held for sale. See Note


under "

Assets Held for Sale

" for additional information. A preliminary gain of $2.5 billion pre-tax ($1.3 billion after tax) associated with the sale of Gulf Power is expected to be recorded in 2019.

•

Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. On May 22, 2018, Southern Power sold a noncontrolling 33% equity interest in SP Solar, a limited partnership indirectly owning substantially all of Southern Power's solar facilities, for approximately $1.2 billion and, on December 11, 2018, Southern Power sold a noncontrolling tax equity interest in SP Wind, a holding company owning a portfolio of eight operating wind facilities, for approximately $1.2 billion. On November 5, 2018, Southern Power entered into an agreement to sell all of its equity interests in Plant Mankato (including the 385-MW expansion currently under construction) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $650 million, which is expected to close mid-2019. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

•

Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through its natural gas distribution utilities and is involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments, wholesale gas services, and gas marketing services. In July 2018, Southern Company Gas completed sales of three of its natural gas distribution utilities.

See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "General" herein and Note


to the financial statements for additional information regarding disposition activities.

Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Southern Company system's electricity and natural gas businesses. These factors include the ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments, to maintain and grow sales and customers, and to effectively manage and secure timely recovery of costs. These costs include those related to projected long-term demand growth, stringent environmental standards, including CCR rules, reliability, fuel, restoration following major storms, and capital expenditures, including constructing new electric generating plants, expanding and improving the electric transmission and distribution systems, and updating and expanding the natural gas distribution systems.

The traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities have various regulatory mechanisms that operate to address cost recovery. Effectively operating pursuant to these regulatory mechanisms and appropriately balancing required costs and capital expenditures with customer prices will continue to challenge the Southern Company system for the foreseeable future. See Note


to the financial statements for additional information.

In 2018, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, Atlanta Gas Light, and Nicor Gas reached agreements with their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies relating to the regulatory impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation, which, for some companies, included capital structure adjustments expected to help mitigate the potential adverse impacts to certain of their credit metrics. See Note


to the financial statements for additional information regarding state PSC or other regulatory agency actions related to the Tax Reform Legislation. Also see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Income Tax Matters" and FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Credit Rating Risk" herein and Note


to the financial statements for information regarding the Tax Reform Legislation.

Another major factor affecting the Southern Company system's businesses is the profitability of the competitive market-based wholesale generating business. Southern Power's strategy is to create value through various transactions including acquisitions, dispositions, and sales of partnership interests, development and construction of new generating facilities, and entry into PPAs primarily with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. In general, Southern Power commits to the construction or acquisition of new generating capacity only after entering into or assuming long-term PPAs for the new facilities.

Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

Southern Company's other business activities include providing energy solutions, including distributed energy infrastructure, energy efficiency products and services, and utility infrastructure services, to customers. Other business activities also include investments in telecommunications, leveraged lease projects, and gas storage facilities. Management continues to evaluate the contribution of each of these activities to total shareholder return and may pursue acquisitions, dispositions, and other strategic ventures or investments accordingly.

In striving to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns while providing cost-effective energy to more than eight million electric and gas utility customers, the Southern Company system continues to focus on several key performance indicators. These indicators include, but are not limited to, customer satisfaction, plant availability, electric and natural gas system reliability, execution of major construction projects, and earnings per share (EPS). Southern Company's financial success is directly tied to customer satisfaction. Key elements of ensuring customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high reliability, and competitive prices. Management uses customer satisfaction surveys and reliability indicators to evaluate the results of the Southern Company system.

See

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

herein for information on Southern Company's financial performance.

Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 Status

In 2009, the Georgia PSC certified construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (with electric generating capacity of approximately

1,100

MWs each). Georgia Power holds a 45.7% ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. In March 2017, the EPC Contractor filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In December 2017, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's recommendation to continue construction. The current expected in-service dates remain November 2021 for Unit 3 and November 2022 for Unit 4.

In the second quarter 2018, Georgia Power revised its base capital cost forecast and estimated contingency to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to

$8.0 billion

and

$0.4 billion

, respectively, for a total project capital cost forecast of $8.4 billion (net of $1.7 billion received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related Customer Refunds), with respect to Georgia Power's ownership interest. Although Georgia Power believes these incremental costs are reasonable and necessary to complete the project and the Georgia PSC's order in the seventeenth VCM proceeding specifically states that the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is not subject to a cost cap, Georgia Power did not seek rate recovery for the

$0.7 billion

increase in costs included in the current base capital cost forecast (or any related financing costs) in the nineteenth VCM report that was approved by the Georgia PSC on February 19, 2019. In connection with future VCM filings, Georgia Power may request the Georgia PSC to evaluate costs currently included in the construction contingency estimate for rate recovery as and when they are appropriately included in the base capital cost forecast. After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of costs included in the construction contingency estimate since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in these future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded a total pre-tax charge to income of

$1.1 billion

(

$0.8 billion

after tax) in the second quarter 2018.

As a result of the increase in the total project capital cost forecast and Georgia Power's decision not to seek rate recovery of the increase in the base capital costs, the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 were required to vote to continue construction. On September 26, 2018, the Vogtle Owners unanimously voted to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. In connection with the vote to continue construction, Georgia Power entered into (i) a binding term sheet (Vogtle Owner Term Sheet) with the other Vogtle Owners and certain of MEAG's wholly-owned subsidiaries, including MEAG Power SPVJ, LLC (MEAG SPVJ), to take certain actions which partially mitigate potential financial exposure for the other Vogtle Owners and (ii) a term sheet (MEAG Term Sheet) with MEAG and MEAG SPVJ to provide funding with respect to MEAG SPVJ's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 under certain circumstances. On January 14, 2019, Georgia Power, MEAG, and MEAG SPVJ entered into an agreement to implement the provisions of the MEAG Term Sheet. On February 18, 2019, Georgia Power, the other Vogtle Owners, and certain of MEAG's wholly-owned subsidiaries entered into certain amendments to their joint ownership agreements to implement the provisions of the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Earnings

Consolidated net income attributable to Southern Company was

$2.2 billion

in


, an increase of

$1.4 billion

, or

164.4%

,

from the prior year. The increase was primarily due to charges of $3.4 billion ($2.4 billion after tax) in 2017 related to the Kemper IGCC at Mississippi Power, partially offset by a $1.1 billion ($0.8 billion after tax) charge in the second quarter 2018 for an

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

estimated probable loss on Georgia Power's construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. The increase also reflects lower federal income tax expense as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation, partially offset by impairment charges, primarily associated with asset sales at Southern Power and Southern Company Gas.

Consolidated net income attributable to Southern Company was

$842 million

in


, a decrease of

$1.6 billion

, or

65.6%

, from the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to pre-tax charges of $3.4 billion ($2.4 billion after tax) related to the Kemper IGCC at Mississippi Power. Also contributing to the change were increases of $240 million in net income from Southern Company Gas (excluding the impact of $111 million in additional expense related to the Tax Reform Legislation) reflecting the 12-month period in 2017 compared to the six-month period following the Merger closing on July 1, 2016, $264 million related to net tax benefits from the Tax Reform Legislation, higher retail electric revenues resulting from increases in base rates partially offset by milder weather and lower customer usage, and increases in renewable energy sales at Southern Power. These increases were partially offset by higher interest and depreciation and amortization.

increase from 2017. Details of electric operating revenues were as follows:

Retail electric revenues decreased

$108 million

, or

0.7%

, in


as compared to the prior year. The significant factors driving this change are shown in the preceding table. The decrease in rates and pricing in 2018 was primarily due to revenues deferred as regulatory liabilities for customer bill credits related to the Tax Reform Legislation and expected customer refunds at Alabama Power and Georgia Power.

Retail electric revenues increased

$96 million

, or

0.6%

, in


as compared to the prior year. The significant factors driving this change are shown in the preceding table. The increase in rates and pricing in 2017 was primarily due to a Rate RSE increase at Alabama Power effective in January 2017, the recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 construction financing costs under the NCCR tariff at Georgia Power, and an increase in retail base rates effective July 2017 at Gulf Power.

Electric rates for the traditional electric operating companies include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses, including the energy component of PPA costs, and do not affect net income. The traditional electric operating companies each have one or more regulatory mechanisms to recover other costs such as environmental and other compliance costs, storm damage, new plants, and PPA capacity costs.

Wholesale electric revenues consist of PPAs and short-term opportunity sales. Wholesale electric revenues from PPAs (other than solar and wind PPAs) have both capacity and energy components. Capacity revenues generally represent the greatest contribution to net income and are designed to provide recovery of fixed costs plus a return on investment. Energy revenues will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. Energy sales from solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or through a fixed price related to the energy. As a result, the ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Wholesale electric revenues at Mississippi Power include FERC-regulated MRA sales as well as market-based sales. Short-term opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above the Southern Company system's variable cost to produce the energy.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

Wholesale electric revenues from power sales were as follows:

In


, wholesale revenues increased

$90 million

, or

3.7%

, as compared to the prior year due to a

$112 million

increase in energy revenues, partially offset by a

$22 million

decrease in capacity revenues. The increase in energy revenues was primarily related to Southern Power and includes new PPAs related to existing natural gas facilities, new renewable facilities, and an increase in the volume of KWHs sold at existing renewable facilities, partially offset by a decrease in non-PPA revenues from short-term sales. The decrease in capacity revenues was primarily due to the expiration of a wholesale contract in the fourth quarter 2017 at Georgia Power.

In


, wholesale revenues increased

$500 million

, or

26.0%

, as compared to the prior year due to a

$428 million

increase in energy revenues and a

$72 million

increase in capacity revenues, primarily at Southern Power. The increase in energy revenues was primarily due to increases in renewable energy sales arising from new solar and wind facilities and non-PPA revenues from short-term sales. The increase in capacity revenues was primarily due to a PPA related to new natural gas facilities and additional customer capacity requirements.

Other Electric Revenues

Other electric revenues decreased

$17 million

, or

2.5%

, in


as compared to the prior year. The decrease is primarily related to a decrease in open access transmission tariff revenues, largely due to a lower rate related to the Tax Reform Legislation. Other electric revenues decreased

$17 million

, or

2.4%

, in


, as compared to the prior year. The decrease reflects a $15 million decrease in open access transmission tariff revenues, primarily as a result of the expiration of long-term transmission services contracts at Georgia Power.

Energy Sales

Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year. KWH sales for 2018 and the percent change from the prior year were as follows:

Changes in retail energy sales are generally the result of changes in electricity usage by customers, changes in weather, and changes in the number of customers. Retail energy sales increased

5.7 billion

KWHs in


as compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to colder weather in the first quarter 2018 and warmer weather in the second and third quarters 2018 compared to the corresponding periods in 2017. Weather-adjusted residential KWH sales increased primarily due to customer growth. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales increased primarily due to customer growth, partially offset by decreased customer usage resulting from customer initiatives in energy savings and an ongoing migration to the electronic commerce business model. Industrial KWH energy sales increased primarily due to increased sales in the primary metals sector, partially offset by decreased sales in the paper sector.

Retail energy sales decreased

4.2 billion

KWHs in


as compared to the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to milder weather and decreased customer usage, partially offset by customer growth. Weather-adjusted residential KWH sales decreased

II-21

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

primarily due to decreased customer usage resulting from an increase in penetration of energy-efficient residential appliances and an increase in multi-family housing, partially offset by customer growth. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales decreased primarily due to decreased customer usage resulting from customer initiatives in energy savings and an ongoing migration to the electronic commerce business model, partially offset by customer growth. Industrial KWH energy sales were flat primarily due to decreased sales in the paper, stone, clay, and glass, transportation, and chemicals sectors, offset by increased sales in the primary metals and textile sectors. Additionally, Hurricane Irma negatively impacted customer usage for all customer classes.

See "Electric Operating Revenues" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale revenues related to changes in price and KWH sales.

Other Revenues

Other revenues increased

$66 million

, or

64.1%

, in


as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to unregulated sales of products and services that were reclassified from other income (expense), net as a result of the adoption of ASC 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

(ASC 606). See Note


to the financial statements for additional information regarding the adoption of ASC 606.

Other revenues increased

$20 million

in


as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to additional third party infrastructure services.

Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses

The mix of fuel sources for the generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the availability of generating units. Additionally, the electric utilities purchase a portion of their electricity needs from the wholesale market.

Details of the Southern Company system's generation and purchased power were as follows:

(a)

For 2018, cost of fuel, generated and average cost of fuel, generated excludes a $30 million adjustment associated with a May 2018 Alabama PSC accounting order related to excess deferred income taxes.

(b)

Average cost of purchased power includes fuel purchased by the Southern Company system for tolling agreements where power is generated by the provider.

In


, total fuel and purchased power expenses were

$5.6 billion

, an increase of

$345 million

, or

6.6%

, as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily the result of a $178 million increase in the volume of KWHs generated and purchased primarily due to colder weather in the first quarter 2018 and warmer weather in the second and third quarters 2018 compared to the corresponding periods in 2017 and a $137 million increase in the average cost of fuel and purchased power primarily due to higher natural gas prices.

In addition, fuel expense increased $30 million in 2018 as a result of an Alabama PSC accounting order authorizing the amortization of a regulatory liability to offset under recovered fuel costs. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Regulatory Matters – Alabama Power –

Tax Reform Accounting Order

" herein for additional information.

In


, total fuel and purchased power expenses were

$5.3 billion

, an increase of

$152 million

, or

3.0%

, as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily the result of a $196 million increase in the average cost of fuel and purchased power primarily due to higher natural gas prices, partially offset by a $44 million net decrease in the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.

Fuel and purchased power energy transactions at the traditional electric operating companies are generally offset by fuel revenues and do not have a significant impact on net income. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "

Regulatory Matters

Fuel Cost Recovery

" herein for additional information. Fuel expenses incurred under Southern Power's PPAs are generally the responsibility of the counterparties and do not significantly impact net income.

Fuel

In


, fuel expense was

$4.6 billion

, an increase of

$237 million

, or

5.4%

,

as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a 3.6% increase in the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated, a 3.5% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by coal, and a 2.8% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas.

In


, fuel expense was

$4.4 billion

, an increase of

$39 million

, or

0.9%

, as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a 12.5% increase in the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated and a 2.8% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas, partially offset by a 7.9% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by coal and a 7.6% decrease in the average cost of coal per KWH generated.

Purchased Power

In


, purchased power expense was

$971 million

, an increase of

$108 million

, or

12.5%

, as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a 5.2% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased, primarily as a result of higher natural gas prices, and a 5.2% increase in the volume of KWHs purchased.

In


, purchased power expense was

$863 million

, an increase of

$113 million

, or

15.1%

, as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a 7.9% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased, primarily as a result of higher natural gas prices, and a 5.0% increase in the volume of KWHs purchased.

Energy purchases will vary depending on demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation.

Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses

Other operations and maintenance expenses increased

$45 million

, or

1.0%

, in


as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a $74 million increase in transmission and distribution costs, primarily related to additional vegetation management at Georgia Power, and $74 million in expenses from unregulated sales of products and services that were reclassified to other operations and maintenance expenses as a result of the adoption of ASC 606. In prior periods, these expenses were included in other income (expense), net. These increases were partially offset by a $32.5 million charge in the first quarter 2017 related to the write-down of Gulf Power's ownership of Plant Scherer Unit 3 in accordance with a rate case settlement agreement, a $30 million net decrease in employee compensation and benefits, including pension costs, largely due to a decrease in active medical costs at Alabama Power and a 2017 employee attrition plan at Georgia Power, and a $27 million decrease in customer accounts, service, and sales costs primarily due to cost-saving initiatives. See Note


to the financial statements for additional information regarding the adoption of ASC 606.

Other operations and maintenance expenses decreased

$76 million

, or

1.6%

, in


as compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to cost containment and modernization activities implemented at Georgia Power that contributed to decreases of $85 million in generation maintenance costs, $46 million in transmission and distribution overhead line maintenance, $22 million in other employee compensation and benefits, and $22 million in customer accounts, service, and sales costs. Additionally, there was a $34 million decrease in scheduled outage and maintenance costs at generation facilities. These decreases were partially offset by a $56 million increase associated with new facilities at Southern Power, a $37 million increase in transmission and distribution costs primarily due to vegetation management at Alabama Power, and $32.5 million resulting from the write-down of Gulf Power's ownership of Plant Scherer Unit 3 in accordance with a rate case settlement agreement.

Production expenses and transmission and distribution expenses fluctuate from year to year due to variations in outage and maintenance schedules and normal changes in the cost of labor and materials.

Gas Business

Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through utilities in four states and is involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments, wholesale gas services, and gas marketing services.

A condensed statement of income for the gas business follows:

In the table above, the 2018 changes for Southern Company Gas reflect the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The Southern Company Gas Dispositions were completed by July 29, 2018 and represent the primary variance driver for the 2018 changes. Additional detailed variance explanations are provided herein. The 2017 changes reflect the 12-month period in 2017 compared to the six-month period following the Merger closing on July 1, 2016, which is the primary variance driver. Additionally, earnings from equity method investments include Southern Company Gas' acquisition of a 50% equity interest in SNG completed in September 2016. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information on Southern Company Gas' investment in SNG and the Southern Company Gas Dispositions.

Seasonality of Results

During the period from November through March when natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher (Heating Season), more customers are connected to Southern Company Gas' distribution systems, and natural gas usage is higher in periods of colder weather. Occasionally in the summer, operating revenues are impacted due to peak usage by power generators in response to summer energy demands. Southern Company Gas' base operating expenses, excluding cost of natural gas, bad debt expense, and certain incentive compensation costs, are incurred relatively equally over any given year. Thus, operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonality. For


, the percentage of operating revenues and net income generated during the Heating Season (January through March and November through December) were

68.7%

and

96.0%

, respectively. For


, the percentage of operating revenues and net income generated during the Heating Season were

$11 million

decrease

from 2017. Details of operating revenues were as follows:

(*)

Includes a $154 million decrease related to natural gas revenues, including alternative revenue programs, and a $74 million decrease related to other revenues. See Note


to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.

Revenues from infrastructure replacement programs and base rate changes increased in


primarily due to a $48 million increase at Nicor Gas, partially offset by a $12 million decrease at Atlanta Gas Light. These amounts include the natural gas distribution utilities' continued investments recovered through infrastructure replacement programs and base rate increases less revenue reductions for the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. See Note


to the financial statements under "

Southern Company Gas

" for additional information.

Revenues increased due to colder weather, as determined by Heating Degree Days, in


compared to


.

Revenues from wholesale gas services increased in


primarily due to increased commercial activity, partially offset by derivative losses.

Other revenues increased in


primarily due to a $15 million increase from the Dalton Pipeline being placed in service in August 2017 and a $14 million increase in Nicor Gas' revenue taxes.

Natural gas distribution rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from the natural gas distribution utilities.

Cost of Natural Gas

Excluding Atlanta Gas Light, which does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, the natural gas distribution utilities charge their utility customers for natural gas consumed using natural gas cost recovery mechanisms set by the applicable state regulatory agencies. Under these mechanisms, all prudently-incurred natural gas costs are passed through to customers without markup, subject to regulatory review. The natural gas distribution utilities defer or accrue the difference between the actual cost of natural gas and the amount of commodity revenue earned in a given period. The deferred or accrued amount is either billed or refunded to customers prospectively through adjustments to the commodity rate. Deferred natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory assets and accrued natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory liabilities. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from the natural gas distribution utilities. Cost of natural gas at the natural gas distribution utilities represented

83.2%

of the total cost of natural gas for


.

Gas marketing services customers are charged for actual and estimated natural gas consumed. Cost of natural gas includes the cost of fuel and associated transportation costs, lost and unaccounted for gas, adjustments to reduce the value of inventories to market value, if applicable, and gains and losses associated with certain derivatives.

Cost of natural gas in

Effects of Inflation

The electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities are subject to rate regulation that is generally based on the recovery of historical and projected costs. The effects of inflation can create an economic loss since the recovery of costs could be in dollars that have less purchasing power. Southern Power is party to long-term contracts reflecting market-based rates, including inflation expectations. Any adverse effect of inflation on Southern Company's results of operations has not been substantial in recent years.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL

General

The traditional electric operating companies operate as vertically integrated utilities providing electric service to customers within their service territories in the Southeast. On January 1, 2019, Southern Company completed the sale of Gulf Power, one of the traditional electric operating companies, to NextEra Energy. The natural gas distribution utilities provide service to customers in their service territories in Illinois, Georgia, Virginia, and Tennessee. In July 2018, Southern Company Gas completed sales of three of its natural gas distribution utilities. Prices for electricity provided and natural gas distributed to retail customers are set by state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies under cost-based regulatory principles. Retail rates and earnings are reviewed and may be adjusted periodically within certain limitations. Prices for wholesale electricity sales and natural gas distribution, interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power are regulated by the FERC. Southern Power continues to focus on long-term PPAs. In 2018, Southern Power completed sales of noncontrolling interests in entities indirectly owning substantially all of its solar facilities and eight of its wind facilities and also completed sales and entered into an agreement to sell certain of its natural gas plants.

Utility Regulation

" herein and Note


to the financial statements for additional information about regulatory matters.

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of Southern Company's future earnings potential. Future earnings will be impacted by the 2018 disposition activities described herein and in Note


to the financial statements. The level of Southern Company's future earnings depends on numerous factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Southern Company system's primary businesses of selling electricity and distributing natural gas. These factors include the traditional electric operating companies' and the natural gas distribution utilities' ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments that allow for the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs during a time of increasing costs, continued customer growth, and, for the traditional electric operating companies, the weak pace of growth in electricity use per customer, especially in residential and commercial markets. Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 construction and rate recovery and the profitability of Southern Power's competitive wholesale business are also major factors.

Earnings in the electricity business will also depend upon maintaining and growing sales, considering, among other things, the adoption and/or penetration rates of increasingly energy-efficient technologies, increasing volumes of electronic commerce transactions, and more multi-family home construction, all of which could contribute to a net reduction in customer usage. Earnings for both the electricity and natural gas businesses are subject to a variety of other factors. These factors include weather, competition, new energy contracts with other utilities and other wholesale customers, energy conservation practiced by customers, the use of alternative energy sources by customers, the prices of electricity and natural gas, the price elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic growth or decline in the service territory. In addition, the level of future earnings for the wholesale electric business also depends on numerous factors including regulatory matters, creditworthiness of customers, total electric generating capacity available and related costs, the development or acquisition of renewable facilities and other energy projects, and the successful remarketing of capacity as current contracts expire. Demand for electricity and natural gas is primarily driven by the pace of economic growth that may be affected by changes in regional and global economic conditions, which may impact future earnings. In addition, the volatility of natural gas prices has a significant impact on the natural gas distribution utilities' customer rates, long-term competitive position against other energy sources, and the ability of Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services and wholesale gas services businesses to capture value from locational and seasonal spreads. Additionally, changes in commodity prices subject a significant portion of Southern Company Gas' operations to earnings variability.

As part of its ongoing effort to adapt to changing market conditions, Southern Company continues to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential business strategies. These strategies may include business combinations, partnerships, and acquisitions involving other utility or non-utility businesses or properties, disposition of certain assets or businesses, internal restructuring, or some combination thereof. Furthermore, Southern Company may engage in new business ventures that arise from competitive and regulatory changes in the utility industry. Pursuit of any of the above strategies, or any combination thereof, may significantly affect the business operations, risks, and financial condition of Southern Company.

On January 1, 2019, Southern Company completed the sale of Gulf Power to NextEra Energy for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately $5.8 billion (less $1.3 billion of indebtedness assumed), subject to customary working capital adjustments. In 2018, net income attributable to Gulf Power was $160 million.

On June 4, 2018, Southern Company Gas completed the stock sale of Pivotal Home Solutions to American Water Enterprises LLC for a total cash purchase price of $365 million. On July 1, 2018, a Southern Company Gas subsidiary, Pivotal Utility Holdings, completed the sales of the assets of two of its natural gas distribution utilities, Elizabethtown Gas and Elkton Gas, to South Jersey Industries, Inc. for a total cash purchase price of $1.7 billion. On July 29, 2018, Southern Company Gas and its wholly-owned direct subsidiary, NUI Corporation, completed the stock sale of Pivotal Utility Holdings, which primarily consisted of Florida City Gas, to NextEra Energy for a total cash purchase price of $587 million. The total cash purchase price for each transaction includes final working capital and other adjustments.

The Southern Company Gas Dispositions resulted in a net loss of $51 million, which includes $342 million of tax expense. The after-tax impacts of these dispositions included income tax expense on goodwill not deductible for tax purposes and for which a deferred tax liability had not been recorded previously. In addition, a goodwill impairment charge of $42 million was recorded during 2018 in contemplation of the sale of Pivotal Home Solutions.

On May 22, 2018, Southern Power sold a noncontrolling 33% equity interest in SP Solar, a limited partnership indirectly owning substantially all of Southern Power's solar facilities, for approximately $1.2 billion and, on December 11, 2018, sold a noncontrolling tax equity interest in SP Wind, a holding company owning a portfolio of eight operating wind facilities, for approximately $1.2 billion. Additionally, on November 5, 2018, Southern Power entered into an agreement to sell all of its equity interests in Plant Mankato (including the 385-MW expansion currently under construction) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $650 million. The completion of the disposition is subject to the expansion unit reaching commercial operation as well as various other customary conditions to closing, including FERC and state commission approvals, and the sale is expected

Environmental Matters

The Southern Company system's

operations are regulated by state and federal environmental agencies through a variety of laws and regulations governing air, water, land, and protection of other natural resources.

The Southern Company system

maintains comprehensive environmental compliance and GHG strategies to assess upcoming requirements and compliance costs associated with these environmental laws and regulations. The costs, including capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, and costs reflected in ARO liabilities, required to comply with environmental laws and regulations and to achieve stated goals may impact future electric generating unit retirement and replacement decisions, results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition. Related costs may result from the installation of additional environmental controls, closure and monitoring of CCR facilities, unit retirements, or changing fuel sources for certain existing units, as well as related upgrades to

the Southern Company system's

transmission and distribution

(electric and natural gas)

systems. A major portion of these costs is expected to be recovered through

retail and wholesale rates.

The ultimate impact of environmental laws and regulations and the GHG goals discussed herein will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements, the availability and cost of any deployed technology, fuel prices, and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges.

New or revised environmental laws and regulations could affect many areas of

the traditional electric operating companies', Southern Power's, and the natural gas distribution utilities'

operations. The impact of any such changes cannot be determined at this time. Environmental compliance costs could affect earnings if such costs cannot continue to be recovered in rates on a timely basis

for the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities

or through long-term wholesale agreements

for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power

. Further, increased costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity

and natural gas

, which could negatively affect results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition.

Additionally, many commercial and industrial customers may also be affected by existing and future environmental requirements, which for some may have the potential to ultimately affect their demand for electricity

and

natural gas

.

The Southern Company system's commitment to the environment has been demonstrated in many ways, including participating in partnerships resulting in approximately $140 million of funding that has restored or enhanced more than 2 million acres of habitat since 2003; the removal of more than 15.5 million pounds of trash and debris from waterways between 2000 and 2018 through the Renew Our Rivers program; a 21.2% reduction in surface water withdrawal from 2015 to 2017; reductions in SO


and NO

X

air emissions of 98% and 89%, respectively, from 1990 to 2017; the reduction of mercury air emissions of over 95% from 2005 to 2017; and the Southern Company system's changing energy mix.

Through


, the traditional electric operating companies have invested approximately $14.2 billion in environmental capital retrofit projects to comply with environmental requirements, with annual totals of approximately $1.3 billion, $0.9 billion, and $0.5 billion for


,


, and


, respectively. Although the timing, requirements, and estimated costs could change as environmental laws and regulations are adopted or modified, as compliance plans are revised or updated, and as legal challenges to rules are initiated or completed, the Southern Company system's current compliance strategy estimates capital expenditures of

$1.4 billion

from

Environmental Laws and Regulations

Air Quality

The EPA has set National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for six air pollutants (carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, particulate matter, and SO


) to protect and improve the nation's air quality, which it reviews and revises periodically. Following a NAAQS revision, states are required to develop an EPA-approved plan to protect air quality. These state plans can require additional emission controls, improvements in control efficiency, or fuel changes which can result in increased compliance and operational costs. NAAQS requirements can also adversely affect the siting of new electric generating facilities.

All areas within

the Southern Company system's electric

service territory have been designated as attainment for all NAAQS

II-32


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

except for a seven-county area within metropolitan Atlanta that is not in attainment with the 2015 ozone NAAQS and the area surrounding Plant Hammond

, in Georgia

, which will not be designated attainment or nonattainment for the 2010 SO


standard until December 2020

. If areas

are designated as nonattainment in the future, increased compliance costs could result.

See "Regulatory Matters – Georgia Power – Integrated Resource Plan" herein for information regarding Georgia Power's request to decertify and retire Plant Hammond.

In 2011, the EPA finalized the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) to address impacts of SO


and NO

X

emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating plants. CSAPR establishes emissions trading programs and budgets for certain states and allocates emissions allowances for sources in those states.

In 2016, the EPA published a final rule establishing more stringent ozone season NO

X

emissions budgets in

Alabama

,

Mississippi

,

and

Texas

.

Georgia's ozone season NO

X

emissions budget remained unchanged.

The EPA also removed

North Carolina from this particular CSAPR program.

The outcome of ongoing CSAPR litigation concerning the 2016 CSAPR rule, to which

Mississippi Power

is a party, could have an impact on the State of Mississippi's ozone season NO

X

emissions budget.

Increases in either future fossil fuel-fired generation or the availability or cost of CSAPR allowances could have a negative financial impact on results of operations for

Southern Company

.

The EPA finalized regional haze regulations in 2005 and 2017. These regulations require states, tribal governments, and various federal agencies to develop and implement plans to reduce pollutants that impair visibility and demonstrate reasonable progress toward the goal of restoring natural visibility conditions in certain areas, including national parks and wilderness areas.

States must submit a revised state implementation plan (SIP) to the EPA demonstrating continued reasonable progress towards achieving visibility improvement goals. These plans could require reductions in certain pollutants, such as particulate matter, SO


, and NO

X

, which could result in increased compliance costs.

The EPA approved the regional progress SIPs for the States of Alabama and Georgia, but only issued a limited approval of the regional progress SIP for the State of Mississippi because Mississippi must revise the best available retrofit technology (BART) provisions of its SIP. Therefore, Mississippi Power's Plant Daniel is the only electric generating unit in the Southern Company system that continues to be evaluated under the regional haze BART provisions.

Mississippi Power is required to submit Plant Daniel's BART analysis to the State of Mississippi by summer 2019. Requirements for further reduction of these pollutants at Plant Daniel could increase compliance costs.

Water Quality

In 2014, the EPA finalized requirements under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) to regulate cooling water intake structures (CWIS) to minimize their effects on fish and other aquatic life at existing power plants (e.g. coal, natural gas, oil, and nuclear generating plants) and manufacturing facilities. The regulation requires plant-specific studies to determine applicable CWIS changes to protect organisms that either get caught on the intake screens (impingement) or are drawn into the cooling system (entrainment).

The Southern Company system

is conducting these studies and currently anticipates applicable CWIS changes may include fish-friendly CWIS screens with fish return systems

and minor additions of monitoring equipment at certain plants.

However, the ultimate impact of this rule will depend on the outcome of these plant-specific studies, any additional protective measures required to be incorporated into each plant's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit based on site-specific factors, and the outcome of any legal challenges.

In 2015, the EPA finalized the steam electric effluent limitations guidelines (ELG) rule (2015 ELG Rule) that set national standards for wastewater discharges from new and existing steam electric generating units generating greater than 50 MWs. The 2015 ELG Rule prohibits effluent discharges of certain waste streams and imposes stringent limits on flue gas desulfurization (scrubber) wastewater discharges. The revised technology-based limits and the CCR Rule require extensive changes to existing ash and wastewater management systems or the installation and operation of new ash and wastewater management systems. Compliance with the 2015 ELG Rule is expected to require capital expenditures and increased operational costs primarily for

the traditional electric operating companies'

coal-fired electric generation. State environmental agencies will incorporate specific compliance applicability dates in the NPDES permitting process for each ELG waste stream no later than December 31, 2023. The EPA is scheduled to issue a new rulemaking by December 2019 that could revise the limitations and applicability dates of two of the waste streams regulated in the 2015 ELG Rule. The impact of any changes to the 2015 ELG Rule will depend on the content of the new rule and the outcome of any legal challenges.

In 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) jointly published a final rule that revised the regulatory definition of waters of the United States (WOTUS) for all CWA programs. The rule significantly expanded the scope of federal jurisdiction over waterbodies (such as rivers, streams, canals, and wastewater treatment ponds), which could impact new generation projects

and permitting and reporting requirements associated with the installation, expansion, and maintenance of transmission

, distribution, and pipeline projects.

The EPA and the Corps are expected to publish a final rule in 2019 to replace the 2015 WOTUS definition. The impact of any changes to the 2015 WOTUS rule will depend on the content of this final rule and the outcome of any legal challenges.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

Coal Combustion Residuals

In 2015, the EPA finalized non-hazardous solid waste regulations for the disposal of CCR, including coal ash and gypsum, in landfills and surface impoundments (ash ponds) at active generating power plants.

In addition to the EPA's CCR Rule, the States of Alabama and Georgia have also finalized regulations regarding the handling of CCR within their respective states.

The EPA's CCR Rule requires landfills and ash ponds to be evaluated against a set of performance criteria and potentially closed if minimum criteria are not met. Closure of existing landfills and ash ponds could require installation of equipment and infrastructure to manage CCR in accordance with the CCR Rule.

Based on cost estimates for closure and monitoring of landfills and ash ponds pursuant to the CCR Rule,

the Southern Company system recorded AROs for each CCR unit in 2015. As further analysis was performed and closure details were developed, the traditional electric operating companies have continued

to periodically update these cost estimates, as discussed further below.

The EPA published certain amendments to the CCR Rule, which became effective August 29, 2018. These amendments extend the date from April 2019 to October 31, 2020 to cease sending CCR and other waste streams to ash ponds that demonstrate compliance with all except two of the specified performance criteria.

On August 21, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a decision suggesting the EPA should regulate previously-excluded inactive ash ponds located at retired generation facilities and questioning both the ability of unlined ash ponds to continue operating no matter the performance criteria results and the classification of clay-lined landfills and ash ponds.

These developments could impact the expected timing of

the traditional electric operating companies'

landfill and ash pond closure activities, but the extent of any impact will depend on the outcome of ongoing litigation, anticipated EPA rulemaking action to establish further guidance, and the outcome of any legal challenges.

In June 2018, Alabama Power recorded an increase of approximately $1.2 billion to its AROs related to the CCR Rule.

The revised cost estimates were based on information from feasibility studies performed on ash ponds in use at plants operated by Alabama Power

, including at a plant jointly-owned by Mississippi Power.

During the second quarter 2018, Alabama Power's management completed its analysis of these studies which indicated that additional closure costs, primarily related to increases in estimated ash volume, water management requirements, and design revisions, will be required to close these ash ponds under the planned closure-in-place methodology.

As the level of work becomes more defined in the next 12 months, it is likely that these cost estimates will change and the change could be material.

In December 2018, Georgia Power recorded an increase of approximately

$3.1 billion

to its AROs related to the CCR Rule and the related state rule. During the second half of 2018, Georgia Power completed a strategic assessment related to its plans to close the ash ponds at all of its generating plants in compliance with the CCR Rule and the related state rule. This assessment included engineering and constructability studies related to design assumptions for ash pond closures and advanced engineering methods. The results indicated that additional closure costs will be required to close these ash ponds, primarily due to changes in closure strategies, the estimated amount of ash to be excavated, and additional water management requirements necessary to support closure strategies. These factors also impact the estimated timing of future cash outlays.

The traditional electric operating companies expect to periodically update their ARO cost estimates. Absent continued recovery of ARO costs through regulated rates, Southern Company's results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition could be materially impacted. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations" herein and Note


to the financial statements for additional information.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Nuclear Decommissioning

In June 2018, Alabama Power completed an updated decommissioning cost site study for Plant Farley. The estimated cost of decommissioning based on the study resulted in an increase in Alabama Power's ARO liability of approximately $300 million. Amounts previously contributed to Alabama Power's external trust funds are currently projected to be adequate to meet the updated decommissioning obligations.

In December 2018, Georgia Power completed updated decommissioning cost site studies for Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2. The estimated cost of decommissioning based on the studies resulted in an increase in Georgia Power's ARO liability of approximately $130 million. Georgia Power currently collects $4 million and $2 million annually in rates, which is used to fund external nuclear decommissioning trusts for Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, respectively. Georgia Power expects the Georgia PSC to review and adjust, if necessary, these amounts in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case.

Environmental Remediation

The Southern Company system must comply with environmental laws and regulations governing the handling and disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations, the Southern Company system could incur substantial costs to clean up affected sites. The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities conduct studies to determine the extent of any required cleanup and Southern Company has recognized the estimated costs to clean up known impacted sites in its financial statements. Amounts for cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs were not material for any year presented. The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities in Illinois and Georgia have all received authority from their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies to recover approved environmental compliance costs through regulatory mechanisms. These regulatory mechanisms are adjusted annually or as necessary within limits approved by the state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas may be liable for some or all required cleanup costs for additional sites that may require environmental remediation. See Note 3 to the financial statements under "

Environmental Remediation

" for additional information.

Global Climate Issues

On August 31, 2018, the EPA published a proposed rule known as the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule, which is intended to replace a regulation enacted in 2015 known as the Clean Power Plan (CPP), that would limit CO


emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. The CPP has been stayed by the U.S. Supreme Court since 2016. The ACE Rule would require states to develop GHG unit-specific emission rate standards based on heat-rate efficiency improvements for existing fossil fuel-fired steam units. As proposed, combustion turbines, including natural gas combined cycles, are not affected sources. As of January 1, 2019,

the Southern Company system has ownership interests in 40

fossil fuel-fired steam units to which the proposed ACE Rule is applicable. The ultimate impact of this rule to

the Southern Company system

is currently unknown and will depend on changes between the proposal and the final rule, subsequent state plan developments and requirements, and any associated legal challenges.

On December 20, 2018, the EPA published a proposed review of the Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from New, Modified, and Reconstructed Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units final rule (2015 NSPS rule). The EPA's final 2015 NSPS rule set standards of performance for new, modified, and reconstructed electric utility generating units which included stationary combustion turbines and fossil-fired steam boilers. This proposal reduces the stringency of the 2015 NSPS rule by not basing the new and reconstructed fossil-fired steam boiler and IGCC standards on partial carbon capture and sequestration. The impact of any changes to this rule will depend on the content of the final rule and the outcome of any legal challenges.

Additional domestic GHG policies may emerge in the future requiring the United States to transition to a lower GHG emitting economy. The Southern Company system has transitioned from an electric generating mix of 70% coal and 15% natural gas in 2007 to a mix of 30% coal and 46% natural gas in 2018, along with over 8,000 MWs of renewable resources. This transition has been supported in part by the Southern Company system retiring 4,226 MWs of coal- and oil-fired generating capacity since 2010 and converting 3,280 MWs of generating capacity from coal to natural gas since 2015. In addition, Southern Company Gas has replaced approximately 5,600 miles of bare steel and cast-iron pipe, resulting in removal of approximately 2.5 million metric tons of GHG from its natural gas distribution system since 1998. Based on ownership or financial control of facilities, the Southern Company system's 2017 GHG emissions (CO


equivalent) were approximately 98 million metric tons, with 2018 emissions estimated at 98 million metric tons. This equates to a reduction of 36% between 2007 and 2018. The 2018 estimates include GHG emissions attributable to each of Elizabethtown Gas, Elkton Gas, Florida City Gas, and the Florida Plants through the date of the applicable disposition. See Note

In April 2018, Southern Company established an intermediate goal of a 50% reduction in carbon emissions from 2007 levels by 2030 and a long-term goal of low- to no-carbon operations by 2050. To achieve these goals, the Southern Company system expects to continue growing its renewable energy portfolio, optimize technology advancements to modernize its transmission and distribution systems, increase the use of natural gas for generation,

complete ongoing construction projects, including Georgia Power's interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4,

invest in energy efficiency, and continue research and development efforts focused on technologies to lower GHG emissions. The Southern Company system's ability to achieve these goals also will be dependent on many external factors, including supportive national energy policies, low natural gas prices, and the development, deployment, and advancement of relevant energy technologies.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

FERC Matters

Open Access Transmission Tariff

On May 10, 2018, AMEA and Cooperative Energy filed with the FERC a complaint against SCS and the traditional electric operating companies

claiming that the current

11.25%

base ROE used in calculating the annual transmission revenue requirements of the traditional electric operating companies'

open access transmission tariff is unjust and unreasonable as measured by the applicable FERC standards. The complaint requested that the base ROE be set no higher than

8.65%

and that the FERC order refunds for the difference in revenue requirements that results from applying a just and reasonable ROE established in this proceeding upon determining the current ROE is unjust and unreasonable.

On June 18, 2018, SCS and the traditional electric operating companies

filed their response challenging the adequacy of the showing presented by the complainants and offering support for the current ROE. On September 6, 2018, the FERC issued an order establishing a refund effective date of May 10, 2018 in the event a refund is due and initiating an investigation and settlement procedures regarding the current base ROE.

Through December 31, 2018, the estimated maximum potential refund is not expected to be material to

Southern Company's

results of operations or cash flows.

The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Southern Company Gas

Southern Company Gas' gas pipeline investments business is involved in two significant pipeline construction projects, the Atlantic Coast Pipeline (5% ownership) and the PennEast Pipeline (20% ownership), which received FERC approval in October 2017 and January 2018, respectively. Southern Company Gas' total capital expenditures, excluding AFUDC, at completion are expected to be between $350 million and $390 million for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and $276 million for the PennEast Pipeline. These projects, along with Southern Company Gas' existing pipelines, are intended to provide diverse sources of natural gas supplies to customers, resolve current and long-term supply planning for new capacity, enhance system reliability, and generate economic development in the areas served.

Work continues with state and federal agencies to obtain the required permits to begin construction on the PennEast Pipeline. Any material delays may impact forecasted capital expenditures and the expected in-service date.

The Atlantic Coast Pipeline has experienced challenges to its permits since construction began in 2018. During the third and fourth quarters 2018, a FERC stop work order, together with delays in obtaining permits necessary for construction and construction delays due to judicial actions, impacted the cost and schedule for the project. As a result, total project cost estimates have increased from between $6.0 billion and $6.5 billion to between $7.0 billion and $7.8 billion, excluding financing costs. Southern Company Gas' share of the total project costs is 5% and Southern Company Gas' investment at December 31, 2018 totaled $83 million. The operator of the joint venture currently expects to achieve a late 2020 in-service date for at least key segments of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, while the remainder may extend into early 2021. Southern Company Gas has evaluated the recoverability of its investment and determined there was no impairment as of December 31, 2018. Abnormal weather, work delays (including due to judicial or regulatory action), and other conditions may result in additional cost or schedule modifications, which could result in an impairment of Southern Company Gas' investment and could have a material impact on Southern Company's financial statements.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. See Notes

Regulatory Matters

Alabama Power

Alabama Power

's revenues from regulated retail operations are collected through various rate mechanisms subject to the oversight of the Alabama PSC.

Alabama Power

currently recovers its costs from the regulated retail business primarily through Rate RSE, Rate CNP, Rate ECR, and Rate NDR. In addition, the Alabama PSC issues accounting orders to address current events impacting

Alabama Power. See Note


to the financial statements under "

Alabama Power

" for additional information regarding Alabama Power's rate mechanisms and accounting orders.

Rate RSE

The Alabama PSC has adopted Rate RSE that provides for periodic annual adjustments based upon Alabama Power's projected weighted common equity return (WCER) compared to an allowable range. Rate RSE adjustments are based on forward-looking information for the applicable upcoming calendar year. Rate RSE adjustments for any two-year period, when averaged together, cannot exceed 4.0% and any annual adjustment is limited to 5.0%. When the projected WCER is under the allowed range, there is

II-36


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

an adjusting point of 5.98% and eligibility for a performance-based adder of seven basis points, or 0.07%, to the WCER adjusting point if Alabama Power (i) has an "A" credit rating equivalent with at least one of the recognized rating agencies or (ii) is in the top one-third of a designated customer value benchmark survey. If Alabama Power's actual retail return is above the allowed WCER range, the excess will be refunded to customers unless otherwise directed by the Alabama PSC; however, there is no provision for additional customer billings should the actual retail return fall below the WCER range. Prior to January 2019, retail rates remained unchanged when the WCER range was between 5.75% and 6.21%.

On May 1, 2018, the Alabama PSC approved modifications to Rate RSE and other commitments designed to position Alabama Power to address the growing pressure on its credit quality resulting from the Tax Reform Legislation, without increasing retail rates under Rate RSE in the near term. Alabama Power plans to reduce growth in total debt by increasing equity, with corresponding reductions in debt issuances, thereby de-leveraging its capital structure. Alabama Power's goal is to achieve an equity ratio of approximately 55% by the end of 2025. At December 31, 2018, Alabama Power's equity ratio was approximately 47%.

The approved modifications to Rate RSE began for billings in January 2019. The modifications include reducing the top of the allowed WCER range from 6.21% to 6.15% and modifications to the refund mechanism applicable to prior year actual results. The modifications to the refund mechanism allow Alabama Power to retain a portion of the revenue that causes the actual WCER for a given year to exceed the allowed range.

Generally, if Alabama Power's actual WCER is between 6.15% and 7.65%, customers will receive 25% of the amount between 6.15% and 6.65%, 40% of the amount between 6.65% and 7.15%, and 75% of the amount between 7.15% and 7.65%. Customers will receive all amounts in excess of an actual WCER of 7.65%.

In conjunction with these modifications to Rate RSE, on May 8, 2018, Alabama Power consented to a moratorium on any upward adjustments under Rate RSE for 2019 and 2020 and will also return $50 million to customers through bill credits in 2019.

On November 30, 2018, Alabama Power made its required annual Rate RSE submission to the Alabama PSC of projected data for calendar year 2019. Projected earnings were within the specified range; therefore, retail rates under Rate RSE remain unchanged for 2019.

At December 31, 2018, Alabama Power's retail return exceeded the allowed WCER range, which resulted in Alabama Power establishing a regulatory liability of $109 million for Rate RSE refunds. In accordance with an Alabama PSC order issued on February 5, 2019, Alabama Power will apply $75 million to reduce the Rate ECR under recovered balance and the remaining $34 million will be refunded to customers through bill credits in July through September 2019.

Rate CNP PPA

Alabama Power's retail rates, approved by the Alabama PSC, provide for adjustments under Rate CNP to recognize the placing of new generating facilities into retail service. Alabama Power may also recover retail costs associated with certificated PPAs under Rate CNP PPA. No adjustments to Rate CNP PPA occurred during the period 2016 through 2018 and no adjustment is expected in 2019.

In accordance with an accounting order issued in February 2017 by the Alabama PSC, Alabama Power reclassified $69 million of the December 31, 2016 Rate CNP PPA under recovered balance to a separate regulatory asset. The amortization of the new regulatory asset through Rate RSE will begin concurrently with the effective date of Alabama Power's next depreciation study, which is expected to occur no later than 2022.

Rate CNP Compliance

Rate CNP Compliance allows for the recovery of Alabama Power's retail costs associated with laws, regulations, and other such mandates directed at the utility industry involving the environment, security, reliability, safety, sustainability, or similar considerations impacting Alabama Power's facilities or operations. Rate CNP Compliance is based on forward-looking information and provides for the recovery of these costs pursuant to a factor that is calculated annually. Compliance costs to be recovered include operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation, and a return on certain invested capital. Revenues for Rate CNP Compliance, as recorded on the financial statements, are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor will have no significant effect on revenues or net income, but will affect annual cash flow. Changes in Rate CNP Compliance-related operations and maintenance expenses and depreciation generally will have no effect on net income.

In accordance with an accounting order issued in February 2017 by the Alabama PSC, Alabama Power reclassified $36 million of its under recovered balance in Rate CNP Compliance to a separate regulatory asset. The amortization of the new regulatory asset

II-37

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

through Rate RSE will begin concurrently with the effective date of Alabama Power's next depreciation study, which is expected to occur no later than 2022.

On November 30, 2018, Alabama Power submitted calculations associated with its cost of complying with environmental mandates, as provided under Rate CNP Compliance. The filing reflected a projected unrecovered retail revenue requirement for environmental compliance of approximately $205 million, which is being recovered in the billing months of January 2019 through December 2019.

Tax Reform Accounting Order

On May 1, 2018, the Alabama PSC approved an accounting order that authorized Alabama Power to defer the benefits of federal excess deferred income taxes associated with the Tax Reform Legislation for the year ended December 31, 2018 as a regulatory liability and to use up to $30 million of such deferrals to offset under recovered amounts under Rate ECR. The estimated deferrals for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled approximately $63 million, subject to adjustment following the filing of the 2018 tax return, of which $30 million was used to offset the Rate ECR under recovered balance and $33 million is recorded in other regulatory liabilities, deferred on the balance sheet to be used for the benefit of customers as determined by the Alabama PSC at a future date. See Note


to the financial statements under "Current and Deferred Income Taxes" for additional information.

Environmental Accounting Order

Based on an order from the Alabama PSC (Environmental Accounting Order), Alabama Power is allowed to establish a regulatory asset to record the unrecovered investment costs, including the unrecovered plant asset balance and the unrecovered costs associated with site removal and closure associated with future unit retirements caused by environmental regulations. The regulatory asset is being amortized and recovered over the affected unit's remaining useful life, as established prior to the decision regarding early retirement through Rate CNP Compliance. At December 31, 2018, this regulatory asset had a balance of $42 million. See "

Environmental Matters

–

Environmental Laws and Regulations

" herein for additional information regarding environmental regulations.

Subsequent to December 31, 2018, Alabama Power determined that Plant Gorgas Units 8, 9, and 10 (approximately

1,000

MWs) will be retired by April 15, 2019 due to the expected costs of compliance with federal and state environmental regulations. In accordance with the Environmental Accounting Order, approximately

$740 million

of net investment costs will be transferred to a regulatory asset at the retirement date and recovered over the affected units' remaining useful lives, as established prior to the decision to retire.

Georgia Power

Georgia Power's

revenues from regulated retail operations are collected through various rate mechanisms subject to the oversight of the Georgia PSC.

Georgia Power currently recovers its costs from the regulated retail business through the 2013 ARP, which includes traditional base tariff rates, Demand-Side Management (DSM) tariffs, Environmental Compliance Cost Recovery (ECCR) tariffs, and Municipal Franchise Fee (MFF) tariffs. Georgia Power is scheduled to file a base rate case by July 1, 2019, which may continue or modify these tariffs. In addition, financing costs on certified construction costs of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are being collected through the NCCR tariff and fuel costs are collected through a separate fuel cost recovery tariff. See Note


to the financial statements under "

Georgia Power

" for additional information.

Rate Plans

Pursuant to the terms and conditions of a settlement agreement related to Southern Company's acquisition of Southern Company Gas approved by the Georgia PSC in 2016, the 2013 ARP will continue in effect until December 31, 2019, and Georgia Power will be required to file its next base rate case by July 1, 2019. Furthermore, through December 31, 2019, Georgia Power will retain its merger savings, net of transition costs, as defined in the settlement agreement; through December 31, 2022, such net merger savings will be shared on a 60/40 basis with customers; thereafter, all merger savings will be retained by customers. See Note


to the financial statements under "

Southern Company Merger with Southern Company Gas

" for additional information regarding the Merger.

There were no changes to Georgia Power's traditional base tariff rates, ECCR tariff, DSM tariffs, or MFF tariff in 2017 or 2018.

Under the 2013 ARP, Georgia Power's retail ROE is set at 10.95% and earnings are evaluated against a retail ROE range of 10.00% to 12.00%. Two-thirds of any earnings above 12.00% will be directly refunded to customers, with the remaining one-third retained by Georgia Power. There will be no recovery of any earnings shortfall below 10.00% on an actual basis. In 2016, Georgia Power's retail ROE exceeded 12.00%, and Georgia Power refunded to retail customers in 2018 approximately $40 million as approved by the Georgia PSC. On February 5, 2019, the Georgia PSC approved a settlement between Georgia Power and the staff

II-38

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

of the Georgia PSC under which Georgia Power's retail ROE for 2017 was stipulated to exceed 12.00% and Georgia Power will reduce certain regulatory assets by approximately $4 million in lieu of providing refunds to retail customers. In 2018, Georgia Power's retail ROE exceeded 12.00%, and Georgia Power accrued approximately $100 million to refund to retail customers, subject to review and approval by the Georgia PSC.

On April 3, 2018, the Georgia PSC approved the Georgia Power Tax Reform Settlement Agreement. Pursuant to the Georgia Power Tax Reform Settlement Agreement, to reflect the federal income tax rate reduction impact of the Tax Reform Legislation, Georgia Power will refund to customers a total of $330 million through bill credits. Georgia Power issued bill credits of approximately $130 million in 2018 and will issue bill credits of approximately $95 million in June 2019 and $105 million in February 2020. In addition, Georgia Power is deferring as a regulatory liability (i) the revenue equivalent of the tax expense reduction resulting from legislation lowering the Georgia state income tax rate from 6.00% to 5.75% in 2019 and (ii) the entire benefit of federal and state excess accumulated deferred income taxes, which is expected to total approximately $700 million at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2018, the related regulatory liability balance totaled

$610 million

. The amortization of these regulatory liabilities is expected to be addressed in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case. If there is not a base rate case in 2019, customers will receive $185 million in annual bill credits beginning in 2020, with any additional federal and state income tax savings deferred as a regulatory liability, until Georgia Power's next base rate case.

To address some of the negative cash flow and credit quality impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation, the Georgia PSC also approved an increase in Georgia Power's retail equity ratio to the lower of (i) Georgia Power's actual common equity weight in its capital structure or (ii)

55%

, until the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case. At December 31, 2018, Georgia Power's actual retail common equity ratio (on a 13-month average basis) was approximately

55%

. Benefits from reduced federal income tax rates in excess of the amounts refunded to customers will be retained by Georgia Power to cover the carrying costs of the incremental equity in 2018 and 2019.

Integrated Resource Plan

See "

Environmental Matters

" herein for additional information regarding proposed and final EPA rules and regulations, including revisions to ELG for steam electric power plants and additional regulations of CCR and CO


.

In 2016, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's triennial Integrated Resource Plan (2016 IRP) including the reclassification of the remaining net book value of Plant Mitchell Unit 3 and costs associated with materials and supplies remaining at the unit retirement date to a regulatory asset. Recovery of the unit's net book value will continue through December 31, 2019, as provided in the 2013 ARP. The timing of the recovery of the remaining balance of the unit's net book value as of December 31, 2019 and costs associated with materials and supplies remaining at the unit retirement date was deferred for consideration in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case.

In the 2016 IRP, the Georgia PSC also approved recovery of costs up to $99 million through June 30, 2019 to preserve nuclear generation as an option at a future generation site in Stewart County, Georgia. In March 2017, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's decision to suspend work at the site due to changing economics, including lower load forecasts and fuel costs. The timing of recovery for costs incurred of approximately

$50 million

is expected to be determined by the Georgia PSC in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case.

On January 31, 2019, Georgia Power filed its triennial IRP (2019 IRP). The filing includes a request to decertify and retire Plant Hammond Units 1 through 4 (840 MWs) and Plant McIntosh Unit 1 (142.5 MWs) upon approval of the 2019 IRP.

In the 2019 IRP, Georgia Power requested approval to reclassify the remaining net book value of Plant Hammond Units 1 through 4 (approximately

$520 million

at December 31, 2018) upon retirement to a regulatory asset to be amortized ratably over a period equal to the applicable unit's remaining useful life through 2035. For Plant McIntosh Unit 1, Georgia Power requested approval to reclassify the remaining net book value (approximately

$40 million

at December 31, 2018) upon retirement to a regulatory asset to be amortized over a

three

-year period to be determined in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case. Georgia Power also requested approval to reclassify any unusable material and supplies inventory balances remaining at the applicable unit's retirement date to a regulatory asset for recovery over a period to be determined in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case.

The 2019 IRP also includes a request to certify approximately


MWs of capacity at Plant Scherer Unit 3 for the retail jurisdiction beginning January 1, 2020, following the expiration of a wholesale PPA.

The 2019 IRP also includes details regarding ARO costs associated with ash pond and landfill closures and post-closure care. Georgia Power requested the timing and rate of recovery of these costs be determined by the Georgia PSC in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case.

Georgia Power also requested approval to issue

two

capacity-based requests for proposals (RFP). If approved, the first capacity-based RFP will seek resources that can provide capacity beginning in 2022 or 2023 and the second capacity-based RFP will seek resources that can provide capacity beginning in 2026, 2027, or 2028. Additionally, the 2019 IRP includes a request to procure an additional

1,000

MWs of renewable resources through a competitive bidding process. Georgia Power also proposed to invest in a portfolio of up to


MWs of battery energy storage technologies.

A decision from the Georgia PSC on the 2019 IRP is expected in mid-2019.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Storm Damage Recovery

Georgia Power is accruing $30 million annually through December 31, 2019, as provided in the 2013 ARP, for incremental operations and maintenance costs of damage from major storms to its transmission and distribution facilities. At December 31, 2018, the total balance in the regulatory asset related to storm damage was $416 million. During October 2018, Hurricane Michael caused significant damage to Georgia Power's transmission and distribution facilities. The incremental restoration costs related to this hurricane deferred in the regulatory asset for storm damage totaled approximately $115 million. Hurricanes Irma and Matthew also caused significant damage to Georgia Power's transmission and distribution facilities during September 2017 and October 2016, respectively. The incremental restoration costs related to Hurricanes Irma and Matthew deferred in Georgia Power's regulatory asset for storm damage totaled approximately

$250 million

. The rate of storm damage cost recovery is expected to be adjusted as part of the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case and further adjusted in future regulatory proceedings as necessary.

The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Mississippi Power

Mississippi Power's retail base rates generally are set under the PEP, a rate plan approved by the Mississippi PSC.

Two

filings are made for each calendar year: the PEP projected filing, which is typically filed prior to the beginning of the year based on a projected revenue requirement, and the PEP lookback filing, which is filed after the end of the year and allows for review of the actual revenue requirement compared to the projected filing.

On February 7, 2018, Mississippi Power revised its annual projected PEP filing for 2018 to reflect the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. The revised filing requested an increase of $26 million in annual revenues, based on a performance adjusted ROE of 9.33% and an increased equity ratio of 55%. On July 27, 2018, Mississippi Power and the MPUS entered into a settlement agreement with respect to the 2018 PEP filing and all unresolved PEP filings for prior years (PEP Settlement Agreement), which was approved by the Mississippi PSC on August 7, 2018. Rates under the PEP Settlement Agreement became effective with the first billing cycle of September 2018. The PEP Settlement Agreement provides for an increase of approximately $21.6 million in annual base retail revenues, which excludes certain compensation costs contested by the MPUS, as well as approximately $2 million which was subsequently approved for recovery through Mississippi Power's 2018 Energy Efficiency Cost Rider.

Pursuant to the PEP Settlement Agreement, Mississippi Power's performance-adjusted allowed ROE is 9.31% and its allowed equity ratio is capped at 51%, pending further review by the Mississippi PSC. In lieu of the requested equity ratio increase, Mississippi Power retained $44 million of excess accumulated deferred income taxes resulting from the Tax Reform Legislation until the conclusion of Mississippi Power's next base rate case, which is scheduled to be filed in the fourth quarter 2019 (Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case). Further, Mississippi Power agreed to seek equity contributions sufficient to restore its equity ratio to 50% by December 31, 2018.

Pursuant to the PEP Settlement Agreement, PEP proceedings are suspended until after the conclusion of the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case and Mississippi Power is not required to make any PEP filings for regulatory years 2018, 2019, and 2020. The PEP Settlement Agreement also resolved all open PEP filings with no change to customer rates.

Kemper County Energy Facility

In 2018, Mississippi Power recorded pre-tax charges to income of

$37 million

(

$27 million

after tax), primarily resulting from the abandonment and related closure activities and ongoing period costs, net of sales proceeds, for the mine and gasifier-related assets at the Kemper County energy facility. In addition, Mississippi Power recorded a credit to earnings of

$95 million

in the fourth quarter 2018 primarily resulting from the reduction of a valuation allowance for a state income tax net operating loss (NOL)

carryforward associated with the Kemper County energy facility. Additional closure costs for the mine and gasifier-related assets, currently estimated at up to

$10 million

pre-tax (excluding salvage, net of dismantlement costs), may be incurred through the first half of 2020. In addition, period costs, including, but not limited to, costs for compliance and safety, ARO accretion, and property taxes for the mine and gasifier-related assets, are estimated to total

$11 million

in 2019 and

$2 million

to

$4 million

2020 through 2023. Mississippi Power is currently evaluating its options regarding the final disposition of the CO


pipeline, including removal of the pipeline. This evaluation is expected to be complete later in 2019. If Mississippi Power ultimately decides to remove the CO


pipeline, the cost of removal could have a material impact on Southern Company's financial statements.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

The combined cycle and associated common facilities portions of the Kemper County energy facility were dedicated as Plant Ratcliffe on April 27, 2018.

Reserve Margin Plan

On August 6, 2018, Mississippi Power filed its proposed Reserve Margin Plan (RMP), as required by the Mississippi PSC's order in the docket established for the purposes of pursuing a global settlement of the costs related to the Kemper County energy facility. Under the RMP, Mississippi Power proposed alternatives that would reduce its reserve margin, with the most economic of the alternatives being the two-year and seven-year acceleration of the retirement of Plant Watson Units 4 and 5, respectively, to the first quarter 2022 and the four-year acceleration of the retirement of Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 to the third quarter 2021 and the third quarter 2022, respectively, in order to lower or avoid operating costs. The Plant Greene County unit retirements would require the completion by Alabama Power of proposed transmission and system reliability improvements, as well as agreement by Alabama Power. The RMP filing also states that, in the event the Mississippi PSC ultimately approves an alternative that includes an accelerated retirement, Mississippi Power would require authorization to defer in a regulatory asset for future recovery the remaining net book value of the units at the time of retirement. A decision by the Mississippi PSC that does not include recovery of the remaining book value of any generating units retired could have a material impact on Southern Company's financial statements. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Government Grants

In 2010, the DOE, through a cooperative agreement with SCS, agreed to fund

$270 million

of the Kemper County energy facility through the grants awarded to the project by the DOE under the Clean Coal Power Initiative Round 2. Through December 31, 2018, Mississippi Power received total DOE grants of

$387 million

, of which

$382 million

reduced the construction costs of the Kemper County energy facility and

$5 million

reimbursed Mississippi Power for expenses associated with DOE reporting.

On December 12, 2018, Mississippi Power filed with the DOE its request for property closeout certification under the contract related to the

grants received. Mississippi Power and the DOE are currently in discussions regarding the requested closeout and property disposition, which may require payment to the DOE for a portion of certain property that is to be retained by Mississippi Power. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time; however, it could have a

significant impact on Southern Company's financial statements.

Southern Company Gas

The natural gas distribution utilities are subject to regulation and oversight by their respective state regulatory agencies for the rates charged to their customers and other matters.

The natural gas market for Atlanta Gas Light was deregulated in 1997. Accordingly, Marketers, rather than a traditional utility, sell natural gas to end-use customers in Georgia and handle customer billing functions. Atlanta Gas Light earns revenue for its distribution services by charging rates to its customers based primarily on monthly fixed charges that are set by the Georgia PSC and adjusted periodically.

With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the natural gas distribution utilities are authorized by the relevant regulatory agencies in the states in which they serve to use natural gas cost recovery mechanisms that adjust rates to reflect changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas and ensure recovery of all costs prudently incurred in purchasing natural gas for customers. Natural gas cost recovery revenues are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable natural gas costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Changes in the billing factor will not have a significant effect on revenues or net income, but will affect cash flows. In addition to natural gas cost recovery mechanisms, there are other cost recovery mechanisms, such as regulatory riders, which vary by utility but allow recovery of certain costs, such as those related to infrastructure replacement programs, as well as environmental remediation and energy efficiency plans.

Rate Proceedings

On February 23, 2018, Atlanta Gas Light revised its annual base rate filing to reflect the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation and requested a $16 million rate reduction in 2018. On May 15, 2018, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation for Atlanta Gas Light's annual base rates to remain at the 2017 level for 2018 and 2019, with customer credits of $8 million in each of July 2018 and October 2018 to reflect the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. The Georgia PSC maintained Atlanta Gas Light's previously authorized earnings band based on a ROE between 10.55% and 10.95% and increased the allowed equity ratio by 4% to an equity ratio of 55% to address the negative cash flow and credit metric impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. Additionally, Atlanta Gas Light is required to file a traditional base rate case on or before June 1, 2019 for rates effective January 1, 2020.

On January 31, 2018, the Illinois Commission approved a $137 million increase in Nicor Gas' annual base rate revenues, including $93 million related to the recovery of investments under Nicor Gas' infrastructure program, effective February 8, 2018, based on a ROE of 9.8%.

On May 2, 2018, the Illinois Commission approved Nicor Gas' rehearing request for revised base rates to incorporate the reduction in the federal income tax rate as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation. The resulting decrease of approximately $44 million in annual base rate revenues became effective May 5, 2018. Nicor Gas' previously-authorized capital structure and ROE of 9.80% were not addressed in the rehearing and remain unchanged. On November 9, 2018, Nicor Gas filed a general base rate case with the Illinois Commission requesting a $230 million increase in annual base rate revenues. The requested increase is based on a projected test year for the 12-month period ending September 30, 2020, a ROE of 10.6%, and an increase in the equity ratio from 52.0% to 54.0% to address the negative cash flow and credit metric impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. The Illinois Commission is expected to rule on the requested increase within the 11-month statutory time limit, after which rate adjustments will be effective. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Fuel Cost Recovery

The traditional electric operating companies each have established fuel cost recovery rates approved by their respective state PSCs. Fuel cost recovery revenues are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable fuel costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor will not have a significant effect on Southern Company's revenues or net income, but will affect cash flow. The traditional electric operating companies continuously monitor their under or over recovered fuel cost balances and make appropriate filings with their state PSCs to adjust fuel cost recovery rates as necessary.

Construction Program

Overview

The subsidiary companies of Southern Company are engaged in continuous construction programs to accommodate existing and estimated future loads on their respective systems. The Southern Company system intends to continue its strategy of developing and constructing new electric generating facilities, adding environmental modifications to certain existing units, expanding and improving the electric transmission and distribution systems, and updating and expanding the natural gas distribution systems. For the traditional electric operating companies, major generation construction projects are subject to state PSC approval in order to be included in retail rates. While Southern Power generally constructs and acquires generation assets covered by long-term PPAs, any uncontracted capacity could negatively affect future earnings. Southern Company Gas is engaged in various infrastructure improvement programs designed to update or expand the natural gas distribution systems of the natural gas distribution utilities to improve reliability and meet operational flexibility and growth. The natural gas distribution utilities recover their investment and a return associated with these infrastructure programs through their regulated rates. See Note

Nuclear Construction

In 2009, the Georgia PSC certified construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Georgia Power holds a 45.7% ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. In 2012, the NRC issued the related combined construction and operating licenses, which allowed full construction of the

two

AP1000 nuclear units (with electric generating capacity of approximately

1,100

MWs each) and related facilities to begin. Until March 2017, construction on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 continued under the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement, which was a substantially fixed price agreement. In March 2017, the EPC Contractor filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

In connection with the EPC Contractor's bankruptcy filing, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the Vogtle Owners, entered into the Interim Assessment Agreement with the EPC Contractor to allow construction to continue. The Interim Assessment Agreement expired in July 2017 when Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the other Vogtle Owners, and the EPC Contractor entered into the Vogtle Services Agreement. Under the Vogtle Services Agreement, Westinghouse provides facility design and engineering services, procurement and technical support, and staff augmentation on a time and materials cost basis. The Vogtle Services Agreement provides that it will continue until the start-up and testing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are complete and electricity is generated and sold from both units. The Vogtle Services Agreement is terminable by the Vogtle Owners upon


days' written notice.

In October 2017, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the other Vogtle Owners, executed the Bechtel Agreement, a cost reimbursable plus fee arrangement, whereby Bechtel is reimbursed for actual costs plus a base fee and an at-risk fee, which is subject to adjustment based on Bechtel's performance against cost and schedule targets. Each Vogtle Owner is severally (not jointly) liable for its proportionate share, based on its ownership interest, of all amounts owed to Bechtel under the Bechtel Agreement. The Vogtle Owners may terminate the Bechtel Agreement at any time for their convenience, provided that the Vogtle Owners will be required to pay amounts related to work performed prior to the termination (including the applicable portion of the base fee), certain termination-related costs, and, at certain stages of the work, the applicable portion of the at-risk fee. Bechtel may terminate the Bechtel Agreement under certain circumstances, including certain Vogtle Owner suspensions of work, certain breaches of the Bechtel Agreement by the Vogtle Owners, Vogtle Owner insolvency, and certain other events. Pursuant to the Loan Guarantee Agreement between Georgia Power and the DOE, Georgia Power is required to obtain the DOE's approval of the Bechtel Agreement prior to obtaining any further advances under the Loan Guarantee Agreement.

Cost and Schedule

Georgia Power's approximate proportionate share of the remaining estimated capital cost to complete Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 by the expected in-service dates of November 2021 and November 2022, respectively, is as follows:

(a)

Excludes financing costs expected to be capitalized through AFUDC of approximately

$315 million

.

(b)

Net of

$1.7 billion

received from Toshiba under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately

$188 million

in related Customer Refunds.

Georgia Power estimates that its financing costs for construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 will total approximately

$3.1 billion

, of which

$1.9 billion

had been incurred through

December 31, 2018

.

As construction continues, challenges with management of contractors, subcontractors, and vendors; labor productivity, availability, and/or cost escalation; procurement, fabrication, delivery, assembly, and/or installation and testing, including any

II-43

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

required engineering changes, of plant systems, structures, and components (some of which are based on new technology that only recently began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale); or other issues could arise and change the projected schedule and estimated cost. Monthly construction production targets required to maintain the current project schedule will continue to increase significantly throughout 2019. To meet these increasing monthly targets, existing craft construction productivity must improve and additional craft laborers must be retained and deployed.

Georgia Power and Southern Nuclear believe it is a leading practice in connection with a construction project of this size and complexity to periodically validate recent construction progress in comparison to the projected schedule and to verify and update quantities of commodities remaining to install, labor productivity, and forecasted staffing needs. This verification process, led by Southern Nuclear, was underway as of December 31, 2018 and is expected to be completed during the second quarter 2019. Georgia Power currently does not anticipate any material changes to the total estimated project capital cost forecast for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 or the expected in-service dates of November 2021 and November 2022, respectively, resulting from this verification process. However, the ultimate impact on cost and schedule, if any, will not be known until the verification process is completed. Georgia Power is required to report the results and any project impacts to the Georgia PSC by May 15, 2019.

There have been technical and procedural challenges to the construction and licensing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 at the federal and state level and additional challenges may arise. Processes are in place that are designed to assure compliance with the requirements specified in the Westinghouse Design Control Document and the combined construction and operating licenses, including inspections by Southern Nuclear and the NRC that occur throughout construction. As a result of such compliance processes, certain license amendment requests have been filed and approved or are pending before the NRC. Various design and other licensing-based compliance matters, including the timely resolution of ITAAC and the related approvals by the NRC, may arise, which may result in additional license amendments or require other resolution. If any license amendment requests or other licensing-based compliance issues are not resolved in a timely manner, there may be delays in the project schedule that could result in increased costs.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. However, any extension of the project schedule is currently estimated to result in additional base capital costs of approximately

$50 million

per month, based on Georgia Power's ownership interests, and AFUDC of approximately

$12 million

per month. While Georgia Power is not precluded from seeking recovery of any future capital cost forecast increase, management will ultimately determine whether or not to seek recovery. Any further changes to the capital cost forecast that are not expected to be recoverable through regulated rates will be required to be charged to income and such charges could be material.

Joint Owner Contracts

In November 2017, the Vogtle Owners entered into an amendment to their joint ownership agreements for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to provide for, among other conditions, additional Vogtle Owner approval requirements. Effective August 31, 2018, the Vogtle Owners further amended the joint ownership agreements to clarify and provide procedures for certain provisions of the joint ownership agreements related to adverse events that require the vote of the holders of at least

90%

of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to continue construction (as amended, and together with the November 2017 amendment, the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements). The Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements also confirm that the Vogtle Owners' sole recourse against Georgia Power or Southern Nuclear for any action or inaction in connection with their performance as agent for the Vogtle Owners is limited to removal of Georgia Power and/or Southern Nuclear as agent, except in cases of willful misconduct.

As a result of the increase in the total project capital cost forecast and Georgia Power's decision not to seek rate recovery of the increase in the base capital costs as described below, the holders of at least

90%

of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 were required to vote to continue construction. On September 26, 2018, the Vogtle Owners unanimously voted to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.

Amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements

In connection with the vote to continue construction, Georgia Power entered into (i) the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet with the other Vogtle Owners and MEAG's wholly-owned subsidiaries MEAG SPVJ, MEAG Power SPVM, LLC (MEAG SPVM), and MEAG Power SPVP, LLC (MEAG SPVP) to take certain actions which partially mitigate potential financial exposure for the other Vogtle Owners, including additional amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements and the purchase of PTCs from the other Vogtle Owners, and (ii) the MEAG Term Sheet with MEAG and MEAG SPVJ to provide funding with respect to MEAG SPVJ's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (Project J) under certain circumstances. On January 14, 2019, Georgia Power, MEAG, and MEAG SPVJ entered into an agreement to implement the provisions of the MEAG Term Sheet (MEAG Funding Agreement). On February 18, 2019, Georgia Power, the other Vogtle Owners, and MEAG's wholly-owned subsidiaries MEAG SPVJ, MEAG SPVM, and MEAG SPVP entered into certain amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements to implement the provisions of the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet (Global Amendments).

II-44


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

Pursuant to the Global Amendments, and consistent with the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet, the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements were modified as follows: (i) each Vogtle Owner must pay its proportionate share of qualifying construction costs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 based on its ownership percentage up to the estimated cost at completion (EAC) for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 which formed the basis of Georgia Power's forecast of

$8.4 billion

in the nineteenth VCM plus

$800 million

; (ii) Georgia Power will be responsible for

55.7%

of actual qualifying construction costs between

$800 million

and

$1.6 billion

over the EAC in the nineteenth VCM (resulting in

$80 million

of potential additional costs to Georgia Power), with the remaining Vogtle Owners responsible for

44.3%

of such costs pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests; and (iii) Georgia Power will be responsible for

65.7%

of qualifying construction costs between

$1.6 billion

and

$2.1 billion

over the EAC in the nineteenth VCM (resulting in a further

$100 million

of potential additional costs to Georgia Power), with the remaining Vogtle Owners responsible for

34.3%

of such costs pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests.

If the EAC is revised and exceeds the EAC in the nineteenth VCM by more than

$2.1 billion

, each of the other Vogtle Owners will have a one-time option at the time the project budget forecast is so revised to tender a portion of its ownership interest to Georgia Power in exchange for Georgia Power's agreement to pay

100%

of such Vogtle Owner's remaining share of total construction costs in excess of the EAC in the nineteenth VCM plus

$2.1 billion

. In this event, Georgia Power will have the option of cancelling the project in lieu of purchasing a portion of the ownership interest of any other Vogtle Owner. If Georgia Power accepts the offer to purchase a portion of another Vogtle Owner's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, the ownership interest(s) to be conveyed from the tendering Vogtle Owner(s) to Georgia Power will be calculated based on the proportion of the cumulative amount of construction costs paid by each such tendering Vogtle Owner(s) and by Georgia Power as of the COD of Plant Vogtle Unit 4. For purposes of this calculation, payments made by Georgia Power on behalf of another Vogtle Owner in accordance with the second and third items described in the paragraph above will be treated as payments made by the applicable Vogtle Owner.

In the event the actual costs of construction at completion of a Unit are less than the EAC reflected in the nineteenth VCM report and such Unit is placed in service in accordance with the schedule projected in the nineteenth VCM report (i.e., Plant Vogtle Unit 3 is placed in service by November 2021 or Plant Vogtle Unit 4 is placed in service by November 2022), Georgia Power will be entitled to

60.7%

of the cost savings with respect to the relevant Unit and the remaining Vogtle Owners will be entitled to

39.3%

of such savings on a pro rata basis in accordance with their respective ownership interests.

For purposes of the foregoing provisions, qualifying construction costs will not include costs (i) resulting from force majeure events, including governmental actions or inactions (or significant delays associated with issuance of such actions) that affect the licensing, completion, start-up, operations, or financing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, administrative proceedings or litigation regarding ITAAC or other regulatory challenges to commencement of operation of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, and changes in laws or regulations governing Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, (ii) legal fees and legal expenses incurred due to litigation with contractors or subcontractors that are not subsidiaries or affiliates of Southern Company, and (iii) additional costs caused by requests from the Vogtle Owners other than Georgia Power, except for the exercise of a right to vote granted under the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements, that increase costs by

$100,000

or more.

Pursuant to the Global Amendments, and consistent with the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet, the provisions of the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements requiring that Vogtle Owners holding

90%

of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 vote to continue construction following certain adverse events (Project Adverse Events) were modified. Pursuant to the Global Amendments, the holders of at least

90%

of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 must vote to continue construction if certain Project Adverse Events occur, including: (i) the bankruptcy of Toshiba; (ii) the termination or rejection in bankruptcy of certain agreements, including the Vogtle Services Agreement, the Bechtel Agreement, or the agency agreement with Southern Nuclear; (iii) Georgia Power publicly announces its intention not to submit for rate recovery any portion of its investment in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 or the Georgia PSC determines that any of Georgia Power's costs relating to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 will not be recovered in retail rates, excluding any additional amounts paid by Georgia Power on behalf of the other Vogtle Owners pursuant to the Global Amendments described above and the first

6%

of costs during any

six

-month VCM reporting period that are disallowed by the Georgia PSC for recovery, or for which Georgia Power elects not to seek cost recovery, through retail rates; and (iv) an incremental extension of

one year

or more over the most recently approved schedule. Under the Global Amendments, Georgia Power may cancel the project at any time in its sole discretion.

In addition, pursuant to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements, the required approval of holders of ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is at least (i)

90%

for a change of the primary construction contractor and (ii)

67%

for material amendments to the Vogtle Services Agreement or agreements with Southern Nuclear or the primary construction contractor, including the Bechtel Agreement.

The Global Amendments provide that if the holders of at least

90%

of the ownership interests fail to vote in favor of continuing the project following any future Project Adverse Event, work on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 will continue for a period of


days if

II-45


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

the holders of more than

50%

of the ownership interests vote in favor of continuing construction (Majority Voting Owners). In such a case, the Vogtle Owners (i) have agreed to negotiate in good faith towards the resumption of the project, (ii) if no agreement is reached during such


-day period, the project will be cancelled, and (iii) in the event of such a cancellation, the Majority Voting Owners will be obligated to reimburse any other Vogtle Owner for the incremental costs it incurred during such


-day negotiation period.

Purchase of PTCs During Commercial Operation

Pursuant to the Global Amendments, and consistent with the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet, Georgia Power has agreed to purchase additional PTCs from OPC, Dalton, MEAG SPVM, MEAG SPVP, and MEAG SPVJ (to the extent any MEAG SPVJ PTC rights remain after any purchases required under the MEAG Funding Agreement as described below) at varying purchase prices dependent upon the actual cost to complete construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 as compared to the EAC reflected in the nineteenth VCM report. The purchases are at the option of the applicable Vogtle Owner.

Potential Funding to MEAG Project J

Pursuant to the MEAG Funding Agreement, and consistent with the MEAG Term Sheet, if MEAG SPVJ is unable to make its payments due under the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements solely as a result of the occurrence of one of the following situations that materially impedes access to capital markets for MEAG for Project J: (i) the conduct of JEA or the City of Jacksonville, such as JEA's legal challenges of its obligations under a PPA with MEAG (PPA-J), or (ii) PPA-J is declared void by a court of competent jurisdiction or rejected by JEA under the applicable provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (each of (i) and (ii), a JEA Default), at MEAG's request, Georgia Power will purchase from MEAG SPVJ the rights to PTCs attributable to MEAG SPVJ's share of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (approximately


MWs) within 30 days of such request at varying prices dependent upon the stage of construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. The aggregate purchase price of the PTCs, together with any advances made as described in the next paragraph, shall not exceed

$300 million

.

At the option of MEAG, as an alternative or supplement to Georgia Power's purchase of PTCs as described above, Georgia Power has agreed to provide up to

$250 million

in funding to MEAG for Project J in the form of advances (either advances under the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements or the purchase of MEAG Project J bonds, at the discretion of Georgia Power), subject to any required approvals of the Georgia PSC and the DOE.

In the event MEAG SPVJ certifies to Georgia Power that it is unable to fund its obligations under the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements as a result of a JEA Default and Georgia Power becomes obligated to provide funding as described above, MEAG is required to (i) assign to Georgia Power its right to vote on any future Project Adverse Event and (ii) diligently pursue JEA for its breach of PPA-J. In addition, Georgia Power agreed that it will not sue MEAG for any amounts due from MEAG SPVJ under MEAG's guarantee of MEAG SPVJ's obligations so long as MEAG SPVJ complies with the terms of the MEAG Funding Agreement as to its payment obligations and the other non-payment provisions of the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements.

Under the terms of the MEAG Funding Agreement, Georgia Power may cancel the project in lieu of providing funding in the form of advances or PTC purchases.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Regulatory Matters

In 2009, the Georgia PSC voted to certify construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 with a certified capital cost of

$4.418 billion

. In addition, in 2009 the Georgia PSC approved inclusion of the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 related CWIP accounts in rate base, and the State of Georgia enacted the Georgia Nuclear Energy Financing Act, which allows Georgia Power to recover financing costs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Financing costs are recovered on all applicable certified costs through annual adjustments to the NCCR tariff up to the certified capital cost of

$4.418 billion

. At

December 31, 2018

, Georgia Power had recovered approximately

$1.9 billion

of financing costs. Financing costs related to capital costs above

$4.418 billion

will be recovered through AFUDC; however, Georgia Power will not record AFUDC related to any capital costs in excess of the total deemed reasonable by the Georgia PSC (currently

$7.3 billion

) and not requested for rate recovery. On December 18, 2018, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's request to increase the NCCR tariff by

$88 million

annually, effective January 1, 2019.

Georgia Power is required to file semi-annual VCM reports with the Georgia PSC by February 28 and August 31 of each year. In 2013, in connection with the eighth VCM report, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation between Georgia Power and the staff of the Georgia PSC to waive the requirement to amend the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 certificate in accordance with the 2009 certification order until the completion of Plant Vogtle Unit 3, or earlier if deemed appropriate by the Georgia PSC and Georgia Power.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

In 2016, the Georgia PSC voted to approve a settlement agreement (Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement) resolving certain prudency matters in connection with the fifteenth VCM report. In December 2017, the Georgia PSC voted to approve (and issued its related order on January 11, 2018) Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report, which included a recommendation to continue construction with Southern Nuclear as project manager and Bechtel serving as the primary construction contractor, and modified the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement. The Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, as modified by the January 11, 2018 order, resolved the following regulatory matters related to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4: (i) none of the

$3.3 billion

of costs incurred through December 31, 2015 and reflected in the fourteenth VCM report should be disallowed from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (ii) the Contractor Settlement Agreement was reasonable and prudent and none of the amounts paid pursuant to the Contractor Settlement Agreement should be disallowed from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (iii) (a) capital costs incurred up to

$5.68 billion

would be presumed to be reasonable and prudent with the burden of proof on any party challenging such costs, (b) Georgia Power would have the burden to show that any capital costs above

$5.68 billion

were prudent, and (c) a revised capital cost forecast of

$7.3 billion

(after reflecting the impact of payments received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and related Customer Refunds) was found reasonable; (iv) construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 should be completed, with Southern Nuclear serving as project manager and Bechtel as primary contractor; (v) approved and deemed reasonable Georgia Power's revised schedule placing Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in service in November 2021 and November 2022, respectively; (vi) confirmed that the revised cost forecast does not represent a cost cap and that prudence decisions on cost recovery will be made at a later date, consistent with applicable Georgia law; (vii) reduced the ROE used to calculate the NCCR tariff (a) from

10.95%

(the ROE rate setting point authorized by the Georgia PSC in the 2013 ARP) to

10.00%

effective January 1, 2016, (b) from

10.00%

to

8.30%

, effective January 1, 2020, and (c) from

8.30%

to

5.30%

, effective January 1, 2021 (provided that the ROE in no case will be less than Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt); (viii) reduced the ROE used for AFUDC equity for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from

10.00%

to Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt, effective January 1, 2018; and (ix) agreed that upon Unit 3 reaching commercial operation, retail base rates would be adjusted to include carrying costs on those capital costs deemed prudent in the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement. The January 11, 2018 order also stated that if Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are not commercially operational by June 1, 2021 and June 1, 2022, respectively, the ROE used to calculate the NCCR tariff will be further reduced by 10 basis points each month (but not lower than Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt) until the respective Unit is commercially operational. The ROE reductions negatively impacted earnings by approximately

$100 million

,

$25 million

, and

$20 million

in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, and are estimated to have negative earnings impacts of approximately

$75 million

in 2019 and an aggregate of approximately

$615 million

from 2020 to 2022.

In its January 11, 2018 order, the Georgia PSC also stated if other conditions change and assumptions upon which Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report are based do not materialize, the Georgia PSC reserved the right to reconsider the decision to continue construction.

On February 12, 2018, Georgia Interfaith Power & Light, Inc. (GIPL) and Partnership for Southern Equity, Inc. (PSE) filed a petition appealing the Georgia PSC's January 11, 2018 order with the Fulton County Superior Court. On March 8, 2018, Georgia Watch filed a similar appeal to the Fulton County Superior Court for judicial review of the Georgia PSC's decision and denial of Georgia Watch's motion for reconsideration. On December 21, 2018, the Fulton County Superior Court granted Georgia Power's motion to dismiss the two appeals. On January 9, 2019, GIPL, PSE, and Georgia Watch filed an appeal of this decision with the Georgia Court of Appeals. Georgia Power believes the appeal has no merit; however, an adverse outcome in the appeal combined with subsequent adverse action by the Georgia PSC could have a material impact on Southern Company's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

In preparation for its nineteenth VCM filing, Georgia Power requested Southern Nuclear to perform a full cost reforecast for the project. This reforecast, performed prior to the nineteenth VCM filing, resulted in a

$0.7 billion

increase to the base capital cost forecast reported in the second quarter 2018. This base cost increase primarily resulted from changed assumptions related to the finalization of contract scopes and management responsibilities for Bechtel and over


subcontractors, labor productivity rates, and craft labor incentives, as well as the related levels of project management, oversight, and support, including field supervision and engineering support.

Although Georgia Power believes these incremental costs are reasonable and necessary to complete the project and the Georgia PSC's order in the seventeenth VCM proceeding specifically states that the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is not subject to a cost cap, Georgia Power did not seek rate recovery for these cost increases included in the current base capital cost forecast (or any related financing costs) in the nineteenth VCM report. In connection with future VCM filings, Georgia Power may request the Georgia PSC to evaluate costs currently included in the construction contingency estimate for rate recovery as and when they are appropriately included in the base capital cost forecast. After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of costs included in the construction contingency estimate since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in these future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded a total pre-tax charge to income of

$1.1 billion

tax) in the second quarter 2018, which includes the total increase in the base capital cost forecast and construction contingency estimate.

On August 31, 2018, Georgia Power filed its nineteenth VCM report with the Georgia PSC, which requested approval of

$578 million

of construction capital costs incurred from January 1, 2018 through June 30, 2018. On February 19, 2019, the Georgia PSC approved the nineteenth VCM, but deferred approval of

$51.6 million

of expenditures related to Georgia Power's portion of an administrative claim filed in the Westinghouse bankruptcy proceedings. Through the nineteenth VCM, the Georgia PSC has approved total construction capital costs incurred through June 30, 2018 of

$5.4 billion

(before

$1.7 billion

of payments received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately

$188 million

in related Customer Refunds). In addition, the staff of the Georgia PSC requested, and Georgia Power agreed, to file its twentieth VCM report concurrently with the twenty-first VCM report by August 31, 2019.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

DOE Financing

At

December 31, 2018

, Georgia Power had borrowed

$2.6 billion

related to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 costs through the Loan Guarantee Agreement and a multi-advance credit facility among Georgia Power, the DOE, and the FFB, which provides for borrowings of up to

$3.46 billion

, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. In September 2017, the DOE issued a conditional commitment to Georgia Power for up to approximately

Income Tax Matters

Federal Tax Reform Legislation

In December 2017, the Tax Reform Legislation was signed into law and became effective on January 1, 2018. The Tax Reform Legislation, among other things, reduced the federal corporate income tax rate to 21%, retained normalization provisions for public utility property and existing renewable energy incentives, and repealed the corporate alternative minimum tax.

In addition, under the Tax Reform Legislation, NOLs generated after December 31, 2017 can no longer be carried back to previous tax years but can be carried forward indefinitely, with utilization limited to 80% of taxable income of the subsequent tax year. The projected reduction of the consolidated income tax liability resulting from the tax rate reduction also delays the expected utilization of existing tax credit carryforwards.

Following the enactment of the Tax Reform Legislation, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 – "Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" (SAB 118), which provided for a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date to complete accounting under GAAP for the tax effects of the legislation. Due to the complex and comprehensive nature of the enacted tax law changes and their application under GAAP, Southern Company considered all amounts recorded in the financial statements as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation "provisional" as discussed in SAB 118 and subject to revision prior to filing its 2017 tax return in the fourth quarter 2018. Southern Company recognized tax benefits of $30 million and $264 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, for a total net tax benefit of $294 million as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation. In addition, in total, Southern Company recorded a $417 million decrease in regulatory assets and a $6.2 billion increase in regulatory liabilities as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation and $16 million of stranded excess deferred tax balances in AOCI at December 31, 2017 were adjusted through retained earnings in 2018. As of December 31, 2018, Southern Company considered the measurement of impacts from the Tax Reform Legislation on deferred income tax assets and liabilities, primarily due to the impact of the reduction of the corporate income tax rate, to be complete.

However, the IRS continues to issue regulations that provide further interpretation and guidance on the law and each state's adoption of the provisions contained in the Tax Reform Legislation remains uncertain. In addition, the regulatory treatment of certain impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation is subject to the discretion of the FERC and each state's regulatory commission. The ultimate impact of these matters cannot be determined at this time. See Note

" for additional information.

Bonus Depreciation

Under the Tax Reform Legislation, projects with binding contracts prior to September 28, 2017 and placed in service after September 27, 2017 remain eligible for bonus depreciation under the PATH Act. The PATH Act allowed for 50% bonus depreciation for 2015 through 2017, 40% bonus depreciation for 2018, and 30% bonus depreciation for 2019 and certain long-lived assets placed in service in 2020. Based on provisional estimates, bonus depreciation is expected to result in positive cash flows of approximately $300 million for the 2018 tax year and approximately $130 million for the 2019 tax year. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Tax Credits

The Tax Reform Legislation retained the renewable energy incentives that were included in the PATH Act. The PATH Act allows for 30% ITC for solar projects that commence construction by December 31, 2019; 26% ITC for solar projects that commence construction in 2020; 22% ITC for solar projects that commence construction in 2021; and a permanent 10% ITC for solar projects that commence construction on or after January 1, 2022. In addition, the PATH Act allows for 100% PTC for wind projects that commenced construction in 2016; 80% PTC for wind projects that commenced construction in 2017; 60% PTC for wind projects that commenced construction in 2018 and 40% PTC for wind projects that commence construction in 2019. Wind projects commencing construction after 2019 will not be entitled to any PTCs. Southern Company has received ITCs and PTCs in connection with investments in solar, wind, and biomass facilities primarily at Southern Power and Georgia Power. See Note

Other Matters

Southern Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various other matters being litigated and regulatory matters that could affect future earnings. In addition, Southern Company and its subsidiaries are subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. The business activities of Southern Company's subsidiaries are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the environment, such as laws and regulations governing air, water, land, and protection of other natural resources. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, has occurred throughout the U.S. This litigation has included claims for damages alleged to have been caused by CO


and other emissions, CCR, and alleged exposure to hazardous materials, and/or requests for injunctive relief in connection with such matters.

The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation or regulatory matters cannot be predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically reported herein or in Notes


and


to the financial statements, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings would have a material effect on Southern Company's financial statements. See Notes


and


to the financial statements for a discussion of various other contingencies, regulatory matters, and other matters being litigated which may affect future earnings potential.

Litigation

In January 2017, a putative securities class action complaint was filed against Southern Company, certain of its officers, and certain former Mississippi Power officers in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division, by Monroe County Employees' Retirement System on behalf of all persons who purchased shares of Southern Company's common stock between April 25, 2012 and October 29, 2013. The complaint alleges that Southern Company, certain of its officers, and certain former Mississippi Power officers made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Kemper County energy facility in violation of certain provisions under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The complaint seeks, among other things, compensatory damages and litigation costs and attorneys' fees. In June 2017, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that provided additional detail about their claims, increased the purported class period by one day, and added certain other former Mississippi Power officers as defendants. In July 2017, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' amended complaint with prejudice, to which the plaintiffs filed an opposition in September 2017. On March 29, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division, issued an order granting, in part, the defendants' motion to dismiss. The court dismissed certain claims against certain officers of Southern Company and Mississippi Power and dismissed the allegations related to a number of the statements that plaintiffs challenged as being false or misleading. On April 26, 2018, the

II-49

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the court's order, seeking dismissal of the remaining claims in the lawsuit. On August 10, 2018, the court denied the motion for reconsideration and denied a motion to certify the issue for interlocutory appeal.

In February 2017, Jean Vineyard filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit and, in May 2017, Judy Mesirov filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit, each in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. Each of these lawsuits names as defendants Southern Company, certain of its directors, certain of its officers, and certain former Mississippi Power officers. In August 2017, these two shareholder derivative lawsuits were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The complaints allege that the defendants caused Southern Company to make false or misleading statements regarding the Kemper County energy facility cost and schedule. Further, the complaints allege that the defendants were unjustly enriched and caused the waste of corporate assets and also allege that the individual defendants violated their fiduciary duties. Each plaintiff seeks to recover, on behalf of Southern Company, unspecified actual damages and, on each plaintiff's own behalf, attorneys' fees and costs in bringing the lawsuit. Each

plaintiff

also seeks certain changes to Southern Company's corporate governance and internal processes. On April 25, 2018, the court entered an order staying this lawsuit until 30 days after the resolution of any dispositive motions or any settlement, whichever is earlier, in the putative securities class action.

In May 2017, Helen E. Piper Survivor's Trust filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the Superior Court of Gwinnett County, State of Georgia that names as defendants Southern Company, certain of its directors, certain of its officers, and certain former Mississippi Power officers. The complaint alleges that the individual defendants, among other things, breached their fiduciary duties in connection with schedule delays and cost overruns associated with the construction of the Kemper County energy facility. The complaint further alleges that the individual defendants authorized or failed to correct false and misleading statements regarding the Kemper County energy facility schedule and cost and failed to implement necessary internal controls to prevent harm to Southern Company. The plaintiff seeks to recover, on behalf of Southern Company, unspecified actual damages and disgorgement of profits and, on its behalf, attorneys' fees and costs in bringing the lawsuit. The plaintiff also seeks certain unspecified changes to Southern Company's corporate governance and internal processes. On May 4, 2018, the court entered an order staying this lawsuit until 30 days after the resolution of any dispositive motions or any settlement, whichever is earlier, in the putative securities class action.

On May 18, 2018, Southern Company and Mississippi Power received a notice of dispute and arbitration demand filed by Martin Product Sales, LLC (Martin) based on two agreements, both related to Kemper IGCC byproducts for which Mississippi Power provided termination notices in September 2017. Martin alleges breach of contract, breach of good faith and fair dealing, fraud and misrepresentation, and civil conspiracy and makes a claim for damages in the amount of approximately $143 million, as well as additional unspecified damages, attorney's fees, costs, and interest. In the first quarter 2019, Mississippi Power and Southern Company filed motions to dismiss.

Southern Company believes these legal challenges have no merit; however, an adverse outcome in any of these proceedings could have an impact on Southern Company's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Southern Company will vigorously defend itself in these matters, the ultimate outcome of which cannot be determined at this time.

Investments in Leveraged Leases

A subsidiary of Southern Holdings has several leveraged lease agreements, with original terms ranging up to

45 years

, which relate to international and domestic energy generation, distribution, and transportation assets. Southern Company receives federal income tax deductions for depreciation and amortization, as well as interest on long-term debt related to these investments. Southern Company reviews all important lease assumptions at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that a change in assumptions has occurred or may occur. These assumptions include the effective tax rate, the residual value, the credit quality of the lessees, and the timing of expected tax cash flows. See Note


to the financial statements under "

Leveraged Leases

" for additional information.

The ability of the lessees to make required payments to the Southern Holdings subsidiary is dependent on the operational performance of the assets. In 2017, the financial and operational performance of one of the lessees and the associated generation assets raised significant concerns about the short-term ability of the generation assets to produce cash flows sufficient to support ongoing operations and the lessee's contractual obligations and its ability to make the remaining semi-annual lease payments to the Southern Holdings subsidiary beginning in June 2018. As a result of operational improvements in 2018, the 2018 lease payments were paid in full. However, operational issues and the resulting cash liquidity challenges persist and significant concerns continue regarding the lessee's ability to make the remaining semi-annual lease payments. These operational challenges may also impact the expected residual value of the assets at the end of the lease term in 2047. If any future lease payment is not paid in full, the Southern Holdings subsidiary may be unable to make its corresponding payment to the holders of the underlying non-recourse debt related to the generation assets. Failure to make the required payment to the debtholders could represent an event of default that would give the debtholders the right to foreclose on, and take ownership of, the generation assets from the

. Southern Company has evaluated the recoverability of the lease receivable and the expected residual value of the generation assets at the end of the lease under various scenarios and has concluded that its investment in the leveraged lease is not impaired at

December 31, 2018

. Southern Company will continue to monitor the operational performance of the underlying assets and evaluate the ability of the lessee to continue to make the required lease payments. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Mississippi Power

In conjunction with Southern Company's sale of Gulf Power, Mississippi Power and Gulf Power have committed to seek a restructuring of their 50% undivided ownership interests in Plant Daniel such that each of them would, after the restructuring, own 100% of a generating unit. On January 15, 2019, Gulf Power provided notice to Mississippi Power that Gulf Power will retire its share of the generating capacity of Plant Daniel on January 15, 2024. Mississippi Power has the option to purchase Gulf Power's ownership interest for $1 on January 15, 2024, provided that Mississippi Power exercises the option no later than 120 days prior to that date. Mississippi Power is assessing the potential operational and economic effects of Gulf Power's notice. The ultimate outcome of these matters remains subject to completion of Mississippi Power's evaluations and applicable regulatory approvals, including the FERC and the Mississippi PSC, and cannot now be determined. See Note


to the financial statements under "

Southern Company's Sale of Gulf Power

" for information regarding the sale of Gulf Power.

Southern Power

On January 29, 2019, Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) filed petitions to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Southern Power, together with its noncontrolling partners, owns

four

solar facilities where PG&E is the energy off-taker for approximately


MWs of capacity under long-term PPAs. PG&E is also the transmission provider for these facilities and two of Southern Power's other solar facilities. Southern Power has evaluated the recoverability of its investments in these solar facilities under various scenarios, including selling the related energy into the competitive markets, and has concluded they are not impaired. At December 31, 2018, Southern Power had outstanding accounts receivables due from PG&E of

$1 million

related to the PPAs and

$36 million related to the transmission interconnections. Southern Company does not expect a material impact to its financial statements if, as a result of the bankruptcy proceedings, PG&E does not perform in accordance with the PPAs or the terms of the PPAs are renegotiated; however, the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Southern Company Gas

A wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Company Gas owns and operates a natural gas storage facility consisting of two salt dome caverns in Louisiana. Periodic integrity tests are required in accordance with rules of the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources (DNR). In August 2017, in connection with an ongoing integrity project, updated seismic mapping indicated the proximity of one of the caverns to the edge of the salt dome may be less than the required minimum and could result in Southern Company Gas retiring the cavern early. At December 31, 2018, the facility's property, plant, and equipment had a net book value of $109 million, of which the cavern itself represents approximately 20%. A potential early retirement of this cavern is dependent upon several factors including compliance with an order from the Louisiana DNR detailing the requirements to place the cavern back in service, which includes, among other things, obtaining core samples to determine the composition of the sheath surrounding the edge of the salt dome.

The cavern continues to maintain its pressures and overall structural integrity. Southern Company Gas intends to monitor the cavern and comply with the Louisiana DNR order through 2020 and place the cavern back in service in 2021. These events were considered in connection with Southern Company Gas' annual long-lived asset impairment analysis, which determined there was no impairment as of December 31, 2018. Any changes in results of monitoring activities, rates at which expiring capacity contracts are re-contracted, timing of placing the cavern back in service, or Louisiana DNR requirements could trigger impairment. Further, early retirement of the cavern could trigger impairment of other long-lived assets associated with the natural gas storage facility. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time, but could have a significant impact on Southern Company's financial statements.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Southern Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Significant accounting policies are described in Notes


,


, and


to the financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may

II-51

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

have a material impact on Southern Company's results of operations and related disclosures. Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those recorded in the financial statements. Senior management has reviewed and discussed the following critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors.

Utility Regulation

Southern Company's traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities, which collectively comprised approximately

85%

of Southern Company's total operating revenues for


, are subject to retail regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies and wholesale regulation by the FERC. These regulatory agencies set the rates the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are permitted to charge customers based on allowable costs, including a reasonable ROE. As a result, the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities apply accounting standards which require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the ratemaking process, the regulators may require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when they would be recognized by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of expenses and the recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery through rates or the deferral of gains or creation of liabilities and the recording of related regulatory liabilities. The application of the accounting standards has a further effect on Southern Company's financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from those actually incurred by the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities; therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation, AROs, and pension and other postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on Southern Company's results of operations and financial condition than they would on a non-regulated company. See Note


to the financial statements for information regarding the sale of Gulf Power and three of Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities.

As reflected in Note

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

," significant regulatory assets and liabilities have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of these regulatory assets and any requirement to refund these regulatory liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines and GAAP. However, adverse legislative, judicial, or regulatory actions could materially impact the amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could adversely impact Southern Company's financial statements.

Estimated Cost, Schedule, and Rate Recovery for the Construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4

In 2016, the Georgia PSC approved the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, which resolved certain prudency matters in connection with Georgia Power's fifteenth VCM report. In December 2017, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report, which included a recommendation to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, with Southern Nuclear serving as project manager and Bechtel serving as the primary construction contractor, as well as a modification of the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement. The Georgia PSC's related order stated that under the modified Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, (i) none of the $3.3 billion of costs incurred through December 31, 2015 should be disallowed as imprudent; (ii) capital costs incurred up to $5.68 billion would be presumed to be reasonable and prudent with the burden of proof on any party challenging such costs; (iii) Georgia Power would have the burden of proof to show that any capital costs above $5.68 billion were prudent; (iv) Georgia Power's total project capital cost forecast of $7.3 billion (net of $1.7 billion received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related Customer Refunds) was found reasonable and did not represent a cost cap; and (v) prudence decisions would be made subsequent to achieving fuel load for Unit 4.

In its order, the Georgia PSC also stated if other conditions change and assumptions upon which Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report are based do not materialize, the Georgia PSC reserved the right to reconsider the decision to continue construction.

In the second quarter 2018, Georgia Power revised its base cost forecast and estimated contingency to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to $8.0 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively, for a total project capital cost forecast of $8.4 billion (net of $1.7 billion received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related Customer Refunds). Although Georgia Power believes these incremental costs are reasonable and necessary to complete the project and the Georgia PSC's order in the seventeenth VCM proceeding specifically states that the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is not subject to a cost cap, Georgia Power did not seek rate recovery for the $0.7 billion increase in costs included in the current base capital cost forecast in the nineteenth VCM report. In connection with future VCM filings, Georgia Power may request the Georgia PSC to evaluate costs currently included in the construction contingency estimate for rate recovery as and when they are appropriately included in the base capital cost forecast. After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of costs included in the construction contingency estimate since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in these future

II-52

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded a total pre-tax charge to income of $1.1 billion ($0.8 billion after tax) in the second quarter 2018.

Georgia Power's revised cost estimate reflects an expected in-service date of November 2021 for Unit 3 and November 2022 for Unit 4.

As construction continues, challenges with management of contractors, subcontractors, and vendors; labor productivity, availability, and/or cost escalation; procurement, fabrication, delivery, assembly, and/or installation and testing, including any required engineering changes, of plant systems, structures, and components (some of which are based on new technology that only recently began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale); or other issues could arise and change the projected schedule and estimated cost. Monthly construction production targets required to maintain the current project schedule will continue to increase significantly throughout 2019. To meet these increasing monthly targets, existing craft construction productivity must improve and additional craft laborers must be retained and deployed.

Georgia Power and Southern Nuclear believe it is a leading practice in connection with a construction project of this size and complexity to periodically validate recent construction progress in comparison to the projected schedule and to verify and update quantities of commodities remaining to install, labor productivity, and forecasted staffing needs. This verification process, led by Southern Nuclear, was underway as of December 31, 2018 and is expected to be completed during the second quarter 2019. Georgia Power currently does not anticipate any material changes to the total estimated project capital cost forecast for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 or the expected in-service dates of November 2021 and November 2022, respectively, resulting from this verification process. However, the ultimate impact on cost and schedule, if any, will not be known until the verification process is completed. Georgia Power is required to report the results and any project impacts to the Georgia PSC by May 15, 2019.

There have been technical and procedural challenges to the construction and licensing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 at the federal and state level and additional challenges may arise. Processes are in place that are designed to assure compliance with the requirements specified in the Westinghouse Design Control Document and the combined construction and operating licenses, including inspections by Southern Nuclear and the NRC that occur throughout construction. As a result of such compliance processes, certain license amendment requests have been filed and approved or are pending before the NRC. Various design and other licensing-based compliance matters, including the timely resolution of ITAAC and the related approvals by the NRC, may arise, which may result in additional license amendments or require other resolution. If any license amendment requests or other licensing-based compliance issues are not resolved in a timely manner, there may be delays in the project schedule that could result in increased costs.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. Any extension of the in-service dates of November 2021 for Unit 3 and November 2022 for Unit 4 is currently estimated to result in additional base capital costs of approximately $50 million per month, based on Georgia Power's ownership interests, and AFUDC of approximately $12 million per month. While Georgia Power is not precluded from seeking recovery of any future capital cost forecast increase, management will ultimately determine whether or not to seek recovery. Any further changes to the capital cost forecast that are not expected to be recoverable through regulated rates will be required to be charged to income and such charges could be material.

Given the significant complexity involved in estimating the future costs to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and the significant management judgment necessary to assess the related uncertainties surrounding future rate recovery of any projected cost increases, as well as the potential impact on Southern Company's results of operations and cash flows, Southern Company considers these items to be critical accounting estimates. See Note

Accounting for Income Taxes

The consolidated income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as any unrecognized tax benefits and valuation allowances, require significant judgment and estimates. These estimates are supported by historical tax return data, reasonable projections of taxable income, and interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions. The effective tax rate reflects the statutory tax rates and calculated apportionments for the various states in which the Southern Company system operates.

Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and various state income tax returns, some of which are combined or unitary. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement, each Southern Company subsidiary's current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis and no subsidiary is allocated more current expense than would be paid if it filed a separate income tax return. Certain deductions and credits can be limited at the consolidated or combined level resulting in NOL and tax credit carryforwards that would not otherwise result on a stand-alone basis. Utilization of NOL and tax credit carryforwards and the assessment of valuation allowances are based on significant judgment and extensive analysis of

II-53


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

Southern Company's current financial position and result of operations, including currently available information about future years, to estimate when future taxable income will be realized.

Current and deferred state income tax liabilities and assets are estimated based on laws of multiple states that determine the income to be apportioned to their jurisdictions. States utilize various formulas to calculate the apportionment of taxable income, primarily using sales, assets, or payroll within the jurisdiction compared to the consolidated totals. In addition, each state varies as to whether a stand-alone, combined, or unitary filing methodology is required. The calculation of deferred state taxes considers apportionment factors and filing methodologies that are expected to apply in future years. The apportionments and methodologies which are ultimately finalized in a manner inconsistent with expectations could have a material effect on Southern Company's financial statements.

Given the significant judgment involved in estimating NOL and tax credit carryforwards and multi-state apportionments for all subsidiaries, Southern Company considers federal and state deferred income tax liabilities and assets to be critical accounting estimates.

Asset Retirement Obligations

AROs are computed as the fair value of the estimated costs for an asset's future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The estimated costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. In the absence of quoted market prices, AROs are estimated using present value techniques in which estimates of future cash outlays associated with the asset retirements are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Estimates of the timing and amounts of future cash outlays are based on projections of when and how the assets will be retired and the cost of future removal activities.

The liability for AROs primarily relates to facilities that are subject to the CCR Rule and the related state rules, principally ash ponds, and the decommissioning of the Southern Company system's nuclear facilities – Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's ownership interests in Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2. In addition, the Southern Company system has AROs related to various landfill sites, asbestos removal, mine reclamation, land restoration related to solar and wind facilities, and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers.

The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas also have identified retirement obligations, such as obligations related to certain electric transmission and distribution facilities, certain asbestos containing material within long-term assets not subject to ongoing repair and maintenance activities, certain wireless communication towers, the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers, leasehold improvements, equipment on customer property, and property associated with the Southern Company system's rail lines and natural gas pipelines. However, liabilities for the removal of these assets have not been recorded as the fair value of the retirement obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. A liability for these retirement obligations will be recognized when sufficient information becomes available to support a reasonable estimation of the retirement obligation.

The cost estimates for AROs related to the disposal of CCR are based on information using various assumptions related to closure and post-closure costs, timing of future cash outlays, inflation and discount rates, and the potential methods for complying with the CCR Rule. During 2018, Alabama Power and Georgia Power recorded increases of approximately $1.2 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, to their AROs related to the disposal of CCR and increases of approximately $300 million and $130 million, respectively, to their AROs related to updated nuclear decommissioning cost site studies. Alabama Power's CCR-related update resulted from feasibility studies performed on ash ponds in use at the plants it operates, which indicated that additional closure costs, primarily related to increases in estimated ash volume, water management requirements, and design revisions, will be required to close these ash ponds under the planned closure-in-place methodology. Georgia Power's CCR-related update resulted from a strategic assessment which indicated additional closure costs will be required to close its ash ponds, primarily due to changes in closure strategies, the estimated amount of ash to be excavated, and additional water management requirements necessary to support closure strategies. The traditional electric operating companies expect to periodically update their ARO cost estimates. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "

Given the significant judgment involved in estimating AROs, Southern Company considers the liabilities for AROs to be critical accounting estimates.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Southern Company's calculation of pension and other postretirement benefits expense is dependent on a number of assumptions. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected long-term return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary and wage increases, and other factors. Components of pension and other postretirement benefits expense include

II-54


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

interest and service cost on the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, expected return on plan assets, and amortization of certain unrecognized costs and obligations. Actual results that differ from the assumptions utilized are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While Southern Company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect its pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations.

Key elements in determining Southern Company's pension and other postretirement benefit expense are the expected long-term return on plan assets and the discount rate used to measure the benefit plan obligations and the periodic benefit plan expense for future periods. The expected long-term return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets is based on Southern Company's investment strategy, historical experience, and expectations for long-term rates of return that consider external actuarial advice. Southern Company determines the long-term return on plan assets by applying the long-term rate of expected returns on various asset classes to Southern Company's target asset allocation. For purposes of determining its liability related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, Southern Company discounts the future related cash flows using a single-point discount rate for each plan developed from the weighted average of market-observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to expected benefit payments.

The following table illustrates the sensitivity to changes in Southern Company's long-term assumptions with respect to the discount rate, salary increases, and the long-term rate of return on plan assets:

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The acquisition method of accounting requires the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values. Southern Company recognizes goodwill as of the acquisition date, as a residual over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of the year as well as on an interim basis as events and changes in circumstances occur. Primarily as a result of the acquisitions of Southern Company Gas and PowerSecure in 2016, goodwill totaled approximately

$5.3 billion

at

December 31, 2018

. As a result of the Southern Company Gas Dispositions, goodwill was reduced by

$910 million

during 2018. In addition, Southern Company Gas recorded a $42 million goodwill impairment charge in 2018 in contemplation of the sale of Pivotal Home Solutions.

Definite-lived intangible assets acquired are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets to reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed. Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible assets may not be recoverable, the intangible assets will be reviewed for impairment. Primarily as a result of the acquisitions of Southern Company Gas and PowerSecure and PPA fair value adjustments resulting from Southern Power's acquisitions, other intangible assets, net of amortization totaled approximately

$613 million

at

December 31, 2018

.

The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can significantly impact Southern Company's results of operations. Fair values and useful lives are determined based on, among other factors, the expected future period of benefit of the asset, the various characteristics of the asset, and projected cash flows. As the determination of an asset's fair value and useful life involves management making certain estimates and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded, Southern Company considers these estimates to be critical accounting estimates.

information related to Southern Company's 2016 acquisitions of Southern Company Gas and PowerSecure, as well as the Southern Company Gas Dispositions.

Derivatives and Hedging Activities

Derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheets as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair value, unless the transactions qualify for the normal purchases or normal sales scope exception and are instead subject to traditional accrual accounting. For those transactions that do not qualify as a normal purchase or normal sale, changes in the derivatives' fair values are recognized concurrently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. If the derivatives meet those criteria, derivative gains and losses offset related results of the hedged item in the income statement in the case of a fair value hedge, or gains and losses are deferred in OCI until the hedged transaction affects earnings in the case of a cash flow hedge. Certain subsidiaries of Southern Company enter into energy-related derivatives that are designated as regulatory hedges where gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets and then are included in fuel expense as the underlying fuel is used in operations and ultimately recovered through billings to customers.

Southern Company uses derivative instruments to reduce the impact to the results of operations due to the risk of changes in the price of natural gas, to manage fuel hedging programs per guidelines of state regulatory agencies, and to mitigate residual changes in the price of electricity, weather, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates. The fair value of commodity derivative instruments used to manage exposure to changing prices reflects the estimated amounts that Southern Company would receive or pay to terminate or close the contracts at the reporting date. To determine the fair value of the derivative instruments, Southern Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the derivative asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs of the valuation technique.

Southern Company classifies derivative assets and liabilities based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy. The determination of the fair value of the derivative instruments incorporates various required factors. These factors include:

•

the creditworthiness of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash deposits and letters of credit);

•

events specific to a given counterparty; and

•

the impact of Southern Company's nonperformance risk on its liabilities.

Given the assumptions used in pricing the derivative asset or liability, Southern Company considers the valuation of derivative assets and liabilities a critical accounting estimate. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "

Market Price Risk

" herein and Note


to the financial statements for more information.

Contingent Obligations

Southern Company is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations as well as other factors and conditions that subject it to environmental, litigation, and other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Notes


and


to the financial statements for more information regarding certain of these contingencies. Southern Company periodically evaluates its exposure to such risks and records reserves for those matters where a non-tax-related loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable. The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or conditions that can be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially affect Southern Company's results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

See Note


to the financial statements under "

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

" for additional information.

In 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,

Leases (Topic 842)

(ASU 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases. ASU 2016-02 also changes the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expense associated with leases and provides clarification regarding the identification of certain components of contracts that would represent a lease. The accounting required by lessors is relatively unchanged

and there is no change to the accounting for existing leveraged leases.

ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and

Southern Company

adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2019.

Southern Company

elected the transition methodology provided by ASU No. 2018-11,

Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements

, whereby the requirements of ASU 2016-02 are applied on a prospective basis as of the adoption date of January 1, 2019, without restating prior periods.

Southern Company

elected the package of practical expedients provided by ASU 2016-02

II-56

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

that allows prior determinations of whether existing contracts are, or contain, leases and the classification of existing leases to continue without reassessment. Additionally,

Southern Company

applied the use-of-hindsight practical expedient in determining lease terms as of the date of adoption and elected the practical expedient that allows existing land easements not previously accounted for as leases not to be reassessed.

Southern Company

also made accounting policy elections to account for short-term leases in all asset classes as off-balance sheet leases and combined lease and non-lease components in the computations of lease obligations and right-of-use assets for most asset classes.

The Southern Company system

completed the implementation of a new application to track and account for its leases and updated its internal controls and accounting policies to support the accounting for leases under ASU 2016-02.

The Southern Company system

completed its lease inventory and

determined its most significant leases

involve PPAs, real estate, and communication towers where certain of Southern Company's subsidiaries are the lessee and PPAs where certain of Southern Company's subsidiaries are the lessor.

In the first quarter 2019, the adoption of ASU 2016-02 resulted in recording lease liabilities and right-of-use assets on

Southern Company's

balance sheet each totaling

approximately $2.0 billion

, with no impact on

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

Earnings in all periods presented were negatively affected by charges associated with plants under construction; however, Southern Company's financial condition remained stable at

December 31, 2018

.

The Southern Company system's cash requirements primarily consist of funding ongoing operations, common stock dividends, capital expenditures, and debt maturities. The Southern Company system's capital expenditures and other investing activities include investments to meet projected long-term demand requirements, including to build new electric generation facilities, to maintain existing electric generation facilities, to comply with environmental regulations including adding environmental modifications to certain existing electric generating units and closures of ash ponds, to expand and improve electric transmission and distribution facilities, to update and expand natural gas distribution systems, and for restoration following major storms. Operating cash flows provide a substantial portion of the Southern Company system's cash needs. For the three-year period from


through


, Southern Company's projected common stock dividends, capital expenditures, and debt maturities are expected to exceed operating cash flows. Southern Company plans to finance future cash needs in excess of its operating cash flows primarily by accessing borrowings from financial institutions and through debt and equity issuances in the capital markets. Southern Company intends to continue to monitor its access to short-term and long-term capital markets as well as bank credit arrangements to meet future capital and liquidity needs. See "

Sources of Capital

Southern Company intends to meet its future capital needs through operating cash flows, borrowings from financial institutions, and debt and equity issuances in the capital markets. Equity capital can be provided from any combination of Southern Company's stock plans, private placements, or public offerings. The amount and timing of additional equity and debt issuances in


, as well as in subsequent years, will be contingent on Southern Company's investment opportunities and the Southern Company system's capital requirements and will depend upon prevailing market conditions and other factors. See "

Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations

" herein for additional information.

Except as described herein, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas plan to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from operating cash flows, external security issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, and equity contributions or loans from Southern Company. Southern Power also plans to utilize tax equity partnership contributions, as well as funds resulting from its pending sale of Plant Mankato. However, the amount, type, and timing of any future financings, if needed, will depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory approval, and other factors. See Note


to the financial statements under "

In addition, in 2014, Georgia Power entered into the Loan Guarantee Agreement with the DOE, under which the proceeds of borrowings may be used to reimburse Georgia Power for Eligible Project Costs incurred in connection with its construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Under the Loan Guarantee Agreement, the DOE agreed to guarantee borrowings of up to

$3.46 billion

(not to exceed

70%

of Eligible Project Costs) to be made by Georgia Power under a multi-advance credit facility (FFB Credit Facility) among Georgia Power, the DOE, and the FFB. At

December 31, 2018

, Georgia Power had borrowed $2.6 billion under

II-58

the FFB Credit Facility. In July 2017, Georgia Power entered into an amendment to the Loan Guarantee Agreement, which provides that further advances are conditioned upon the DOE's approval of any agreements entered into in replacement of the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement and satisfaction of certain other conditions.

In September 2017, the DOE issued a conditional commitment to Georgia Power for up to approximately

$1.67 billion

of additional guaranteed loans under the Loan Guarantee Agreement. This conditional commitment expires on March 31, 2019, subject to any further extension approved by the DOE. Final approval and issuance of these additional loan guarantees by the DOE cannot be assured and are subject to the negotiation of definitive agreements, completion of due diligence by the DOE, receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals, and satisfaction of other conditions. See Note

The issuance of securities by the traditional electric operating companies and Nicor Gas is generally subject to the approval of the applicable state PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency. The issuance of all securities by Mississippi Power and short-term securities by Georgia Power is generally subject to regulatory approval by the FERC. Additionally, with respect to the public offering of securities, Southern Company and certain of its subsidiaries file registration statements with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (1933 Act). The amounts of securities authorized by the appropriate regulatory authorities, as well as the securities registered under the 1933 Act, are continuously monitored and appropriate filings are made to ensure flexibility in the capital markets.

Southern Company, each traditional electric operating company, and Southern Power generally obtain financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. The Southern Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of each company are not commingled with funds of any other company in the Southern Company system.

In addition, Southern Company Gas Capital obtains external financing for Southern Company Gas and its subsidiaries, other than Nicor Gas, which obtains financing separately without credit support from any affiliates. Nicor Gas' commercial paper program supports its working capital needs as Nicor Gas is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. All of the other Southern Company Gas subsidiaries benefit from Southern Company Gas Capital's commercial paper program.

See Note

(c)

Southern Company Gas, as the parent entity, guarantees the obligations of Southern Company Gas Capital, which is the borrower of $1.4 billion of this arrangement. Southern Company Gas' committed credit arrangement also includes $500 million for which Nicor Gas is the borrower and which is restricted for working capital needs of Nicor Gas. Pursuant to this multi-year credit arrangement, the allocations between Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas may be adjusted.

(d)

Amounts used are for letters of credit.

(e)

to the financial statements under "

Southern Company's Sale of Gulf Power

" for additional information.

See Note


to the financial statements under "

Bank Credit Arrangements

" for additional information.

Most of these bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of Alabama Power and Southern Power Company, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. Such cross-default provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness or guarantee obligations over a specified threshold. Such cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. At

December 31, 2018

, Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power Company, Southern Company Gas, and Nicor Gas were in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings.

Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder.

A portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to the revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial paper programs of Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power Company, Southern Company Gas, and Nicor Gas. The amount of variable rate revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies outstanding requiring liquidity support at

December 31, 2018

was approximately

$1.6 billion

, which included $82 million related to Gulf Power. In addition, at

December 31, 2018

, the traditional electric operating companies had approximately

$403 million

of revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the next 12 months, which included $58 million related to Gulf Power. See Note

In January 2018, Georgia Power repaid its outstanding $150 million short-term floating rate bank loan due May 31, 2018.

In May 2018, through cash tender offers, Georgia Power repurchased and retired $89 million of the $250 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its Series 2007A 5.65% Senior Notes due March 1, 2037, $326 million of the $500 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its Series 2009A 5.95% Senior Notes due February 1, 2039, and $335 million of the $600 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its Series 2010B 5.40% Senior Notes due June 1, 2040, for an aggregate purchase price, excluding accrued and unpaid interest, of $902 million.

Subsequent to December 31, 2018, Georgia Power redeemed approximately $13 million, $20 million, and $75 million aggregate principal amount of Development Authority of Burke County (Georgia) Pollution Control Revenue Bonds (Georgia Power Company Plant Vogtle Project), First Series 1992, Eighth Series 1994, and Second Series 1995, respectively.

In March 2018, Mississippi Power entered into a $300 million short-term floating rate bank loan bearing interest based on one-month LIBOR, of which $200 million was repaid in the second quarter 2018 and $100 million was repaid in the third quarter 2018. The proceeds of this loan, together with the proceeds of Mississippi Power's $600 million senior notes issuances, were used to repay Mississippi Power's $900 million unsecured floating rate term loan.

In October 2018, Mississippi Power completed the redemption of all 334,210 outstanding shares of its preferred stock (as well as related depositary shares), with an aggregate par value of approximately $33.4 million.

In May 2018, Southern Power entered into two short-term floating rate bank loans, each for an aggregate principal amount of $100 million, which bear interest based on one-month LIBOR. In November 2018, Southern Power repaid one of these short-term loans.

During 2018, Southern Power received approximately $148 million of third-party tax equity related to certain of its renewable facilities. See Note


to the financial statements under "

Southern Power

" for additional information.

In May 2018, Southern Company Gas Capital borrowed $95 million pursuant to a short-term uncommitted bank credit arrangement, guaranteed by Southern Company Gas, bearing interest at a rate agreed upon by Southern Company Gas Capital and the bank from time to time and payable on no less than 30 days' demand by the bank. In July 2018, Southern Company Gas Capital repaid this loan.

Other long-term debt issuances for Southern Company Gas include the issuance by Nicor Gas of $300 million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds in a private placement, of which $100 million was issued in August 2018 and $200 million was issued in November 2018.

In addition to any financings that may be necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual obligations, Southern Company and its subsidiaries plan to continue, when economically feasible, a program to retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit.

Credit Rating Risk

At

December 31, 2018

, Southern Company and its subsidiaries did not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade.

There are certain contracts that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change of certain subsidiaries to BBB and/or Baa2 or below. These contracts are for physical electricity and natural gas purchases and sales, fuel purchases, fuel transportation and storage, energy price risk management, transmission, interest rate management, and construction of new generation at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

The maximum potential collateral requirements under these contracts at

December 31, 2018

were as follows:

(a)

Includes potential collateral requirements related to Gulf Power of $111 million and $221 million at a credit rating of BBB- and/or Baa3 and BB+ and/or Ba1, respectively. See Note


to the financial statements under "

Southern Company's Sale of Gulf Power

" for information regarding the sale of Gulf Power on January 1, 2019.

(b)

Any additional credit rating downgrades at or below BB- and/or Ba3 could increase collateral requirements up to an additional $38 million.

Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. Additionally, a credit rating downgrade could impact the ability of Southern Company and its subsidiaries to access capital markets and would be likely to impact the cost at which they do so.

On February 26, 2018, Moody's revised its rating outlook for Mississippi Power from stable to positive. On August 8, 2018, Moody's upgraded Mississippi Power's senior unsecured rating to Baa3 from Ba1 and maintained the positive rating outlook.

On February 28, 2018, Fitch removed Mississippi Power from rating watch negative and revised its rating outlook from stable to positive.

Also on February 28, 2018, Fitch downgraded the senior unsecured long-term debt rating of Southern Company to BBB+ from A- with a stable outlook and of Georgia Power to A from A+ with a negative outlook. On August 9, 2018, Fitch downgraded the senior unsecured long-term debt rating of Georgia Power to A- from A.

On March 14, 2018, S&P upgraded the senior unsecured long-term debt rating of Mississippi Power to A- from BBB+. The outlook remained negative.

On August 8, 2018, Moody's downgraded the senior unsecured debt rating of Georgia Power to Baa1 from A3.

On September 28, 2018, Moody's revised its rating outlooks for Southern Company, Alabama Power, and Georgia Power from negative to stable.

Also on September 28, 2018, Fitch assigned a negative rating outlook to the ratings of Southern Company and its subsidiaries (excluding Mississippi Power).

As a result of the Tax Reform Legislation, certain financial metrics, such as the funds from operations to debt percentage, used by the credit rating agencies to assess Southern Company and its subsidiaries may be negatively impacted. Southern Company and most of its regulated subsidiaries have taken actions to mitigate the resulting impacts, which, among other alternatives, include adjusting capital structure. Absent actions by Southern Company and its subsidiaries that fully mitigate the impacts, the credit ratings of Southern Company and certain of its subsidiaries could be negatively affected. See Note


to the financial statements for additional information related to state PSC or other regulatory agency actions related to the Tax Reform Legislation, including approvals of capital structure adjustments for Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Atlanta Gas Light by their respective state PSCs, which are expected to help mitigate the potential adverse impacts to certain of their credit metrics.

Market Price Risk

The Southern Company system is exposed to market risks, including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, weather risk, and occasionally foreign currency exchange rate risk. To manage the volatility attributable to these exposures, the applicable company nets the exposures, where possible, to take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to the applicable company's policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and risk management practices. Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas operations use various contracts in its commercial activities that generally meet the definition of derivatives. For the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas' other businesses, each company's policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including, but not limited to, market valuation, value at risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis.

II-64


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

To mitigate future exposure to a change in interest rates, Southern Company and certain of its subsidiaries enter into derivatives that have been designated as hedges. Derivatives that have been designated as hedges outstanding at

December 31, 2018

have a notional amount of

$2.0 billion

and are intended to mitigate interest rate volatility related to existing fixed rate obligations. The weighted average interest rate on $5.8 billion of long-term variable interest rate exposure at

December 31, 2018

was 3.02%. If Southern Company sustained a 100 basis point change in interest rates for all long-term variable interest rate exposure, the change would affect annualized interest expense by approximately $58 million at

December 31, 2018

. See Note


to the financial statements under "

Financial Instruments

" and Note


to the financial statements for additional information.

Southern Power Company had foreign currency denominated debt of €1.1 billion at

December 31, 2018

. Southern Power Company has mitigated its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk through the use of foreign currency swaps converting all interest and principal payments to fixed-rate U.S. dollars.

Due to cost-based rate regulation and other various cost recovery mechanisms, the traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities continue to have limited exposure to market volatility in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity. In addition, Southern Power's exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity is limited because its long-term sales contracts shift substantially all fuel cost responsibility to the purchaser. However, Southern Power has been and may continue to be exposed to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices as a result of uncontracted generating capacity. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power may enter into physical fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity market and, to a lesser extent, financial hedge contracts for natural gas purchases; however, a significant portion of contracts are priced at market. The traditional electric operating companies and certain of the natural gas distribution utilities manage fuel-hedging programs implemented per the guidelines of their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. Southern Company had no material change in market risk exposure for the year ended

December 31, 2018

when compared to the year ended

December 31, 2017

.

The changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts are substantially attributable to both the volume and the price of natural gas. For the years ended December 31, the changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts, the majority of which are composed of regulatory hedges, were as follows:

(a)

Current period changes also include the changes in fair value of new contracts entered into during the period, if any.

(b)

Excludes premium and intrinsic value associated with weather derivatives of $8 million and

$11 million

at

December 31, 2018

and


, respectively.

(c)

Includes $6 million of net liabilities related to Gulf Power. See Note


to the financial statements under "

Southern Company's Sale of Gulf Power

" for information regarding the sale of Gulf Power on January 1, 2019.

The net hedge volumes of energy-related derivative contracts were 431 million mmBtu and 621 million mmBtu at

December 31, 2018

and


, respectively.

For the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, the weighted average swap contract cost above market prices was approximately $0.12 per mmBtu at

December 31, 2018

and $0.15 per mmBtu at

December 31, 2017

. The majority of the natural gas hedge gains and losses are recovered through the traditional electric operating companies' fuel cost recovery clauses.

At

December 31, 2018

and


, a portion of the Southern Company system's energy-related derivative contracts were designated as regulatory hedges and were related to the applicable company's fuel-hedging program. Therefore, gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense as they are recovered through the energy cost recovery clause. Certain other gains and losses on energy-related derivatives, designated as cash flow hedges, are initially deferred in OCI before being recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transaction. Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as incurred. See Note


to the financial statements for additional information.

The Southern Company system uses exchange-traded market-observable contracts, which are categorized as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, and over-the-counter contracts that are not exchange traded but are fair valued using prices which are market

II-65


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

observable, and thus fall into Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. See Note


to the financial statements for further discussion of fair value measurements. The maturities of the energy-related derivative contracts at

December 31, 2018

were as follows:

The Southern Company system is exposed to market price risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to energy-related and interest rate derivative contracts. The Southern Company system only enters into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody's and S&P, or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. Therefore, the Southern Company system does not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the counterparties. For additional information, see Note


to the financial statements under "

Financial Instruments

" and Note


to the financial statements.

With the exception of Southern Company Gas' subsidiary, Atlanta Gas Light, and the Southern Company Gas wholesale gas services business, the Southern Company system is not exposed to concentrations of credit risk. Concentration of credit risk occurs at Atlanta Gas Light for amounts billed for services and other costs to its customers, which consist of


Marketers in Georgia responsible for the retail sale of natural gas to end-use customers in Georgia. For


, the four largest Marketers based on customer count, which includes SouthStar, accounted for

20%

of Southern Company Gas' adjusted operating margin. Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas services business has a concentration of credit risk for services it provides to its counterparties as measured by its 30-day receivable exposure plus forward exposure. At

December 31, 2018

, Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas services business' top 20 counterparties represented approximately

48%

, or

$298 million

, of its total counterparty exposure and had a weighted average S&P equivalent credit rating of A-, all of which is consistent with the prior year.

Southern Company performs periodic reviews of its leveraged lease transactions, both domestic and international, and the creditworthiness of the lessees, including a review of the value of the underlying leased assets and the credit ratings of the lessees. Southern Company's domestic lease transactions generally do not have any credit enhancement mechanisms; however, the lessees in its international lease transactions have pledged various deposits as additional security to secure the obligations. The lessees in Southern Company's international lease transactions are also required to provide additional collateral in the event of a credit downgrade below a certain level.

The construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions; changes in load projections; changes in environmental laws and regulations; the outcome of any legal challenges to environmental rules; changes in electric generating plants, including unit retirements and replacements and adding or changing fuel sources at existing electric generating units, to meet regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules and regulations; state regulatory agency approvals; changes in the expected environmental compliance program; changes in legislation; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes; storm impacts; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered. Additionally, planned expenditures for plant acquisitions may vary due to market opportunities and Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy.

See Note


to the financial statements under "

Southern Power

" for additional information regarding Southern Power's plant acquisitions.

The construction program also includes Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which includes components based on new technology that only recently began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale and which may be subject to additional revised cost estimates during construction.

The ability to control costs and avoid cost and schedule overruns during the development, construction, and operation of new facilities is subject to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, changes in labor costs, availability, and productivity; challenges with management of contractors, subcontractors, or vendors; adverse weather conditions; shortages, increased costs, or inconsistent quality of equipment, materials, and labor; contractor or supplier delay; non-performance under construction, operating, or other agreements; operational readiness, including specialized operator training and required site safety programs; engineering or design problems; design and other licensing-based compliance matters, including the timely resolution of ITAAC and the related approvals by the NRC; challenges with start-up activities, including major equipment failure and system integration; and/or operational performance.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual Report

OVERVIEW

Business Activities

Alabama Power operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electric service to retail and wholesale customers within its traditional service territory located in the State of Alabama in addition to wholesale customers in the Southeast.

Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of Alabama Power's business of providing electric service. These factors include the ability to maintain a constructive regulatory environment, to maintain and grow energy sales and customers, and to effectively manage and secure timely recovery of costs. These costs include those related to projected long-term demand growth, stringent environmental standards, including CCR rules, reliability, fuel, capital expenditures, including improving the electric transmission and distribution systems, and restoration following major storms. Alabama Power has various regulatory mechanisms that operate to address cost recovery. Effectively operating pursuant to these regulatory mechanisms and appropriately balancing required costs and capital expenditures with customer prices will continue to challenge Alabama Power for the foreseeable future. On May 1, 2018, the Alabama PSC approved modifications to Rate RSE and other commitments designed to position Alabama Power to address the retail rate impact and the growing pressure on its credit quality resulting from the Tax Reform Legislation. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Retail Regulatory Matters" and FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Credit Rating Risk" herein for additional information.

Alabama Power continues to focus on several key performance indicators including, but not limited to, customer satisfaction, plant availability, system reliability, and net income after dividends on preferred stock. Alabama Power's financial success is directly tied to customer satisfaction. Key elements of ensuring customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high reliability, and competitive prices. Management uses customer satisfaction surveys to evaluate Alabama Power's results and generally targets the top quartile of these surveys in measuring performance.

See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for information on Alabama Power's financial performance.

Earnings

Alabama Power's


net income after dividends on preferred and preference stock was

$930 million

, representing an

$82 million

, or

9.7%

, increase over the previous year. The increase was primarily due to a decrease in income tax expense, partially offset by a decrease in retail revenues associated with customer bill credits related to the Tax Reform Legislation. The increase also reflects an increase in revenues associated with colder weather in the first quarter 2018 and warmer weather in the second and third quarters 2018 compared to the corresponding periods in 2017, partially offset by an accrual for a Rate RSE refund. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Retail Regulatory Matters – Rate RSE" herein for additional information.

Alabama Power's 2017 net income after dividends on preferred and preference stock was

$848 million

, representing a $26 million, or 3.2%, increase over the previous year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in rates under Rate RSE effective in January 2017 and the impact of a Rate RSE refund recorded in 2016. These increases to income were partially offset by a decrease in retail revenues associated with milder weather, lower customer usage, and an increase in non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses in 2017 as compared to 2016. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Retail Regulatory Matters – Rate RSE" herein for additional information.

decrease from 2017. Details of operating revenues were as follows:

Retail revenues in


were

$5.4 billion

. These revenues decreased $

91 million

, or

1.7%

, in 2018 as compared to the prior year. The decrease in 2018 was primarily due to customer bill credits related to the Tax Reform Legislation and an accrual for a Rate RSE refund, partially offset by an increase in fuel revenues and colder weather in the first quarter and warmer weather in the second and third quarters 2018 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2017.

II-71


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual Report

Retail revenues in 2017 were $5.5 billion. These revenues increased

$136 million

, or

2.6%

, in 2017 as compared to the prior year. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in rates under Rate RSE effective in January 2017, partially offset by a decrease in fuel revenues and milder weather in the first and third quarters 2017 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2016.

See Note


to the financial statements under "Alabama Power – Rate RSE" for additional information. See "Energy Sales" herein for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to sales decline and weather.

Electric rates include provisions to recognize the recovery of fuel costs, purchased power costs, PPAs certificated by the Alabama PSC, and costs associated with the natural disaster reserve. Under these provisions, fuel and other cost recovery revenues generally equal fuel and other cost recovery expenses and do not affect net income. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Retail Regulatory Matters – Rate ECR" herein for additional information.

Wholesale revenues from power sales to non-affiliated utilities were as follows:

Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Alabama Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not affect net income. Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in wholesale energy sales to non-affiliates. These opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Alabama Power's variable cost to produce the energy.

In 2018, wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates increased $

3 million

, or

1.1%

, as compared to the prior year. In 2017, wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates decreased $7 million, or 2.5%, as compared to the prior year.

Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliate sales and purchases are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost and energy purchases are generally offset by energy revenues through Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause.

In 2018, wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates increased

$22 million

, or

22.7%

, as compared to the prior year. In 2018, the price of energy increased 12.3% as a result of higher natural gas prices and KWH sales increased 10.0% primarily due to an increase in hydro generation. In 2017, wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates increased $28 million, or 40.6%, as compared to the prior year. In 2017, KWH sales increased 31.1% as a result of supporting Southern Company system transmission reliability and a 6.9% increase in the price of energy primarily due to higher natural gas prices.

In 2018, other operating revenues increased

$59 million

, or

28.4%

, as compared to the prior year primarily due to revenues related to unregulated sales of products and services that were reclassified as other revenues as a result of the adoption of ASC 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

(ASC 606). In prior periods, these revenues were included in other income (expense), net. See Note 1 to the financial statements for additional information regarding Alabama Power's adoption of ASC 606. This increase was partially offset by decreases in open access transmission tariff revenues primarily due to a lower rate related to the Tax Reform Legislation.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual Report

Energy Sales

Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year. KWH sales for 2018 and the percent change from the prior year were as follows:

Changes in retail energy sales are generally the result of changes in electricity usage by customers, changes in weather, and changes in the number of customers. Retail energy sales in 2018 were 3.7% higher than in 2017. Residential sales and commercial sales increased 8.2% and 1.9% in 2018, respectively, primarily due to colder weather in the first quarter and warmer weather in the second and third quarters 2018 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2017. Weather-adjusted residential sales were 0.4% lower in 2018 primarily due to lower customer usage resulting from an increase in penetration of energy-efficient residential appliances. Weather-adjusted commercial sales were 1.0% lower in 2018 primarily due to lower customer usage resulting from customer initiatives in energy savings and an ongoing migration to the electronic commerce business model. Industrial sales increased 1.4% in 2018 as compared to 2017 as a result of an increase in demand resulting from changes in production levels primarily in the primary metals, pipelines, and mining sectors offset by the paper sector.

Retail energy sales in 2017 were 2.3% lower than in 2016. Residential sales and commercial sales decreased 6.1% and 3.4% in 2017, respectively, primarily due to milder weather in the first and third quarters 2017 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2016. Weather-adjusted residential sales were 1.2% lower in 2017 primarily due to lower customer usage resulting from an increase in penetration of energy-efficient residential appliances, partially offset by customer growth. Weather-adjusted commercial sales were 1.3% lower in 2017 primarily due to lower customer usage resulting from customer initiatives in energy savings and an ongoing migration to the electronic commerce business model, partially offset by customer growth. Industrial sales increased 1.7% in 2017 as compared to 2016 as a result of an increase in demand resulting from changes in production levels primarily in the primary metals, chemicals, and mining sectors offset by the pipelines and paper sectors.

See "Operating Revenues" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates and wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies related to changes in price and KWH sales.

Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses

The mix of fuel sources for generation of electricity is determined primarily by the unit cost of fuel consumed, demand, and the availability of generating units. Additionally, Alabama Power purchases a portion of its electricity needs from the wholesale market.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual Report

Details of Alabama Power's generation and purchased power were as follows:

Fuel and purchased power expenses were

$1.73 billion

in 2018, an increase of

$180 million

, or

11.6%

, compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to an $81 million net increase related to the volume of KWHs purchased and generated, a $54 million increase in the average cost of fuel, and a $15 million increase in the average cost of purchased power.

In addition, fuel expense increased $30 million in 2018 as a result of an Alabama PSC accounting order authorizing the amortization of a regulatory liability to offset under recovered fuel costs. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Retail Regulatory Matters – Tax Reform Accounting Order" herein for additional information.

Fuel and purchased power expenses were $1.55 billion in 2017, a decrease of $78 million, or 4.8%, compared to 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a $67 million net decrease related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased and a $42 million decrease in the average cost of fuel, partially offset by a $31 million increase in the average cost of purchased power.

Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings, since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause. Alabama Power, along with the Alabama PSC, continuously monitors the under/over recovered balance to determine whether adjustments to billing rates are required. See Note


to the financial statements under "Alabama Power – Rate ECR" for additional information.

Fuel

Fuel expenses were

$1.3 billion

in 2018, an increase of

$76 million

, or

6.2%

, compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to a 5.0% increase in the average cost of KWHs generated by coal and a 4.4% increase in the average cost of KWHs generated by natural gas, which excludes tolling agreements. These increases were partially offset by a 28.3% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by hydro and a 2.1% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas. Fuel expenses were $1.2 billion in 2017, a decrease of $72 million, or 5.6%, compared to 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a 12.2% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by hydro, a 5.8% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by coal, and a 5.5% and 3.9% decrease in the average cost of KWHs generated by coal and nuclear fuel, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by an 8.1% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by nuclear fuel and a 4.0% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas.

In addition, fuel expense increased $30 million in 2018 as a result of an Alabama PSC accounting order authorizing the amortization of a regulatory liability to offset under recovered fuel costs. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Retail Regulatory Matters – Tax Reform Accounting Order" herein for additional information.

Non-Affiliates

Purchased power expense from non-affiliates was

$216 million

in 2018, an increase of

$46 million

, or

27.1%

, compared to 2017. This increase was primarily due to an 18.9% increase in the amount of energy purchased due to colder weather in the first quarter and warmer weather in the second and third quarters 2018 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2017 and a 6.6% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased due to higher natural gas prices. Purchased power expense from non-affiliates was $170 million in 2017, an increase of $4 million, or 2.4%, compared to 2016.

Energy purchases from non-affiliates will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation.

Purchased Power

–

Affiliates

Purchased power expense from affiliates was

$216 million

in 2018, an increase of

$58 million

, or

36.7%

, compared to 2017. This increase was primarily due to a 34.5% increase in the amount of energy purchased due to colder weather in the first quarter and warmer weather in the second and third quarters 2018 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2017 and a 1.4% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased due to higher natural gas prices. Purchased power expense from affiliates was $158 million in 2017, a decrease of $10 million, or 6.0%, compared to 2016. This decrease was primarily due to a 17.2% decrease in the amount of energy purchased due to milder weather partially offset by a 13.9% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased due to higher natural gas prices.

Energy purchases from affiliates will vary depending on demand for energy and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company within the Southern Company system. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, as approved by the FERC.

Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses

In 2018, other operations and maintenance expenses decreased

$40 million

, or

2.3%

, as compared to the prior year. Generation costs decreased $34 million primarily due to fewer outages resulting in lower costs. Employee benefit costs, including pension costs, decreased $26 million primarily due to lower active medical costs. Customer service costs decreased $10 million primarily due to cost-saving initiatives. These decreases were partially offset by a $47 million increase in expenses from unregulated sales of products and services that were reclassified as other operations and maintenance expenses as a result of the adoption of ASC 606. In prior periods, these expenses were included in other income (expense), net. See Note 1 to the financial statements under "Revenue" for additional information.

In 2017, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $152 million, or 9.8%, as compared to the prior year. Distribution and transmission expenses increased $58 million primarily due to vegetation management expenses. Generation costs increased $38 million primarily due to outage costs. Employee benefit costs, including pension costs, increased $32 million.

See Note


to the financial statements under "Pension Plans" for additional information.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization increased

$28 million

, or

3.8%

, in 2018 as compared to the prior year primarily due to additional plant in service related to distribution, transmission, compliance-related steam, and other generation production projects. Depreciation and amortization increased $33 million, or 4.7%, in 2017 as compared to the prior year primarily due to additional plant in service and an increase in generation-related depreciation rates, effective January 1, 2017, associated with compliance-related steam projects and ARO recovery, partially offset by a decrease in distribution-related depreciation rates. See Note


to the financial statements under "Depreciation and Amortization" for additional information.

Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction

AFUDC equity increased

$23 million

, or

59.0%

, in 2018 as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily associated with steam and transmission construction projects.

expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $3 million, or 1.0%, in 2017 as compared to the prior year. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Financing Activities" herein for additional information.

Other Income (Expense), Net

Other income (expense), net decreased

$23 million

, or

53.5%

, in 2018 as compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in charitable donations and the reclassification of revenues and expenses associated with unregulated sales of products and services to other revenues and operations and maintenance expenses, respectively, as a result of the adoption of ASC 606. See Note 1 to the financial statements under "Revenue" for additional information. Other income (expense), net increased $17 million, or 65.4%, in 2017 as compared to the prior year primarily due to increases in unregulated lighting services and a decrease in the non-service cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefits costs. See Note 1 to the financial statements under "

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

" and Note


to the financial statements for additional information on net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs.

Income Taxes

Income taxes decreased

$277 million

, or

48.8%

, in 2018 as compared to the prior year primarily due to the reduction in the federal income tax rate, the benefit from the flowback of excess deferred income taxes as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation, and lower pre-tax earnings. Income taxes increased $37 million, or 7.0%, in 2017 as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings, an increase related to prior year tax return actualization, and an increase in income tax reserves, partially offset by an increase in state income tax credits. The impact to net income as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation was not material due to the application of regulatory accounting. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Income Tax Matters –

Federal Tax Reform Legislation

" herein and Note


to the financial statements for additional information.

Effects of Inflation

Alabama Power is subject to rate regulation that is generally based on the recovery of historical and projected costs. The effects of inflation can create an economic loss since the recovery of costs could be in dollars that have less purchasing power. Any adverse effect of inflation on Alabama Power's results of operations has not been substantial in recent years. See Note


to the financial statements under "Alabama Power – Rate RSE" for additional information.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL

General

Alabama Power operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electric service to retail and wholesale customers within its traditional service territory located in the State of Alabama and to wholesale customers in the Southeast. Prices for electric service provided by Alabama Power to retail customers are set by the Alabama PSC under cost-based regulatory principles. Retail rates and earnings are reviewed and may be adjusted periodically within certain limitations. Prices for wholesale electric service, interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power are regulated by the FERC. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES – "Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Utility Regulation" herein and Note


to the financial statements under "Alabama Power" for additional information about regulatory matters.

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of future earnings potential. The level of Alabama Power's future earnings depends on numerous factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of Alabama Power's primary business of providing electric service. These factors include Alabama Power's ability to maintain a constructive regulatory environment that continues to allow for the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs during a time of increasing costs and the weak pace of growth in new customers and electricity use per customer, especially in residential and commercial markets. Earnings will also depend upon maintaining and growing sales, considering, among other things, the adoption and/or penetration rates of increasingly energy-efficient technologies and increasing volumes of electronic commerce transactions, both of which could contribute to a net reduction in customer usage. Earnings are subject to a variety of other factors. These factors include weather, competition, new energy contracts with other utilities, energy conservation practiced by customers, the use of alternative energy sources by customers, the price of electricity, the price elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic growth or decline in Alabama Power's service territory. Demand for electricity is primarily driven by the pace of economic growth that may be affected by changes in regional and global economic conditions, which may impact future earnings.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual Report

Environmental Matters

Alabama Power's

operations are regulated by state and federal environmental agencies through a variety of laws and regulations governing air, water, land, and protection of other natural resources.

Alabama Power

maintains comprehensive environmental compliance and GHG strategies to assess upcoming requirements and compliance costs associated with these environmental laws and regulations. The costs, including capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, and costs reflected in ARO liabilities, required to comply with environmental laws and regulations and to achieve stated goals may impact future electric generating unit retirement and replacement decisions, results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition. Related costs may result from the installation of additional environmental controls, closure and monitoring of CCR facilities, unit retirements, or changing fuel sources for certain existing units, as well as related upgrades to

Alabama Power's

transmission and distribution

systems. A major portion of these costs is expected to be recovered through

existing ratemaking provisions.

The ultimate impact of environmental laws and regulations and the GHG goals discussed herein will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements, the availability and cost of any deployed technology, fuel prices, and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges.

New or revised environmental laws and regulations could affect many areas of

Alabama Power's

operations. The impact of any such changes cannot be determined at this time. Environmental compliance costs could affect earnings if such costs cannot continue to be recovered in rates on a timely basis

. Environmental compliance costs are recovered through Rate CNP Compliance. See Note


to the financial statements under "Alabama Power – Rate CNP Compliance" for additional information

. Further, increased costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity

, which could negatively affect results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition.

Additionally, many commercial and industrial customers may also be affected by existing and future environmental requirements, which for some may have the potential to ultimately affect their demand for electricity

.

Through


, Alabama Power has invested approximately $5.4 billion in environmental capital retrofit projects to comply with environmental requirements, with annual totals of approximately $681 million, $491 million, and $260 million for


,


, and


, respectively. Although the timing, requirements, and estimated costs could change as environmental laws and regulations are adopted or modified, as compliance plans are revised or updated, and as legal challenges to rules are initiated or completed, Alabama Power's current compliance strategy estimates capital expenditures of $635 million from


through


, with annual totals of approximately $226 million in


, $68 million in


, $118 million in


, $112 million in


, and $111 million in


. These estimates do not include any potential compliance costs associated with pending regulation of CO


emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. See "Global Climate Issues" herein for additional information. Alabama Power also anticipates substantial expenditures associated with ash pond closure and ground water monitoring under the CCR Rule, which are reflected in Alabama Power's ARO liabilities. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations" herein and Note


to the financial statements for additional information.

Environmental Laws and Regulations

Air Quality

The EPA has set National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for six air pollutants (carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, particulate matter, and SO


) to protect and improve the nation's air quality, which it reviews and revises periodically. Following a NAAQS revision, states are required to develop an EPA-approved plan to protect air quality. These state plans can require additional emission controls, improvements in control efficiency, or fuel changes which can result in increased compliance and operational costs. NAAQS requirements can also adversely affect the siting of new electric generating facilities.

No areas within Alabama Power's service territory are currently designated nonattainment for any NAAQS. If areas

are designated as nonattainment in the future, increased compliance costs could result.

In 2011, the EPA finalized the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) to address impacts of SO


and NO

X

emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating plants. CSAPR establishes emissions trading programs and budgets for certain states and allocates emissions allowances for sources in those states.

In 2016, the EPA published a final rule establishing more stringent ozone season NO

X

emissions budgets in

Alabama

.

Increases in either future fossil fuel-fired generation or the availability or cost of CSAPR allowances could have a negative financial impact on results of operations for Alabama Power

.

The EPA finalized regional haze regulations in 2005 and 2017. These regulations require states, tribal governments, and various federal agencies to develop and implement plans to reduce pollutants that impair visibility and demonstrate reasonable progress toward the goal of restoring natural visibility conditions in certain areas, including national parks and wilderness areas.

States must submit a revised state implementation plan (SIP) to the EPA demonstrating continued reasonable progress towards achieving visibility improvement goals. The EPA approved the regional progress SIP for the State of Alabama.

II-77

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual Report

Water Quality

In 2014, the EPA finalized requirements under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) to regulate cooling water intake structures (CWIS) to minimize their effects on fish and other aquatic life at existing power plants (e.g. coal, natural gas, oil, and nuclear generating plants) and manufacturing facilities. The regulation requires plant-specific studies to determine applicable CWIS changes to protect organisms that either get caught on the intake screens (impingement) or are drawn into the cooling system (entrainment).

Alabama Power

is conducting these studies and currently anticipates applicable CWIS changes may include fish-friendly CWIS screens with fish return systems

and minor additions of monitoring equipment at certain plants.

However, the ultimate impact of this rule will depend on the outcome of these plant-specific studies, any additional protective measures required to be incorporated into each plant's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit based on site-specific factors, and the outcome of any legal challenges.

In 2015, the EPA finalized the steam electric effluent limitations guidelines (ELG) rule (2015 ELG Rule) that set national standards for wastewater discharges from new and existing steam electric generating units generating greater than 50 MWs. The 2015 ELG Rule prohibits effluent discharges of certain waste streams and imposes stringent limits on flue gas desulfurization (scrubber) wastewater discharges. The revised technology-based limits and the CCR Rule require extensive changes to existing ash and wastewater management systems or the installation and operation of new ash and wastewater management systems. Compliance with the 2015 ELG Rule is expected to require capital expenditures and increased operational costs primarily for

Alabama Power's

coal-fired electric generation. State environmental agencies will incorporate specific compliance applicability dates in the NPDES permitting process for each ELG waste stream no later than December 31, 2023. The EPA is scheduled to issue a new rulemaking by December 2019 that could revise the limitations and applicability dates of two of the waste streams regulated in the 2015 ELG Rule. The impact of any changes to the 2015 ELG Rule will depend on the content of the new rule and the outcome of any legal challenges.

Alabama Power does not anticipate that the unavailability of any units as a result of the ELG rule will have a material impact on Alabama Power's operations or financial condition.

In 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) jointly published a final rule that revised the regulatory definition of waters of the United States (WOTUS) for all CWA programs. The rule significantly expanded the scope of federal jurisdiction over waterbodies (such as rivers, streams, canals, and wastewater treatment ponds), which could impact new generation projects

and permitting and reporting requirements associated with the installation, expansion, and maintenance of transmission

and distribution projects.

The EPA and the Corps are expected to publish a final rule in 2019 to replace the 2015 WOTUS definition. The impact of any changes to the 2015 WOTUS rule will depend on the content of this final rule and the outcome of any legal challenges.

Coal Combustion Residuals

In 2015, the EPA finalized non-hazardous solid waste regulations for the disposal of CCR, including coal ash and gypsum, in landfills and surface impoundments (ash ponds) at active generating power plants.

In addition to the EPA's CCR Rule, the State of Alabama has also finalized regulations regarding the handling of CCR that have been provided to the EPA for review. This state CCR rule is generally consistent with the federal CCR Rule.

The EPA's CCR Rule requires landfills and ash ponds to be evaluated against a set of performance criteria and potentially closed if minimum criteria are not met. Closure of existing landfills and ash ponds could require installation of equipment and infrastructure to manage CCR in accordance with the CCR Rule.

Based on cost estimates for closure in place and monitoring of ash ponds pursuant to the CCR Rule, Alabama Power recorded AROs for each CCR unit in 2015. As further analysis was performed and closure details were developed, Alabama Power has continued

to periodically update these cost estimates, as discussed further below.

The EPA published certain amendments to the CCR Rule, which became effective August 29, 2018. These amendments extend the date from April 2019 to October 31, 2020 to cease sending CCR and other waste streams to ash ponds that demonstrate compliance with all except two of the specified performance criteria.

On August 21, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a decision suggesting the EPA should regulate previously-excluded inactive ash ponds located at retired generation facilities and questioning both the ability of unlined ash ponds to continue operating no matter the performance criteria results and the classification of clay-lined landfills and ash ponds.

These developments could impact the expected timing of

Alabama Power's

landfill and ash pond closure activities, but the extent of any impact will depend on the outcome of ongoing litigation, anticipated EPA rulemaking action to establish further guidance, and the outcome of any legal challenges.

In June 2018, Alabama Power recorded an increase of approximately $1.2 billion to its AROs related to the CCR Rule.

The revised cost estimates were based on information from feasibility studies performed on ash ponds in use at plants operated by Alabama Power

.

During the second quarter 2018, Alabama Power's management completed its analysis of these studies which indicated that additional closure costs, primarily related to increases in estimated ash volume, water management requirements,

II-78


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual Report

and design revisions, will be required to close these ash ponds under the planned closure-in-place methodology.

As the level of work becomes more defined in the next 12 months, it is likely that these cost estimates will change and the change could be material.

Alabama Power expects to periodically update its ARO cost estimates. Absent continued recovery of ARO costs through regulated rates, Alabama Power's results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition could be materially impacted. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations" herein and Note


to the financial statements for additional information.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Nuclear Decommissioning

In June 2018, Alabama Power completed an updated decommissioning cost site study for Plant Farley. The estimated cost of decommissioning based on the study resulted in an increase in Alabama Power's ARO liability of approximately $300 million. Amounts previously contributed to Alabama Power's external trust funds are currently projected to be adequate to meet the updated decommissioning obligations.

See Note


to the financial statements for additional information.

Global Climate Issues

On August 31, 2018, the EPA published a proposed rule known as the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule, which is intended to replace a regulation enacted in 2015 known as the Clean Power Plan (CPP), that would limit CO


emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. The CPP has been stayed by the U.S. Supreme Court since 2016. The ACE Rule would require states to develop GHG unit-specific emission rate standards based on heat-rate efficiency improvements for existing fossil fuel-fired steam units. As proposed, combustion turbines, including natural gas combined cycles, are not affected sources. As of January 1, 2019,

Alabama Power has ownership interests in 20

fossil fuel-fired steam units to which the proposed ACE Rule is applicable. The ultimate impact of this rule to

Alabama Power

is currently unknown and will depend on changes between the proposal and the final rule, subsequent state plan developments and requirements, and any associated legal challenges.

On December 20, 2018, the EPA published a proposed review of the Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from New, Modified, and Reconstructed Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units final rule (2015 NSPS rule). The EPA's final 2015 NSPS rule set standards of performance for new, modified, and reconstructed electric utility generating units which included stationary combustion turbines and fossil-fired steam boilers. This proposal reduces the stringency of the 2015 NSPS rule by not basing the new and reconstructed fossil-fired steam boiler and IGCC standards on partial carbon capture and sequestration. The impact of any changes to this rule will depend on the content of the final rule and the outcome of any legal challenges.

The EPA's GHG reporting rule requires annual reporting of GHG emissions expressed in terms of metric tons of CO


equivalent emissions for a company's operational control of facilities. Based on ownership or financial control of facilities, Alabama Power's


GHG emissions were approximately 37 million metric tons of CO


equivalent. The preliminary estimate of Alabama Power's


GHG emissions on the same basis is approximately 36 million metric tons of CO


equivalent.

Through 2017, the Southern Company system has achieved an estimated GHG emission reduction of 36% since 2007.

In April 2018, Southern Company established an intermediate goal of a 50% reduction in carbon emissions from 2007 levels by 2030 and a long-term goal of low- to no-carbon operations by 2050. To achieve these goals, the Southern Company system expects to continue growing its renewable energy portfolio, optimize technology advancements to modernize its transmission and distribution systems, increase the use of natural gas for generation,

complete ongoing construction projects,

invest in energy efficiency, and continue research and development efforts focused on technologies to lower GHG emissions. The Southern Company system's ability to achieve these goals also will be dependent on many external factors, including supportive national energy policies, low natural gas prices, and the development, deployment, and advancement of relevant energy technologies.

FERC Matters

Open Access Transmission Tariff

On May 10, 2018, AMEA and Cooperative Energy filed with the FERC a complaint against SCS and the traditional electric operating companies

(including Alabama Power)

claiming that the current

11.25%

base ROE used in calculating the annual transmission revenue requirements of the traditional electric operating companies'

(including Alabama Power's)

open access transmission tariff is unjust and unreasonable as measured by the applicable FERC standards. The complaint requested that the base ROE be set no higher than

8.65%

and that the FERC order refunds for the difference in revenue requirements that results from applying a just and reasonable ROE established in this proceeding upon determining the current ROE is unjust and

II-79

unreasonable.

On June 18, 2018, SCS and the traditional electric operating companies

(including Alabama Power)

filed their response challenging the adequacy of the showing presented by the complainants and offering support for the current ROE. On September 6, 2018, the FERC issued an order establishing a refund effective date of May 10, 2018 in the event a refund is due and initiating an investigation and settlement procedures regarding the current base ROE.

Through December 31, 2018, the estimated maximum potential refund is not expected to be material to

Alabama Power's

results of operations or cash flows.

The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Retail Regulatory Matters

Alabama Power

's revenues from regulated retail operations are collected through various rate mechanisms subject to the oversight of the Alabama PSC.

Alabama Power

currently recovers its costs from the regulated retail business primarily through Rate RSE, Rate CNP, Rate ECR, and Rate NDR. In addition, the Alabama PSC issues accounting orders to address current events impacting

Alabama Power. See Note


to the financial statements under "Alabama Power" for additional information regarding Alabama Power's rate mechanisms and accounting orders.

Rate RSE

The Alabama PSC has adopted Rate RSE that provides for periodic annual adjustments based upon Alabama Power's projected weighted common equity return (WCER) compared to an allowable range. Rate RSE adjustments are based on forward-looking information for the applicable upcoming calendar year. Rate RSE adjustments for any two-year period, when averaged together, cannot exceed 4.0% and any annual adjustment is limited to 5.0%. When the projected WCER is under the allowed range, there is an adjusting point of 5.98% and eligibility for a performance-based adder of seven basis points, or 0.07%, to the WCER adjusting point if Alabama Power (i) has an "A" credit rating equivalent with at least one of the recognized rating agencies or (ii) is in the top one-third of a designated customer value benchmark survey. If Alabama Power's actual retail return is above the allowed WCER range, the excess will be refunded to customers unless otherwise directed by the Alabama PSC; however, there is no provision for additional customer billings should the actual retail return fall below the WCER range. Prior to January 2019, retail rates remained unchanged when the WCER range was between 5.75% and 6.21%.

On May 1, 2018, the Alabama PSC approved modifications to Rate RSE and other commitments designed to position Alabama Power to address the growing pressure on its credit quality resulting from the Tax Reform Legislation, without increasing retail rates under Rate RSE in the near term. Alabama Power plans to reduce growth in total debt by increasing equity, with corresponding reductions in debt issuances, thereby de-leveraging its capital structure. Alabama Power's goal is to achieve an equity ratio of approximately 55% by the end of 2025. At December 31, 2018, Alabama Power's equity ratio was approximately 47%.

The approved modifications to Rate RSE began for billings in January 2019. The modifications include reducing the top of the allowed WCER range from 6.21% to 6.15% and modifications to the refund mechanism applicable to prior year actual results. The modifications to the refund mechanism allow Alabama Power to retain a portion of the revenue that causes the actual WCER for a given year to exceed the allowed range.

Generally, if Alabama Power's actual WCER is between 6.15% and 7.65%, customers will receive 25% of the amount between 6.15% and 6.65%, 40% of the amount between 6.65% and 7.15%, and 75% of the amount between 7.15% and 7.65%. Customers will receive all amounts in excess of an actual WCER of 7.65%.

In conjunction with these modifications to Rate RSE, on May 8, 2018, Alabama Power consented to a moratorium on any upward adjustments under Rate RSE for 2019 and 2020 and will also return $50 million to customers through bill credits in 2019.

On November 30, 2018, Alabama Power made its required annual Rate RSE submission to the Alabama PSC of projected data for calendar year 2019. Projected earnings were within the specified range; therefore, retail rates under Rate RSE remain unchanged for 2019.

At December 31, 2018, Alabama Power's retail return exceeded the allowed WCER range, which resulted in Alabama Power establishing a regulatory liability of $109 million for Rate RSE refunds. In accordance with an Alabama PSC order issued on February 5, 2019, Alabama Power will apply $75 million to reduce the Rate ECR under recovered balance and the remaining $34 million will be refunded to customers through bill credits in July through September 2019.

Rate CNP PPA

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual Report

Rate CNP PPA.

No adjustments to Rate CNP PPA occurred during the period 2016 through 2018 and no adjustment is expected in 2019.

In accordance with an accounting order issued in February 2017 by the Alabama PSC, Alabama Power reclassified $69 million of the December 31, 2016 Rate CNP PPA under recovered balance to a separate regulatory asset. The amortization of the new regulatory asset through Rate RSE will begin concurrently with the effective date of Alabama Power's next depreciation study, which is expected to occur no later than 2022.

Rate CNP Compliance

Rate CNP Compliance allows for the recovery of Alabama Power's retail costs associated with laws, regulations, and other such mandates directed at the utility industry involving the environment, security, reliability, safety, sustainability, or similar considerations impacting Alabama Power's facilities or operations. Rate CNP Compliance is based on forward-looking information and provides for the recovery of these costs pursuant to a factor that is calculated annually. Compliance costs to be recovered include operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation, and a return on certain invested capital. Revenues for Rate CNP Compliance, as recorded on the financial statements, are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor will have no significant effect on Alabama Power's revenues or net income, but will affect annual cash flow. Changes in Rate CNP Compliance-related operations and maintenance expenses and depreciation generally will have

no

effect on net income.

In accordance with an accounting order issued in February 2017 by the Alabama PSC, Alabama Power reclassified $36 million of its under recovered balance in Rate CNP Compliance to a separate regulatory asset. The amortization of the new regulatory asset through Rate RSE will begin concurrently with the effective date of Alabama Power's next depreciation study, which is expected to occur no later than 2022.

On November 30, 2018, Alabama Power submitted calculations associated with its cost of complying with environmental mandates, as provided under Rate CNP Compliance. The filing reflected a projected unrecovered retail revenue requirement for environmental compliance of approximately $205 million, which is being recovered in the billing months of January 2019 through December 2019.

Rate ECR

Alabama Power has established energy cost recovery rates under Alabama Power's Rate ECR as approved by the Alabama PSC. Rates are based on an estimate of future energy costs and the current over or under recovered balance. Revenues recognized under Rate ECR and recorded on the financial statements are adjusted for the difference in actual recoverable fuel costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. The difference in the recoverable fuel costs and amounts billed give rise to the over or under recovered amounts recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities. Alabama Power, along with the Alabama PSC, continually monitors the over or under recovered cost balance to determine whether an adjustment to billing rates is required. Changes in the Rate ECR factor have no significant effect on Alabama Power's net income, but will impact operating cash flows. Currently, the Alabama PSC may approve billing rates under Rate ECR of up to 5.910 cents per KWH.

In accordance with an accounting order issued in February 2017 by the Alabama PSC, Alabama Power reclassified $36 million of its under recovered balance in Rate ECR to a separate regulatory asset. The amortization of the new regulatory asset through Rate RSE will begin concurrently with the effective date of Alabama Power's next depreciation study, which is expected to occur no later than 2022. Alabama Power's current depreciation study became effective January 1, 2017.

On May 1, 2018, the Alabama PSC approved an increase to Rate ECR from 2.015 cents per KWH to 2.353 cents per KWH effective July 2018 through December 2018. On December 4, 2018, the Alabama PSC issued a consent order to leave this rate in effect through December 31, 2019. This change is expected to increase collections by approximately $183 million in 2019. Absent any further order from the Alabama PSC, in January 2020, the rates will return to the originally authorized 5.910 cents per KWH.

As discussed herein under "Rate RSE," in accordance with an Alabama PSC order issued on February 5, 2019, Alabama Power will utilize $75 million of the 2018 Rate RSE refund liability to reduce the Rate ECR under recovered balance.

Tax Reform Accounting Order

On May 1, 2018, the Alabama PSC approved an accounting order that authorized Alabama Power to defer the benefits of federal excess deferred income taxes associated with the Tax Reform Legislation for the year ended December 31, 2018 as a regulatory liability and to use up to $30 million of such deferrals to offset under recovered amounts under Rate ECR. The estimated deferrals for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled approximately $63 million, subject to adjustment following the filing of the 2018 tax return, of which $30 million was used to offset the Rate ECR under recovered balance and $33 million is recorded in other

regulatory liabilities, deferred on the balance sheet to be used for the benefit of customers as determined by the Alabama PSC at a future date. See Note


to the financial statements under "Current and Deferred Income Taxes" for additional information.

Software Accounting Order

On February 5, 2019, the Alabama PSC approved an accounting order that authorizes Alabama Power to establish a regulatory asset for operations and maintenance costs associated with software implementation projects. The regulatory asset will be amortized ratably over the life of the related software.

Plant Greene County

Alabama Power jointly owns Plant Greene County with an affiliate, Mississippi Power. See Note


to the financial statements under "

Joint Ownership Agreements

" for additional information regarding the joint ownership agreement. On August 6, 2018, Mississippi Power filed its proposed Reserve Margin Plan (RMP) with the Mississippi PSC, which proposes a four-year acceleration of the retirement of Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 to the third quarter 2021 and the third quarter 2022, respectively. Mississippi Power's proposed Plant Greene County unit retirements would require the completion of proposed transmission and system reliability improvements, as well as agreement by Alabama Power. Alabama Power will continue to monitor the status of Mississippi Power's proposed RMP and associated regulatory process as well as the proposed transmission and system reliability improvements. Alabama Power will review all the facts and circumstances and will evaluate all its alternatives prior to reaching a final determination on the ongoing operations of Plant Greene County. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Request for Proposals for Future Generation

On September 21, 2018, Alabama Power issued a request for proposals of between 100 MWs and 1,200 MWs of capacity beginning no later than 2023. On November 9, 2018, bids were received and an evaluation of those bids is in progress. Any purchases will depend upon the cost competitiveness of the respective offers as well as other options available to Alabama Power. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Rate NDR

Based on an order from the Alabama PSC, Alabama Power maintains a reserve for operations and maintenance expenses to cover the cost of damages from major storms to its transmission and distribution facilities. The order approves a separate monthly Rate NDR charge to customers consisting of two components. The first component is intended to establish and maintain a reserve balance for future storms and is an on-going part of customer billing. When the reserve balance falls below

$50 million

, a reserve establishment charge will be activated (and the on-going reserve maintenance charge concurrently suspended) until the reserve balance reaches

$75 million

. In December 2017, the reserve maintenance charge was suspended and the reserve establishment charge was activated as a result of the NDR balance falling below

$50 million

. Alabama Power expects to collect approximately $16 million annually until the reserve balance is restored to $75 million. The NDR balance at December 31, 2018 was

$20 million

and is included in other regulatory liabilities, deferred on the balance sheet.

The second component of the Rate NDR charge is intended to allow recovery of any existing deferred storm-related operations and maintenance costs and any future reserve deficits over a


-month period. The Alabama PSC order gives Alabama Power authority to record a deficit balance in the NDR when costs of storm damage exceed any established reserve balance. Absent further Alabama PSC approval, the maximum total Rate NDR charge consisting of both components is

$10

per month per non-residential customer account and

$5

per month per residential customer account. Alabama Power has the authority, based on an order from the Alabama PSC, to accrue certain additional amounts as circumstances warrant.

As revenue from the Rate NDR charge is recognized, an equal amount of operations and maintenance expenses related to the NDR will also be recognized. As a result, the Rate NDR charge will not have an effect on net income but will impact operating cash flows.

Environmental Accounting Order

Based on an order from the Alabama PSC (Environmental Accounting Order), Alabama Power is allowed to establish a regulatory asset to record the unrecovered investment costs, including the unrecovered plant asset balance and the unrecovered costs associated with site removal and closure associated with future unit retirements caused by environmental regulations. The regulatory asset is being amortized and recovered over the affected unit's remaining useful life, as established prior to the decision regarding early retirement through Rate CNP Compliance. At December 31, 2018, this regulatory asset had a balance of $42 million. See "Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and Regulations" herein for additional information regarding environmental regulations.

II-82

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual Report

Subsequent to December 31, 2018, Alabama Power determined that Plant Gorgas Units 8, 9, and 10 (approximately

1,000

MWs) will be retired by April 15, 2019 due to the expected costs of compliance with federal and state environmental regulations. In accordance with the Environmental Accounting Order, approximately

$740 million

of net investment costs will be transferred to a regulatory asset at the retirement date and recovered over the affected units' remaining useful lives, as established prior to the decision to retire.

Income Tax Matters

Federal Tax Reform Legislation

In December 2017, the Tax Reform Legislation was signed into law and became effective on January 1, 2018. The Tax Reform Legislation, among other things, reduced the federal corporate income tax rate to 21%, retained normalization provisions for public utility property and existing renewable energy incentives, and repealed the corporate alternative minimum tax. In addition, under the Tax Reform Legislation, net operating losses (NOLs) generated after December 31, 2017 can no longer be carried back to previous tax years but can be carried forward indefinitely, with utilization limited to 80% of taxable income of the subsequent tax year. The projected reduction of Southern Company's consolidated income tax liability resulting from the tax rate reduction also delays the expected utilization of existing tax credit carryforwards. See Note


to the financial statements for information on Southern Company's joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement.

Following the enactment of the Tax Reform Legislation, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 – "Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" (SAB 118), which provided for a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date to complete accounting under GAAP for the tax effects of the legislation. Due to the complex and comprehensive nature of the enacted tax law changes and their application under GAAP, Alabama Power considered all amounts recorded in the financial statements as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation "provisional" as discussed in SAB 118 and subject to revision prior to filing its 2017 tax return in the fourth quarter 2018. Alabama Power recognized tax expense of $3 million in 2017 as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation. In addition, in total, Alabama Power recorded a $281 million decrease in regulatory assets and a $2.0 billion increase in regulatory liabilities as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation. As of December 31, 2018, Alabama Power considered the measurement of impacts from the Tax Reform Legislation on deferred income tax assets and liabilities, primarily due to the impact of the reduction of the corporate income tax rate, to be complete.

However, the IRS continues to issue regulations that provide further interpretation and guidance on the law and each state's adoption of the provisions contained in the Tax Reform Legislation remains uncertain. The regulatory treatment of certain impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation is subject to the discretion of the FERC. The ultimate impact of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note


to the financial statements under "Alabama Power – Rate RSE" for additional information regarding modifications to Rate RSE to reflect the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. Also see FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Credit Rating Risk" herein and Note


to the financial statements under "Current and Deferred Income Taxes" for additional information.

Bonus Depreciation

Under the Tax Reform Legislation, projects with binding contracts prior to September 28, 2017 and placed in service after September 27, 2017 remain eligible for bonus depreciation under the PATH Act. The PATH Act allowed for 50% bonus depreciation for 2015 through 2017, 40% bonus depreciation for 2018, and 30% bonus depreciation for 2019 and certain long-lived assets placed in service in 2020. Based on provisional estimates, bonus depreciation is expected to result in positive cash flows of approximately $100 million for the 2018 tax year and approximately $30 million for the 2019 tax year. See Note


to the financial statements under "Current and Deferred Income Taxes" for additional information. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Other Matters

Alabama Power is involved in various other matters being litigated and regulatory matters that could affect future earnings. In addition, Alabama Power is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. Alabama Power's business activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the environment, such as laws and regulations governing air, water, land, and protection of other natural resources. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, has occurred throughout the U.S. This litigation has included claims for damages alleged to have been caused by CO


and other emissions, CCR, and alleged exposure to hazardous materials, and/or requests for injunctive relief in connection with such matters.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual Report

The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation or regulatory matters cannot be predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically reported herein or in Notes


and


to the financial statements, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings would have a material effect on Alabama Power's financial statements. See Notes


and


to the financial statements for a discussion of various other contingencies, regulatory matters, and other matters being litigated which may affect future earnings potential.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Alabama Power prepares its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Significant accounting policies are described in Notes


,


, and


to the financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may have a material impact on Alabama Power's results of operations and related disclosures. Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those recorded in the financial statements. Senior management has reviewed and discussed the following critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors.

Utility Regulation

Alabama Power is subject to retail regulation by the Alabama PSC and wholesale regulation by the FERC. As a result, Alabama Power applies accounting standards which require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the ratemaking process, the regulators may require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when they would be recognized by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of expenses and the recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery through rates or the deferral of gains or creation of liabilities and the recording of related regulatory liabilities. The application of the accounting standards has a further effect on Alabama Power's financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from those actually incurred by Alabama Power; therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation, AROs, and pension and other postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on Alabama Power's results of operations and financial condition than they would on a non-regulated company.

As reflected in Note


to the financial statements under "

Alabama Power

–

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

," significant regulatory assets and liabilities have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of these regulatory assets and any requirement to refund these regulatory liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines and GAAP. However, adverse legislative, judicial, or regulatory actions could materially impact the amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could adversely impact Alabama Power's financial statements.

Asset Retirement Obligations

AROs are computed as the fair value of the estimated costs for an asset's future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The estimated costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. In the absence of quoted market prices, AROs are estimated using present value techniques in which estimates of future cash outlays associated with the asset retirements are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Estimates of the timing and amounts of future cash outlays are based on projections of when and how the assets will be retired and the cost of future removal activities.

The liability for AROs primarily relates to the decommissioning of Alabama Power's nuclear facility, Plant Farley, and facilities that are subject to the CCR Rule and the related state rule, principally ash ponds. In addition, Alabama Power has AROs related to various landfill sites, underground storage tanks, asbestos removal related to ongoing repair and maintenance, disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers, and disposal of sulfur hexafluoride gas in certain substation breakers.

Alabama Power also has identified retirement obligations related to certain transmission and distribution facilities, asbestos containing material within long-term assets not subject to ongoing repair and maintenance activities, and certain wireless communication towers. However, liabilities for the removal of these assets have not been recorded because the settlement timing for the retirement obligations related to these assets is indeterminable and, therefore, the fair value of the retirement obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. A liability for these retirement obligations will be recognized when sufficient information becomes available to support a reasonable estimation of the retirement obligation.

The cost estimates for AROs related to the disposal of CCR are based on information using various assumptions related to closure and post-closure costs, timing of future cash outlays, inflation and discount rates, and the potential methods for complying with the CCR Rule requirements for closure in place. In June 2018, Alabama Power recorded increases of approximately $1.2 billion

II-84


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual Report

to its AROs related to the CCR Rule and approximately $300 million to its AROs related to updated nuclear decommissioning cost site studies. The revised CCR-related cost estimates as of June 30, 2018 were based on information from feasibility studies performed on ash ponds in use at the plants Alabama Power operates. During the second quarter 2018, Alabama Power's management completed its analysis of these studies which indicated that additional closure costs, primarily related to increases in estimated ash volume, water management requirements, and design revisions, will be required to close these ash ponds under the planned closure-in-place methodology. As the level of work becomes more defined in the next 12 months, it is likely that these cost estimates will change and the change could be material. Alabama Power expects to periodically update its ARO cost estimates. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and Regulations – Coal Combustion Residuals" herein and Note


to the financial statements for additional information.

Given the significant judgment involved in estimating AROs, Alabama Power considers the liabilities for AROs to be critical accounting estimates.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Alabama Power's calculation of pension and other postretirement benefits expense is dependent on a number of assumptions. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected long-term return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary and wage increases, and other factors. Components of pension and other postretirement benefits expense include interest and service cost on the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, expected return on plan assets, and amortization of certain unrecognized costs and obligations. Actual results that differ from the assumptions utilized are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While Alabama Power believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect its pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations.

Key elements in determining Alabama Power's pension and other postretirement benefit expense are the expected long-term return on plan assets and the discount rate used to measure the benefit plan obligations and the periodic benefit plan expense for future periods. The expected long-term return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets is based on Southern Company's investment strategy, historical experience, and expectations for long-term rates of return that consider external actuarial advice. Southern Company determines the long-term return on plan assets by applying the long-term rate of expected returns on various asset classes to Southern Company's target asset allocation. For purposes of determining Alabama Power's liability related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, Southern Company discounts the future related cash flows using a single-point discount rate developed from the weighted average of market-observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to expected benefit payments.

A 25 basis point change in any significant assumption (discount rate, salary increases, or long-term rate of return on plan assets) would result in a $9 million or less change in total annual benefit expense, a $99 million or less change in the projected obligation for the pension plan, and an $11 million or less change in the projected obligation for other post retirement benefit plans.

Alabama Power recorded pension costs of $27 million, $9 million, and $11 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Postretirement benefit costs for Alabama Power were $2 million, $3 million, and $4 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Such amounts are dependent on several factors including trust earnings and changes to the plans. A portion of pension and other postretirement benefit costs is capitalized based on construction-related labor charges. Pension and other postretirement benefit costs are a component of the regulated rates and generally do not have a long-term effect on net income.

See Note


to the financial statements for additional information regarding pension and other postretirement benefits.

Contingent Obligations

Alabama Power is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other factors and conditions that subject it to environmental, litigation, and other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Notes


and


to the financial statements for more information regarding certain of these contingencies. Alabama Power periodically evaluates its exposure to such risks and records reserves for those matters where a non-tax-related loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable. The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or conditions that can be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially affect Alabama Power's results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

Alabama Power's financial condition remained stable at December 31, 2018. Alabama Power's cash requirements primarily consist of funding ongoing operations, common stock dividends, capital expenditures, and debt maturities. Capital expenditures and other investing activities include investments to meet projected long-term demand requirements, to maintain existing generation facilities, to comply with environmental regulations including adding environmental modifications to certain existing generating units and closures of ash ponds, to expand and improve transmission and distribution facilities, and for restoration following major storms. Operating cash flows provide a substantial portion of Alabama Power's cash needs. For the three-year period from 2019 through 2021, Alabama Power's projected common stock dividends, capital expenditures, and debt maturities are expected to exceed operating cash flows. Alabama Power plans to finance future cash needs in excess of its operating cash flows primarily through external securities issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, or equity contributions from Southern Company. Alabama Power plans to use commercial paper to manage seasonal variations in operating cash flows and for other working capital needs. Alabama Power intends to continue to monitor its access to short-term and long-term capital markets as well as its bank credit arrangements to meet future capital and liquidity needs. See "Sources of Capital," "Financing Activities," and "Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations" herein for additional information.

Alabama Power's investments in the qualified pension plan and the nuclear decommissioning trust funds decreased in value as of December 31, 2018 as compared to December 31, 2017. No contributions to the qualified pension plan were made for the year ended December 31, 2018 and no mandatory contributions to the qualified pension plan are anticipated during


. Alabama Power's funding obligations for the nuclear decommissioning trust funds are based on the most recent site study completed in 2018, and the next study is expected to be conducted by 2023. See Notes


and


to the financial statements under "

Nuclear Decommissioning

" and "

Pension Plans

," respectively, for additional information.

Net cash provided from operating activities totaled $

1.9 billion

for 2018, an increase of $44 million as compared to 2017. The increase in cash provided from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in weather-related revenues, fuel cost recovery, and income tax refunds received in 2018, partially offset by materials and supplies purchases, the timing of vendor payments, and settlement of AROs. Net cash provided from operating activities totaled $1.8 billion for 2017, a decrease of $112 million as compared to 2017. The decrease in cash provided from operating activities was primarily due to the timing of income tax payments in 2017 and the receipt of income tax refunds in 2016 as a result of bonus depreciation, partially offset by the voluntary contribution to the qualified pension plan in 2016.

II-86

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual Report

Net cash used for investing activities totaled

$2.3 billion

for 2018, $1.9 billion for 2017, and $1.4 billion for 2016. These activities were primarily related to gross property additions for environmental, distribution, transmission, and steam generation assets.

Net cash provided from financing activities totaled

$177 million

in 2018 primarily due to issuances of long-term debt and additional capital contributions from Southern Company, partially offset by the payment of common stock dividends and a maturity of long-term debt. Net cash provided from financing activities totaled $163 million in 2017 primarily due to issuances of long-term debt and additional capital contributions from Southern Company, partially offset by the payment of common stock dividends and maturities of long-term debt. Fluctuations in cash flow from financing activities vary from year to year based on capital needs and the maturity or redemption of securities.

Significant balance sheet changes for 2018 included increases of $2.84 billion in property, plant, and equipment primarily due to $1.35 billion in AROs and additions to nuclear, distribution, and transmission assets. Other changes include $522 million in capital contributions from Southern Company and $295 million in long-term debt primarily due to a senior notes issuance. See Notes


and 8 to the financial statements for additional information related to changes in Alabama Power's AROs and financing activities, respectively.

Alabama Power's ratio of common equity to total capitalization plus short-term debt was

47.0%

and 46.3% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See Note


to the financial statements for additional information.

Sources of Capital

Alabama Power plans to obtain the funds to meet its future capital needs from sources similar to those used in the past, which were primarily from operating cash flows, external security issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, and equity contributions from Southern Company. However, the amount, type, and timing of any future financings, if needed, will depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory approval, and other factors. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, Alabama Power received a capital contribution totaling $1.225 billion from Southern Company.

Security issuances are subject to regulatory approval by the Alabama PSC. Additionally, with respect to the public offering of securities, Alabama Power files registration statements with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The amounts of securities authorized by the Alabama PSC are continuously monitored and appropriate filings are made to ensure flexibility in the capital markets.

Alabama Power obtains financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. See Note


to the financial statements under "Bank Credit Arrangements" for additional information. The Southern Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of Alabama Power are not commingled with funds of any other company in the Southern Company system.

At December 31, 2018, Alabama Power's current liabilities exceeded current assets by $50 million. Alabama Power's current liabilities sometimes exceed current assets because of long-term debt maturities and the periodic use of short-term debt as a funding source, as well as significant seasonal fluctuations in cash needs.

At December 31, 2018, Alabama Power had approximately

$313 million

of cash and cash equivalents. Committed credit arrangements with banks at December 31, 2018 were as follows:

See Note


to the financial statements under "Bank Credit Arrangements" for additional information.

Most of these bank credit arrangements, as well as Alabama Power's term loan arrangements, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) of Alabama Power. Such cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if Alabama Power defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. At December 31, 2018, Alabama Power was in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings.

Subject to applicable market conditions, Alabama Power expects to renew or replace its bank credit arrangements as needed prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Alabama Power may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual Report

A portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to Alabama Power's pollution control revenue bonds and commercial paper programs. The amount of variable rate pollution control revenue bonds outstanding requiring liquidity support was $854 million at December 31, 2018.

Alabama Power also has substantial cash flow from operating activities and access to the capital markets, including a commercial paper program, to meet liquidity needs. Alabama Power may meet short-term cash needs through its commercial paper program. Alabama Power may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper at the request and for the benefit of Alabama Power and the other traditional electric operating companies. Proceeds from such issuances for the benefit of Alabama Power are loaned directly to Alabama Power. The obligations of each traditional electric operating company under these arrangements are several and there is no cross-affiliate credit support.

Details of short-term borrowings were as follows:

(*)

Average and maximum amounts are based upon daily balances during the 12-month periods ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.

Alabama Power believes that the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing commercial paper programs, lines of credit, and operating cash flows.

Financing Activities

In June 2018, Alabama Power issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of Series 2018A 4.300% Senior Notes due July 15, 2048. The proceeds were used to repay outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes, including Alabama Power's continuous construction program.

In October 2018, Alabama Power purchased and held $120 million aggregate principal amount of The Industrial Development Board of the City of Mobile, Alabama Pollution Control Revenue Bonds (Alabama Power Company Plant Barry Project), Series 2008. Alabama Power reoffered these bonds to the public in November 2018.

In November 2018, Alabama Power guaranteed a $100 million three-year bank term loan for SEGCO. See Note


to the financial statements under "Guarantees" for additional information.

Subsequent to December 31, 2018, Alabama Power repaid at maturity $200 million aggregate principal amount of Series Z 5.125% Senior Notes due February 15, 2019.

In addition to any financings that may be necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual obligations, Alabama Power plans to continue, when economically feasible, a program to retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit.

Credit Rating Risk

At December 31, 2018, Alabama Power did not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade.

II-88


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual Report

There are certain contracts that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change to BBB and/or Baa2 or below. These contracts are primarily for physical electricity purchases, fuel purchases, fuel transportation and storage, energy price risk management, and transmission.

The maximum potential collateral requirements under these contracts at December 31, 2018 were as follows:

Included in these amounts are certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that either Alabama Power or Georgia Power (an affiliate of Alabama Power) has a credit rating change to below investment grade. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. Additionally, a credit rating downgrade could impact the ability of Alabama Power to access capital markets and would be likely to impact the cost at which it does so.

On September 28, 2018, Fitch assigned a negative rating outlook to the ratings of Southern Company and certain of its subsidiaries (including Alabama Power).

Also on September 28, 2018, Moody's revised its rating outlook for Alabama Power from negative to stable.

As a result of the Tax Reform Legislation, certain financial metrics, such as the funds from operations to debt percentage, used by the credit rating agencies to assess Southern Company and its subsidiaries, including Alabama Power, may be negatively impacted. The modifications to Rate RSE and other commitments approved by the Alabama PSC are expected to help mitigate these potential adverse impacts to certain credit metrics and will help Alabama Power meet its goal of achieving an equity ratio of approximately 55% by the end of 2025. See Note


to the financial statements under "Alabama Power – Rate RSE" for additional information.

Market Price Risk

Due to cost-based rate regulation and other various cost recovery mechanisms, Alabama Power continues to have limited exposure to market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity. To manage the volatility attributable to these exposures, Alabama Power nets the exposures, where possible, to take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to Alabama Power's policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and risk management practices. Alabama Power's policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including, but not limited to, market valuation, value at risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis.

To mitigate future exposure to changes in interest rates, Alabama Power may enter into derivatives designated as hedges. The weighted average interest rate on $1.1 billion of long-term variable interest rate exposure at December 31, 2018 was 2.5%. If Alabama Power sustained a 100 basis point change in interest rates for all long-term variable interest rate exposure, the change would affect annualized interest expense by approximately $11 million at December 31, 2018. See Note


to the financial statements under "Financial Instruments" and Note


to the financial statements for additional information.

To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, Alabama Power enters into physical fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity market and financial hedge contracts for natural gas purchases. Alabama Power continues to manage a retail fuel-hedging program implemented per the guidelines of the Alabama PSC. Alabama Power had no material change in market risk exposure for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.

In addition, Rate ECR allows the recovery of specific costs associated with the sales of natural gas that become necessary due to operating considerations at Alabama Power's electric generating facilities. Rate ECR also allows recovery of the cost of financial instruments used for hedging market price risk up to 75% of the budgeted annual amount of natural gas purchases. Alabama Power may not engage in natural gas hedging activities that extend beyond a rolling 42-month window. Also, the premiums paid for natural gas financial options may not exceed 5% of Alabama Power's natural gas budget for that year.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual Report

The changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts are substantially attributable to both the volume and the price of natural gas. For the years ended December 31, the changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts, the majority of which are composed of regulatory hedges, were as follows:

(*)

Current period changes also include the changes in fair value of new contracts entered into during the period, if any.

The net hedge volumes of energy-related derivative contracts at

December 31, 2018

and


were as follows:

The weighted average swap contract cost above market prices was approximately $0.08 per mmBtu at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. The change in option fair value is primarily attributable to the volatility of the market and the underlying change in the natural gas price. Substantially all of the natural gas hedge gains and losses are recovered through Alabama Power's retail energy cost recovery clause.

At December 31, 2018 and 2017, substantially all of Alabama Power's energy-related derivative contracts were designated as regulatory hedges and were related to Alabama Power's fuel-hedging program. Therefore, gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense as they are recovered through the energy cost recovery clause. Certain other gains and losses on energy-related derivatives, designated as cash flow hedges, are initially deferred in OCI before being recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transaction. Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as incurred and were not material for any year presented.

Alabama Power uses over-the-counter contracts that are not exchange traded but are fair valued using prices which are market observable, and thus fall into Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. See Note


to the financial statements for further discussion of fair value measurements. The maturities of the energy-related derivative contracts, which are primarily Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, at December 31, 2018 were as follows:

Alabama Power is exposed to market price risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to energy-related and interest rate derivative contracts. Alabama Power only enters into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that have

investment grade credit ratings by Moody's and S&P, or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. Therefore, Alabama Power does not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the counterparties. For additional information, see Note


to the financial statements under "Financial Instruments" and Note


to the financial statements.

Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations

The construction program of Alabama Power is currently estimated to total $1.8 billion for 2019, $1.6 billion for 2020, $1.6 billion for 2021, $1.4 billion for 2022, and $1.5 billion for 2023. The construction program includes capital expenditures related to contractual purchase commitments for nuclear fuel and capital expenditures covered under LTSAs. Estimated capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations included in these amounts are $226 million for 2019, $68 million for 2020, $118 million for 2021, $112 million for 2022, and $111 million for 2023. These estimated expenditures do not include any potential compliance costs associated with pending regulation of CO


emissions from fossil-fuel-fired electric generating units. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and Regulations" and "– Global Climate Issues" herein for additional information.

Alabama Power also anticipates costs associated with closure-in-place and monitoring of ash ponds in accordance with the CCR Rule, which are reflected in Alabama Power's ARO liabilities. These costs, which are expected to change and could change materially as underlying assumptions are refined and the cost, method, and timing of compliance activities continue to be evaluated, are currently estimated to be $232 million for 2019, $238 million for 2020, $246 million for 2021, $252 million for 2022, and $258 million for 2023. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and Regulations – Coal Combustion Residuals" herein and Note


to the financial statements for additional information. Costs associated with the CCR Rule are expected to be recovered through Rate CNP Compliance.

The construction program is subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions; changes in load projections; changes in environmental laws and regulations; the outcome of any legal challenges to environmental rules; changes in generating plants, including unit retirements and replacements and adding or changing fuel sources at existing generating units, to meet regulatory requirements; changes in the expected environmental compliance program; changes in FERC rules and regulations; Alabama PSC approvals; changes in legislation; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes; storm impacts; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered.

As a result of NRC requirements, Alabama Power has external trust funds for nuclear decommissioning costs; however, Alabama Power currently has no additional funding requirements. For additional information, see Note


to the financial statements under "Nuclear Decommissioning."

In addition, as discussed in Note


to the financial statements, Alabama Power provides postretirement benefits to substantially all employees and funds trusts to the extent required by the Alabama PSC and the FERC.

Funding requirements related to obligations associated with scheduled maturities of long-term debt, as well as the related interest, derivative obligations, pension and other postretirement benefit plans, preferred stock dividends, leases, other purchase commitments, and ARO settlements are detailed in the contractual obligations table that follows.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual Report

OVERVIEW

Business Activities

Georgia Power operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electric service to retail customers within its traditional service territory located within the State of Georgia and to wholesale customers in the Southeast.

Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of Georgia Power's business of providing electric service. These factors include the ability to maintain a constructive regulatory environment, to maintain and grow energy sales and customers, and to effectively manage and secure timely recovery of costs. These costs include those related to projected long-term demand growth, stringent environmental standards, including CCR rules, reliability, fuel, capital expenditures, including new generating facilities and expanding and improving transmission and distribution facilities, and restoration following major storms. Georgia Power has various regulatory mechanisms that operate to address cost recovery. Effectively operating pursuant to these regulatory mechanisms and appropriately balancing required costs and capital expenditures with customer prices will continue to challenge Georgia Power for the foreseeable future. On April 3, 2018, the Georgia PSC approved the Georgia Power Tax Reform Settlement Agreement, which provides for a total of $330 million in customer refunds for 2018 and 2019 and the deferral of certain revenues and tax benefits to be addressed in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case. The Georgia PSC also approved an increase to Georgia Power's retail equity ratio to address some of the negative cash flow and credit metric impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Retail Regulatory Matters – Rate Plans" herein for additional information on the Georgia Power Tax Reform Settlement Agreement.

Georgia Power continues to focus on several key performance indicators, including, but not limited to, customer satisfaction, plant availability, system reliability, the execution of major construction projects, and net income. Georgia Power's financial success is directly tied to customer satisfaction. Key elements of ensuring customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high reliability, and competitive prices. Management uses customer satisfaction surveys to evaluate Georgia Power's results and generally targets the top quartile of these surveys in measuring performance.

See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for information on Georgia Power's financial performance.

Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 Status

In 2009, the Georgia PSC certified construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (with electric generating capacity of approximately

1,100

MWs each). Georgia Power holds a 45.7% ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. In March 2017, the EPC Contractor filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In December 2017, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's recommendation to continue construction. The current expected in-service dates remain November 2021 for Unit 3 and November 2022 for Unit 4.

In the second quarter 2018, Georgia Power revised its base capital cost forecast and estimated contingency to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to

$8.0 billion

and

$0.4 billion

, respectively, for a total project capital cost forecast of $8.4 billion (net of $1.7 billion received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related Customer Refunds), with respect to Georgia Power's ownership interest. Although Georgia Power believes these incremental costs are reasonable and necessary to complete the project and the Georgia PSC's order in the seventeenth VCM proceeding specifically states that the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is not subject to a cost cap, Georgia Power did not seek rate recovery for the

$0.7 billion

increase in costs included in the current base capital cost forecast (or any related financing costs) in the nineteenth VCM report that was approved by the Georgia PSC on February 19, 2019. In connection with future VCM filings, Georgia Power may request the Georgia PSC to evaluate costs currently included in the construction contingency estimate for rate recovery as and when they are appropriately included in the base capital cost forecast. After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of costs included in the construction contingency estimate since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in these future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded a total pre-tax charge to income of

$1.1 billion

(

$0.8 billion

after tax) in the second quarter 2018.

As a result of the increase in the total project capital cost forecast and Georgia Power's decision not to seek rate recovery of the increase in the base capital costs, the holders of at least

90%

of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 were required to vote to continue construction. On September 26, 2018, the Vogtle Owners unanimously voted to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. In connection with the vote to continue construction, Georgia Power entered into (i) a binding term sheet (Vogtle Owner Term Sheet) with the other Vogtle Owners and certain of MEAG's wholly-owned subsidiaries, including MEAG Power SPVJ, LLC (MEAG SPVJ), to take certain actions which partially mitigate potential financial exposure for the other Vogtle Owners and (ii) a term sheet (MEAG Term Sheet) with MEAG and MEAG SPVJ to provide funding with respect to MEAG

II-93

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual Report

SPVJ's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 under certain circumstances. On January 14, 2019, Georgia Power, MEAG, and MEAG SPVJ entered into an agreement to implement the provisions of the MEAG Term Sheet. On February 18, 2019, Georgia Power, the other Vogtle Owners, and certain of MEAG's wholly-owned subsidiaries entered into certain amendments to their joint ownership agreements to implement the provisions of the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction – Regulatory Matters" for additional information on the NCCR tariff.

See "Energy Sales" below for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to sales growth (decline) and weather.

Electric rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these fuel cost recovery provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses and do not affect net income. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Retail Regulatory Matters – Fuel Cost Recovery" herein for additional information.

Wholesale revenues from power sales to non-affiliated utilities were as follows:

Wholesale capacity revenues from PPAs are recognized either on a levelized basis over the appropriate contract period or the amounts billable under the contract terms and provide for recovery of fixed costs and a return on investment. Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Georgia Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant

Weather-adjusted residential KWH sales and weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales increased by 2.6% and 1.6%, respectively, largely due to customer growth. Weather-adjusted industrial KWH sales were essentially flat primarily due to increased demand in the primary and fabricated metal sectors, offset by decreased demand in the textiles and stone, clay, and glass sectors. Additionally, customer usage for all customer classes increased due to the negative impacts of Hurricane Irma in 2017.

primarily due to milder weather in 2017. Weather-adjusted residential KWH sales decreased by 0.2% primarily due to a decline in average customer usage resulting from an increase in multi-family housing and energy saving initiatives, partially offset by customer growth. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales decreased by 0.9% primarily due to a decline in average customer usage resulting from an increase in electronic commerce transactions and energy saving initiatives, partially offset by customer growth. Weather-adjusted industrial KWH sales were essentially flat primarily due to decreased demand in the chemicals and paper sectors, offset by increased demand in the textile, non-manufacturing, and rubber sectors. Additionally, Hurricane Irma negatively impacted customer usage for all customer classes in 2017.

See "Operating Revenues" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale sales to non-affiliates and affiliated companies.

Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses

Fuel costs constitute one of the largest expenses for Georgia Power. The mix of fuel sources for the generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the availability of generating units. Additionally, Georgia Power purchases a portion of its electricity needs from the wholesale market.

Details of Georgia Power's generation and purchased power were as follows:

Effects of Inflation

Georgia Power is subject to rate regulation that is generally based on the recovery of historical and projected costs. The effects of inflation can create an economic loss since the recovery of costs could be in dollars that have less purchasing power. Any adverse effect of inflation on Georgia Power's results of operations has not been substantial in recent years.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual Report

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL

General

Georgia Power operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electric service to retail customers within its traditional service territory located in the State of Georgia and to wholesale customers in the Southeast. Prices for electricity provided by Georgia Power to retail customers are set by the Georgia PSC under cost-based regulatory principles. Retail rates and earnings are reviewed and may be adjusted periodically within certain limitations. Prices for wholesale electricity sales, interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power are regulated by the FERC. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES – "Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Utility Regulation" herein and Note


to the financial statements under "Georgia Power" for additional information about regulatory matters.

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of future earnings potential. The level of Georgia Power's future earnings depends on numerous factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of Georgia Power's business of providing electric service. These factors include Georgia Power's ability to maintain a constructive regulatory environment that continues to allow for the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs during a time of increasing costs, continued customer growth, and the weak pace of growth in electricity use per customer, especially in residential and commercial markets. Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 construction and rate recovery are also major factors. Earnings will also depend upon maintaining and growing sales, considering, among other things, the adoption and/or penetration rates of increasingly energy-efficient technologies, increasing volumes of electronic commerce transactions, and more multi-family home construction, all of which could contribute to a net reduction in customer usage. Earnings are subject to a variety of other factors. These factors include weather, competition, new energy contracts with other utilities, energy conservation practiced by customers, the use of alternative energy sources by customers, the price of electricity, the price elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic growth or decline in Georgia Power's service territory. Demand for electricity is primarily driven by the pace of economic growth that may be affected by changes in regional and global economic conditions, which may impact future earnings.

Environmental Matters

Georgia Power's

operations are regulated by state and federal environmental agencies through a variety of laws and regulations governing air, water, land, and protection of other natural resources.

Georgia Power

maintains comprehensive environmental compliance and GHG strategies to assess upcoming requirements and compliance costs associated with these environmental laws and regulations. The costs, including capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, and costs reflected in ARO liabilities, required to comply with environmental laws and regulations and to achieve stated goals may impact future electric generating unit retirement and replacement decisions, results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition. Related costs may result from the installation of additional environmental controls, closure and monitoring of CCR facilities, unit retirements, or changing fuel sources for certain existing units, as well as related upgrades to

Georgia Power's

transmission and distribution

systems. A major portion of these costs is expected to be recovered through

retail rates.

The ultimate impact of environmental laws and regulations and the GHG goals discussed herein will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements, the availability and cost of any deployed technology, fuel prices, and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges.

New or revised environmental laws and regulations could affect many areas of

Georgia Power's

operations. The impact of any such changes cannot be determined at this time. Environmental compliance costs could affect earnings if such costs cannot continue to be recovered in rates on a timely basis

. Georgia Power's Environmental Compliance Cost Recovery (ECCR) tariff allows for the recovery of capital and operations and maintenance costs related to environmental controls mandated by state and federal regulations

. Further, increased costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity

, which could negatively affect results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition.

Additionally, many commercial and industrial customers may also be affected by existing and future environmental requirements, which for some may have the potential to ultimately affect their demand for electricity

.

Through


, Georgia Power has invested approximately $6.0 billion in environmental capital retrofit projects to comply with environmental requirements, with annual totals of approximately $0.5 billion, $0.3 billion, and $0.2 billion for


,


, and


, respectively. Although the timing, requirements, and estimated costs could change as environmental laws and regulations are adopted or modified, as compliance plans are revised or updated, and as legal challenges to rules are initiated or completed, Georgia Power's current compliance strategy estimates capital expenditures of

$0.7 billion

from

emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. See "Global Climate Issues" herein for additional information. Georgia Power also anticipates substantial expenditures associated with ash pond closure and ground water monitoring under the CCR Rule, which

II-100


Index to Financial Statements

Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual Report

are reflected in Georgia Power's ARO liabilities. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations" herein and Note


to the financial statements for additional information.

Environmental Laws and Regulations

Air Quality

The EPA has set National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for six air pollutants (carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, particulate matter, and SO


) to protect and improve the nation's air quality, which it reviews and revises periodically. Following a NAAQS revision, states are required to develop an EPA-approved plan to protect air quality. These state plans can require additional emission controls, improvements in control efficiency, or fuel changes which can result in increased compliance and operational costs. NAAQS requirements can also adversely affect the siting of new electric generating facilities.

All areas within

Georgia Power's

service territory have been designated as attainment for all NAAQS

except for a seven-county area within metropolitan Atlanta that is not in attainment with the 2015 ozone NAAQS and the area surrounding Plant Hammond

, which will not be designated attainment or nonattainment for the 2010 SO


standard until December 2020

. If areas

are designated as nonattainment in the future, increased compliance costs could result.

See "Retail Regulatory Matters – Integrated Resource Plan" herein for information regarding Georgia Power's request to decertify and retire Plant Hammond.

In 2011, the EPA finalized the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) to address impacts of SO


and NO

X

emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating plants. CSAPR establishes emissions trading programs and budgets for certain states and allocates emissions allowances for sources in those states.

In 2016, the EPA published a final rule establishing more stringent ozone season NO

X

emissions budgets in

Alabama

.

Georgia's ozone season NO

X

emissions budget remained unchanged.

Increases in either future fossil fuel-fired generation or the availability or cost of CSAPR allowances could have a negative financial impact on results of operations for

Georgia Power

.

The EPA finalized regional haze regulations in 2005 and 2017. These regulations require states, tribal governments, and various federal agencies to develop and implement plans to reduce pollutants that impair visibility and demonstrate reasonable progress toward the goal of restoring natural visibility conditions in certain areas, including national parks and wilderness areas.

States must submit a revised state implementation plan (SIP) to the EPA demonstrating continued reasonable progress towards achieving visibility improvement goals. The EPA has approved the regional progress SIP for the State of Georgia.

Water Quality

In 2014, the EPA finalized requirements under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) to regulate cooling water intake structures (CWIS) to minimize their effects on fish and other aquatic life at existing power plants (e.g. coal, natural gas, oil, and nuclear generating plants) and manufacturing facilities. The regulation requires plant-specific studies to determine applicable CWIS changes to protect organisms that either get caught on the intake screens (impingement) or are drawn into the cooling system (entrainment).

Georgia Power

is conducting these studies and currently anticipates applicable CWIS changes may include fish-friendly CWIS screens with fish return systems

and minor additions of monitoring equipment at certain plants.

However, the ultimate impact of this rule will depend on the outcome of these plant-specific studies, any additional protective measures required to be incorporated into each plant's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit based on site-specific factors, and the outcome of any legal challenges.

In 2015, the EPA finalized the steam electric effluent limitations guidelines (ELG) rule (2015 ELG Rule) that set national standards for wastewater discharges from new and existing steam electric generating units generating greater than 50 MWs. The 2015 ELG Rule prohibits effluent discharges of certain waste streams and imposes stringent limits on flue gas desulfurization (scrubber) wastewater discharges. The revised technology-based limits and the CCR Rule require extensive changes to existing ash and wastewater management systems or the installation and operation of new ash and wastewater management systems. Compliance with the 2015 ELG Rule is expected to require capital expenditures and increased operational costs primarily for

Georgia Power's

coal-fired electric generation. State environmental agencies will incorporate specific compliance applicability dates in the NPDES permitting process for each ELG waste stream no later than December 31, 2023. The EPA is scheduled to issue a new rulemaking by December 2019 that could revise the limitations and applicability dates of two of the waste streams regulated in the 2015 ELG Rule. The impact of any changes to the 2015 ELG Rule will depend on the content of the new rule and the outcome of any legal challenges.

In 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) jointly published a final rule that revised the regulatory definition of waters of the United States (WOTUS) for all CWA programs. The rule significantly expanded the scope of federal jurisdiction over waterbodies (such as rivers, streams, canals, and wastewater treatment ponds), which could impact new generation projects

and permitting and reporting requirements associated with the installation, expansion, and maintenance of transmission

and distribution projects.

The EPA and the Corps are expected to publish a final rule in 2019 to replace the 2015

II-101


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual Report

WOTUS definition. The impact of any changes to the 2015 WOTUS rule will depend on the content of this final rule and the outcome of any legal challenges.

Coal Combustion Residuals

In 2015, the EPA finalized non-hazardous solid waste regulations for the disposal of CCR, including coal ash and gypsum, in landfills and surface impoundments (ash ponds) at active generating power plants.

In addition to the EPA's CCR Rule, the State of Georgia has also finalized its own regulations regarding the handling of CCR.

The EPA's CCR Rule requires landfills and ash ponds to be evaluated against a set of performance criteria and potentially closed if minimum criteria are not met. Closure of existing landfills and ash ponds could require installation of equipment and infrastructure to manage CCR in accordance with the CCR Rule.

Based on cost estimates for closure and monitoring of landfills and ash ponds pursuant to the CCR Rule,

Georgia Power recorded an update to the AROs for each CCR unit in 2015. As further analysis is performed and closure details are developed, Georgia Power has continued

to periodically update these cost estimates, as discussed further below.

The EPA published certain amendments to the CCR Rule, which became effective August 29, 2018. These amendments extend the date from April 2019 to October 31, 2020 to cease sending CCR and other waste streams to ash ponds that demonstrate compliance with all except two of the specified performance criteria.

However, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources has not incorporated these amendments into its state CCR rule.

On August 21, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a decision suggesting the EPA should regulate previously-excluded inactive ash ponds located at retired generation facilities and questioning both the ability of unlined ash ponds to continue operating no matter the performance criteria results and the classification of clay-lined landfills and ash ponds.

These developments could impact the expected timing of

Georgia Power's

landfill and ash pond closure activities, but the extent of any impact will depend on the outcome of ongoing litigation, anticipated EPA rulemaking action to establish further guidance, and the outcome of any legal challenges.

In December 2018, Georgia Power recorded an increase of approximately

$3.1 billion

to its AROs related to the CCR Rule and the related state rule. During the second half of 2018, Georgia Power completed a strategic assessment related to its plans to close the ash ponds at all of its generating plants in compliance with the CCR Rule and the related state rule. This assessment included engineering and constructability studies related to design assumptions for ash pond closures and advanced engineering methods. The results indicated that additional closure costs will be required to close these ash ponds, primarily due to changes in closure strategies, the estimated amount of ash to be excavated, and additional water management requirements necessary to support closure strategies. These factors also impact the estimated timing of future cash outlays.

Georgia Power expects to periodically update its ARO cost estimates.

Absent continued recovery of ARO costs through regulated rates, Georgia Power's results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition could be materially impacted. See "Retail Regulatory Matters – Integrated Resource Plan" and FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations" herein and Note


to the financial statements for additional information.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Nuclear Decommissioning

In December 2018, Georgia Power completed updated decommissioning cost site studies for Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2. The estimated cost of decommissioning based on the studies resulted in an increase in Georgia Power's ARO liability of approximately

$130 million

. Georgia Power currently collects $4 million and $2 million annually in rates, which is used to fund external nuclear decommissioning trusts for Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, respectively. Georgia Power expects the Georgia PSC to review and adjust, if necessary, these amounts in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case. See Note


to the financial statements for additional information.

Environmental Remediation

Georgia Power must comply with environmental laws and regulations governing the handling and disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations, Georgia Power may also incur substantial costs to clean up affected sites. Georgia Power conducts studies to determine the extent of any required cleanup and has recognized the estimated costs to clean up known impacted sites in its financial statements. Amounts for cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs were not material for any year presented. Georgia Power has received authority from the Georgia PSC to recover approved environmental compliance costs through regulatory mechanisms. Georgia Power may be liable for some or all required cleanup costs for additional sites that may require environmental remediation. See Note


to the financial statements under "Environmental Remediation" for additional information.

II-102


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual Report

Global Climate Issues

On August 31, 2018, the EPA published a proposed rule known as the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule, which is intended to replace a regulation enacted in 2015 known as the Clean Power Plan (CPP), that would limit CO


emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. The CPP has been stayed by the U.S. Supreme Court since 2016. The ACE Rule would require states to develop GHG unit-specific emission rate standards based on heat-rate efficiency improvements for existing fossil fuel-fired steam units. As proposed, combustion turbines, including natural gas combined cycles, are not affected sources. As of January 1, 2019,

Georgia Power has ownership interests in 20

fossil fuel-fired steam units to which the proposed ACE Rule is applicable. The ultimate impact of this rule to

Georgia Power

is currently unknown and will depend on changes between the proposal and the final rule, subsequent state plan developments and requirements, and any associated legal challenges.

On December 20, 2018, the EPA published a proposed review of the Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from New, Modified, and Reconstructed Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units final rule (2015 NSPS rule). The EPA's final 2015 NSPS rule set standards of performance for new, modified, and reconstructed electric utility generating units which included stationary combustion turbines and fossil-fired steam boilers. This proposal reduces the stringency of the 2015 NSPS rule by not basing the new and reconstructed fossil-fired steam boiler and IGCC standards on partial carbon capture and sequestration. The impact of any changes to this rule will depend on the content of the final rule and the outcome of any legal challenges.

The EPA's GHG reporting rule requires annual reporting of GHG emissions expressed in terms of metric tons of CO


equivalent emissions for a company's operational control of facilities. Based on ownership or financial control of facilities, Georgia Power's


GHG emissions were approximately 30 million metric tons of CO


equivalent. The preliminary estimate of Georgia Power's


GHG emissions on the same basis is approximately 30 million metric tons of CO


equivalent.

Through 2017, the Southern Company system has achieved an estimated GHG emission reduction of 36% since 2007.

In April 2018, Southern Company established an intermediate goal of a 50% reduction in carbon emissions from 2007 levels by 2030 and a long-term goal of low- to no-carbon operations by 2050. To achieve these goals, the Southern Company system expects to continue growing its renewable energy portfolio, optimize technology advancements to modernize its transmission and distribution systems, increase the use of natural gas for generation,

complete ongoing construction projects, including Georgia Power's interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4,

invest in energy efficiency, and continue research and development efforts focused on technologies to lower GHG emissions. The Southern Company system's ability to achieve these goals also will be dependent on many external factors, including supportive national energy policies, low natural gas prices, and the development, deployment, and advancement of relevant energy technologies.

FERC Matters

On May 10, 2018, AMEA and Cooperative Energy filed with the FERC a complaint against SCS and the traditional electric operating companies

(including Georgia Power)

claiming that the current

11.25%

base ROE used in calculating the annual transmission revenue requirements of the traditional electric operating companies'

(including Georgia Power's)

open access transmission tariff is unjust and unreasonable as measured by the applicable FERC standards. The complaint requested that the base ROE be set no higher than

8.65%

and that the FERC order refunds for the difference in revenue requirements that results from applying a just and reasonable ROE established in this proceeding upon determining the current ROE is unjust and unreasonable.

On June 18, 2018, SCS and the traditional electric operating companies

(including Georgia Power)

filed their response challenging the adequacy of the showing presented by the complainants and offering support for the current ROE. On September 6, 2018, the FERC issued an order establishing a refund effective date of May 10, 2018 in the event a refund is due and initiating an investigation and settlement procedures regarding the current base ROE.

Through December 31, 2018, the estimated maximum potential refund is not expected to be material to

Georgia Power's

results of operations or cash flows.

The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Retail Regulatory Matters

Georgia Power's

revenues from regulated retail operations are collected through various rate mechanisms subject to the oversight of the Georgia PSC.

Georgia Power

currently recovers its costs from the regulated retail business through the 2013 ARP, which includes traditional base tariff rates, Demand-Side Management (DSM) tariffs,

ECCR

tariffs, and Municipal Franchise Fee (MFF) tariffs. Georgia Power is scheduled to file a base rate case by July 1, 2019, which may continue or modify these tariffs. In addition, financing costs on certified construction costs of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are being collected through the NCCR tariff and fuel costs are collected through a separate fuel cost recovery tariff.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual Report

On November 16, 2018, Georgia Power completed the sale of its natural gas lateral pipeline serving Plant McDonough Units 4 through 6 to SNG at net book value, as approved by the Georgia PSC on January 16, 2018. Georgia Power expects payment of $142 million from SNG to occur in the first quarter 2020. During the interim period, Georgia Power will receive a discounted shipping rate to reflect the delayed consideration. Southern Company Gas, an affiliate of Georgia Power, owns a 50% equity interest in SNG.

Rate Plans

Pursuant to the terms and conditions of a settlement agreement related to Southern Company's acquisition of Southern Company Gas approved by the Georgia PSC in 2016, the 2013 ARP will continue in effect until December 31, 2019, and Georgia Power will be required to file its next base rate case by July 1, 2019. Furthermore, through December 31, 2019, Georgia Power will retain its merger savings, net of transition costs, as defined in the settlement agreement; through December 31, 2022, such net merger savings will be shared on a


/


basis with customers; thereafter, all merger savings will be retained by customers.

There were no changes to Georgia Power's traditional base tariff rates, ECCR tariff, DSM tariffs, or MFF tariff in 2017 or 2018.

Under the 2013 ARP, Georgia Power's retail ROE is set at

10.95%

and earnings are evaluated against a retail ROE range of

10.00%

to

12.00%

. Two-thirds of any earnings above

12.00%

will be directly refunded to customers, with the remaining one-third retained by Georgia Power. There will be no recovery of any earnings shortfall below

10.00%

on an actual basis.

In 2016, Georgia Power's retail ROE exceeded

12.00%

, and Georgia Power refunded to retail customers in 2018 approximately

$40 million

as approved by the Georgia PSC. On February 5, 2019, the Georgia PSC approved a settlement between Georgia Power and the staff of the Georgia PSC under which Georgia Power's retail ROE for 2017 was stipulated to exceed

12.00%

and Georgia Power will reduce certain regulatory assets by approximately

$4 million

in lieu of providing refunds to retail customers. In 2018, Georgia Power's retail ROE exceeded

12.00%

, and Georgia Power accrued approximately

$100 million

to refund to retail customers, subject to review and approval by the Georgia PSC.

On April 3, 2018, the Georgia PSC approved the Georgia Power Tax Reform Settlement Agreement.

Pursuant to the Georgia Power Tax Reform Settlement Agreement, to reflect the federal income tax rate reduction impact of the Tax Reform Legislation, Georgia Power will refund to customers a total of

$330 million

through bill credits. Georgia Power issued bill credits of approximately

$130 million

in 2018 and will issue bill credits of approximately

$95 million

in June 2019 and

$105 million

in February 2020. In addition, Georgia Power is deferring as a regulatory liability (i) the revenue equivalent of the tax expense reduction resulting from legislation lowering the Georgia state income tax rate from

6.00%

to

5.75%

in 2019 and (ii) the entire benefit of federal and state excess accumulated deferred income taxes, which is expected to total approximately

$700 million

at December 31, 2019. At

December 31, 2018

, the related regulatory liability balance totaled

$610 million

. The amortization of these regulatory liabilities is expected to be addressed in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case. If there is not a base rate case in 2019, customers will receive

$185 million

in annual bill credits beginning in 2020, with any additional federal and state income tax savings deferred as a regulatory liability, until Georgia Power's next base rate case.

To address some of the negative cash flow and credit quality impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation, the Georgia PSC also approved an increase in Georgia Power's retail equity ratio to the lower of (i) Georgia Power's actual common equity weight in its capital structure or (ii)

55%

, until the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case. At

December 31, 2018

, Georgia Power's actual retail common equity ratio (on a


-month average basis) was approximately

55%

. Benefits from reduced federal income tax rates in excess of the amounts refunded to customers will be retained by Georgia Power to cover the carrying costs of the incremental equity in 2018 and 2019.

Integrated Resource Plan

See "Environmental Matters" herein for additional information regarding proposed and final EPA rules and regulations, including revisions to ELG for steam electric power plants and additional regulations of CCR and CO


.

In 2016, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's triennial Integrated Resource Plan (2016 IRP) including the reclassification of the remaining net book value of Plant Mitchell Unit 3 and costs associated with materials and supplies remaining at the unit retirement date to a regulatory asset. Recovery of the unit's net book value will continue through December 31, 2019, as provided in the 2013 ARP. The timing of the recovery of the remaining balance of the unit's net book value as of December 31, 2019 and costs associated with materials and supplies remaining at the unit retirement date was deferred for consideration in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case.

In the 2016 IRP, the Georgia PSC also approved recovery of costs up to

$99 million

through June 30, 2019 to preserve nuclear generation as an option at a future generation site in Stewart County, Georgia. In March 2017, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's decision to suspend work at the site due to changing economics, including lower load forecasts and fuel costs. The timing

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual Report

of recovery for costs incurred of approximately

$50 million

is expected to be determined by the Georgia PSC in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case.

On January 31, 2019, Georgia Power filed its triennial IRP (2019 IRP). The filing includes a request to decertify and retire Plant Hammond Units 1 through 4 (


MWs) and Plant McIntosh Unit 1 (

142.5

MWs) upon approval of the 2019 IRP

.

In the 2019 IRP, Georgia Power requested approval to reclassify the remaining net book value of Plant Hammond Units 1 through 4 (approximately

$520 million

at December 31, 2018) upon retirement to a regulatory asset to be amortized ratably over a period equal to the applicable unit's remaining useful life through 2035. For Plant McIntosh Unit 1, Georgia Power requested approval to reclassify the remaining net book value (approximately

$40 million

at December 31, 2018) upon retirement to a regulatory asset to be amortized over a

three

-year period to be determined in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case. Georgia Power also requested approval to reclassify any unusable material and supplies inventory balances remaining at the applicable unit's retirement date to a regulatory asset for recovery over a period to be determined in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case.

The 2019 IRP also includes a request to certify approximately


MWs of capacity at Plant Scherer Unit 3 for the retail jurisdiction beginning January 1, 2020, following the expiration of a wholesale PPA.

The 2019 IRP also includes details regarding ARO costs associated with ash pond and landfill closures and post-closure care. Georgia Power requested the timing and rate of recovery of these costs be determined by the Georgia PSC in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case.

See "Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and Regulations – Coal Combustion Residuals" and FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations" herein and Note


to the financial statements for additional information regarding Georgia Power's AROs.

Georgia Power also requested approval to issue

two

capacity-based requests for proposals (RFP). If approved, the first capacity-based RFP will seek resources that can provide capacity beginning in 2022 or 2023 and the second capacity-based RFP will seek resources that can provide capacity beginning in 2026, 2027, or 2028. Additionally, the 2019 IRP includes a request to procure an additional

1,000

MWs of renewable resources through a competitive bidding process. Georgia Power also proposed to invest in a portfolio of up to


MWs of battery energy storage technologies.

A decision from the Georgia PSC on the 2019 IRP is expected in mid-2019.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Fuel Cost Recovery

Georgia Power has established fuel cost recovery rates approved by the Georgia PSC.

On August 16, 2018, the Georgia PSC approved the deferral of Georgia Power's next fuel case to no later than March 16, 2020, with new rates, if any, to be effective June 1, 2020. Georgia Power continues to be allowed to adjust its fuel cost recovery rates under an interim fuel rider prior to the next fuel case if the under or over recovered fuel balance exceeds

$200 million

. At December 31, 2018, Georgia Power's under recovered fuel balance was

$115 million

.

Georgia Power's fuel cost recovery mechanism includes costs associated with a natural gas hedging program, as revised and approved by the Georgia PSC, allowing the use of an array of derivative instruments within a


-month time horizon.

Fuel cost recovery revenues as recorded on the financial statements are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable fuel costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor will not have a significant effect on

Georgia Power's revenues or net income, but will affect operating cash flows.

Storm Damage Recovery

Georgia Power is accruing

$30 million

annually through December 31, 2019, as provided in the 2013 ARP, for incremental operations and maintenance costs of damage from major storms to its transmission and distribution facilities. At

December 31, 2018

, the total balance in the regulatory asset related to storm damage was

$416 million

.

During October 2018, Hurricane Michael caused significant damage to Georgia Power's transmission and distribution facilities. The incremental restoration costs related to this hurricane deferred in the regulatory asset for storm damage totaled approximately

$115 million

. Hurricanes Irma and Matthew also caused significant damage to Georgia Power's transmission and distribution facilities during September 2017 and October 2016, respectively. The incremental restoration costs related to Hurricanes Irma and Matthew deferred in the regulatory asset for storm damage totaled approximately

$250 million

.

The rate of storm damage cost recovery is expected to be adjusted as part of the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case and further adjusted in future regulatory proceedings as necessary.

The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

See Note

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual Report

Nuclear Construction

In 2009, the Georgia PSC certified construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Georgia Power holds a 45.7% ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. In 2012, the NRC issued the related combined construction and operating licenses, which allowed full construction of the

two

AP1000 nuclear units (with electric generating capacity of approximately

1,100

MWs each) and related facilities to begin. Until March 2017, construction on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 continued under the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement, which was a substantially fixed price agreement. In March 2017, the EPC Contractor filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

In connection with the EPC Contractor's bankruptcy filing, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the Vogtle Owners, entered into the Interim Assessment Agreement with the EPC Contractor to allow construction to continue. The Interim Assessment Agreement expired in July 2017 when Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the other Vogtle Owners, and the EPC Contractor entered into the Vogtle Services Agreement. Under the Vogtle Services Agreement, Westinghouse provides facility design and engineering services, procurement and technical support, and staff augmentation on a time and materials cost basis. The Vogtle Services Agreement provides that it will continue until the start-up and testing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are complete and electricity is generated and sold from both units. The Vogtle Services Agreement is terminable by the Vogtle Owners upon


days' written notice.

In October 2017, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the other Vogtle Owners, executed the Bechtel Agreement, a cost reimbursable plus fee arrangement, whereby Bechtel is reimbursed for actual costs plus a base fee and an at-risk fee, which is subject to adjustment based on Bechtel's performance against cost and schedule targets. Each Vogtle Owner is severally (not jointly) liable for its proportionate share, based on its ownership interest, of all amounts owed to Bechtel under the Bechtel Agreement. The Vogtle Owners may terminate the Bechtel Agreement at any time for their convenience, provided that the Vogtle Owners will be required to pay amounts related to work performed prior to the termination (including the applicable portion of the base fee), certain termination-related costs, and, at certain stages of the work, the applicable portion of the at-risk fee. Bechtel may terminate the Bechtel Agreement under certain circumstances, including certain Vogtle Owner suspensions of work, certain breaches of the Bechtel Agreement by the Vogtle Owners, Vogtle Owner insolvency, and certain other events. Pursuant to the Loan Guarantee Agreement between Georgia Power and the DOE, Georgia Power is required to obtain the DOE's approval of the Bechtel Agreement prior to obtaining any further advances under the Loan Guarantee Agreement.

Cost and Schedule

Georgia Power's approximate proportionate share of the remaining estimated capital cost to complete Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 by the expected in-service dates of November 2021 and November 2022, respectively, is as follows:

(a)

Excludes financing costs expected to be capitalized through AFUDC of approximately

$315 million

.

(b)

Net of

$1.7 billion

received from Toshiba under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately

$188 million

in related Customer Refunds.

Georgia Power estimates that its financing costs for construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 will total approximately

$3.1 billion

, of which

$1.9 billion

had been incurred through

December 31, 2018

.

As construction continues, challenges with management of contractors, subcontractors, and vendors; labor productivity, availability, and/or cost escalation; procurement, fabrication, delivery, assembly, and/or installation and testing, including any required engineering changes, of plant systems, structures, and components (some of which are based on new technology that only recently began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale); or other issues could arise and change the projected schedule and estimated cost. Monthly construction production targets required to maintain the current project schedule will continue to increase significantly throughout 2019. To meet these increasing monthly targets, existing craft construction productivity must improve and additional craft laborers must be retained and deployed.

Georgia Power and Southern Nuclear believe it is a leading practice in connection with a construction project of this size and complexity to periodically validate recent construction progress in comparison to the projected schedule and to verify and update quantities of commodities remaining to install, labor productivity, and forecasted staffing needs. This verification process, led by

II-106


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual Report

Southern Nuclear, was underway as of December 31, 2018 and is expected to be completed during the second quarter 2019. Georgia Power currently does not anticipate any material changes to the total estimated project capital cost forecast for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 or the expected in-service dates of November 2021 and November 2022, respectively, resulting from this verification process. However, the ultimate impact on cost and schedule, if any, will not be known until the verification process is completed. Georgia Power is required to report the results and any project impacts to the Georgia PSC by May 15, 2019.

There have been technical and procedural challenges to the construction and licensing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 at the federal and state level and additional challenges may arise. Processes are in place that are designed to assure compliance with the requirements specified in the Westinghouse Design Control Document and the combined construction and operating licenses, including inspections by Southern Nuclear and the NRC that occur throughout construction. As a result of such compliance processes, certain license amendment requests have been filed and approved or are pending before the NRC. Various design and other licensing-based compliance matters, including the timely resolution of ITAAC and the related approvals by the NRC, may arise, which may result in additional license amendments or require other resolution. If any license amendment requests or other licensing-based compliance issues are not resolved in a timely manner, there may be delays in the project schedule that could result in increased costs.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. However, any extension of the project schedule is currently estimated to result in additional base capital costs of approximately

$50 million

per month, based on Georgia Power's ownership interests, and AFUDC of approximately

$12 million

per month. While Georgia Power is not precluded from seeking recovery of any future capital cost forecast increase, management will ultimately determine whether or not to seek recovery. Any further changes to the capital cost forecast that are not expected to be recoverable through regulated rates will be required to be charged to income and such charges could be material.

Joint Owner Contracts

In November 2017, the Vogtle Owners entered into an amendment to their joint ownership agreements for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to provide for, among other conditions, additional Vogtle Owner approval requirements. Effective August 31, 2018, the Vogtle Owners further amended the joint ownership agreements to clarify and provide procedures for certain provisions of the joint ownership agreements related to adverse events that require the vote of the holders of at least

90%

of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to continue construction (as amended, and together with the November 2017 amendment, the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements). The Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements also confirm that the Vogtle Owners' sole recourse against Georgia Power or Southern Nuclear for any action or inaction in connection with their performance as agent for the Vogtle Owners is limited to removal of Georgia Power and/or Southern Nuclear as agent, except in cases of willful misconduct.

As a result of the increase in the total project capital cost forecast and Georgia Power's decision not to seek rate recovery of the increase in the base capital costs as described below, the holders of at least

90%

of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 were required to vote to continue construction. On September 26, 2018, the Vogtle Owners unanimously voted to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.

Amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements

In connection with the vote to continue construction, Georgia Power entered into (i) the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet with the other Vogtle Owners and MEAG's wholly-owned subsidiaries MEAG SPVJ, MEAG Power SPVM, LLC (MEAG SPVM), and MEAG Power SPVP, LLC (MEAG SPVP) to take certain actions which partially mitigate potential financial exposure for the other Vogtle Owners, including additional amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements and the purchase of PTCs from the other Vogtle Owners, and (ii) the MEAG Term Sheet with MEAG and MEAG SPVJ to provide funding with respect to MEAG SPVJ's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (Project J) under certain circumstances. On January 14, 2019, Georgia Power, MEAG, and MEAG SPVJ entered into an agreement to implement the provisions of the MEAG Term Sheet (MEAG Funding Agreement). On February 18, 2019, Georgia Power, the other Vogtle Owners, and MEAG's wholly-owned subsidiaries MEAG SPVJ, MEAG SPVM, and MEAG SPVP entered into certain amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements to implement the provisions of the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet (Global Amendments).

Pursuant to the Global Amendments, and consistent with the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet, the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements were modified as follows: (i) each Vogtle Owner must pay its proportionate share of qualifying construction costs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 based on its ownership percentage up to the estimated cost at completion (EAC) for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 which formed the basis of Georgia Power's forecast of

$8.4 billion

in the nineteenth VCM plus

$800 million

; (ii) Georgia Power will be responsible for

55.7%

of actual qualifying construction costs between

$800 million

and

$1.6 billion

over the EAC in the nineteenth VCM (resulting in

$80 million

of potential additional costs to Georgia Power), with the remaining Vogtle Owners responsible for

44.3%

of such costs pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests; and (iii) Georgia Power will be responsible for

65.7%

of qualifying construction costs between

$1.6 billion

and

$2.1 billion

over the EAC in the nineteenth

II-107

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual Report

VCM (resulting in a further

$100 million

of potential additional costs to Georgia Power), with the remaining Vogtle Owners responsible for

34.3%

of such costs pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests.

If the EAC is revised and exceeds the EAC in the nineteenth VCM by more than

$2.1 billion

, each of the other Vogtle Owners will have a one-time option at the time the project budget forecast is so revised to tender a portion of its ownership interest to Georgia Power in exchange for Georgia Power's agreement to pay

100%

of such Vogtle Owner's remaining share of total construction costs in excess of the EAC in the nineteenth VCM plus

$2.1 billion

. In this event, Georgia Power will have the option of cancelling the project in lieu of purchasing a portion of the ownership interest of any other Vogtle Owner. If Georgia Power accepts the offer to purchase a portion of another Vogtle Owner's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, the ownership interest(s) to be conveyed from the tendering Vogtle Owner(s) to Georgia Power will be calculated based on the proportion of the cumulative amount of construction costs paid by each such tendering Vogtle Owner(s) and by Georgia Power as of the COD of Plant Vogtle Unit 4. For purposes of this calculation, payments made by Georgia Power on behalf of another Vogtle Owner in accordance with the second and third items described in the paragraph above will be treated as payments made by the applicable Vogtle Owner.

In the event the actual costs of construction at completion of a Unit are less than the EAC reflected in the nineteenth VCM report and such Unit is placed in service in accordance with the schedule projected in the nineteenth VCM report (i.e., Plant Vogtle Unit 3 is placed in service by November 2021 or Plant Vogtle Unit 4 is placed in service by November 2022), Georgia Power will be entitled to

60.7%

of the cost savings with respect to the relevant Unit and the remaining Vogtle Owners will be entitled to

39.3%

of such savings on a pro rata basis in accordance with their respective ownership interests.

For purposes of the foregoing provisions, qualifying construction costs will not include costs (i) resulting from force majeure events, including governmental actions or inactions (or significant delays associated with issuance of such actions) that affect the licensing, completion, start-up, operations, or financing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, administrative proceedings or litigation regarding ITAAC or other regulatory challenges to commencement of operation of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, and changes in laws or regulations governing Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, (ii) legal fees and legal expenses incurred due to litigation with contractors or subcontractors that are not subsidiaries or affiliates of Southern Company, and (iii) additional costs caused by requests from the Vogtle Owners other than Georgia Power, except for the exercise of a right to vote granted under the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements, that increase costs by

$100,000

or more.

Pursuant to the Global Amendments, and consistent with the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet, the provisions of the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements requiring that Vogtle Owners holding

90%

of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 vote to continue construction following certain adverse events (Project Adverse Events) were modified. Pursuant to the Global Amendments, the holders of at least

90%

of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 must vote to continue construction if certain Project Adverse Events occur, including: (i) the bankruptcy of Toshiba; (ii) the termination or rejection in bankruptcy of certain agreements, including the Vogtle Services Agreement, the Bechtel Agreement, or the agency agreement with Southern Nuclear; (iii) Georgia Power publicly announces its intention not to submit for rate recovery any portion of its investment in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 or the Georgia PSC determines that any of Georgia Power's costs relating to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 will not be recovered in retail rates, excluding any additional amounts paid by Georgia Power on behalf of the other Vogtle Owners pursuant to the Global Amendments described above and the first

6%

of costs during any

six

-month VCM reporting period that are disallowed by the Georgia PSC for recovery, or for which Georgia Power elects not to seek cost recovery, through retail rates; and (iv) an incremental extension of

one year

or more over the most recently approved schedule. Under the Global Amendments, Georgia Power may cancel the project at any time in its sole discretion.

In addition, pursuant to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements, the required approval of holders of ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is at least (i)

90%

for a change of the primary construction contractor and (ii)

67%

for material amendments to the Vogtle Services Agreement or agreements with Southern Nuclear or the primary construction contractor, including the Bechtel Agreement.

The Global Amendments provide that if the holders of at least

90%

of the ownership interests fail to vote in favor of continuing the project following any future Project Adverse Event, work on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 will continue for a period of


days if the holders of more than

50%

of the ownership interests vote in favor of continuing construction (Majority Voting Owners). In such a case, the Vogtle Owners (i) have agreed to negotiate in good faith towards the resumption of the project, (ii) if no agreement is reached during such


-day period, the project will be cancelled, and (iii) in the event of such a cancellation, the Majority Voting Owners will be obligated to reimburse any other Vogtle Owner for the incremental costs it incurred during such


-day negotiation period.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual Report

Purchase of PTCs During Commercial Operation

Pursuant to the Global Amendments, and consistent with the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet, Georgia Power has agreed to purchase additional PTCs from OPC, Dalton, MEAG SPVM, MEAG SPVP, and MEAG SPVJ (to the extent any MEAG SPVJ PTC rights remain after any purchases required under the MEAG Funding Agreement as described below) at varying purchase prices dependent upon the actual cost to complete construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 as compared to the EAC reflected in the nineteenth VCM report. The purchases are at the option of the applicable Vogtle Owner.

Potential Funding to MEAG Project J

Pursuant to the MEAG Funding Agreement, and consistent with the MEAG Term Sheet, if MEAG SPVJ is unable to make its payments due under the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements solely as a result of the occurrence of one of the following situations that materially impedes access to capital markets for MEAG for Project J: (i) the conduct of JEA or the City of Jacksonville, such as JEA's legal challenges of its obligations under a PPA with MEAG (PPA-J), or (ii) PPA-J is declared void by a court of competent jurisdiction or rejected by JEA under the applicable provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (each of (i) and (ii), a JEA Default), at MEAG's request, Georgia Power will purchase from MEAG SPVJ the rights to PTCs attributable to MEAG SPVJ's share of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (approximately


MWs) within


days of such request at varying prices dependent upon the stage of construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. The aggregate purchase price of the PTCs, together with any advances made as described in the next paragraph, shall not exceed

$300 million

.

At the option of MEAG, as an alternative or supplement to Georgia Power's purchase of PTCs as described above, Georgia Power has agreed to provide up to

$250 million

in funding to MEAG for Project J in the form of advances (either advances under the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements or the purchase of MEAG Project J bonds, at the discretion of Georgia Power), subject to any required approvals of the Georgia PSC and the DOE.

In the event MEAG SPVJ certifies to Georgia Power that it is unable to fund its obligations under the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements as a result of a JEA Default and Georgia Power becomes obligated to provide funding as described above, MEAG is required to (i) assign to Georgia Power its right to vote on any future Project Adverse Event and (ii) diligently pursue JEA for its breach of PPA-J. In addition, Georgia Power agreed that it will not sue MEAG for any amounts due from MEAG SPVJ under MEAG's guarantee of MEAG SPVJ's obligations so long as MEAG SPVJ complies with the terms of the MEAG Funding Agreement as to its payment obligations and the other non-payment provisions of the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements.

Under the terms of the MEAG Funding Agreement, Georgia Power may cancel the project in lieu of providing funding in the form of advances or PTC purchases.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Regulatory Matters

In 2009, the Georgia PSC voted to certify construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 with a certified capital cost of

$4.418 billion

. In addition, in 2009 the Georgia PSC approved inclusion of the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 related CWIP accounts in rate base, and the State of Georgia enacted the Georgia Nuclear Energy Financing Act, which allows Georgia Power to recover financing costs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Financing costs are recovered on all applicable certified costs through annual adjustments to the NCCR tariff up to the certified capital cost of

$4.418 billion

. At

December 31, 2018

, Georgia Power had recovered approximately

$1.9 billion

of financing costs. Financing costs related to capital costs above

$4.418 billion

will be recovered through AFUDC; however, Georgia Power will not record AFUDC related to any capital costs in excess of the total deemed reasonable by the Georgia PSC (currently

$7.3 billion

) and not requested for rate recovery. On December 18, 2018, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's request to increase the NCCR tariff by

$88 million

annually, effective January 1, 2019.

Georgia Power is required to file semi-annual VCM reports with the Georgia PSC by February 28 and August 31 of each year. In 2013, in connection with the eighth VCM report, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation between Georgia Power and the staff of the Georgia PSC to waive the requirement to amend the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 certificate in accordance with the 2009 certification order until the completion of Plant Vogtle Unit 3, or earlier if deemed appropriate by the Georgia PSC and Georgia Power.

In 2016, the Georgia PSC voted to approve a settlement agreement (Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement) resolving certain prudency matters in connection with the fifteenth VCM report. In December 2017, the Georgia PSC voted to approve (and issued its related order on January 11, 2018) Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report, which included a recommendation to continue construction with Southern Nuclear as project manager and Bechtel serving as the primary construction contractor, and modified the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement. The Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, as modified by the January 11, 2018 order, resolved the following regulatory matters related to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4: (i) none of the

$3.3 billion

of costs incurred

II-109


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual Report

through December 31, 2015 and reflected in the fourteenth VCM report should be disallowed from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (ii) the Contractor Settlement Agreement was reasonable and prudent and none of the amounts paid pursuant to the Contractor Settlement Agreement should be disallowed from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (iii) (a) capital costs incurred up to

$5.68 billion

would be presumed to be reasonable and prudent with the burden of proof on any party challenging such costs, (b) Georgia Power would have the burden to show that any capital costs above

$5.68 billion

were prudent, and (c) a revised capital cost forecast of

$7.3 billion

(after reflecting the impact of payments received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and related Customer Refunds) was found reasonable; (iv) construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 should be completed, with Southern Nuclear serving as project manager and Bechtel as primary contractor; (v) approved and deemed reasonable Georgia Power's revised schedule placing Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in service in November 2021 and November 2022, respectively; (vi) confirmed that the revised cost forecast does not represent a cost cap and that prudence decisions on cost recovery will be made at a later date, consistent with applicable Georgia law; (vii) reduced the ROE used to calculate the NCCR tariff (a) from

10.95%

(the ROE rate setting point authorized by the Georgia PSC in the 2013 ARP) to

10.00%

effective January 1, 2016, (b) from

10.00%

to

8.30%

, effective January 1, 2020, and (c) from

8.30%

to

5.30%

, effective January 1, 2021 (provided that the ROE in no case will be less than Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt); (viii) reduced the ROE used for AFUDC equity for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from

10.00%

to Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt, effective January 1, 2018; and (ix) agreed that upon Unit 3 reaching commercial operation, retail base rates would be adjusted to include carrying costs on those capital costs deemed prudent in the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement. The January 11, 2018 order also stated that if Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are not commercially operational by June 1, 2021 and June 1, 2022, respectively, the ROE used to calculate the NCCR tariff will be further reduced by 10 basis points each month (but not lower than Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt) until the respective Unit is commercially operational. The ROE reductions negatively impacted earnings by approximately

$100 million

,

$25 million

, and

$20 million

in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, and are estimated to have negative earnings impacts of approximately

$75 million

in 2019 and an aggregate of approximately

$615 million

from 2020 to 2022.

In its January 11, 2018 order, the Georgia PSC also stated if other conditions change and assumptions upon which Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report are based do not materialize, the Georgia PSC reserved the right to reconsider the decision to continue construction.

On February 12, 2018, Georgia Interfaith Power & Light, Inc. (GIPL) and Partnership for Southern Equity, Inc. (PSE) filed a petition appealing the Georgia PSC's January 11, 2018 order with the Fulton County Superior Court. On March 8, 2018, Georgia Watch filed a similar appeal to the Fulton County Superior Court for judicial review of the Georgia PSC's decision and denial of Georgia Watch's motion for reconsideration. On December 21, 2018, the Fulton County Superior Court granted Georgia Power's motion to dismiss the

two

appeals. On January 9, 2019, GIPL, PSE, and Georgia Watch filed an appeal of this decision with the Georgia Court of Appeals. Georgia Power believes the appeal has no merit; however, an adverse outcome in the appeal combined with subsequent adverse action by the Georgia PSC could have a material impact on Georgia Power's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

In preparation for its nineteenth VCM filing, Georgia Power requested Southern Nuclear to perform a full cost reforecast for the project. This reforecast, performed prior to the nineteenth VCM filing, resulted in a

$0.7 billion

increase to the base capital cost forecast reported in the second quarter 2018. This base cost increase primarily resulted from changed assumptions related to the finalization of contract scopes and management responsibilities for Bechtel and over


subcontractors, labor productivity rates, and craft labor incentives, as well as the related levels of project management, oversight, and support, including field supervision and engineering support.

Although Georgia Power believes these incremental costs are reasonable and necessary to complete the project and the Georgia PSC's order in the seventeenth VCM proceeding specifically states that the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is not subject to a cost cap, Georgia Power did not seek rate recovery for these cost increases included in the current base capital cost forecast (or any related financing costs) in the nineteenth VCM report. In connection with future VCM filings, Georgia Power may request the Georgia PSC to evaluate costs currently included in the construction contingency estimate for rate recovery as and when they are appropriately included in the base capital cost forecast. After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of costs included in the construction contingency estimate since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in these future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded a total pre-tax charge to income of

$1.1 billion

(

$0.8 billion

after tax) in the second quarter 2018, which includes the total increase in the base capital cost forecast and construction contingency estimate.

On August 31, 2018, Georgia Power filed its nineteenth VCM report with the Georgia PSC, which requested approval of

$578 million

of construction capital costs incurred from January 1, 2018 through June 30, 2018. On February 19, 2019, the Georgia PSC approved the nineteenth VCM, but deferred approval of

$51.6 million

of expenditures related to Georgia Power's portion of

Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual Report

an administrative claim filed in the Westinghouse bankruptcy proceedings. Through the nineteenth VCM, the Georgia PSC has approved total construction capital costs incurred through June 30, 2018 of

$5.4 billion

(before

$1.7 billion

of payments received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately

$188 million

in related Customer Refunds). In addition, the staff of the Georgia PSC requested, and Georgia Power agreed, to file its twentieth VCM report concurrently with the twenty-first VCM report by August 31, 2019.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

DOE Financing

At

December 31, 2018

, Georgia Power had borrowed

$2.6 billion

related to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 costs through the Loan Guarantee Agreement and a multi-advance credit facility among Georgia Power, the DOE, and the FFB, which provides for borrowings of up to

$3.46 billion

, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. In September 2017, the DOE issued a conditional commitment to Georgia Power for up to approximately

$1.67 billion

in additional guaranteed loans under the Loan Guarantee Agreement. In September 2018, the DOE extended the conditional commitment to

March 31, 2019

. Any further extension must be approved by the DOE. Final approval and issuance of these additional loan guarantees by the DOE cannot be assured and are subject to the negotiation of definitive agreements, completion of due diligence by the DOE, receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals, and satisfaction of other conditions. See Note


to the financial statements under "Long-term Debt – DOE Loan Guarantee Borrowings" for additional information, including applicable covenants, events of default, mandatory prepayment events (including any decision not to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4), and conditions to borrowing.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Income Tax Matters

Federal Tax Reform Legislation

In December 2017, the Tax Reform Legislation was signed into law and became effective on January 1, 2018. The Tax Reform Legislation, among other things, reduced the federal corporate income tax rate to 21%, retained normalization provisions for public utility property and existing renewable energy incentives, and repealed the corporate alternative minimum tax. In addition, under the Tax Reform Legislation, net operating losses generated after December 31, 2017 can no longer be carried back to previous tax years but can be carried forward indefinitely, with utilization limited to 80% of taxable income of the subsequent tax year. The projected reduction of Southern Company's consolidated income tax liability resulting from the tax rate reduction also delays the expected utilization of existing tax credit carryforwards at Georgia Power. See Note


to the financial statements for information on Southern Company's joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement.

Following the enactment of the Tax Reform Legislation, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 – "Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" (SAB 118), which provided for a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date to complete accounting under GAAP for the tax effects of the legislation. Due to the complex and comprehensive nature of the enacted tax law changes and their application under GAAP, Georgia Power considered all amounts recorded in the financial statements as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation "provisional" as discussed in SAB 118 and subject to revision prior to filing its 2017 tax return in the fourth quarter 2018. Georgia Power recognized tax benefits of $50 million and $8 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, for a total of $58 million as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation. In addition, in total, Georgia Power recorded a $147 million decrease in regulatory assets and a $3.0 billion increase in regulatory liabilities as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation and $2 million of stranded excess deferred tax balances in AOCI at December 31, 2017 were adjusted through retained earnings in 2018. As of December 31, 2018, Georgia Power considered the measurement of impacts from the Tax Reform Legislation on deferred income tax assets and liabilities, primarily due to the impact of the reduction of the corporate income tax rate, to be complete.

However, the IRS continues to issue regulations that provide further interpretation and guidance on the law and each state's adoption of the provisions contained in the Tax Reform Legislation remains uncertain. The ultimate impact of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note


to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Rate Plans" for additional information regarding the Georgia Power Tax Reform Settlement Agreement. The regulatory treatment of certain impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation remains subject to the discretion of the Georgia PSC in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case and the FERC. Also, see FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Credit Rating Risk" herein and Note


to the financial statements under "Current and Deferred Income Taxes" for additional information.

Bonus Depreciation

Under the Tax Reform Legislation, projects with binding contracts prior to September 28, 2017 and placed in service after September 27, 2017 remain eligible for bonus depreciation under the PATH Act. The PATH Act allowed for 50% bonus depreciation for 2015 through 2017, 40% bonus depreciation for 2018, and 30% bonus depreciation for 2019 and certain long-lived assets placed in service in 2020. Based on provisional estimates, bonus depreciation is expected to result in positive cash flows of approximately $80 million for the


tax year and approximately $30 million for the


tax year. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Other Matters

Georgia Power is involved in various other matters being litigated and regulatory matters that could affect future earnings. In addition, Georgia Power is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. Georgia Power's business activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the environment, such as laws and regulations governing air, water, land, and protection of other natural resources. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, has occurred throughout the U.S. This litigation has included claims for damages alleged to have been caused by CO


and other emissions, CCR, and alleged exposure to hazardous materials, and/or requests for injunctive relief in connection with such matters.

The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation or regulatory matters cannot be predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically reported herein or in Notes


and


to the financial statements, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings would have a material effect on Georgia Power's financial statements. See Notes


and


to the financial statements for a discussion of various other contingencies, regulatory matters, and other matters being litigated which may affect future earnings potential.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Georgia Power prepares its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Significant accounting policies are described in Notes


,


, and


to the financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may have a material impact on Georgia Power's results of operations and related disclosures. Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those recorded in the financial statements. Senior management has reviewed and discussed the following critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors.

Utility Regulation

Georgia Power is subject to retail regulation by the Georgia PSC and wholesale regulation by the FERC. These regulatory agencies set the rates Georgia Power is permitted to charge customers based on allowable costs. As a result, Georgia Power applies accounting standards which require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the ratemaking process, the regulators may require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when they would be recognized by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of expenses and the recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery through rates or the deferral of gains or creation of liabilities and the recording of related regulatory liabilities. The application of the accounting standards has a further effect on Georgia Power's financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from those actually incurred by Georgia Power; therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation, AROs, and pension and other postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on Georgia Power's results of operations and financial condition than they would on a non-regulated company.

As reflected in Note


to the financial statements under "

Georgia Power

–

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

," significant regulatory assets and liabilities have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of these regulatory assets and any requirement to refund these regulatory liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines and GAAP. However, adverse legislative, judicial, or regulatory actions could materially impact the amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could adversely impact Georgia Power's financial statements.

Estimated Cost, Schedule, and Rate Recovery for the Construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4

In 2016, the Georgia PSC approved the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, which resolved certain prudency matters in connection with Georgia Power's fifteenth VCM report. In December 2017, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM

II-112

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual Report

report, which included a recommendation to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, with Southern Nuclear serving as project manager and Bechtel serving as the primary construction contractor, as well as a modification of the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement. The Georgia PSC's related order stated that under the modified Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, (i) none of the

$3.3 billion

of costs incurred through December 31, 2015 should be disallowed as imprudent; (ii) capital costs incurred up to

$5.68 billion

would be presumed to be reasonable and prudent with the burden of proof on any party challenging such costs; (iii) Georgia Power would have the burden of proof to show that any capital costs above

$5.68 billion

were prudent; (iv) Georgia Power's total project capital cost forecast of

$7.3 billion

(net of

$1.7 billion

received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately

$188 million

in related Customer Refunds) was found reasonable and did not represent a cost cap; and (v) prudence decisions would be made subsequent to achieving fuel load for Unit 4.

In its order, the Georgia PSC also stated if other conditions change and assumptions upon which Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report are based do not materialize, the Georgia PSC reserved the right to reconsider the decision to continue construction.

In the second quarter 2018, Georgia Power revised its base cost forecast and estimated contingency to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to

$8.0 billion

and

$0.4 billion

, respectively, for a total project capital cost forecast of

$8.4 billion

(net of

$1.7 billion

received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately

$188 million

in related Customer Refunds). Although Georgia Power believes these incremental costs are reasonable and necessary to complete the project and the Georgia PSC's order in the seventeenth VCM proceeding specifically states that the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is not subject to a cost cap, Georgia Power did not seek rate recovery for the

$0.7 billion

increase in costs included in the current base capital cost forecast in the nineteenth VCM report. In connection with future VCM filings, Georgia Power may request the Georgia PSC to evaluate costs currently included in the construction contingency estimate for rate recovery as and when they are appropriately included in the base capital cost forecast. After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of costs included in the construction contingency estimate since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in these future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded a total pre-tax charge to income of

$1.1 billion

(

$0.8 billion

after tax) in the second quarter 2018.

Georgia Power's revised cost estimate reflects an expected in-service date of November 2021 for Unit 3 and November 2022 for Unit 4.

As construction continues, challenges with management of contractors, subcontractors, and vendors; labor productivity, availability, and/or cost escalation; procurement, fabrication, delivery, assembly, and/or installation and testing, including any required engineering changes, of plant systems, structures, and components (some of which are based on new technology that only recently began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale); or other issues could arise and change the projected schedule and estimated cost. Monthly construction production targets required to maintain the current project schedule will continue to increase significantly throughout 2019. To meet these increasing monthly targets, existing craft construction productivity must improve and additional craft laborers must be retained and deployed.

Georgia Power and Southern Nuclear believe it is a leading practice in connection with a construction project of this size and complexity to periodically validate recent construction progress in comparison to the projected schedule and to verify and update quantities of commodities remaining to install, labor productivity, and forecasted staffing needs. This verification process, led by Southern Nuclear, was underway as of December 31, 2018 and is expected to be completed during the second quarter 2019. Georgia Power currently does not anticipate any material changes to the total estimated project capital cost forecast for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 or the expected in-service dates of November 2021 and November 2022, respectively, resulting from this verification process. However, the ultimate impact on cost and schedule, if any, will not be known until the verification process is completed. Georgia Power is required to report the results and any project impacts to the Georgia PSC by May 15, 2019.

There have been technical and procedural challenges to the construction and licensing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 at the federal and state level and additional challenges may arise. Processes are in place that are designed to assure compliance with the requirements specified in the Westinghouse Design Control Document and the combined construction and operating licenses, including inspections by Southern Nuclear and the NRC that occur throughout construction. As a result of such compliance processes, certain license amendment requests have been filed and approved or are pending before the NRC. Various design and other licensing-based compliance matters, including the timely resolution of ITAAC and the related approvals by the NRC, may arise, which may result in additional license amendments or require other resolution. If any license amendment requests or other licensing-based compliance issues are not resolved in a timely manner, there may be delays in the project schedule that could result in increased costs.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. Any extension of the in-service dates of November 2021 for Unit 3 and November 2022 for Unit 4 is currently estimated to result in additional base capital costs of approximately

$50 million

per month, based on Georgia Power's ownership interests, and AFUDC of approximately

$12 million

per month. While

II-113

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual Report

Georgia Power is not precluded from seeking recovery of any future capital cost forecast increase, management will ultimately determine whether or not to seek recovery. Any further changes to the capital cost forecast that are not expected to be recoverable through regulated rates will be required to be charged to income and such charges could be material.

Given the significant complexity involved in estimating the future costs to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and the significant management judgment necessary to assess the related uncertainties surrounding future rate recovery of any projected cost increases, as well as the potential impact on Georgia Power's results of operations and cash flows, Georgia Power considers these items to be critical accounting estimates. See Note


to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" for additional information.

Asset Retirement Obligations

AROs are computed as the fair value of the estimated costs for an asset's future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The estimated costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. In the absence of quoted market prices, AROs are estimated using present value techniques in which estimates of future cash outlays associated with the asset retirements are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Estimates of the timing and amounts of future cash outlays are based on projections of when and how the assets will be retired and the cost of future removal activities.

The liability for AROs primarily relates to the decommissioning of Georgia Power's nuclear facilities, which include Georgia Power's ownership interests in Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, and facilities that are subject to the CCR Rule and the related state rule, principally ash ponds. In addition, Georgia Power has AROs related to various landfill sites, underground storage tanks, and asbestos removal.

Georgia Power also has identified retirement obligations related to certain transmission and distribution facilities, including the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers; leasehold improvements; equipment on customer property; and property associated with Georgia Power's rail lines and natural gas pipelines. However, liabilities for the removal of these assets have not been recorded because the settlement timing for the retirement obligations related to these assets is indeterminable and, therefore, the fair value of the retirement obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. A liability for these retirement obligations will be recognized when sufficient information becomes available to support a reasonable estimation of the retirement obligation.

Georgia Power previously recorded AROs as a result of state requirements in Georgia which closely align with the requirements of the CCR Rule discussed above. The cost estimates for AROs related to the disposal of CCR are based on information using various assumptions related to closure and post-closure costs, timing of future cash outlays, inflation and discount rates, and the potential methods for complying with the CCR Rule and the related state rule.

In December 2018, Georgia Power recorded an increase of approximately

$3.1 billion

to its AROs related to the disposal of CCR as a result of a strategic assessment which indicated additional closure costs will be required to close the ash ponds, primarily due to changes in closure strategies, the estimated amount of ash to be excavated, and additional water management requirements necessary to support closure strategies. Also in December 2018, Georgia Power recorded an increase of approximately

$130 million

to its AROs as a result of updated decommissioning cost site studies for Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2. Georgia Power expects to periodically update its ARO cost estimates. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and Regulations – Coal Combustion Residuals" herein and Note


to the financial statements for additional information.

Given the significant judgment involved in estimating AROs, Georgia Power considers the liabilities for AROs to be critical accounting estimates.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Georgia Power's calculation of pension and other postretirement benefits expense is dependent on a number of assumptions. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected long-term return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary and wage increases, and other factors. Components of pension and other postretirement benefits expense include interest and service cost on the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, expected return on plan assets, and amortization of certain unrecognized costs and obligations. Actual results that differ from the assumptions utilized are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While Georgia Power believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect its pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations.

Key elements in determining Georgia Power's pension and other postretirement benefit expense are the expected long-term return on plan assets and the discount rate used to measure the benefit plan obligations and the periodic benefit plan expense for future periods. The expected long-term return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets is based on Southern Company's investment strategy, historical experience, and expectations for long-term rates of return that consider external actuarial advice.

II-114


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual Report

Southern Company determines the long-term return on plan assets by applying the long-term rate of expected returns on various asset classes to Southern Company's target asset allocation. For purposes of determining Georgia Power's liability related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, Southern Company discounts the future related cash flows using a single-point discount rate for each plan developed from the weighted average of market-observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to expected benefit payments.

A 25 basis point change in any significant assumption (discount rate, salary increases, or long-term rate of return on plan assets) would result in a $10 million or less change in total annual benefit expense, a $128 million or less change in the projected obligation for the pension plan, and an $18 million or less change in the projected obligation for other postretirement benefit plans.

See Note


to the financial statements for additional information regarding pension and other postretirement benefits.

Contingent Obligations

Georgia Power is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other factors and conditions that subject it to environmental, litigation, and other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Notes


and


to the financial statements for more information regarding certain of these contingencies. Georgia Power periodically evaluates its exposure to such risks and records reserves for those matters where a non-tax-related loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable. The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or conditions that can be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially affect Georgia Power's results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

See Note


to the financial statements under "

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

" for additional information.

In 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,

Leases (Topic 842)

(ASU 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases. ASU 2016-02 also changes the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expense associated with leases and provides clarification regarding the identification of certain components of contracts that would represent a lease. The accounting required by lessors is relatively unchanged

.

ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and

Georgia Power

adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2019.

Georgia Power

elected the transition methodology provided by ASU No. 2018-11,

Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements

, whereby the requirements of ASU 2016-02 are applied on a prospective basis as of the adoption date of January 1, 2019, without restating prior periods.

Georgia Power

elected the package of practical expedients provided by ASU 2016-02 that allows prior determinations of whether existing contracts are, or contain, leases and the classification of existing leases to continue without reassessment. Additionally,

Georgia Power

applied the use-of-hindsight practical expedient in determining lease terms as of the date of adoption and elected the practical expedient that allows existing land easements not previously accounted for as leases not to be reassessed.

Georgia Power

also made accounting policy elections to account for short-term leases in all asset classes as off-balance sheet leases and combined lease and non-lease components in the computations of lease obligations and right-of-use assets for most asset classes.

Georgia Power

completed the implementation of a new application to track and account for its leases and updated its internal controls and accounting policies to support the accounting for leases under ASU 2016-02.

Georgia Power

completed its lease inventory and

determined its most significant leases involve PPAs and real estate.

In the first quarter 2019, the adoption of ASU 2016-02 resulted in recording lease liabilities and right-of-use assets on

Georgia Power's

balance sheet each totaling

approximately $1.5 billion

, with no impact on

Georgia Power's

statement of income.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

Georgia Power's financial condition remained stable at

December 31, 2018

. Georgia Power's cash requirements primarily consist of funding ongoing operations, common stock dividends, capital expenditures, and debt maturities. Capital expenditures and other investing activities include investments to build new generation facilities, including Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, to maintain existing generation facilities, to comply with environmental regulations including adding environmental modifications to existing generating units and closures of ash ponds, to expand and improve transmission and distribution facilities, and for restoration following major storms. Operating cash flows provide a substantial portion of Georgia Power's cash needs. For the three-year period from


through


, Georgia Power's projected common stock dividends, capital expenditures, and debt maturities are expected to exceed operating cash flows. Georgia Power plans to finance future cash needs in excess of its operating cash flows primarily through external securities issuances, equity contributions from Southern Company, borrowings from financial

II-115

institutions, and borrowings through the FFB. Georgia Power plans to use commercial paper to manage seasonal variations in operating cash flows and for other working capital needs. Georgia Power intends to continue to monitor its access to short-term and long-term capital markets as well as bank credit arrangements to meet future capital and liquidity needs. See "Sources of Capital," "Financing Activities," and "Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations" herein for additional information.

Georgia Power's investments in the qualified pension plan and nuclear decommissioning trust funds decreased in value as of

December 31, 2018

as compared to

December 31, 2017

. No contributions to the qualified pension plan were made for the year ended December 31, 2018 and no mandatory contributions to the qualified pension plan are anticipated during


. Georgia Power also funded approximately $5 million to its nuclear decommissioning trust funds in


. See "Contractual Obligations" herein and Notes


and

Net cash provided from operating activities totaled

$2.8 billion

in


, an

increase

of

$857 million

from


, primarily due to the timing of vendor and property tax payments and income tax refunds, a decrease in current income taxes related to the Tax Reform Legislation, increased fuel cost recovery, and the timing of fossil fuel stock purchases, partially offset by payments of customer refunds primarily related to the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and the Georgia Power Tax Reform Settlement Agreement. Net cash provided from operating activities totaled

$1.9 billion

in


, a

decrease

of

$513 million

from


, primarily due to the timing of vendor payments and increases in under-recovered fuel costs and prepaid federal income taxes, partially offset by a decrease in voluntary contributions to the qualified pension plan. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Income Tax Matters –

Federal Tax Reform Legislation

" herein and Note


to the financial statements for additional information regarding federal income taxes.

Net cash used for investing activities totaled

$3.1 billion

,

$0.9 billion

, and

$2.3 billion

in


,


, and


, respectively, due to gross property additions primarily related to installation of equipment to comply with environmental standards and construction of generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, including a total of $2.7 billion related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, partially offset in 2017 by

$1.7 billion

in payments received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement. The majority of funds needed for gross property additions for the last several years has been provided from operating activities, capital contributions from Southern Company, and the issuance of debt. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Retail Regulatory Matters – Nuclear Construction" herein for additional information on the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.

Net cash used for financing activities totaled

$400 million

,

$151 million

, and

$142 million

for


,


, and


, respectively. The increase in cash used in


compared to


was primarily due to lower issuances of senior notes and short-term bank debt and higher redemptions and repurchases of senior notes, partially offset by higher capital contributions from Southern Company and an increase in notes payable. The increase in cash used in


compared to


was primarily due to a decrease in notes payable, a decrease in borrowings from the FFB for construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, and the redemption of all outstanding shares of Georgia Power's preferred and preference stock, partially offset by higher issuances of senior notes and junior subordinated notes and a decrease in maturities of senior notes. Fluctuations in cash flow from financing activities vary from year to year based on capital needs and the maturity or redemption of securities.

Significant balance sheet changes in


included an increase in property, plant, and equipment of

$2.6 billion

primarily related to the

$3.2 billion

increase in AROs, as well as the installation of equipment to comply with environmental standards and the construction of generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, and net of the

$1.1 billion

charge related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4; an increase of

$2.0 billion

in other regulatory assets, deferred primarily related to AROs; and a decrease of

$1.9 billion

in long-term debt (including securities due within one year) primarily due to the redemption, repurchase, and maturity of senior notes and the purchase of pollution control revenue bonds. Total common stockholder's equity increased

$2.4 billion

primarily due to a

$3.0 billion

increase in paid-in capital resulting from capital contributions received from Southern Company, partially offset by a

$0.6 billion

Sources of Capital

Georgia Power plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from sources similar to those used in the past, which were primarily from operating cash flows, external security issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, equity contributions from Southern Company, and borrowings from the FFB. However, the amount, type, and timing of any future financings, if needed, will depend upon regulatory approvals, prevailing market conditions, and other factors.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual Report

In 2014, Georgia Power entered into the Loan Guarantee Agreement with the DOE, under which the proceeds of borrowings may be used to reimburse Georgia Power for Eligible Project Costs incurred in connection with its construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Under the Loan Guarantee Agreement, the DOE agreed to guarantee borrowings of up to

$3.46 billion

(not to exceed 70% of Eligible Project Costs) to be made by Georgia Power under a multi-advance credit facility (FFB Credit Facility) among Georgia Power, the DOE, and the FFB. At

December 31, 2018

, Georgia Power had borrowed

$2.6 billion

under the FFB Credit Facility. In July 2017, Georgia Power entered into an amendment to the Loan Guarantee Agreement, which provides that further advances are conditioned upon the DOE's approval of any agreements entered into in replacement of the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement and satisfaction of certain other conditions.

In September 2017, the DOE issued a conditional commitment to Georgia Power for up to approximately

$1.67 billion

of additional guaranteed loans under the Loan Guarantee Agreement. This conditional commitment expires on

March 31, 2019

, subject to any further extension approved by the DOE. Final approval and issuance of these additional loan guarantees by the DOE cannot be assured and are subject to the negotiation of definitive agreements, completion of due diligence by the DOE, receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals, and satisfaction of other conditions. See Note


to the financial statements under "Long-term Debt – DOE Loan Guarantee Borrowings" for additional information regarding the Loan Guarantee Agreement, including applicable covenants, events of default, mandatory prepayment events (including any decision not to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4), and additional conditions to borrowing. Also see Note


to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" for additional information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.

The issuance of long-term securities by Georgia Power is subject to the approval of the Georgia PSC. In addition, the issuance of short-term debt securities by Georgia Power is subject to regulatory approval by the FERC. Additionally, with respect to the public offering of securities, Georgia Power files registration statements with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The amounts of securities authorized by the Georgia PSC and the FERC are continuously monitored and appropriate filings are made to ensure flexibility in the capital markets.

Georgia Power obtains financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. See Note


to the financial statements under "Bank Credit Arrangements" for additional information. The Southern Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of Georgia Power are not commingled with funds of any other company in the Southern Company system.

At

December 31, 2018

, Georgia Power's current liabilities exceeded current assets by

$1.4 billion

primarily as a result of

$0.6 billion

of long-term debt that is due within one year and

$0.3 billion

of notes payable. Georgia Power's current liabilities frequently exceed current assets because of scheduled maturities of long-term debt and the periodic use of short-term debt as a funding source, as well as significant seasonal fluctuations in cash needs.

At

December 31, 2018

, Georgia Power had approximately

$4 million

of cash and cash equivalents. Georgia Power's committed credit arrangement with banks was

$1.75 billion

at

December 31, 2018

, of which

$1.74 billion

was unused. This credit arrangement expires in 2022.

This bank credit arrangement contains a covenant that limits debt levels and contains a cross-acceleration provision to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) of Georgia Power. Such cross-acceleration provision to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if Georgia Power defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. At

December 31, 2018

, Georgia Power was in compliance with this covenant. This bank credit arrangement does not contain a material adverse change clause at the time of borrowing.

Subject to applicable market conditions, Georgia Power expects to renew or replace this credit arrangement as needed prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Georgia Power may extend the maturity date and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder.

See Note


to the financial statements under "Bank Credit Arrangements" for additional information.

A portion of the

$1.74 billion

unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to Georgia Power's pollution control revenue bonds and commercial paper program. The amount of variable rate pollution control revenue bonds outstanding requiring liquidity support at

December 31, 2018

was

$659 million

as compared to

$550 million

at

December 31, 2017

. In addition, at

December 31, 2018

, Georgia Power had obligations related to

$345 million

of pollution control revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the next 12 months. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, Georgia Power redeemed approximately $108 million of these obligations.

Georgia Power may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper at the request and for the benefit of Georgia Power and the other traditional electric operating companies. Proceeds from such issuances for the benefit of Georgia Power are loaned directly to Georgia Power. The obligations of each

Georgia Power believes the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing the commercial paper program, lines of credit, short-term bank notes, and operating cash flows.

Financing Activities

In addition to any financings that may be necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual obligations, Georgia Power plans to continue, when economically feasible, a program to retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit.

Senior Notes

In April 2018, Georgia Power redeemed all $250 million aggregate principal amount of its Series 2008B 5.40% Senior Notes due June 1, 2018.

In May 2018, through cash tender offers, Georgia Power repurchased and retired $89 million of the $250 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its Series 2007A 5.65% Senior Notes due March 1, 2037, $326 million of the $500 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its Series 2009A 5.95% Senior Notes due February 1, 2039, and $335 million of the $600 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its Series 2010B 5.40% Senior Notes due June 1, 2040, for an aggregate purchase price, excluding accrued and unpaid interest, of $902 million.

In December 2018, Georgia Power repaid at maturity $500 million aggregate principal amount of its Series 2015A 1.95% Senior Notes.

Pollution Control Revenue Bonds

During 2018, Georgia Power purchased and held the following pollution control revenue bonds, which may be reoffered to the public at a later date:

•

approximately $105 million aggregate principal amount of Development Authority of Burke County (Georgia) Pollution Control Revenue Bonds (Georgia Power Company Plant Vogtle Project), First Series 2013

•

$173 million aggregate principal amount of Development Authority of Bartow County (Georgia) Pollution Control Revenue Bonds (Georgia Power Company Plant Bowen Project), First Series 2009

•

$55 million aggregate principal amount of Development Authority of Burke County (Georgia) Pollution Control Revenue Bonds (Georgia Power Company Plant Vogtle Project), Fifth Series 1994

In January 2018, Georgia Power repaid its outstanding $150 million and $100 million floating rate bank loans due May 31, 2018 and October 26, 2018, respectively.

Credit Rating Risk

At

December 31, 2018

, Georgia Power did not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade.

There are certain contracts that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change to BBB- and/or Baa3 or below. These contracts are for physical electricity purchases and sales, fuel purchases, fuel transportation and storage, energy price risk management, transmission, interest rate management, and construction of new generation at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.

The maximum potential collateral requirements under these contracts at

December 31, 2018

were as follows:

Included in these amounts are certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that either Georgia Power or Alabama Power (an affiliate of Georgia Power) has a credit rating change to below investment grade. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. Additionally, a credit rating downgrade could impact the ability of Georgia Power to access capital markets and would be likely to impact the cost at which it does so.

On February 28, 2018, Fitch downgraded the senior unsecured long-term debt rating of Georgia Power to A from A+ with a negative outlook. On August 9, 2018, Fitch downgraded the senior unsecured long-term debt rating of Georgia Power to A- from A. On September 28, 2018, Fitch assigned a negative rating outlook to the ratings of Southern Company and certain of its subsidiaries (including Georgia Power).

On August 8, 2018, Moody's downgraded the senior unsecured debt rating of Georgia Power to Baa1 from A3. On September 28, 2018, Moody's revised its rating outlook for Georgia Power from negative to stable.

As a result of the Tax Reform Legislation, certain financial metrics, such as the funds from operations to debt percentage, used by the credit rating agencies to assess Southern Company and its subsidiaries (including Georgia Power) may be negatively impacted. The Georgia Power Tax Reform Settlement Agreement approved by the Georgia PSC on April 3, 2018 is expected to help mitigate these potential adverse impacts to certain credit metrics by allowing a higher retail equity ratio until the conclusion of the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case. See Note


to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Rate Plans" for additional information.

Market Price Risk

Due to cost-based rate regulation and other various cost recovery mechanisms, Georgia Power continues to have limited exposure to market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity. To manage the volatility attributable to these exposures, Georgia Power nets the exposures, where possible, to take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various

II-119


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual Report

derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to Georgia Power's policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and risk management practices. Georgia Power's policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including, but not limited to, market valuation, value at risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis.

To mitigate future exposure to changes in interest rates, Georgia Power may enter into derivatives designated as hedges. The weighted average interest rate on $0.9 billion of long-term variable interest rate exposure at

December 31, 2018

was 2.57%. If Georgia Power sustained a 100 basis point change in interest rates for all long-term variable interest rate exposure, the change would affect annualized interest expense by approximately $9 million at

December 31, 2018

. See Note


to the financial statements under "Financial Instruments" and Note


to the financial statements for additional information.

To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, Georgia Power enters into physical fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity market and, to a lesser extent, financial hedge contracts for natural gas purchases. Georgia Power continues to manage a fuel-hedging program implemented per the guidelines of the Georgia PSC. Georgia Power had no material change in market risk exposure for the year ended

December 31, 2018

when compared to the

December 31, 2017

reporting period.

The changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts are substantially attributable to both the volume and the price of natural gas. For the years ended December 31, the changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts, the majority of which are composed of regulatory hedges, were as follows:

(*)

Current period changes also include the changes in fair value of new contracts entered into during the period, if any.

The net hedge volumes of energy-related derivative contracts at

December 31, 2018

and


were as follows:

The weighted average swap contract cost above market prices was approximately $0.10 per mmBtu and $0.08 per mmBtu at

December 31, 2018

and


, respectively. The change in option fair value is primarily attributable to the volatility of the market and the underlying change in the natural gas price. All natural gas hedge gains and losses are recovered through Georgia Power's fuel cost recovery mechanism.

At

December 31, 2018

and


, substantially all of Georgia Power's energy-related derivative contracts were designated as regulatory hedges and were related to Georgia Power's fuel-hedging program, which had a time horizon up to 48 months. Hedging gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense as they are recovered through the fuel cost recovery mechanism. Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as incurred and were not material for any year presented.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual Report

Georgia Power uses over-the-counter contracts that are not exchange traded but are fair valued using prices which are market observable, and thus fall into Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. See Note


to the financial statements for further discussion of fair value measurements. The maturities of the energy-related derivative contracts, which are all Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, at

December 31, 2018

were as follows:

Georgia Power is exposed to market price risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the energy-related and interest rate derivative contracts. Georgia Power only enters into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody's and S&P or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. Therefore, Georgia Power does not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the counterparties. For additional information, see Note

, respectively. These estimated expenditures do not include any potential compliance costs associated with pending regulation of CO


emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and Regulations" and " – Global Climate Issues" herein for additional information.

Georgia Power also anticipates costs associated with closure and monitoring of ash ponds and landfills in accordance with the CCR Rule, which are reflected in Georgia Power's ARO liabilities. In December 2018, Georgia Power recorded an increase of approximately

$3.1 billion

to its AROs related to the CCR Rule and the related state rule. These costs, which are expected to change and could change materially as underlying assumptions are refined and the cost and the method and timing of compliance activities continue to be evaluated, are currently estimated to be $0.2 billion for 2019, $0.3 billion for 2020, $0.4 billion for 2021, $0.7 billion for 2022, and $0.6 billion for 2023. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and Regulations – Coal Combustion Residuals" and Note


to the financial statements for additional information.

The construction program is subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions; changes in load projections; changes in environmental laws and regulations; the outcome of any legal challenges to environmental rules; changes in generating plants, including unit retirements and replacements and adding or changing fuel sources at existing generating units, to meet regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules and regulations; Georgia PSC approvals; changes in the expected environmental compliance program; changes in legislation; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes; storm impacts; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered. The construction program also includes Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which includes components based on new technology that only recently began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale and which may be subject to additional revised cost estimates during construction. The ability to control costs and avoid cost and schedule overruns during the development, construction, and operation of new facilities is subject to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, changes in labor costs, availability, and productivity; challenges with management of contractors, subcontractors, or vendors; adverse weather conditions; shortages, increased costs, or inconsistent quality of equipment, materials, and labor; contractor or supplier

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual Report

OVERVIEW

Business Activities

Mississippi Power operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electric service to retail customers within its traditional service territory located within the State of Mississippi and to wholesale customers in the Southeast.

Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of Mississippi Power's business of providing electric service. These factors include Mississippi Power's ability to maintain and grow energy sales and to operate in a constructive regulatory environment that provides timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs. These costs include those related to reliability, fuel, and stringent environmental standards, as well as ongoing capital and operations and maintenance expenditures and restoration following major storms. Appropriately balancing required costs and capital expenditures with customer prices will continue to challenge Mississippi Power for the foreseeable future. Mississippi Power is scheduled to file a base rate case in the fourth quarter 2019 (Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case).

As a result of the Mississippi PSC's stated intent to issue an order establishing a new docket for a global settlement under which the Kemper County energy facility would be operated as a natural gas plant, rather than an IGCC plant (Kemper Settlement Docket), on June 28, 2017, Mississippi Power notified the Mississippi PSC that it would begin a process to suspend operations and start-up activities on the gasifier portion of the Kemper County energy facility. At the time of project suspension, the total cost estimate for the Kemper County energy facility was approximately $7.38 billion, including approximately $5.95 billion of costs subject to the construction cost cap. In the aggregate, Mississippi Power had incurred charges of $3.07 billion ($1.89 billion after tax) for changes in the cost estimate above the cost cap through May 31, 2017.

Given the Mississippi PSC's stated intent regarding no additional rate increases for the Kemper County energy facility and the subsequent suspension of construction, cost recovery of the gasification portions was no longer probable. Therefore, Mississippi Power recorded a charge to income in June 2017 of $2.8 billion ($2.0 billion after tax) for the estimated costs associated with the gasification portions of the plant and lignite mine. During the third and fourth quarters 2017, Mississippi Power recorded further charges to income totaling $242 million ($206 million after tax), including $164 million for ongoing project costs, estimated mine and gasifier-related costs, and certain termination costs during the suspension period prior to conclusion of the Kemper Settlement Docket, as well as a charge associated with the Kemper Settlement Agreement discussed below.

On February 6, 2018, the Mississippi PSC voted to approve a settlement agreement related to cost recovery for the Kemper County energy facility among Mississippi Power, the MPUS, and certain intervenors (Kemper Settlement Agreement), which resolved all cost recovery issues, modified the CPCN to limit the Kemper County energy facility to natural gas combined cycle operation, and provided for an annual revenue requirement of approximately $99.3 million for costs related to the Kemper County energy facility, which included the impact of the Tax Reform Legislation. The revenue requirement is based on (i) a fixed ROE for 2018 of 8.6% excluding any performance adjustment, (ii) a ROE for 2019 calculated in accordance with PEP, excluding the performance adjustment, (iii) for future years, a performance-based ROE calculated pursuant to PEP, and (iv) amortization periods for the related regulatory assets and liabilities of eight years and six years, respectively. The revenue requirement also reflects a disallowance related to a portion of Mississippi Power's investment in the Kemper County energy facility requested for inclusion in rate base, which was recorded in the fourth quarter 2017 as an additional charge to income of approximately $78 million ($85 million net of accumulated depreciation of $7 million) pre-tax ($48 million after tax). Under the Kemper Settlement Agreement, retail customer rates reflect a reduction of approximately $26.8 million annually, effective with the first billing cycle of April 2018, and include no recovery for costs associated with the gasifier portion of the Kemper County energy facility in 2018 or at any future date.

In 2018, Mississippi Power recorded pre-tax charges to income of

$37 million

(

$27 million

after tax), primarily resulting from the abandonment and related closure activities and ongoing period costs, net of sales proceeds, for the mine and gasifier-related assets at the Kemper County energy facility. In addition, Mississippi Power recorded a credit to earnings of

$95 million

in the fourth quarter 2018 primarily resulting from the reduction of a valuation allowance for a state income tax

net operating loss (NOL)

carryforward associated with the Kemper County energy facility. Additional closure costs for the mine and gasifier-related assets, currently estimated at up to

$10 million

pre-tax

(excluding salvage, net of dismantlement costs), may be incurred through the first half of 2020.

In addition, period costs, including, but not limited to, costs for compliance and safety, ARO accretion, and property taxes for the mine and gasifier-related assets, are estimated to total

$11 million

in 2019 and

$2 million

to

$4 million

annually in 2020 through 2023. Mississippi Power is currently evaluating its options regarding the final disposition of the CO


pipeline, including removal of the pipeline. This evaluation is expected to be complete later in 2019. If Mississippi Power ultimately decides to remove the CO


pipeline, the cost of removal would have a material impact on

Mississippi Power's financial statements.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual Report

See Note


to the financial statements under "Kemper County Energy Facility" and Note


to the financial statements for additional information.

On August 7, 2018 the Mississippi PSC approved settlement agreements between Mississippi Power and the MPUS with respect to the 2018 PEP filing and all unresolved PEP filings for prior years (PEP Settlement Agreement) and the 2018 ECO Plan filing (ECO Settlement Agreement). Rates under the PEP Settlement Agreement and the ECO Settlement Agreement resulted in annual revenue increases of approximately

$21.6 million

and

$17 million

, respectively, effective with the first billing cycle of September 2018 and are expected to continue through the conclusion of the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case.

In August 2018, the Mississippi PSC began an operations review of Mississippi Power, for which the final report is expected prior to the conclusion of the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case. Mississippi Power expects that the review will include, but not be limited to, a comparative analysis of its costs, its cost recovery framework, and ways in which it may streamline management operations for the reasonable benefit of ratepayers. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Retail Regulatory Matters" herein and Note


to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power" for additional information.

Mississippi Power continues to focus on several key performance indicators. In recognition that Mississippi Power's long-term financial success is dependent upon how well it satisfies its customers' needs, Mississippi Power's retail base rate mechanism, PEP, includes performance indicators that directly tie customer service indicators to Mississippi Power's allowed ROE. PEP measures Mississippi Power's performance on a 10-point scale as a weighted average of results in three areas: average customer price, as compared to prices of other regional utilities (weighted at 40%); service reliability, measured in percentage of time customers had electric service (40%); and customer satisfaction, measured in a survey of residential customers (20%). Mississippi Power also focuses on broader measures of customer satisfaction, plant availability, system reliability, and net income.

Mississippi Power's financial success is directly tied to customer satisfaction. Key elements of ensuring customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high reliability, and competitive prices. Management uses customer satisfaction surveys to evaluate Mississippi Power's results and generally targets top-quartile performance.

reserved in connection with the 2012 PEP lookback filing and deferred $17 million of revenue in 2017 following the complete amortization of certain regulatory assets related to the Kemper County energy facility. These increases were offset by a decrease of $16 million annually for base rates related to the Kemper County energy facility that became effective for the first billing cycle of April 2018 and the recognition in 2018 of regulatory liabilities of $5 million and $2 million, respectively, related to the equity ratio provisions of the PEP and ECO Settlement Agreements. Additionally, there was a $12 million increase as a result of colder weather in the first quarter and warmer weather in the second and third quarters in 2018 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2017 and a $5 million decrease in fuel and other cost recovery.

Total retail revenues for


decreased $5 million, or 0.6%, compared to


primarily due to a $15 million decrease as a result of milder weather in 2017 as compared to 2016 and the deferral of $17 million of revenue following the complete amortization of certain regulatory assets related to the Kemper County energy facility in July 2017. These decreases were partially offset by a $10 million net increase related to ECO Plan rate changes in the third quarter 2016 and the second quarter 2017 and an increase of $13 million in fuel cost recovery.

See Note


to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power – Environmental Compliance Overview Plan," " – Performance Evaluation Plan," and " – Kemper County Energy Facility – Rate Recovery" for additional information. See "Energy Sales" below for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to sales and weather.

Electric rates for Mississippi Power include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses, including the energy component of purchased power costs, and do not affect net income. Recoverable fuel costs include fuel and purchased power expenses reduced by the fuel and emissions portion of wholesale revenues from energy sold to customers outside Mississippi Power's service territory. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Retail Regulatory Matters – Fuel Cost Recovery" herein for additional information.

Wholesale revenues from power sales to non-affiliated utilities, including FERC-regulated MRA sales as well as market-based sales, were as follows:

Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Mississippi Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. In addition, Mississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and municipalities located in southeastern Mississippi under cost-based electric tariffs which are subject to regulation by the FERC. The contracts with these wholesale customers represented

17.3%

of Mississippi Power's total operating revenues in


and are generally subject to 10-year rolling cancellation notices. Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any changes in contractual relationships for one customer are likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers.

Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in sales for resale to non-affiliates. These opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Mississippi Power's variable cost to produce the energy.

Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost.

Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates increased

$35 million

, or

62.5%

, in


compared to


and increased $30 million, or 115.4%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The increases in 2018 and 2017 were primarily due to $19 million and $9 million, respectively, associated with higher natural gas prices and $16 million and $21 million, respectively, associated with increases in KWH sales due to the dispatch of Mississippi Power's lower cost generation resources to serve Southern Company system territorial load.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual Report

Energy Sales

Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year. KWH sales for 2018 and the percent change from the prior year were as follows:

Changes in retail energy sales are generally the result of changes in electricity usage by customers, changes in weather, and changes in the number of customers. Retail energy sales increased 2.9% in


as compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily the result of colder weather in the first quarter and warmer weather in the second and third quarters


as compared to the corresponding periods in


. Weather-adjusted residential KWH sales increased in


primarily due to increased customer usage. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales decreased primarily due to decreased customer usage slightly offset by customer growth. The increase in industrial KWH energy sales was primarily due to Hurricane Nate, which negatively impacted several large industrial customers in 2017.

Retail energy sales decreased 2.5% in


as compared to the prior year. This decrease was primarily the result of milder weather in


as compared to


. Weather-adjusted residential KWH sales increased in


primarily due to increased customer usage. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales decreased primarily due to decreased customer usage largely offset by customer growth. The decrease in industrial KWH energy sales was primarily due to Hurricane Nate, which negatively impacted several large industrial customers.

See "Operating Revenues" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale revenues to affiliated companies.

Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses

The mix of fuel sources for generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the availability of generating units. Additionally, Mississippi Power purchases a portion of its electricity needs from the wholesale market.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual Report

Details of Mississippi Power's generation and purchased power were as follows:

(*)

Adjusted to include the impacts of station service in 2018 and test period energy produced in 2017 and 2016 for the Kemper County energy facility, which was accounted for in accordance with FERC guidance.

Fuel and purchased power expenses were $446 million in


, an increase of $26 million, or 6.2%, as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a $35 million increase in KWHs generated and purchased, partially offset by a $9 million decrease in the average cost of generation and purchased power.

Fuel and purchased power expenses were $420 million in 2017, an increase of $43 million, or 11.4%, as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a $36 million increase in the average cost of generation and purchased power and a net increase of $7 million in KWHs generated from gas generation.

Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings, since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through Mississippi Power's fuel cost recovery clauses. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Retail Regulatory Matters – Fuel Cost Recovery" herein and Note


to the financial statements under "Fuel Costs" for additional information.

Fuel

Fuel expense increased

$10 million

, or

2.5%

, in


compared to


primarily due to a 5.2% increase in KWHs generated from gas generation. Fuel expense increased $52 million, or 15.2%, in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an 11.6% higher cost of natural gas.

Purchased Power

Purchased power expense increased

$16 million

, or

64.0%

, in


compared to


. The increase was primarily the result of a 67% increase in the volume of KWHs purchased. Purchased power expense decreased $9 million, or 26.5%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease was primarily the result of a 34% decrease in the volume of KWHs purchased, offset by a 13.9% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased compared to 2016. The changes in the volume of KWHs purchased primarily reflect the impact of test period energy offsets in 2017.

Energy purchases will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, as approved by the FERC.

Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses

Other operations and maintenance expenses increased

$22 million

, or

7.6%

, in


compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a $15 million increase related to an employee attrition plan, a $12 million increase in planned generation outage cost, and a $7 million increase related to overhead line maintenance and vegetation management. These increases were partially offset by the deferral of $4 million of compensation costs in accordance with the PEP Settlement Agreement. See Note


to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power – Performance Evaluation Plan" for additional information.

Other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $26 million, or 8.2%, in 2017 compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to a $10 million decrease in transmission and distribution expenses related to overhead line maintenance, an $8 million decrease in contractor services related to facilities, corporate advertising, and employee compensation and benefits, and an

II-129

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual Report

$8 million decrease related to the combined cycle and the associated common facilities portion of the Kemper County energy facility.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization increased

$8 million

, or

5.0%

, in


compared to


primarily due to $8 million of amortization related to the ECO Plan and $6 million of depreciation for additional plant in service. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $4 million in amortization of regulatory assets associated with Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) rule compliance.

Depreciation and amortization increased $29 million, or 22.0%, in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to $13 million of amortization related to the ECO Plan, $7 million of depreciation for additional plant in service, and $6 million in additional amortization of regulatory assets associated with MATS rule compliance.

Estimated Loss on Kemper IGCC

In


,


, and 2016, charges of

$37 million

,

$3.36 billion

, and $428 million, respectively, associated with the Kemper IGCC were recorded. The 2018 pre-tax charge of $37 million primarily resulted from the abandonment and related closure activities and ongoing period costs, net of sales proceeds, for the mine and gasifier-related assets at the Kemper County energy facility. In June 2017, Mississippi Power suspended the gasifier portion of the project and recorded a charge to earnings for the remaining $2.8 billion book value of the gasifier portion of the project. Prior to the suspension, Mississippi Power recorded losses for revisions of estimated costs expected to be incurred on construction of the Kemper IGCC in excess of the $2.88 billion cost cap established by the Mississippi PSC, net of $245 million of grants awarded to the project by the DOE under the Clean Coal Power Initiative Round 2 and excluding the cost of the lignite mine and equipment, the cost of the CO


pipeline facilities, AFUDC, and certain general exceptions (Cost Cap Exceptions).

See Note


to the financial statements under "Kemper County Energy Facility" for additional information.

Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction

AFUDC equity decreased

$72 million

, or

100.0%

, in


as compared to


and $52 million, or 41.9%, in 2017 as compared to 2016 as a result of suspending construction of the Kemper IGCC in June 2017. See Note


to the financial statements under "Kemper County Energy Facility" for additional information.

Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized

Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased

$34 million

, or

81.0%

, in


compared to


. The increase was primarily associated with a $33 million net reduction in interest recorded in 2017 following a settlement with the IRS related to research and experimental (R&E) deductions. The increase also reflects a $29 million reduction in interest capitalized as a result of suspending construction of the Kemper IGCC in June 2017, offset by decreases of $12 million in interest expense as a result of lower average outstanding debt, $8 million related to uncertain tax positions, and $7 million due to the completion of Kemper IGCC carrying cost amortization in 2017.

Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized decreased $32 million, or 43.2%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease was primarily associated with a $33 million net reduction in interest following a settlement with the IRS related to R&E deductions. Also contributing to the decrease was the amortization of $6 million in interest deferrals in accordance with an order the Mississippi PSC issued in December 2015 (In-Service Asset Rate Order) and a $7 million decrease in interest related to outstanding debt as a result of lower balances and lower rates. These decreases were partially offset by a $20 million reduction in interest capitalized as a result of suspending construction of the Kemper IGCC.

See Note


to the financial statements under "Section 174 Research and Experimental Deduction" for additional information.

Other Income (Expense), Net

Other income (expense), net increased

$16 million

in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase primarily reflects the $24 million settlement of Mississippi Power's Deepwater Horizon claim in May 2018, partially offset by a $7 million increase in charitable donations. See Note 3 to the financial statements under "General Litigation Matters

– Mississippi Power" for additional information. Other income (expense), net increased $3 million in 2017 compared to 2016.

Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual Report

Income Taxes (Benefit)

Income tax benefits decreased

$430 million

, or

80.8%

, in


compared to


primarily due to a $1.07 billion increase in income tax expense from higher pre-tax earnings primarily due to lower charges related to the Kemper County energy facility, net of the non-deductible AFUDC equity portion. This increase in income tax expense was partially offset by a $434 million decrease in income tax expense due to the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation, including $407 million primarily associated with the revaluation of 2017 deferred tax assets related to the Kemper IGCC recorded in 2017 and $23 million associated with the lower federal income tax rate applicable in 2018, as well as $194 million related to the reduction in 2018 of a valuation allowance for a state income tax NOL carryforward recorded in 2017.

Income tax benefits increased $428 million, or 411.5%, in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to $809 million in tax benefits on the estimated probable losses on the Kemper IGCC, net of the non-deductible AFUDC equity portion and the related state valuation allowances, partially offset by $372 million resulting from Tax Reform Legislation. Tax Reform Legislation earnings impacts are primarily due to revaluing deferred tax assets related to the Kemper County energy facility.

See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Income Tax Matters" herein and Note


to the financial statements for additional information.

Effects of Inflation

Mississippi Power is subject to rate regulation that is generally based on the recovery of historical and projected costs. The effects of inflation can create an economic loss since the recovery of costs could be in dollars that have less purchasing power. Any adverse effect of inflation on Mississippi Power's results of operations has not been substantial in recent years.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL

General

Mississippi Power operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electric service to retail customers within its traditional service territory located in southeast Mississippi and to wholesale customers in the Southeast. Prices for electricity provided by Mississippi Power to retail customers are set by the Mississippi PSC under cost-based regulatory principles. Retail rates and earnings are reviewed and may be adjusted periodically within certain limitations. Prices for wholesale electricity sales, interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power are regulated by the FERC. See "FERC Matters" herein, ACCOUNTING POLICIES – "Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Utility Regulation" herein, and Note


to the financial statements for additional information about regulatory matters.

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of future earnings potential. The level of Mississippi Power's future earnings depends on numerous factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of Mississippi Power's business of providing electric service. These factors include Mississippi Power's ability to recover its prudently-incurred costs in a timely manner during a time of increasing costs and its ability to prevail against legal challenges associated with the Kemper County energy facility. Future earnings will be driven primarily by continued customer growth and the weak pace of growth in electricity use per customer, especially in residential and commercial markets. Earnings will also depend upon maintaining and growing sales, considering, among other things, the adoption and/or penetration rates of increasingly energy-efficient technologies and increasing volumes of electronic commerce transactions, both of which could contribute to a net reduction in customer usage. Earnings are subject to a variety of other factors. These factors include weather, competition, developing new and maintaining existing energy contracts and associated load requirements with other utilities and other wholesale customers, energy conservation practiced by customers, the use of alternative energy sources by customers, the price of electricity, the price elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic growth or decline in Mississippi Power's service territory. Demand for electricity is primarily driven by the pace of economic growth that may be affected by changes in regional and global economic conditions, which may impact future earnings.

Mississippi Power's retail base rates are set under the PEP, a rate plan approved by the Mississippi PSC. Typically, two filings are made for each calendar year: the PEP projected filing, which is typically filed prior to the beginning of the year based on a projected revenue requirement, and the PEP lookback filing, which is filed after the end of the year and allows for review of the actual return compared to the allowed return range. Pursuant to the PEP Settlement Agreement, PEP proceedings are suspended until after the conclusion of the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case and Mississippi Power is not required to make any PEP filings for regulatory years 2018, 2019, and 2020. See "Retail Regulatory Matters" herein and Note


to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power – Performance Evaluation Plan" for more information.

On October 2, 2018, the Mississippi PSC approved the executed agreements between Mississippi Power and its largest retail customer, Chevron, for Mississippi Power to continue providing retail service to the Chevron refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi

II-131

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual Report

through 2038. The new agreements are not expected to have a material impact on Mississippi Power's earnings; however, the co-generation assets located at the refinery are accounted for as a sales-type lease in accordance with the new lease accounting rules that became effective in 2019. These assets are also subject to a security interest granted to Chevron. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Credit Rating Risk" herein for additional information.

Mississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and municipalities located in southeastern Mississippi under cost-based electric tariffs which are subject to regulation by the FERC. The contracts with these wholesale customers represented

17.3%

of Mississippi Power's total operating revenues in 2018 and are generally subject to 10-year rolling cancellation notices. Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any changes in contractual relationships for one customer are likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers.

Environmental Matters

Mississippi Power's

operations are regulated by state and federal environmental agencies through a variety of laws and regulations governing air, water, land, and protection of other natural resources.

Mississippi Power

maintains comprehensive environmental compliance and GHG strategies to assess upcoming requirements and compliance costs associated with these environmental laws and regulations. The costs, including capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, and costs reflected in ARO liabilities, required to comply with environmental laws and regulations and to achieve stated goals may impact future electric generating unit retirement and replacement decisions, results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition. Related costs may result from the installation of additional environmental controls, closure and monitoring of CCR facilities, unit retirements, or changing fuel sources for certain existing units, as well as related upgrades to

Mississippi Power's

transmission and distribution

systems. A major portion of these costs is expected to be recovered through

retail and wholesale rates.

The ultimate impact of environmental laws and regulations and the GHG goals discussed herein will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements, the availability and cost of any deployed technology, fuel prices, and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges.

New or revised environmental laws and regulations could affect many areas of

Mississippi Power's

operations. The impact of any such changes cannot be determined at this time. Environmental compliance costs could affect earnings if such costs cannot continue to be recovered in rates on a timely basis

or through long-term wholesale agreements

. Further, increased costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity

, which could negatively affect results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition.

Additionally, many commercial and industrial customers may also be affected by existing and future environmental requirements, which for some may have the potential to ultimately affect their demand for electricity

.

See Note


to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power – Environmental Compliance Overview Plan" for additional information.

Through


, Mississippi Power has invested approximately $654 million in environmental capital retrofit projects to comply with environmental requirements, with annual totals of approximately $11 million, $9 million, and $17 million for


,


, and


, respectively. Although the timing, requirements, and estimated costs could change as environmental laws and regulations are adopted or modified, as compliance plans are revised or updated, and as legal challenges to rules are initiated or completed, Mississippi Power's current compliance strategy estimates capital expenditures of $73 million from


through


, with annual totals of approximately $18 million, $20 million, $17 million, $5 million, and $13 million for


,


,


,


, and


, respectively. These estimates do not include any potential compliance costs associated with pending regulation of CO


emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. See "Global Climate Issues" herein for additional information. Mississippi Power also anticipates expenditures associated with ash pond closure and ground water monitoring under the CCR Rule, which are reflected in Mississippi Power's ARO liabilities. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations" herein and Note


to the financial statements for additional information.

Environmental Laws and Regulations

Air Quality

The EPA has set National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for six air pollutants (carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, particulate matter, and SO


) to protect and improve the nation's air quality, which it reviews and revises periodically. Following a NAAQS revision, states are required to develop an EPA-approved plan to protect air quality. These state plans can require additional emission controls, improvements in control efficiency, or fuel changes which can result in increased compliance and operational costs. NAAQS requirements can also adversely affect the siting of new electric generating facilities.

All areas within

Mississippi Power's

service territory have been designated as attainment for all NAAQS

. If areas

are designated as nonattainment in the future, increased compliance costs could result.

II-132


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual Report

In 2011, the EPA finalized the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) to address impacts of SO


and NO

X

emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating plants. CSAPR establishes emissions trading programs and budgets for certain states and allocates emissions allowances for sources in those states.

In 2016, the EPA published a final rule establishing more stringent ozone season NO

X

emissions budgets in

Alabama

and Mississippi

.

The outcome of ongoing CSAPR litigation concerning the 2016 CSAPR rule, to which

Mississippi Power

is a party, could have an impact on the State of Mississippi's ozone season NO

X

emissions budget.

Increases in either future fossil fuel-fired generation or the availability or cost of CSAPR allowances could have a negative financial impact on results of operations for

Mississippi Power

.

The EPA finalized regional haze regulations in 2005 and 2017. These regulations require states, tribal governments, and various federal agencies to develop and implement plans to reduce pollutants that impair visibility and demonstrate reasonable progress toward the goal of restoring natural visibility conditions in certain areas, including national parks and wilderness areas.

States must submit a revised state implementation plan (SIP) to the EPA demonstrating continued reasonable progress towards achieving visibility improvement goals. These plans could require reductions in certain pollutants, such as particulate matter, SO


, and NO

X

, which could result in increased compliance costs.

The EPA issued a limited approval of the regional progress SIP for the State of Mississippi because Mississippi must revise the best available retrofit technology (BART) provisions of its SIP. Therefore, Plant Daniel continues to be evaluated under the regional haze BART provisions.

Mississippi Power is required to submit Plant Daniel's BART analysis to the State of Mississippi by summer 2019. Requirements for further reduction of these pollutants at Plant Daniel could increase compliance costs.

Water Quality

In 2014, the EPA finalized requirements under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) to regulate cooling water intake structures (CWIS) to minimize their effects on fish and other aquatic life at existing power plants (e.g. coal, natural gas, oil, and nuclear generating plants) and manufacturing facilities. The regulation requires plant-specific studies to determine applicable CWIS changes to protect organisms that either get caught on the intake screens (impingement) or are drawn into the cooling system (entrainment).

Mississippi Power

is conducting these studies and currently anticipates applicable CWIS changes may include fish-friendly CWIS screens with fish return systems

and minor additions of monitoring equipment at certain plants.

However, the ultimate impact of this rule will depend on the outcome of these plant-specific studies, any additional protective measures required to be incorporated into each plant's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit based on site-specific factors, and the outcome of any legal challenges.

In 2015, the EPA finalized the steam electric effluent limitations guidelines (ELG) rule (2015 ELG Rule) that set national standards for wastewater discharges from new and existing steam electric generating units generating greater than 50 MWs. The 2015 ELG Rule prohibits effluent discharges of certain waste streams and imposes stringent limits on flue gas desulfurization (scrubber) wastewater discharges. The revised technology-based limits and the CCR Rule require extensive changes to existing ash and wastewater management systems or the installation and operation of new ash and wastewater management systems. Compliance with the 2015 ELG Rule is expected to require capital expenditures and increased operational costs primarily for

Mississippi Power's

coal-fired electric generation. State environmental agencies will incorporate specific compliance applicability dates in the NPDES permitting process for each ELG waste stream no later than December 31, 2023. The EPA is scheduled to issue a new rulemaking by December 2019 that could revise the limitations and applicability dates of two of the waste streams regulated in the 2015 ELG Rule. The impact of any changes to the 2015 ELG Rule will depend on the content of the new rule and the outcome of any legal challenges.

In 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) jointly published a final rule that revised the regulatory definition of waters of the United States (WOTUS) for all CWA programs. The rule significantly expanded the scope of federal jurisdiction over waterbodies (such as rivers, streams, canals, and wastewater treatment ponds), which could impact new generation projects

and permitting and reporting requirements associated with the installation, expansion, and maintenance of transmission

and distribution projects.

The EPA and the Corps are expected to publish a final rule in 2019 to replace the 2015 WOTUS definition. The impact of any changes to the 2015 WOTUS rule will depend on the content of this final rule and the outcome of any legal challenges.

Coal Combustion Residuals

In 2015, the EPA finalized non-hazardous solid waste regulations for the disposal of CCR, including coal ash and gypsum, in landfills and surface impoundments (ash ponds) at active generating power plants.

The EPA's CCR Rule requires landfills and ash ponds to be evaluated against a set of performance criteria and potentially closed if minimum criteria are not met. Closure of existing landfills and ash ponds could require installation of equipment and infrastructure to manage CCR in accordance with the CCR Rule.

Based on cost estimates for closure and monitoring of landfills and ash ponds pursuant to the CCR Rule,

Mississippi

II-133


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual Report

Power recorded AROs for each CCR unit in 2015. As further analysis was performed and closure details were developed, Mississippi Power has continued

to periodically update these cost estimates, as discussed further below.

The EPA published certain amendments to the CCR Rule, which became effective August 29, 2018. These amendments extend the date from April 2019 to October 31, 2020 to cease sending CCR and other waste streams to ash ponds that demonstrate compliance with all except two of the specified performance criteria.

On August 21, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a decision suggesting the EPA should regulate previously-excluded inactive ash ponds located at retired generation facilities and questioning both the ability of unlined ash ponds to continue operating no matter the performance criteria results and the classification of clay-lined landfills and ash ponds.

These developments could impact the expected timing of

Mississippi Power's

landfill and ash pond closure activities, but the extent of any impact will depend on the outcome of ongoing litigation, anticipated EPA rulemaking action to establish further guidance, and the outcome of any legal challenges.

During 2018, Mississippi Power recorded increases of approximately $16 million to its AROs related to the CCR Rule. The increases include approximately $11 million based on information from feasibility studies performed on an ash pond at Plant Greene County, which is co-owned with Alabama Power, and approximately $5 million related to increases in post-closure care for Plant Watson's ash pond and landfill. The Alabama Power studies for Plant Greene County indicated that additional closure costs, primarily related to increases in estimated ash volume, water management requirements, and design revisions, will be required to close the ash pond under the planned closure-in-place methodology. As the level of work becomes more defined in the next 12 months, it is likely that these cost estimates will change and the change could be material. Mississippi Power expects to periodically update its ARO cost estimates.

In 2016, the Mississippi PSC granted a CPCN to Mississippi Power authorizing certain projects associated with complying with the CCR Rule. Additionally in this order, the Mississippi PSC also authorized Mississippi Power to recover any costs associated with the CPCN, including future monitoring costs, through the ECO clause. Absent continued recovery of ARO costs through regulated rates, Mississippi Power's results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition could be materially impacted. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations" herein and Note


to the financial statements for additional information regarding Mississippi Power's AROs.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Environmental Remediation

Mississippi Power must comply with environmental laws and regulations governing the handling and disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations, Mississippi Power may also incur substantial costs to clean up affected sites. Mississippi Power has authority from the Mississippi PSC to recover approved environmental compliance costs through established regulatory mechanisms. Mississippi Power recognizes a liability for environmental remediation costs only when it determines a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.

Global Climate Issues

On August 31, 2018, the EPA published a proposed rule known as the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule, which is intended to replace a regulation enacted in 2015 known as the Clean Power Plan (CPP), that would limit CO


emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. The CPP has been stayed by the U.S. Supreme Court since 2016. The ACE Rule would require states to develop GHG unit-specific emission rate standards based on heat-rate efficiency improvements for existing fossil fuel-fired steam units. As proposed, combustion turbines, including natural gas combined cycles, are not affected sources. As of January 1, 2019,

Mississippi Power has ownership interests in six

fossil fuel-fired steam units to which the proposed ACE Rule is applicable. The ultimate impact of this rule to

Mississippi Power

is currently unknown and will depend on changes between the proposal and the final rule, subsequent state plan developments and requirements, and any associated legal challenges.

On December 20, 2018, the EPA published a proposed review of the Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from New, Modified, and Reconstructed Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units final rule (2015 NSPS rule). The EPA's final 2015 NSPS rule set standards of performance for new, modified, and reconstructed electric utility generating units which included stationary combustion turbines and fossil-fired steam boilers. This proposal reduces the stringency of the 2015 NSPS rule by not basing the new and reconstructed fossil-fired steam boiler and IGCC standards on partial carbon capture and sequestration. The impact of any changes to this rule will depend on the content of the final rule and the outcome of any legal challenges.

The EPA's GHG reporting rule requires annual reporting of GHG emissions expressed in terms of metric tons of CO


equivalent emissions for a company's operational control of facilities. Based on ownership or financial control of facilities, Mississippi

Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual Report

Power's


GHG emissions were approximately 8 million metric tons of CO


equivalent. The preliminary estimate of Mississippi Power's


GHG emissions on the same basis is approximately 8 million metric tons of CO


equivalent.

Through 2017, the Southern Company system has achieved an estimated GHG emission reduction of 36% since 2007.

In April 2018, Southern Company established an intermediate goal of a 50% reduction in carbon emissions from 2007 levels by 2030 and a long-term goal of low- to no-carbon operations by 2050. To achieve these goals, the Southern Company system expects to continue growing its renewable energy portfolio, optimize technology advancements to modernize its transmission and distribution systems, increase the use of natural gas for generation,

complete ongoing construction projects,

invest in energy efficiency, and continue research and development efforts focused on technologies to lower GHG emissions. The Southern Company system's ability to achieve these goals also will be dependent on many external factors, including supportive national energy policies, low natural gas prices, and the development, deployment, and advancement of relevant energy technologies.

FERC Matters

Municipal and Rural Associations Tariff

Mississippi Power provides wholesale electric service to Cooperative Energy, East Mississippi Electric Power Association, and the City of Collins, all located in southeastern Mississippi, under a long-term cost-based, FERC-regulated MRA tariff.

In 2016, Mississippi Power reached a settlement agreement with its wholesale customers, which was subsequently approved by the FERC, for an increase in wholesale base revenues under the MRA cost-based electric tariff, primarily as a result of placing scrubbers for Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 in service in 2015. The settlement agreement became effective for services rendered beginning May 1, 2016, resulting in an estimated annual revenue increase of

$7 million

under the MRA cost-based electric tariff. Additionally,

under the settlement agreement, the tariff customers agreed to similar regulatory treatment for MRA tariff ratemaking as the treatment approved for retail ratemaking under the In-Service Asset Rate Order.

This regulatory treatment primarily included (i) recovery of the operational Kemper County energy facility assets providing service to customers and other related costs, (ii) amortization of the Kemper County energy facility-related regulatory assets included in rates under the settlement agreement over the

36 months

ending April 30, 2019, (iii) Kemper County energy facility-related expenses included in rates under the settlement agreement no longer being deferred and charged to expense, and (iv) removing all of the Kemper County energy facility CWIP from rate base with a corresponding increase in accrual of AFUDC, which totaled approximately

$22 million

through the suspension of Kemper IGCC start-up activities.

Mississippi Power expects to reach a subsequent settlement agreement with its wholesale customers and will make a filing with the FERC during the first quarter 2019. The settlement agreement is intended to be consistent with the Kemper Settlement Agreement, including the impact of the Tax Reform Legislation. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

In September 2017, Mississippi Power and Cooperative Energy executed a Shared Service Agreement (SSA), as part of the MRA tariff, under which Mississippi Power and Cooperative Energy will share in providing electricity to all Cooperative Energy delivery points, in lieu of the current arrangement under which each delivery point is specifically assigned to either entity. The SSA accepted by the FERC in October 2017 became effective on January 1, 2018 and may be cancelled by Cooperative Energy with

10 years

notice after December 31, 2020.

The SSA provides Cooperative Energy the option to decrease its use of Mississippi Power's generation services under the MRA tariff, subject to annual and cumulative caps and a

one-year

notice requirement. In the event Cooperative Energy elects to reduce these services, the related reduction in Mississippi Power's revenues is not expected to be significant through 2020.

Fuel Cost Recovery

Mississippi Power has a wholesale MRA and a Market Based (MB) fuel cost recovery factor.

Effective with the first billing cycle for January 2018, fuel rates increased

$11 million

annually for wholesale MRA customers and

$1 million

annually for wholesale MB customers. Effective January 1, 2019, the wholesale MRA fuel rate decreased

$16 million

annually

and the wholesale MB fuel rate decreased by an immaterial amount.

At December 31, 2018, over recovered wholesale MRA fuel costs included in other regulatory liabilities, current on the balance sheet were approximately

$6 million

compared to an immaterial amount at December 31, 2017. Under recovered wholesale MB fuel costs included in the balance sheets were immaterial at December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Mississippi Power's operating revenues are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable fuel cost and amounts billed in accordance with the currently approved cost recovery rate. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor should have no significant effect on Mississippi Power's revenues or net income, but will affect cash flow.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual Report

Open Access Transmission Tariff

On May 10, 2018, AMEA and Cooperative Energy filed with the FERC a complaint against SCS and the traditional electric operating companies

(including Mississippi Power)

claiming that the current

11.25%

base ROE used in calculating the annual transmission revenue requirements of the traditional electric operating companies'

(including Mississippi Power's)

open access transmission tariff is unjust and unreasonable as measured by the applicable FERC standards. The complaint requested that the base ROE be set no higher than

8.65%

and that the FERC order refunds for the difference in revenue requirements that results from applying a just and reasonable ROE established in this proceeding upon determining the current ROE is unjust and unreasonable.

On June 18, 2018, SCS and the traditional electric operating companies

(including Mississippi Power)

filed their response challenging the adequacy of the showing presented by the complainants and offering support for the current ROE. On September 6, 2018, the FERC issued an order establishing a refund effective date of May 10, 2018 in the event a refund is due and initiating an investigation and settlement procedures regarding the current base ROE.

Through December 31, 2018, the estimated maximum potential refund is not expected to be material to

Mississippi Power's

results of operations or cash flows.

The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Cooperative Energy Power Supply Agreement

In 2008, Mississippi Power entered into a


-year power supply agreement (PSA) with Cooperative Energy for approximately 152 MWs, which became effective in 2011. Following certain plant retirements, the PSA capacity was reduced to


MWs. On February 5, 2018, Mississippi Power and Cooperative Energy executed an amendment to extend the PSA through March 31, 2021, effective April 1, 2018, which increased total capacity by 286 MWs.

Cooperative Energy also has a


-year network integration transmission service agreement (NITSA) with SCS for transmission service to certain delivery points on Mississippi Power's transmission system that became effective in 2011. As a result of the PSA amendment, Cooperative Energy and SCS amended the terms of the NITSA, which the FERC approved, to provide for the purchase of incremental transmission capacity for service beginning April 1, 2018 through March 31, 2021.

Retail Regulatory Matters

Mississippi Power's rates and charges for service to retail customers are subject to the regulatory oversight of the Mississippi PSC. Mississippi Power's rates are a combination of base rates and several separate cost recovery clauses for specific categories of costs. These separate cost recovery clauses address such items as fuel and purchased power, energy efficiency programs, ad valorem taxes, property damage, and the costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Costs not addressed through one of the specific cost recovery clauses are expected to be recovered through Mississippi Power's base rates. See Note


to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power" for additional information.

Operations Review

In August 2018, the Mississippi PSC began an operations review of Mississippi Power, for which the final report is expected prior to the conclusion of the

Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case.

Mississippi Power expects that the review will include, but not be limited to, a comparative analysis of its costs, its cost recovery framework, and ways in which it may streamline management operations for the reasonable benefit of ratepayers.

The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Performance Evaluation Plan

Mississippi Power's retail base rates generally are set under the PEP, a rate plan approved by the Mississippi PSC.

Two

filings are made for each calendar year: the PEP projected filing, which is typically filed prior to the beginning of the year based on a projected revenue requirement, and the PEP lookback filing, which is filed after the end of the year and allows for review of the actual revenue requirement compared to the projected filing.

In 2011, Mississippi Power submitted its annual PEP lookback filing for 2010, which recommended no surcharge or refund. Later in 2011, the MPUS disputed certain items

in the 2010 PEP lookback filing. In 2012, the Mississippi PSC issued an order canceling Mississippi Power's PEP lookback filing for 2011.

I

n 2013, the MPUS contested Mississippi Power's PEP lookback filing for 2012, which indicated a refund due to customers of

$5 million

.

In 2014 through 2018, Mississippi Power submitted its annual PEP lookback filings for the prior years, which for each of 2013, 2014, and 2017 indicated no surcharge or refund and for each of 2015 and 2016 indicated a

$5 million

surcharge.

Additionally, in July 2016, in November 2016, and in November 2017, Mississippi Power submitted its annual projected PEP filings for 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively, which for 2016 and 2017 indicated no change in rates and for 2018 indicated a rate increase of

4%

, or

$38 million

in annual revenues. The Mississippi PSC suspended each of these filings to allow more time for review.

II-136


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual Report

On February 7, 2018, Mississippi Power revised its annual projected PEP filing for 2018 to reflect the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. The revised filing requested an increase of

$26 million

in annual revenues, based on a performance adjusted ROE of

9.33%

and an increased equity ratio of

55%

.

On July 27, 2018, Mississippi Power and the MPUS entered into the PEP Settlement Agreement, which was approved by the Mississippi PSC on August 7, 2018. Rates under the PEP Settlement Agreement became effective with the first billing cycle of September 2018. The PEP Settlement Agreement provides for an increase of approximately

$21.6 million

in annual base retail revenues, which excludes certain compensation costs contested by the MPUS, as well as approximately

$2 million

which was subsequently approved for recovery through the 2018 Energy Efficiency Cost Rider as discussed below. Under the PEP Settlement Agreement, Mississippi Power is deferring the contested compensation costs for 2018 and 2019 as a regulatory asset, which totaled

$4 million

as of December 31, 2018 and is included in other regulatory assets, deferred on the balance sheet. The Mississippi PSC is currently expected to rule on the appropriate treatment for such costs in connection with the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Pursuant to the PEP Settlement Agreement, Mississippi Power's performance-adjusted allowed ROE is

9.31%

and its allowed equity ratio is capped at

51%

,

pending further review by the Mississippi PSC. In lieu of the requested equity ratio increase, Mississippi Power retained

$44 million

of excess accumulated deferred income taxes resulting from the Tax Reform Legislation until the conclusion of the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case. Further, Mississippi Power agreed to seek equity contributions sufficient to restore its equity ratio to

50%

by December 31, 2018. Since Mississippi Power's actual average equity ratio for 2018 was more than

1%

lower than the

50%

target, Mississippi Power deferred the corresponding difference in its revenue requirement of approximately

$4 million

as a regulatory liability for resolution in the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case.

Pursuant to the PEP Settlement Agreement, PEP proceedings are suspended until after the conclusion of the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case and Mississippi Power is not required to make any PEP filings for regulatory years 2018, 2019, and 2020. The PEP Settlement Agreement also resolved all open PEP filings with no change to customer rates. As a result, in the third quarter 2018, Mississippi Power recognized revenues of

$5 million

previously reserved in connection with the 2012 PEP lookback filing.

Energy Efficiency

In 2013, the Mississippi PSC approved an energy efficiency and conservation rule requiring electric and gas utilities in Mississippi serving more than

25,000

customers to implement energy efficiency programs and standards. Quick Start Plans, which include a portfolio of energy efficiency programs that are intended to provide benefits to a majority of customers, were extended by an order issued by the Mississippi PSC in July 2016, until the time the Mississippi PSC approves a comprehensive portfolio plan program. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

On May 8, 2018, the Mississippi PSC issued an order approving Mississippi Power's revised annual projected Energy Efficiency Cost Rider 2018 compliance filing, which increased annual retail revenues by approximately

$3 million

effective with the first billing cycle for June 2018.

On February 5, 2019, the Mississippi PSC issued an order approving Mississippi Power's Energy Efficiency Cost Rider 2019 compliance filing, which included a slight decrease in annual retail revenues, effective with the first billing cycle in March 2019.

Environmental Compliance Overview Plan

In accordance with a 2011 accounting order from the Mississippi PSC, Mississippi Power has the authority to defer in a regulatory asset for future recovery all plant retirement- or partial retirement-related costs resulting from environmental regulations.

The Mississippi PSC approved

$41 million

and

$17 million

of costs that were reclassified to regulatory assets associated with the fuel conversion of Plant Watson and Plant Greene County, respectively, for amortization over

five

-year periods that began in July 2016 and July 2017, respectively. As a result, these decisions are not expected to have a material impact on Mississippi Power's financial statements.

In August 2016, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's revised ECO Plan filing for 2016, which requested the maximum

2%

annual increase in revenues, or approximately

$18 million

,

primarily related to the Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 scrubbers placed in service in 2015. The revised rates became effective with the first billing cycle for September 2016. Approximately

$22 million

of related revenue requirements in excess of the

2%

maximum was deferred for inclusion in the 2017 filing, along with related carrying costs.

In May 2017, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's ECO Plan filing for 2017, which requested the maximum

2%

annual increase in revenues, or approximately

$

18 million

, primarily related to the carryforward from the prior year. The rates became effective with the first billing cycle for June 2017. Approximately

$26 million

,

plus carrying costs, of related revenue requirements in excess of the

2%

maximum was deferred for inclusion in the 2018 filing.

II-137


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual Report

On February 14, 2018, Mississippi Power submitted its ECO Plan filing for 2018, including the effects of the Tax Reform Legislation, which requested the maximum

2%

annual increase in revenues, or approximately

$17 million

, primarily related to the carryforward from the prior year.

On August 3, 2018, Mississippi Power and the MPUS entered into the ECO Settlement Agreement, which provides for an increase of approximately

$17 million

in annual base retail revenues and was approved by the Mississippi PSC on August 7, 2018. Rates under the ECO Settlement Agreement became effective with the first billing cycle of September 2018 and will continue in effect until modified by the Mississippi PSC. These revenues are expected to be sufficient to recover the costs included in Mississippi Power's request for 2018, as well as the remaining deferred amounts, totaling

$26 million

at December 31, 2018, along with the related carrying costs

. In accordance with the ECO Settlement Agreement, ECO Plan proceedings are suspended until after the conclusion of the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case and Mississippi Power is not required to make any ECO Plan filings for 2018, 2019, and 2020, with any necessary adjustments to be reflected in the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case. The ECO Settlement Agreement contains the same terms as the PEP Settlement Agreement described herein with respect to allowed ROE and equity ratio. At December 31, 2018, Mississippi Power has recorded

$2 million

in other regulatory liabilities, deferred on the balance sheet related to the actual December 31, 2018 average equity ratio differential from target applicable to the ECO Plan.

Fuel Cost Recovery

Mississippi Power establishes, annually, a retail fuel cost recovery factor that is approved by the Mississippi PSC. Mississippi Power is required to file for an adjustment to the retail fuel cost recovery factor annually. In January 2017, the Mississippi PSC approved the 2017 retail fuel cost recovery factor, effective February 2017 through January 2018, which resulted in an annual revenue increase of

$55 million

.

On January 16, 2018, the Mississippi PSC approved the 2018 retail fuel cost recovery factor, effective February 2018 through January 2019, which resulted in an annual revenue increase of

$39 million

.

At December 31, 2018, the amount of over recovered retail fuel costs included in the balance sheet in other accounts payable was approximately

$8 million

compared to

$6 million

under recovered at December 31, 2017.

On January 10, 2019, the Mississippi PSC approved the 2019 retail fuel cost recovery factor, effective February 2019, which results in a

$35 million

decrease in annual revenues as a result of lower expected fuel costs.

Mississippi Power's operating revenues are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable fuel cost and amounts billed in accordance with the currently approved cost recovery rate. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor should have no significant effect on

Mississippi Power's

revenues or net income but will affect operating cash flows.

Ad Valorem Tax Adjustment

Mississippi Power establishes annually an ad valorem tax adjustment factor that is approved by the Mississippi PSC to collect the ad valorem taxes paid by Mississippi Power. On May 8, 2018, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's annual ad valorem tax adjustment factor filing for 2018, which included a rate increase of

0.8%

,

or

$7 million

, effective with the first billing cycle for June 2018.

Kemper County Energy Facility

Overview

The Kemper County energy facility was designed to utilize IGCC technology with an expected output capacity of

582 MWs and to be fueled by locally mined lignite (an abundant, lower heating value coal) from a mine owned by Mississippi Power and situated adjacent to the Kemper County energy facility. The mine, operated by North American Coal Corporation, started commercial operation in 2013. In connection with the Kemper County energy facility construction, Mississippi Power constructed approximately 61 miles of CO


pipeline infrastructure for the transport of captured CO


for use in enhanced oil recovery.

Schedule and Cost Estimate

In 2012, the Mississippi PSC issued an order (2012 MPSC CPCN Order), confirming the CPCN originally approved by the Mississippi PSC in 2010 authorizing the acquisition, construction, and operation of the Kemper County energy facility. The certificated cost estimate of the Kemper County energy facility included in the 2012 MPSC CPCN Order was

$2.4 billion

,

net of approximately

$0.57 billion

in Cost Cap Exceptions. The 2012 MPSC CPCN Order approved a construction cost cap of up to

$2.88 billion

,

with recovery of prudently-incurred costs subject to approval by the Mississippi PSC. The Kemper County energy facility was originally projected to be placed in service in May 2014. Mississippi Power placed the combined cycle and the associated common facilities portion of the Kemper County energy facility in service in August 2014. The combined cycle and associated common facilities portions of the Kemper County energy facility were dedicated as Plant Ratcliffe on April 27, 2018.

II-138


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual Report

On June 21, 2017, the Mississippi PSC stated its intent to issue an order, which occurred on July 6, 2017, directing Mississippi Power to pursue a settlement under which the Kemper County energy facility would be operated as a natural gas plant, rather than an IGCC plant, and address all issues associated with the Kemper County energy facility. The order established the Kemper Settlement Docket. On June 28, 2017, Mississippi Power notified the Mississippi PSC that it would begin a process to suspend operations and start-up activities on the gasifier portion of the Kemper County energy facility, given the uncertainty as to its future.

At the time of project suspension in June 2017, the total cost estimate for the Kemper County energy facility was approximately

$7.38 billion

,

including approximately

$5.95 billion

of costs subject to the construction cost cap, and was net of the

$137 million

in additional grants from the DOE received in April 2016 (Additional DOE Grants). In the aggregate, Mississippi Power had recorded charges to income of

$3.07 billion

(

$1.89 billion

after tax) as a result of changes in the cost estimate above the cost cap for the Kemper IGCC through May 31, 2017.

Given the Mississippi PSC's stated intent regarding no further rate increase for the Kemper County energy facility and the subsequent suspension, cost recovery of the gasifier portions became no longer probable; therefore, Mississippi Power recorded an additional charge to income in June 2017 of

$2.8 billion

(

$2.0 billion

after tax), which included estimated costs associated with the gasification portions of the plant and lignite mine. During the third and fourth quarters of 2017, Mississippi Power recorded charges to income of

$242 million

(

$206 million

after tax), including

$164 million for ongoing project costs, estimated mine and gasifier-related costs, and certain termination costs during the suspension period prior to conclusion of the Kemper Settlement Docket, as well as the charge associated with the Kemper Settlement Agreement discussed below.

In 2018, Mississippi Power recorded pre-tax charges to income of

$37 million

(

$27 million

after tax), primarily resulting from the abandonment and related closure activities and ongoing period costs, net of sales proceeds, for the mine and gasifier-related assets at the Kemper County energy facility. In addition, Mississippi Power recorded a credit to earnings of

$95 million

in the fourth quarter 2018 primarily resulting from the reduction of a valuation allowance for a state income tax

NOL

carryforward associated with the Kemper County energy facility. Additional closure costs for the mine and gasifier-related assets, currently estimated at up to

$10 million

pre-tax

(excluding salvage, net of dismantlement costs), may be incurred through the first half of 2020.

In addition, period costs, including, but not limited to, costs for compliance and safety, ARO accretion, and property taxes for the mine and gasifier-related assets, are estimated to total

$11 million

in 2019 and

$2 million

to

$4 million

annually in 2020 through 2023. Mississippi Power is currently evaluating its options regarding the final disposition of the CO


pipeline, including removal of the pipeline. This evaluation is expected to be complete later in 2019. If Mississippi Power ultimately decides to remove the CO


pipeline, the cost of removal would have a material impact on

Mississippi Power's financial statements.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

See Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.

Rate Recovery

Kemper Settlement Agreement

In 2015, the Mississippi PSC issued the In-Service Asset Rate Order regarding the Kemper County energy facility assets that were commercially operational and providing service to customers (the transmission facilities, combined cycle, natural gas pipeline, and water pipeline) and other related costs. The In-Service Asset Rate Order provided for retail rate recovery of an annual revenue requirement of approximately $126 million which went into effect on December 17, 2015.

On February 6, 2018, the Mississippi PSC voted to approve the Kemper Settlement Agreement, which resolved all cost recovery issues, modified the CPCN to limit the Kemper County energy facility to natural gas combined cycle operation, and provided for an annual revenue requirement of approximately $99.3 million for costs related to the Kemper County energy facility, which included the impact of the Tax Reform Legislation. The revenue requirement is based on (i) a fixed ROE for 2018 of 8.6% excluding any performance adjustment, (ii) a ROE for 2019 calculated in accordance with PEP, excluding the performance adjustment, (iii) for future years, a performance-based ROE calculated pursuant to PEP, and (iv) amortization periods for the related regulatory assets and liabilities of eight years and six years, respectively. The revenue requirement also reflects a disallowance related to a portion of Mississippi Power's investment in the Kemper County energy facility requested for inclusion in rate base, which was recorded in the fourth quarter 2017 as an additional charge to income of approximately $78 million ($85 million net of accumulated depreciation of $7 million) pre-tax ($48 million after tax).

Under the Kemper Settlement Agreement, retail customer rates reflect a reduction of approximately $26.8 million annually, effective with the first billing cycle of April 2018, and include no recovery for costs associated with the gasifier portion of the Kemper County energy facility in 2018 or at any future date.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual Report

Reserve Margin Plan

On August 6, 2018, Mississippi Power filed its proposed Reserve Margin Plan (RMP), as required by the Mississippi PSC's order in the Kemper Settlement Docket. Under the RMP, Mississippi Power proposed alternatives that would reduce its reserve margin, with the most economic of the alternatives being the

two-year and seven-year

acceleration of the retirement of Plant Watson Units 4 and 5, respectively, to the first quarter 2022 and the

four

-year acceleration of the retirement of Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 to the third quarter 2021 and the third quarter 2022, respectively, in order to lower or avoid operating costs. The Plant Greene County unit retirements would require the completion by Alabama Power of proposed transmission and system reliability improvements, as well as agreement by Alabama Power. The RMP filing also states that, in the event the Mississippi PSC ultimately approves an alternative that includes an accelerated retirement, Mississippi Power would require authorization to defer in a regulatory asset for future recovery the remaining net book value of the units at the time of retirement. A decision by the Mississippi PSC that does not include recovery of the remaining book value of any generating units retired could have a material impact on

Mississippi Power's

financial statements. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Lignite Mine and CO


Pipeline Facilities

Mississippi Power owns the lignite mine and equipment and mineral reserves located around the Kemper County energy facility site. The mine started commercial operation in June 2013.

In 2010, Mississippi Power executed a


-year management fee contract with Liberty Fuels Company, LLC (Liberty Fuels), a wholly-owned subsidiary of The North American Coal Corporation, which developed, constructed, and is responsible for the mining operations through the end of the mine reclamation. As the mining permit holder, Liberty Fuels has a legal obligation to perform mine reclamation and Mississippi Power has a contractual obligation to fund all reclamation activities. As a result of the abandonment of the Kemper IGCC, final mine reclamation began in 2018 and is expected to be substantially completed in 2020, with monitoring expected to continue through 2027. See Note 6

to the financial statements and Note 7 to the financial statements

under "Mississippi Power" for additional information.

In addition, Mississippi Power constructed the CO


pipeline for the planned transport of captured CO


for use in enhanced oil recovery and entered into an agreement with Denbury Onshore (Denbury) to purchase the captured CO


. The agreement with Denbury was terminated in December 2018 and did not have a material impact on Mississippi Power's results of operations. Mississippi Power is currently evaluating its options regarding the final disposition of the CO


pipeline, including removal of the pipeline. This evaluation is expected to be complete later in 2019. If Mississippi Power ultimately decides to remove the CO


pipeline, the cost of removal would have a material impact on Mississippi Power's financial statements. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

For additional information on the Kemper County energy facility, see Note


to the financial statements under "

Mississippi Power

–

Kemper County Energy Facility

."

Government Grants

In 2010, the DOE, through a cooperative agreement with SCS, agreed to fund

$270 million

of the Kemper County energy facility through the grants awarded to the project by the DOE under the Clean Coal Power Initiative Round 2. Through December 31, 2018, Mississippi Power received total DOE grants of

$387 million

, of which

$382 million

reduced the construction costs of the Kemper County energy facility and

$5 million

reimbursed Mississippi Power for expenses associated with DOE reporting.

On December 12, 2018, Mississippi Power filed with the DOE its request for property closeout certification under the contract related to the

grants received. Mississippi Power and the DOE are currently in discussions regarding the requested closeout and property disposition, which may require payment to the DOE for a portion of certain property that is to be retained by Mississippi Power. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time; however, it could have a

material impact on Mississippi Power's financial statements.

Income Tax Matters

Federal Tax Reform Legislation

In December 2017, the Tax Reform Legislation was signed into law and became effective on January 1, 2018. The Tax Reform Legislation, among other things, reduced the federal corporate income tax rate to 21%, retained normalization provisions for public utility property and existing renewable energy incentives, and repealed the corporate alternative minimum tax. In addition, under the Tax Reform Legislation, NOLs generated after December 31, 2017 can no longer be carried back to previous tax years but can be carried forward indefinitely, with utilization limited to 80% of taxable income of the subsequent tax year. The projected reduction of Southern Company's consolidated income tax liability resulting from the tax rate reduction also delays the expected

utilization of existing tax credit carryforwards. See Note


to the financial statements for information on Southern Company's joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement.

Following the enactment of the Tax Reform Legislation, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 – "Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" (SAB 118), which provided for a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date to complete accounting under GAAP for the tax effects of the legislation. Due to the complex and comprehensive nature of the enacted tax law changes and their application under GAAP, Mississippi Power considered all amounts recorded in the financial statements as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation "provisional" as discussed in SAB 118 and subject to revision prior to filing its 2017 tax return in the fourth quarter 2018. Mississippi Power recognized tax expense of $372 million in 2017. Following the filing of its 2017 tax return, Mississippi Power recorded tax benefits of $35 million to adjust the provisional amount for a total net tax expense of $337 million as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation. In addition, in total, Mississippi Power recorded an $11 million increase in regulatory assets and a $395 million increase in regulatory liabilities as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation and $1 million of stranded excess deferred tax balances in AOCI at December 31, 2017 were adjusted through retained earnings in 2018. As of December 31, 2018, Mississippi Power considered the measurement of impacts from the Tax Reform Legislation on deferred income tax assets and liabilities, primarily due to the impact of the reduction of the corporate income tax rate, to be complete.

However, the IRS continues to issue regulations that provide further interpretation and guidance on the law and each state's adoption of the provisions contained in the Tax Reform Legislation remains uncertain. In addition, the regulatory treatment of certain impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation is subject to the discretion of the FERC and the Mississippi PSC. The ultimate impact of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note


to the financial statements for additional information regarding the PEP Settlement Agreement and the ECO Settlement Agreement, which reflect certain impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. Also see FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Credit Rating Risk" herein and Note


to the financial statements under "Current and Deferred Income Taxes" for additional information.

Bonus Depreciation

Under the Tax Reform Legislation, projects with binding contracts prior to September 28, 2017 and placed in service after September 27, 2017 remain eligible for bonus depreciation under the PATH Act. The PATH Act allowed for 50% bonus depreciation for 2015 through 2017, 40% bonus depreciation for 2018, and 30% bonus depreciation for 2019 and certain long-lived assets placed in service in 2020. Based on provisional estimates, bonus depreciation is expected to result in positive cash flows of approximately $10 million for the 2018 tax year and Mississippi Power does not expect material positive cash flows from bonus depreciation for the 2019 tax year. See Note


to the financial statements under "Current and Deferred Income Taxes" for additional information. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Other Matters

Mississippi Power is involved in various other matters being litigated and regulatory matters that could affect future earnings. In addition, Mississippi Power is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. Mississippi Power's business activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the environment, such as laws and regulations governing air, water, land, and protection of other natural resources. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, has occurred throughout the U.S. This litigation has included claims for damages alleged to have been caused by CO


and other emissions, CCR, and alleged exposure to hazardous materials, and/or requests for injunctive relief in connection with such matters.

The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation or regulatory matters cannot be predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically reported herein or in Notes


and


to the financial statements, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings would have a material effect on Mississippi Power's financial statements. See Notes


and


to the financial statements for a discussion of various other contingencies, regulatory matters, and other matters being litigated which may affect future earnings potential.

To mitigate customer rate impacts associated with rising costs and declining sales, Mississippi Power management approved an employee attrition plan on July 13, 2018. In 2018, Mississippi Power recorded $16 million in expenses related to this plan.

On October 2, 2018, the Mississippi PSC approved the executed agreements between Mississippi Power and its largest retail customer, Chevron, for Mississippi Power to continue providing retail service to the Chevron refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi through 2038. The new agreements are not expected to have a material impact on earnings.

In conjunction with Southern Company's sale of Gulf Power, Mississippi Power and Gulf Power have committed to seek a restructuring of their 50% undivided ownership interests in Plant Daniel such that each of them would, after the restructuring,

II-141

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual Report

own 100% of a generating unit. On January 15, 2019, Gulf Power provided notice to Mississippi Power that Gulf Power will retire its share of the generating capacity of Plant Daniel on January 15, 2024. Mississippi Power has the option to purchase Gulf Power's ownership interest for $1 on January 15, 2024, provided that Mississippi Power exercises the option no later than 120 days prior to that date. Mississippi Power is assessing the potential operational and economic effects of Gulf Power's notice. The ultimate outcome of these matters remains subject to completion of Mississippi Power's evaluations and applicable regulatory approvals, including the FERC and the Mississippi PSC, and cannot now be determined. See Note


to the financial statements under "

Southern Company's Sale of Gulf Power

" for information regarding the sale of Gulf Power.

Litigation

On May 18, 2018, Southern Company and Mississippi Power received a notice of dispute and arbitration demand filed by Martin Product Sales, LLC (Martin) based on two agreements, both related to Kemper IGCC byproducts for which Mississippi Power provided termination notices in September 2017. Martin alleges breach of contract, breach of good faith and fair dealing, fraud and misrepresentation, and civil conspiracy and makes a claim for damages in the amount of approximately

$143 million

,

as well as additional unspecified damages, attorney's fees, costs, and interest.

In the first quarter 2019, Mississippi Power and Southern Company filed motions to dismiss.

On November 21, 2018, Ray C. Turnage and


other individual plaintiffs filed a putative class action complaint against Mississippi Power and the three current members of the Mississippi PSC in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. Mississippi Power received Mississippi PSC approval in 2013 to charge a mirror CWIP rate premised upon including in its rate base pre-construction and construction costs for the Kemper IGCC prior to placing the Kemper IGCC into service. The Mississippi Supreme Court reversed that approval and ordered Mississippi Power to refund the amounts paid by customers under the previously-approved mirror CWIP rate. The plaintiffs allege that the initial approval process, and the amount approved, were improper. They also allege that Mississippi Power underpaid customers in the refund process because it applied the wrong interest rate to the payments. The plaintiffs seek to recover, on behalf of themselves and their putative class, actual damages, punitive damages, pre-judgment interest, post-judgment interest, attorney's fees, and costs.

Mississippi Power believes these legal challenges have no merit; however, an adverse outcome in either of these proceedings could have a material impact on Mississippi Power's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Mississippi Power will vigorously defend itself in these matters, the ultimate outcome of which cannot be determined at this time.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Mississippi Power prepares its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Significant accounting policies are described in Notes


,


, and


to the financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may have a material impact on Mississippi Power's results of operations and related disclosures. Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those recorded in the financial statements. Senior management has reviewed and discussed the following critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors.

Utility Regulation

Mississippi Power is subject to retail regulation by the Mississippi PSC and wholesale regulation by the FERC. These regulatory agencies set the rates Mississippi Power is permitted to charge customers based on allowable costs. As a result, Mississippi Power applies accounting standards which require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the ratemaking process, the regulators may require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when they would be recognized by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of expenses and the recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery through rates or the deferral of gains or creation of liabilities and the recording of related regulatory liabilities. The application of the accounting standards has a further effect on Mississippi Power's financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from those actually incurred by Mississippi Power; therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation and pension and other postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on Mississippi Power's results of operations and financial condition than they would on a non-regulated company.

As reflected in Note


to the financial statements under "

Mississippi Power

–

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

," significant regulatory assets and liabilities have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of these regulatory assets and any requirement to refund these regulatory liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines and GAAP. However, adverse

II-142


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual Report

legislative, judicial, or regulatory actions could materially impact the amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could adversely impact Mississippi Power's financial statements.

Kemper County Energy Facility Closure Costs

For periods prior to the second quarter 2017, significant accounting estimates included Kemper County energy facility estimated construction costs, project completion date, and rate recovery. In the aggregate, Mississippi Power had recorded charges to income of $3.07 billion ($1.89 billion after tax) as a result of changes in the cost estimate above the cost cap for the Kemper IGCC through May 31, 2017, of which $305 million ($188 million after tax) occurred in 2017 and $428 million ($264 million after tax) occurred in 2016.

On June 21, 2017, the Mississippi PSC stated its intent to issue an order (which occurred on July 6, 2017) directing Mississippi Power to pursue a settlement under which the Kemper County energy facility would be operated as a natural gas plant rather than an IGCC plant; therefore, Mississippi Power suspended the operation and start-up of the gasifier portion of the Kemper County energy facility on June 28, 2017.

As a result of these events, cost recovery of the gasification portions became no longer probable; therefore, Mississippi Power recorded an additional charge to income in June 2017 of $2.8 billion ($2.0 billion after tax), which included estimated costs associated with the gasification portions of the plant and lignite mine. During the third and fourth quarters of 2017, Mississippi Power recorded charges to income of $242 million ($206 million after tax), including $164 million for ongoing project costs, estimated mine and gasifier-related costs, and certain termination costs during the suspension period prior to conclusion of the Kemper Settlement Docket, as well as a charge of $78 million associated with the Kemper Settlement Agreement. The estimated construction costs and project completion date were no longer considered significant accounting estimates for 2017 following the suspension and related charges to earnings. In addition, the Kemper Settlement Agreement was approved by the Mississippi PSC on February 6, 2018 and resolved all related cost recovery issues.

In 2018, Mississippi Power recorded pre-tax charges to income of

$37 million

(

$27 million

after tax), primarily resulting from the abandonment and related closure activities and ongoing period costs, net of sales proceeds, for the mine and gasifier-related assets at the Kemper County energy facility. Additional closure costs for the mine and gasifier-related assets, currently estimated at up to

$10 million

pre-tax

(excluding salvage, net of dismantlement costs), may be incurred through the first half of 2020.

During the fourth quarter 2018, Mississippi Power began evaluating its options regarding the final disposition of the CO


pipeline, including removal of the pipeline. This evaluation is expected to be complete later in 2019. If Mississippi Power ultimately decides to remove the CO


pipeline, the cost of removal would have a material impact on Mississippi Power's financial statements. In addition, in December 2018, Mississippi Power filed with the DOE its request for property closeout certification under the contract related to the grants received. Mississippi Power and the DOE are currently in discussions regarding the requested closeout and property disposition, which may require payment to the DOE for a portion of certain property that is to be retained by Mississippi Power and could have a material impact on Mississippi Power's financial statements. Given the significant judgment and uncertainty involved in estimating these remaining costs associated with the abandonment and closure activities for the mine and gasifier-related assets at the Kemper County energy facility, Mississippi Power considers the related liabilities to be critical accounting estimates.

See Note


to the financial statements under "Kemper County Energy Facility" for additional information. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Asset Retirement Obligations

AROs are computed as the fair value of the estimated costs for an asset's future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The estimated costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. In the absence of quoted market prices, AROs are estimated using present value techniques in which estimates of future cash outlays associated with the asset retirements are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Estimates of the timing and amounts of future cash outlays are based on projections of when and how the assets will be retired and the cost of future removal activities.

The liability for AROs primarily relates to facilities that are subject to the CCR Rule, principally ash ponds. In addition, Mississippi Power has AROs related to various landfill sites, underground storage tanks, water wells, mine reclamation, and asbestos removal.

Mississippi Power also has identified retirement obligations related to certain transmission and distribution facilities and certain wireless communication towers. However, liabilities for the removal of these assets have not been recorded because the settlement timing for the retirement obligations related to these assets is indeterminable and, therefore, the fair value of the retirement obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. A liability for these retirement obligations will be recognized when sufficient

II-143


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual Report

information becomes available to support a reasonable estimation of the retirement obligation. In 2018, Mississippi Power incurred $16 million in ARO revisions, including $11 million at Plant Greene County, which is co-owned with Alabama Power.

The cost estimates for AROs related to the disposal of CCR are based on information using various assumptions related to closure and post-closure costs, timing of future cash outlays, inflation and discount rates, and the potential methods for complying with the CCR Rule requirements for closure. Mississippi Power expects to periodically update its ARO cost estimates. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and Regulations – Coal Combustion Residuals" herein and Note


to the financial statements for additional information.

Given the significant judgment involved in estimating AROs, Mississippi Power considers the liabilities for AROs to be critical accounting estimates.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Mississippi Power's calculation of pension and other postretirement benefits expense is dependent on a number of assumptions. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected long-term return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary and wage increases, and other factors. Components of pension and other postretirement benefits expense include interest and service cost on the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, expected return on plan assets, and amortization of certain unrecognized costs and obligations. Actual results that differ from the assumptions utilized are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While Mississippi Power believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect its pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations.

Key elements in determining Mississippi Power's pension and other postretirement benefit expense are the expected long-term return on plan assets and the discount rate used to measure the benefit plan obligations and the periodic benefit plan expense for future periods. The expected long-term return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets is based on Southern Company's investment strategy, historical experience, and expectations for long-term rates of return that consider external actuarial advice. Southern Company determines the long-term return on plan assets by applying the long-term rate of expected returns on various asset classes to Southern Company's target asset allocation. For purposes of determining Mississippi Power's liability related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, Southern Company discounts the future related cash flows using a single-point discount rate developed from the weighted average of market-observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to expected benefit payments.

A 25 basis point change in any significant assumption (discount rate, salary increases, or long-term rate of return on plan assets) would result in a $1 million or less change in total annual benefit expense, a $19 million or less change in the projected obligation for the pension plan, and a $2 million or less change in the projected obligation for other post retirement benefit plans.

See Note


to the financial statements for additional information regarding pension and other postretirement benefits.

Contingent Obligations

Mississippi Power is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations as well as other factors and conditions that subject it to environmental, litigation, and other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Notes


and


to the financial statements for more information regarding certain of these contingencies. Mississippi Power periodically evaluates its exposure to such risks and records reserves for those matters where a non-tax-related loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable. The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or conditions that can be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially affect Mississippi Power's results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

Earnings for all periods presented were negatively affected by charges associated with the Kemper IGCC. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Kemper County Energy Facility" herein and Note


to the financial statements for additional information.

Mississippi Power's financial condition remained stable at December 31, 2018. Mississippi Power's cash requirements primarily consist of funding ongoing operations, common stock dividends, capital expenditures, and debt maturities. Capital expenditures and other investing activities include investments to maintain existing generation facilities, to comply with environmental regulations including adding environmental modifications to certain existing generating units and closures of ash ponds, to expand and improve transmission and distribution facilities, and for restoration following major storms. Operating cash flows provide a substantial portion of Mississippi Power's cash needs. For the three-year period from 2019 through 2021, Mississippi Power's projected common stock dividends, capital expenditures, and debt maturities are expected to exceed operating cash flows. Mississippi Power plans to finance future cash needs in excess of its operating cash flows primarily through external securities issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, including commercial paper to the extent Mississippi Power is eligible to participate, and equity contributions from Southern Company. Mississippi Power intends to continue to monitor its access to short-term and long-term capital markets as well as its bank credit arrangements to meet future capital and liquidity needs. See "Sources of Capital," "Financing Activities," and "Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations" herein for additional information.

Mississippi Power's investments in the qualified pension plan decreased in value as of December 31, 2018 as compared to December 31, 2017. No contributions to the qualified pension plan were made for the year ended December 31, 2018 and no mandatory contributions to the qualified pension plan are anticipated during 2019. See Note


to the financial statements under "Pension Plans" for additional information.

Net cash provided from operating activities totaled

$804 million

for 2018, an increase of $301 million as compared to 2017. The increase in cash provided from operating activities in 2018 was primarily related to increased income tax refunds in 2018 primarily related to the tax abandonment of the Kemper IGCC. Net cash provided from operating activities totaled

$503 million

for 2017, an increase of $274 million as compared to 2016. The increase in cash provided from operating activities in 2017 was primarily due to tax refunds associated with the Section 174 R&E settlement, largely offset by a decrease in income taxes related to the Kemper County energy facility and the Tax Reform Legislation.

Net cash used for investing activities in 2018, 2017, and 2016 totaled

$232 million

,

$504 million

, and

$697 million

, respectively. The cash used for investing activities in 2018 was primarily due to gross property additions related to other production, distribution, transmission, and steam production. The cash used for investing activities in 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to gross property additions related to the Kemper County energy facility. The cash used for investing activities in 2016 was partially offset by the receipt of Additional DOE Grants.

Net cash used for financing activities totaled

$527 million

in 2018 primarily due to redemption of preferred stock, long-term debt, short-term borrowings, and senior notes, partially offset by the issuance of senior notes and short-term borrowings. Net cash provided from financing activities totaled

$25 million

in 2017 primarily from capital contributions from Southern Company, largely offset by redemptions of long-term debt and short-term borrowings. Net cash provided from financing activities totaled $594 million in 2016 primarily due to long-term debt financings and capital contributions from Southern Company, partially offset by a decrease in short-term borrowings and redemptions of long-term debt.

Significant balance sheet changes in 2018 included increases of $442 million in long-term debt primarily due to the issuance of senior notes, a net change of $475 million in accumulated deferred income taxes primarily due to the tax abandonment of the

II-145

Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual Report

Kemper IGCC, and a decrease of $949 million in securities due within one year primarily due to the repayment of a $900 million unsecured term loan. See "

Financing Activities

" herein and Notes


and


to the financial statements for additional information.

Mississippi Power's ratio of common equity to total capitalization plus short-term debt was 50% and 39% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase was primarily due to repayment of debt obligations in 2018. See Note


to the financial statements for additional information.

Sources of Capital

Mississippi Power plans to obtain the funds to meet its future capital needs from operating cash flows, external securities issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, including commercial paper to the extent Mississippi Power is eligible to participate, and equity contributions from Southern Company. However, the amount, type, and timing of any future financing, if needed, will depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory approval, and other factors.

The issuance of securities by Mississippi Power is subject to regulatory approval by the FERC. Additionally, with respect to the public offering of securities, Mississippi Power files registration statements with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The amounts of securities authorized by the FERC, as well as the securities registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, are continuously monitored and appropriate filings are made to ensure flexibility in raising capital. Any future financing through secured debt would also require approval by the Mississippi PSC.

Mississippi Power obtains financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. See Note


to the financial statements under "Bank Credit Arrangements" for additional information. The Southern Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of Mississippi Power are not commingled with funds of any other company in the Southern Company system.

Mississippi Power's current liabilities sometimes exceed current assets because of long-term debt maturities and the periodic use of short-term debt as a funding source, as well as significant seasonal fluctuations in cash needs. At

December 31, 2018

, Mississippi Power had approximately

$293 million

of cash and cash equivalents. Committed credit arrangements with banks at

December 31, 2018

were $100 million, all of which is unused. In October 2018, Mississippi Power amended its one-year credit arrangements in an aggregate amount of $100 million to extend the maturity dates from 2018 to 2019.

See Note


to the financial statements under "Bank Credit Arrangements" for additional information.

All of these bank credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels and typically contain cross acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) of Mississippi Power. Such cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if Mississippi Power defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. At December 31, 2018, Mississippi Power was in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowing.

Subject to applicable market conditions, Mississippi Power expects to renew or replace its credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Mississippi Power may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder.

A portion of the $100 million unused credit arrangements with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to Mississippi Power's revenue bonds. The amount of variable rate revenue bonds outstanding requiring liquidity support at

December 31, 2018

was approximately $40 million.

Short-term borrowings are included in notes payable in the balance sheets. Details of short-term borrowing were as follows:

(*)

Average and maximum amounts are based upon daily balances during the 12-month periods ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.

II-146

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual Report

Mississippi Power believes the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit, short-term bank notes, commercial paper to the extent Mississippi Power is eligible to participate, and operating cash flows.

Financing Activities

In March 2018, Mississippi Power issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of Series 2018A Floating Rate Senior Notes due March 27, 2020 bearing interest based on three-month LIBOR and $300 million aggregate principal amount of Series 2018B 3.95% Senior Notes due March 30, 2028. In March 2018, Mississippi Power also entered into a $300 million short-term floating rate bank loan bearing interest based on one-month LIBOR, of which $200 million was repaid in the second quarter 2018 and $100 million was repaid in the third quarter 2018. Mississippi Power used the proceeds from these financings to repay a $900 million unsecured floating rate term loan.

In July 2018, Mississippi Power purchased and held approximately $43 million aggregate principal amount of Mississippi Business Finance Corporation Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2002. Mississippi Power may reoffer these bonds to the public at a later date.

In October 2018, Mississippi Power completed the redemption of all 334,210 outstanding shares of its preferred stock (as well as related depositary shares), with an aggregate par value of approximately $33.4 million; all $30 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its Series G 5.40% Senior Notes due July 1, 2035; and all $125 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its Series 2009A 5.55% Senior Notes due March 1, 2019.

In December 2018, Southern Company made equity contributions totaling $17 million to Mississippi Power.

In addition to any financings that may be necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual obligations, Mississippi Power plans, when economically feasible, to retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit.

Credit Rating Risk

At

December 31, 2018

, Mississippi Power does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade.

On October 2, 2018, the Mississippi PSC approved executed agreements between Mississippi Power and its largest retail customer, Chevron

, for Mississippi Power to continue providing retail service to the Chevron refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi through 2038. The agreements grant Chevron a security interest in the co-generation assets, with a net book value of approximately

$101 million

at

December 31, 2018

, located at the refinery that is exercisable upon the occurrence of (i) certain bankruptcy events or (ii) other events of default coupled with specific reductions in steam output at the facility and a downgrade of Mississippi Power's credit rating to below investment grade by two of the three rating agencies.

There are certain contracts that have required or could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change to BBB and/or Baa2 or below. These contracts are for physical electricity purchases and sales, fuel transportation and storage, energy price risk management, and transmission. At

December 31, 2018

, the maximum potential collateral requirements at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3 equaled approximately $283 million.

Included in these amounts are certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that either Alabama Power or Georgia Power (affiliate companies of Mississippi Power) has a credit rating change to below investment grade. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. Additionally, a credit rating downgrade could impact the ability of Mississippi Power to access capital markets and would be likely to impact the cost at which it does so.

On February 26, 2018, Moody's revised its rating outlook for Mississippi Power from stable to positive. On August 8, 2018, Moody's upgraded Mississippi Power's senior unsecured rating to Baa3 from Ba1 and maintained the positive rating outlook.

On February 28, 2018, Fitch removed Mississippi Power from rating watch negative and revised its rating outlook from stable to positive.

On March 14, 2018, S&P upgraded the senior unsecured long-term debt rating of Mississippi Power to A- from BBB+. The outlook remained negative.

As a result of the Tax Reform Legislation, certain financial metrics, such as the funds from operations to debt percentage, used by the credit rating agencies to assess Southern Company and its subsidiaries, including Mississippi Power, may be negatively impacted. The PEP Settlement Agreement is expected to help mitigate these potential adverse impacts by allowing Mississippi Power to retain the excess deferred taxes resulting from the Tax Reform Legislation until the conclusion of the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case. In addition, Mississippi Power has committed to seek equity contributions sufficient to restore its equity ratio to the 50% target. See Note


to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power" for additional information.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual Report

Market Price Risk

Due to cost-based rate regulation and other various cost recovery mechanisms, Mississippi Power continues to have limited exposure to market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity. To manage the volatility attributable to these exposures, Mississippi Power nets the exposures, where possible, to take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to Mississippi Power's policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and risk management practices. Mississippi Power's policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques that include, but are not limited to, market valuation, value at risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis.

To mitigate future exposure to a change in interest rates, Mississippi Power may enter into derivatives that have been designated as hedges. The weighted average interest rate on $340 million of long-term variable interest rate exposure at

December 31, 2018

was 3.32%. If Mississippi Power sustained a 100 basis point change in interest rates for all long-term variable interest rate exposure, the change would have an immaterial effect on annualized interest expense at

December 31, 2018

. See Note


to the financial statements under "Financial Instruments" and Note


to the financial statements for additional information.

To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, Mississippi Power enters into physical fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity market and, to a lesser extent, financial hedge contracts for natural gas purchases. Mississippi Power continues to manage retail fuel-hedging programs implemented per the guidelines of the Mississippi PSC and wholesale fuel-hedging programs under agreements with wholesale customers. Mississippi Power had no material change in market risk exposure for the year ended

December 31, 2018

when compared to the year ended

December 31, 2017

.

The changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts are substantially attributable to both the volume and the price of natural gas. For the years ended December 31, the changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts, the majority of which are composed of regulatory hedges, were as follows:

(*)

Current period changes also include the changes in fair value of new contracts entered into during the period, if any.

The net hedge volumes of energy-related derivative contracts at

December 31, 2018

and


were as follows:

For natural gas hedges, the weighted average swap contract cost above market prices was approximately $0.10 per mmBtu at

December 31, 2018

and $0.14 per mmBtu at

December 31, 2017

. The options outstanding were immaterial for the reporting periods presented. The costs associated with natural gas hedges are recovered through Mississippi Power's ECM clause.

At

December 31, 2018

and


, substantially all of Mississippi Power's energy-related derivative contracts were designated as regulatory hedges and were related to Mississippi Power's fuel-hedging program. Therefore, gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense as they are recovered through the ECM clause.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual Report

Mississippi Power uses over-the-counter contracts that are not exchange traded but are fair valued using prices which are market observable, and thus fall into Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. See Note


to the financial statements for further discussion of fair value measurements. The maturities of the energy-related derivative contracts, which are all Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, at

December 31, 2018

were as follows:

Mississippi Power is exposed to market price risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the energy-related derivative contracts. Mississippi Power only enters into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody's and S&P or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. Therefore, Mississippi Power does not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the counterparties. For additional information, see Note


to the financial statements under "Financial Instruments" and Note


to the financial statements.

Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations

The construction program of Mississippi Power is currently estimated to total $222 million for


, $230 million for


, $216 million for


, $220 million for 2022, and $184 million for 2023. The construction program includes capital expenditures covered under LTSAs. Estimated capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations included in these amounts are $18 million, $20 million, $17 million, $5 million, and $13 million for


,


,


, 2022, and 2023, respectively. These estimated expenditures do not include any potential compliance costs associated with pending regulation of CO


emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and Regulations" and "– Global Climate Issues" herein for additional information.

Mississippi Power also anticipates costs associated with closure and monitoring of ash ponds in accordance with the CCR Rule, which are reflected in Mississippi Power's ARO liabilities. These costs, which are expected to change and could change materially as underlying assumptions are refined and the cost and the method and timing of compliance activities continue to be evaluated, are currently estimated to be $9 million, $9 million, $12 million, $14 million, and $15 million for the years


,


,


, 2022, and 2023, respectively. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and Regulations – Coal Combustion Residuals" herein and Note


to the financial statements for additional information.

The construction program is subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions; changes in load projections; storm impacts; changes in environmental laws and regulations; the outcome of any legal challenges to environmental rules; changes in generating plants, including unit retirements and replacements and adding or changing fuel sources at existing electric generating units, to meet regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules and regulations; Mississippi PSC approvals; changes in the expected environmental compliance program; changes in legislation; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered.

In addition, as discussed in Note


to the financial statements, Mississippi Power provides postretirement benefits to substantially all employees and funds trusts to the extent required by the FERC.

Funding requirements related to obligations associated with scheduled maturities of long-term debt, as well as the related interest, derivative obligations, pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, leases, other purchase commitments, and ARO settlements are detailed in the contractual obligations table that follows.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

OVERVIEW

Business Activities

Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Power continually seeks opportunities to execute its strategy to create value through various transactions including acquisitions, dispositions, and sales of partnership interests, development and construction of new generating facilities, and entry into PPAs primarily with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. In general, Southern Power commits to the construction or acquisition of new generating capacity only after entering into or assuming long-term PPAs for the new facilities.

During


,

Southern Power acquired and placed in service the 20-MW Gaskell West 1 solar facility, placed in service the 148-MW Cactus Flats wind facility, acquired and began construction of the 100-MW Wild Horse Mountain and the 200-MW Reading wind facilities, and continued construction of the expansion of the 385-MW Mankato natural gas facility. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Acquisitions" and "Construction Projects" herein for additional information.

Also during 2018, Southern Power completed the following sales of noncontrolling interests and sales of assets resulting in approximately $2.6 billion in proceeds:

•

On May 22, 2018, Southern Power sold a noncontrolling 33% equity interest in SP Solar, a limited partnership indirectly owning substantially all of Southern Power's solar facilities, for approximately $1.2 billion.

•

On December 4, 2018, Southern Power sold all of its equity interests in Plant Oleander and Plant Stanton Unit A (together, the Florida Plants) to NextEra Energy for $203 million.

•

On December 11, 2018, Southern Power sold a noncontrolling tax equity interest in SP Wind, a holding company owning a portfolio of eight operating wind facilities, for approximately $1.2 billion.

In addition, on November 5, 2018, Southern Power entered into an agreement to sell all of its equity interests in Plant Mankato (including the 385-MW expansion currently under construction) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $650 million. The completion of the disposition is subject to the expansion unit reaching commercial operation as well as various other customary conditions to closing, including FERC and state commission approvals, and the sale is expected to close mid-2019. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

At

December 31, 2018

, Southern Power's generation fleet, which is owned in part with its various partners, totaled

11,888

MWs of nameplate capacity in commercial operation (including

4,508

MWs of nameplate capacity owned by its subsidiaries and including Plant Mankato, which is classified as held for sale in the financial statements). The average remaining duration of Southern Power's total portfolio of wholesale contracts is approximately


years, which reduces remarketing risk for Southern Power. With the inclusion of the PPAs and investments associated with renewable and natural gas facilities currently under construction, Southern Power has an average investment coverage ratio, at December 31, 2018, of


% through 2023 and


% through 2028 (including Plant Mankato, which is classified as held for sale in the financial statements).

Southern Power's future earnings will be materially decreased as a result of the asset and non-controlling interest sales described above. In addition, Southern Power's future earnings will depend on the parameters of the wholesale market and the efficient operation of its wholesale generating assets, as well as Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy and to develop and construct generating facilities. In addition, Southern Power's future earnings may be impacted by the availability of federal and state solar ITCs and wind PTCs on its renewable energy projects, which could be impacted by future tax legislation. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "General," "Acquisitions," "Construction Projects," and "Income Tax Matters" herein and Notes 10 and 15 to the financial statements for additional information.

To evaluate operating results and to ensure Southern Power's ability to meet its contractual commitments to customers, Southern Power continues to focus on several key performance indicators, including, but not limited to, peak season equivalent forced outage rate, contract availability, and net income.

See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for information on Southern Power's financial performance.

Earnings

Southern Power's


net income was $187 million, an $884 million decrease from


, primarily attributable to $743 million of tax benefits recognized in 2017 and $79 million in tax expense recognized in 2018, both related to the Tax Reform Legislation. Also contributing to the decrease were asset impairment charges in 2018 totaling $156 million ($120 million pre-tax for the

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

Florida Plants and $36 million pre-tax for turbine equipment held for development projects, which together totaled $117 million after tax), partially offset by approximately $65 million in state income tax benefits arising from reorganizations of legal entities that own and operate certain of Southern Power's solar and wind facilities.

Southern Power's


net income was

$1.1 billion

, a $733 million increase from


, primarily attributable to $743 million in tax benefits recognized in 2017 related to the Tax Reform Legislation. Also contributing to the change were increases in operating expenses and interest expense related to Southern Power's growth strategy and continuous construction program, largely offset by increased renewable energy sales.

In addition, tax benefits from wind PTCs significantly impacted Southern Power's net income in 2018 and 2017. Tax benefits from solar ITCs related to the acquisition and construction of new facilities also significantly impacted Southern Power's net income in 2017 and 2016. See Note


to the financial statements under "Effective Tax Rate" for additional information.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

A condensed statement of income follows:

Operating Revenues

Total operating revenues include PPA capacity revenues, which are derived primarily from long-term contracts involving natural gas and biomass generating facilities, and PPA energy revenues from Southern Power's generation facilities. To the extent Southern Power has capacity not contracted under a PPA, it may sell power into an accessible wholesale market, or, to the extent those generation assets are part of the FERC-approved IIC, it may sell power into the power pool.

Natural Gas and Biomass Capacity and Energy Revenue

Capacity revenues generally represent the greatest contribution to operating income and are designed to provide recovery of fixed costs plus a return on investment.

Energy is generally sold at variable cost or is indexed to published natural gas indices. Energy revenues will vary depending on the energy demand of Southern Power's customers and their generation capacity, as well as the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Southern Power's energy. Energy revenues also include fees for support services, fuel storage, and unit start charges. Increases and decreases in energy revenues under PPAs that are driven by fuel or purchased power prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel and purchased power costs and do not have a significant impact on net income.

II-152


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

Solar and Wind Energy Revenue

Southern Power's energy sales from solar and wind generating facilities are predominantly through long-term PPAs that do not have a capacity charge. Customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or pay a fixed price related to the energy generated from the respective facility and sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors.

See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Power Sales Agreements" herein for additional information regarding Southern Power's PPAs.

Details of Southern Power's operating revenues were as follows:

Operating revenues for


were

$2.2 billion

, reflecting a

$130 million

, or 6%, increase from


. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to the following:

•

PPA capacity revenues

decreased $19 million, or 3%, primarily due to decreases of $16 million from the contractual expiration of an affiliate natural gas PPA and $5 million from the Florida Plants sold in December 2018.

•

PPA energy revenues increased $170 million, or 18%, primarily due to a $142 million increase in sales related to existing natural gas facilities driven by an $88 million increase in the average cost of fuel and a $54 million increase in the volume of KWHs sold due to customer load, a $12 million increase related to PPAs associated with new renewable facilities, and a $16 million increase related to PPAs associated with existing renewable facilities primarily due to an increase in the volume of KWHs sold.

•

Non-PPA revenues decreased $22 million, or 4%, primarily due to a $56 million decrease in the volume of KWHs sold from uncovered natural gas capacity through short-term sales, partially offset by a $35 million increase in the market price of energy.

Operating revenues for


were $2.1 billion, reflecting a $498 million, or 32%, increase from


. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to the following:

•

PPA capacity revenues

increased $58 million, or 11%, primarily due to additional customer capacity requirements and a new PPA related to Plant Mankato acquired in late 2016.

•

PPA energy revenues increased $276 million, or 40%, primarily due to a $213 million increase in renewable energy sales arising from new solar and wind facilities and a $50 million increase in sales related to existing natural gas PPAs primarily due to an $85 million increase in the average cost of fuel, partially offset by a $35 million decrease in the volume of KWHs sold primarily due to reduced customer load.

•

Non-PPA revenues increased $164 million, or 50%, primarily due to a $156 million increase in the volume of KWHs sold primarily from uncovered natural gas capacity through short-term opportunity sales, as well as an $8 million increase in the market price of energy.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses

Details of Southern Power's generation and purchased power were as follows:

Southern Power's PPAs for natural gas and biomass generation generally provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. Consequently, changes in such fuel costs are generally accompanied by a corresponding change in related fuel revenues and do not have a significant impact on net income. Southern Power is responsible for the cost of fuel for generating units that are not covered under PPAs. Power from these generating units is sold into the wholesale market or into the power pool for capacity owned directly by Southern Power.

Purchased power expenses will vary depending on demand, availability, and the cost of generating resources throughout the Southern Company system and other contract resources. Load requirements are submitted to the power pool on an hourly basis and are fulfilled with the lowest cost alternative, whether that is generation owned by Southern Power, an affiliate company, or external parties. Such purchased power costs are generally recovered through PPA revenues.

Details of Southern Power's fuel and purchased power expenses were as follows:

In


, total fuel and purchased power expenses increased $105 million, or 14%, compared to


. Fuel expense

increased $78 million, or 13%, primarily due to a $60 million increase associated with the volume of KWHs generated, excluding solar, wind, and tolling agreements, primarily due to customer load, and an $18 million increase associated with the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated. Purchased power expense increased $27 million, or 18%, primarily due to a $43 million increase associated with the average cost of purchased power, primarily in the first quarter 2018, partially offset by a $16 million decrease associated with the volume of KWHs purchased.

In


, total fuel and purchased power expenses increased $212 million, or 38%, compared to 2016. Fuel expense

increased $165 million, or 36%, primarily due to an $83 million increase associated with the volume of KWHs generated, excluding solar, wind, and tolling agreements, and an $82 million increase associated with the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated. Purchased power expense increased $47 million, or 46%, primarily due to a $37 million increase associated with the volume of KWHs purchased and an $11 million increase associated with the average cost of purchased power.

Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses

In


, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $9 million, or 2%, compared to


. The increase was primarily due to scheduled outage and maintenance expenses. In


, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $32 million, or 9%, compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to increases of $56 million associated with new facilities, $21 million in business development and support expenses, and $6 million in employee compensation, all associated with Southern Power's overall growth. These 2017 increases were partially offset by decreases of $35 million associated with scheduled outage and maintenance expenses and $15 million in non-outage operations and maintenance expenses.

Taxes Other Than Income Taxes

In


, taxes other than income taxes decreased $2 million, or 4%, compared to 2017. In


, taxes other than income taxes were $48 million compared to $23 million in


, primarily due to additional property taxes on new facilities.

Asset Impairment

In


, asset impairment charges were $156 million. In the second quarter 2018, a $119 million asset impairment charge was recorded in contemplation of the sale of the Florida Plants. In addition, in the third quarter 2018, a $36 million asset impairment charge was recorded on wind turbine equipment held for development projects. There were no asset impairment charges recorded in 2017 or 2016. See Note


to the financial statements under "Southern Power –

Sales of Natural Gas Plants

" and " – Development Projects" for additional information.

Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized

In


, interest expense, net of amounts capitalized decreased $8 million, or 4%, compared to


. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in capitalized interest associated with construction projects. In


, interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $74 million, or 63%, compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $44 million in interest expense related to an increase in average outstanding long-term debt, primarily to fund Southern Power's growth strategy and continuous construction program, as well as a $30 million decrease in capitalized interest associated with completing construction of and placing in service solar facilities.

Other Income (Expense), Net

In


, other income (expense), net increased $22 million compared to


primarily due to a $14 million gain from a joint-development wind project, which is attributable to Southern Power's partner in the project and fully offset within noncontrolling interests.

In


, other income (expense), net decreased $5 million compared to


.

Income Taxes (Benefit)

In


, income tax benefit was

$164 million

compared to

$939 million

for


, a decrease of $775 million, primarily attributable to a $743 million tax benefit in 2017 and a $79 million tax expense in 2018, both related to the remeasurement of accumulated deferred income taxes in accordance with the Tax Reform Legislation. In addition, income tax benefits associated with solar ITCs decreased by $58 million as a result of fewer solar facilities being placed in service in 2018 as compared to 2017. These decreases were partially offset by $65 million of income tax benefits related to certain changes in state apportionment rates arising from reorganizations of Southern Power's legal entities that own and operate certain of its solar and wind facilities and a decrease of $47 million of income tax expense as a result of lower pre-tax earnings and the lower federal tax rate.

In


, income tax benefit was $939 million compared to $195 million for 2016 of which $743 million of the increase was related to the Tax Reform Legislation. The remaining increase in tax benefit was primarily due to an increase of $89 million in PTCs from wind generation in 2017 and other state income taxes, significantly offset by a decrease in tax benefits associated with lower ITCs from solar facilities placed in service.

Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests

In 2018, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $13 million, or 28%, compared to


. The increase was primarily due to $20 million of net income allocations due to the sale of a noncontrolling 33% equity interest in SP Solar and $14 million of other income allocations attributable to a joint-development wind project, partially offset by a reduction of $19 million due to HLBV income allocations between Southern Power and tax equity partners for partnerships entered into during 2018. In

II-155


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

2017, noncontrolling interests increased $10 million, or 28%, compared to 2016 primarily due to additional net income allocations from new solar partnerships.

Effects of Inflation

Southern Power is party to long-term contracts reflecting market-based rates, including inflation expectations. Any adverse effect of inflation on Southern Power's results of operations has not been substantial in recent years.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL

General

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of Southern Power's future earnings potential. Southern Power completed multiple sales of noncontrolling interests and assets in 2018 as described below. These sales will materially decrease future earnings and cash flows to Southern Power. See below for a summary of the 2018 disposition activity. The level of Southern Power's future earnings also depends on numerous factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of Southern Power's competitive wholesale business. These factors include: Southern Power's ability to achieve sales growth while containing costs; regulatory matters; creditworthiness of customers; total generating capacity available in Southern Power's market areas; the successful remarketing of capacity as current contracts expire; and Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy through the development or acquisition of renewable facilities and other energy projects.

On May 22, 2018, Southern Power completed the sale of a noncontrolling 33% equity interest in SP Solar, a limited partnership indirectly owning substantially all of Southern Power's solar facilities, to Global Atlantic Financial Group Limited (Global Atlantic) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.2 billion. Accordingly, Global Atlantic will receive 33% of all cash distributions paid by SP Solar. Southern Power continues to consolidate the assets and liabilities of SP Solar with Global Atlantic's share of partnership earnings included in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of income, which was $20 million for the period from May 22, 2018 to December 31, 2018.

Southern Power completed the sale of all of its equity interests in the Florida Plants to NextEra Energy on December 4, 2018, for an aggregate purchase price of $203 million. Pre-tax net income for the Florida Plants was

$49 million

and

$37 million

for the period from January 1, 2018 to December 4, 2018 and for the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively.

On December 11, 2018, Southern Power completed the sale of a noncontrolling tax equity interest in SP Wind, which owns a portfolio of eight operating wind facilities, to three financial investors, for approximately $1.2 billion. The tax equity investors together will generally receive 40% of the cash distributions from available cash and will receive a 99% allocation of tax attributes, including PTCs. Southern Power continues to consolidate the assets and liabilities of SP Wind with the investors' shares of partnership earnings reflected in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of income.

On November 5, 2018, Southern Power entered into an agreement with Northern States Power to sell all of its equity interests in Plant Mankato (including the 385-MW expansion currently under construction) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $650 million. The completion of the disposition is subject to the expansion unit reaching commercial operation as well as various other customary conditions to closing, including working capital and timing adjustments. Pre-tax net income for Plant Mankato was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. This transaction is subject to FERC and state commission approvals and is expected to close mid-2019. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Demand for electricity is primarily driven by the pace of economic growth that may be affected by changes in regional and global economic conditions, as well as renewable portfolio standards, which may impact future earnings. Other factors that could influence future earnings include weather, transmission constraints, cost of generation from units within the power pool, and operational limitations.

Power Sales Agreements

General

Southern Power has PPAs with some of Southern Company's traditional electric operating companies, other investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. The PPAs are expected to provide Southern Power with a stable source of revenue during their respective terms.

Many of Southern Power's PPAs have provisions that require Southern Power or the counterparty to post collateral or an acceptable substitute guarantee in the event that S&P or Moody's downgrades the credit ratings of the respective company to an unacceptable credit rating or if the counterparty is not rated or fails to maintain a minimum coverage ratio.

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

On January 29, 2019, Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) filed petitions to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Southern Power, together with its noncontrolling partners, owns

four

solar facilities where PG&E is the energy off-taker for approximately


MWs of capacity under long-term PPAs. PG&E is also the transmission provider for these facilities and two of Southern Power's other solar facilities. Southern Power has evaluated the recoverability of its investments in these solar facilities under various scenarios, including selling the related energy into the competitive markets, and has concluded they are not impaired. At December 31, 2018, Southern Power had outstanding accounts receivables due from PG&E of

$1 million

related to the PPAs and

$36 million

related to the transmission interconnections (of which

$17 million

is classified in other deferred charges and assets). Southern Power does not expect a material impact to its financial statements if, as a result of the bankruptcy proceedings, PG&E does not perform in accordance with the PPAs or the terms of the PPAs are renegotiated; however, the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Southern Power is working to maintain and expand its share of the wholesale markets. Southern Power expects there to be new demand for capacity that will develop in the 2019-2021 timeframe. The amount of available demand and timing will vary across the wholesale markets. Southern Power calculates an investment coverage ratio for its generating assets, which includes those assets owned in part with its various partners, based on the ratio of investment under contract to total investment using the respective generation facilities' net book value (or expected in-service value for facilities under construction) as the investment amount. With the inclusion of investments associated with the wind and natural gas facilities currently under construction, as well as other capacity and energy contracts, Southern Power has an average investment coverage ratio of


% through 2023 and


% through 2028, with an average remaining contract duration of approximately


years (including Plant Mankato, which is classified as held for sale in the financial statements). See "Acquisitions" and "Construction Projects" herein for additional information.

Natural Gas and Biomass

Southern Power's electricity sales from natural gas and biomass generating units are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated generating unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serve the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable.

As a general matter, substantially all of the PPAs provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel or purchased power relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. To the extent a particular generating facility does not meet the operational requirements contemplated in the PPAs, Southern Power may be responsible for excess fuel costs. With respect to fuel transportation risk, most of Southern Power's PPAs provide that the counterparties are responsible for the availability of fuel transportation to the particular generating facility.

Capacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year. In general, to reduce Southern Power's exposure to certain operation and maintenance costs, Southern Power has LTSAs. See Note


to the financial statements under "Long-Term Service Agreements" for additional information.

Solar and Wind

Southern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind (renewables) generating facilities are also made pursuant to long-term PPAs; however, these solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Generally, under the solar and wind generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the renewable energy credits.

Environmental Matters

Southern Power's

operations are regulated by state and federal environmental agencies through a variety of laws and regulations governing air, water, land, and protection of other natural resources.

Southern Power maintains a comprehensive environmental compliance strategy to assess upcoming requirements and compliance costs associated with these environmental laws and regulations. The costs, including capital expenditures and operations and maintenance costs, required to comply with

II-157


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

environmental laws and regulations may impact results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. Compliance costs may result from the installation of additional environmental controls. The ultimate impact of the environmental laws and regulations discussed below will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements, the availability and cost of any deployed control technology, fuel prices, and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges.

New or revised environmental laws and regulations could affect many areas of

Southern Power's operations. Southern Power's PPAs generally contain provisions that permit charging the counterparty with some of the new costs incurred as a result of changes in environmental laws and regulations.

Since Southern Power's units are newer natural gas and renewable generating facilities, costs associated with environmental compliance for these facilities have been less significant than for similarly situated coal or older natural gas generating facilities. Environmental, natural resource, and land use concerns, including the applicability of air quality limitations, the potential presence of wetlands or threatened and endangered species, the availability of water withdrawal rights, uncertainties regarding aesthetic impacts such as increased light or noise, and concerns about potential adverse health impacts, can, however, increase the cost of siting and operating any type of future electric generating facility. The impact of such laws and regulations on Southern Power and subsequent recovery through PPA provisions cannot be determined at this time.

Environmental Laws and Regulations

Air Quality

In 2011, the EPA finalized the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) to address impacts of SO


and NO

X

emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating plants. CSAPR establishes emissions trading programs and budgets for certain states and allocates emissions allowances for sources in those states.

In 2016, the EPA published a final rule establishing more stringent ozone season NO

X

emissions budgets in

Alabama

and

Texas

.

The EPA also removed

North Carolina from this particular CSAPR program.

Georgia's ozone season NO

X

emissions budget remained unchanged.

Increases in either future fossil fuel-fired generation or the availability or cost of CSAPR allowances could have a negative financial impact on results of operations for

Southern Power

.

Water Quality

In 2014, the EPA finalized requirements under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) to regulate cooling water intake structures (CWIS) to minimize their effects on fish and other aquatic life at existing power plants (e.g. coal, natural gas, oil, and nuclear generating plants) and manufacturing facilities. The regulation requires plant-specific studies to determine applicable CWIS changes to protect organisms that either get caught on the intake screens (impingement) or are drawn into the cooling system (entrainment).

Southern Power is conducting these studies and currently anticipates such changes will be limited to minor additions of monitoring equipment at certain of its electric generating plants. However, the ultimate impact of this rule will depend on the outcome of these plant-specific studies, any additional protective measures required to be incorporated into each plant's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit based on site-specific factors, and the outcome of any legal challenges.

In 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) jointly published a final rule that revised the regulatory definition of waters of the United States (WOTUS) for all CWA programs. The rule significantly expanded the scope of federal jurisdiction over waterbodies (such as rivers, streams, canals, and wastewater treatment ponds), which could impact new generation projects

.

The EPA and the Corps are expected to publish a final rule in 2019 to replace the 2015 WOTUS definition. The impact of any changes to the 2015 WOTUS rule will depend on the content of this final rule and the outcome of any legal challenges.

Global Climate Issues

On December 20, 2018, the EPA published a proposed review of the Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from New, Modified, and Reconstructed Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units final rule (2015 NSPS rule). The EPA's final 2015 NSPS rule set standards of performance for new, modified, and reconstructed electric utility generating units which included stationary combustion turbines and fossil-fired steam boilers. This proposal reduces the stringency of the 2015 NSPS rule by not basing the new and reconstructed fossil-fired steam boiler standards on partial carbon capture and sequestration. The impact of any changes to this rule will depend on the content of the final rule and the outcome of any legal challenges.

The EPA's GHG reporting rule requires annual reporting of GHG emissions expressed in terms of metric tons of CO


equivalent emissions for a company's operational control of facilities. Based on ownership or financial control of facilities, Southern Power's


GHG emissions were approximately 13 million metric tons of CO


equivalent. The preliminary estimate of Southern Power's


GHG emissions on the same basis is approximately 14 million metric tons of CO


equivalent.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

Income Tax Matters

Consolidated Income Taxes

On behalf of Southern Power, Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and various state income tax returns, some of which are combined or unitary. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement, each Southern Company subsidiary's current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis and no subsidiary is allocated more current expense than would be paid if it filed a separate income tax return. In accordance with IRS regulations, each company is jointly and severally liable for the federal tax liability.

The impact of certain tax events at Southern Company and/or its other subsidiaries can, and does, affect Southern Power's ability to utilize certain tax credits. See "Tax Credits" and ACCOUNTING POLICIES – "Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" herein and Note


to the financial statements for additional information.

Southern Power currently has unutilized federal ITC and PTC carryforwards totaling approximately

$2.1 billion

, and thus has utilized tax equity partnerships where the tax partner will take significantly all of the respective federal tax benefits on a prospective basis. These tax equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Power's financial statements using the HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses. See Note 1 to the financial statements for additional information.

Federal Tax Reform Legislation

In December 2017, the Tax Reform Legislation was signed into law and became effective on January 1, 2018. The Tax Reform Legislation, among other things, reduced the federal corporate income tax rate to 21%, retained existing renewable energy incentives, and repealed the corporate alternative minimum tax. In addition, under the Tax Reform Legislation, NOLs generated after December 31, 2017 can no longer be carried back to previous tax years but can be carried forward indefinitely, with utilization limited to 80% of taxable income of the subsequent tax year. The projected reduction of Southern Company's consolidated income tax liability resulting from the tax rate reduction also delays the expected utilization of existing tax credit carryforwards.

Following the enactment of the Tax Reform Legislation, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 – "Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" (SAB 118), which provided for a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date to complete accounting under GAAP for the tax effects of the legislation. Due to the complex and comprehensive nature of the enacted tax law changes and their application under GAAP, Southern Power considered all amounts recorded in the financial statements as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation "provisional" as discussed in SAB 118 and subject to revision prior to filing its 2017 tax return in the fourth quarter 2018. Southern Power recognized tax benefits of $743 million in 2017. Following the filing of its 2017 tax return, Southern Power recorded tax expense of $79 million to adjust the provisional amount for a total net tax benefit of $664 million as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation. As of December 31, 2018, Southern Power considered the measurement of impacts from the Tax Reform Legislation on deferred income tax assets and liabilities, primarily due to the impact of the reduction of the corporate income tax rate, to be complete.

However, the IRS continues to issue regulations that provide further interpretation and guidance on the law and each state's adoption of the provisions contained in the Tax Reform Legislation remains uncertain. The ultimate impact of this matter cannot be determined at this time. In addition, the regulatory treatment of certain impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation is subject to the discretion of the FERC. See Note


to the financial statements under "Current and Deferred Income Taxes" for additional information.

Tax Credits

The Tax Reform Legislation retained the renewable energy incentives that were included in the PATH Act. The PATH Act allows for 30% ITC for solar projects that commence construction by December 31, 2019; 26% ITC for solar projects that commence construction in 2020; 22% ITC for solar projects that commence construction in 2021; and a permanent 10% ITC for solar projects that commence construction on or after January 1, 2022. In addition, the PATH Act allows for 100% PTC for wind projects that commenced construction in 2016; 80% PTC for wind projects that commenced construction in 2017; 60% PTC for wind projects that commence construction in 2018; and 40% PTC for wind projects that commence construction in 2019. Wind projects commencing construction after 2019 will not be entitled to any PTCs. Southern Power has received ITCs related to its investment in new solar facilities acquired or constructed and receives PTCs related to the first 10 years of energy production from its wind facilities, which have had, and may continue to have, a material impact on Southern Power's cash flows and net income. In 2018, Southern Power sold noncontrolling tax equity interests in SP Wind and Cactus Flats, which both qualify for PTCs, and Gaskell West 1, which qualifies for ITCs. Under these partnerships, the tax equity investors will receive 99% of the PTC and ITC tax benefits and, therefore, Southern Power's tax benefits will be materially reduced. At December 31, 2018,

II-159


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

Southern Power had approximately

$2.1 billion

of unutilized ITCs and PTCs, which are currently expected to be fully utilized by 2022, but could be further delayed. See Note


to the financial statements under "Income and Other Taxes" and Note


to the financial statements under "Current and Deferred Income Taxes – Tax Credit Carryforwards" and "Effective Tax Rate" for additional information regarding utilization and amortization of credits and the tax benefit related to associated basis differences.

Bonus Depreciation

Under the Tax Reform Legislation, projects with binding contracts prior to September 28, 2017 and placed in service after September 27, 2017 remain eligible for bonus depreciation under the PATH Act. The PATH Act allowed for 50% bonus depreciation for 2015 through 2017, 40% bonus depreciation for 2018, and 30% bonus depreciation for 2019 and certain long-lived assets placed in service in 2020. Southern Power is not expecting material cash flows from bonus depreciation for the 2018 or 2019 tax years. However, any cash flows resulting from bonus depreciation would also be impacted by Southern Power's use of tax equity partnerships. See Note


to the financial statements under "Current and Deferred Income Taxes" for additional information. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Acquisitions

During


, Southern Power acquired and completed the project below and acquired the Wild Horse Mountain and Reading wind facilities discussed under "Construction Projects" herein. See Note


to the financial statements under "

Southern Power

" for additional information.

(*)

Southern Power owns 100% of the class B membership interests under a tax equity partnership.

The Gaskell West 1 facility did not have operating revenues or activities prior to being placed in service during March 2018.

Construction Projects

Construction Projects Completed and/or in Progress

During 2018, in accordance with its growth strategy, Southern Power started, continued, or completed construction of the projects set forth in the table below.

(a)

In July 2017, Southern Power purchased 100% of the Cactus Flats facility. In August 2018, Southern Power closed on a tax equity partnership and now owns 100% of the class B membership interests.

(b)

In November 2018, Southern Power entered into an agreement to sell all of its equity interests in Plant Mankato, including this expansion currently under construction. See "Sales of Natural Gas Plants" below.

II-160


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

(c)

In May 2018, Southern Power purchased 100% of the Wild Horse Mountain facility. Southern Power may enter into a tax equity partnership, in which case it would then own 100% of the class B membership interests. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

(d)

In August 2018, Southern Power purchased 100% of the membership interests of the Reading facility from the joint development arrangement with Renewable Energy Systems Americas, Inc. described below. Southern Power may enter into a tax equity partnership, in which case it would then own 100% of the class B membership interests. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Total aggregate construction costs for projects under construction at December 31, 2018, excluding acquisition costs, are expected to be between

$575 million

and

$640 million

for the Plant Mankato expansion, Wild Horse Mountain, and Reading facilities. A

t

December 31, 2018

, total costs of construction incurred for these projects was

$289 million

, and is included in CWIP, except for the Plant Mankato expansion, which is included in assets held for sale in the financial statements. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Power" and "Assets Held for Sale" for additional information.

Development Projects

During 2017, Southern Power purchased wind turbine equipment to be used for various development and construction projects. Any wind projects using this equipment and reaching commercial operation by the end of 2021 are expected to qualify for 80% PTCs.

During 2016, Southern Power entered into a joint development agreement with Renewable Energy Systems Americas, Inc. (RES) to develop and construct wind projects. Concurrent with the agreement, Southern Power purchased wind turbine equipment from Siemens Wind Power, Inc. and Vestas-American Wind Technology, Inc. to be used for construction of these projects. Several wind projects using this equipment, as well as other purchased equipment, have successfully originated, directly or indirectly, from the partnership with RES and are expected to reach commercial operation before the end of 2020, thus qualifying for 100% PTCs.

Southern Power continues to evaluate and refine the deployment of the wind turbine equipment to potential joint development and construction projects as well as the amount of MW capacity to be constructed. During the third quarter 2018, as a result of a review of various options for probable dispositions of wind turbine equipment not deployed to development or construction projects, Southern Power recorded a $36 million asset impairment charge on the equipment.

Subsequent to December 31, 2018 and as part of management's continuous review of disposition options, approximately $53 million of this equipment is being marketed for sale and will be classified as held for sale.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Sales of Renewable Facility Interests

On May 22, 2018, Southern Power completed the sale of a noncontrolling 33% equity interest in SP Solar, a limited partnership indirectly owning substantially all of Southern Power's solar facilities, to Global Atlantic for approximately $1.2 billion. Since Southern Power retains control of the limited partnership through its wholly-owned general partner, the sale was recorded as an equity transaction and Southern Power will continue to consolidate SP Solar in its financial statements. On the date of the transaction, the noncontrolling interest was increased by $511 million to reflect 33% of the carrying value of the partnership. This difference, partially offset by the tax impact and other related transaction charges, also resulted in a $410 million decrease to Southern Power's common stockholder's equity.

On December 11, 2018, Southern Power completed the sale of a noncontrolling tax equity interest in SP Wind, which owns a portfolio of eight operating wind facilities, to three financial investors for approximately $1.2 billion. The tax equity investors together will generally receive 40% of the cash distributions from available cash and will receive 99% of the tax attributes, including future production tax credits. Since Southern Power retains control of SP Wind, Southern Power will continue to consolidate SP Wind in its financial statements.

Sales of Natural Gas Plants

On December 4, 2018, Southern Power completed the sale of all of its equity interests in the Florida Plants to NextEra Energy for $203 million. In contemplation of this sale transaction, Southern Power recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately $119 million ($89 million after tax) in May 2018. Pre-tax net income for the Florida Plants was

$49 million

and

$37 million

for the period from January 1, 2018 to December 4, 2018 and for the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively.

On November 5, 2018, Southern Power entered into an agreement with Northern States Power to sell all of its equity interests in Plant Mankato (including the 385-MW expansion currently under construction) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $650 million. The completion of the disposition is subject to the expansion unit reaching commercial operation as well as various other customary conditions to closing, including working capital and timing adjustments. The ultimate purchase price will decrease $66,667 per day for each day after June 1, 2019 that the expansion has not achieved commercial operation, not to exceed $15 million. Pre-tax net income for Plant Mankato was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. This

II-161

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

transaction is subject to FERC and state commission approvals and is expected to close mid-2019. The assets and liabilities of Plant Mankato are classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2018.

See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Power" and "Assets Held for Sale" for additional information. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Other Matters

Southern Power is involved in various other matters being litigated and regulatory matters that could affect future earnings. In addition, Southern Power is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. Southern Power's business activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the environment, such as laws and regulations governing air, water, land, and protection of other natural resources. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, has occurred throughout the U.S. This litigation has included claims for damages alleged to have been caused by CO


and other emissions and alleged exposure to hazardous materials, and/or requests for injunctive relief in connection with such matters.

The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation or regulatory matters cannot be predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically reported in Note 3 to the financial statements herein, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings would have a material effect on Southern Power's financial statements.

Southern Power indirectly owns a 51% membership interest in RE Roserock LLC (Roserock), the owner of the Roserock facility in Pecos County, Texas. Prior to the facility being placed in service in 2016, certain solar panels were damaged during installation by the construction contractor, McCarthy Building Companies, Inc. (McCarthy), and certain solar panels were damaged by a hail event that also occurred during construction. In connection therewith, Southern Power is withholding payments of approximately $26 million from the construction contractor, which has placed a lien on the Roserock facility for the same amount. In May 2017, Roserock filed a lawsuit in the state district court in Pecos County, Texas, (State Court lawsuit) against XL Insurance America, Inc. (XL) and North American Elite Insurance Company (North American Elite) seeking recovery from an insurance policy for damages resulting from the hail storm and McCarthy's installation practices. On June 1, 2018, the court in the State Court lawsuit granted Roserock's motion for partial summary judgment, finding that the insurers were in breach of contract and in violation of the Texas Insurance Code for failing to pay any monies owed for the hail claim. In addition to the State Court lawsuit, lawsuits were filed between Roserock and McCarthy, as well as other parties, and that litigation has been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. Southern Power intends to vigorously pursue and defend these matters, the ultimate outcome of which cannot be determined at this time.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Southern Power prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Significant accounting policies are described in Notes


, 4, and 10 to the financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may have a material impact on Southern Power's results of operations and related disclosures. Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those recorded in the financial statements. Senior management has reviewed and discussed the following critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors.

Revenue Recognition

Southern Power's revenue recognition depends on appropriate classification and documentation of transactions in accordance with GAAP. In general, Southern Power's power sale transactions, which include PPAs, can be classified in one of four categories: leases, non-derivatives or normal sale derivatives, derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, and derivatives not designated as hedges. For more information on derivative transactions, see FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Market Price Risk" herein and Notes


and


to the financial statements. Southern Power's revenues are dependent upon significant judgments used to determine the appropriate transaction classification, which must be documented upon the inception of each contract.

Lease Transactions

Southern Power considers the following factors to determine whether the sales contract is a lease:

•

Assessing whether specific property is explicitly or implicitly identified in the agreement;

II-162


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

•

Determining whether the fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of the identified property; and

•

Assessing whether the arrangement conveys to the purchaser the right to use the identified property.

If the contract meets the above criteria for a lease, Southern Power performs further analysis as to whether the lease is classified as operating, financing, or sales-type. All of Southern Power's power sales contracts that are determined to be leases are accounted for as operating leases and the capacity revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract and is included in Southern Power's operating revenues. Energy revenues and other contingent revenues are recognized in the period the energy is delivered or the service is rendered.

Non-Derivative and Normal Sale Derivative Transactions

If the power sales contract is not classified as a lease, Southern Power further considers the following factors to determine proper classification:

•

Assessing whether the contract meets the definition of a derivative;

•

Assessing whether the contract meets the definition of a capacity contract;

•

Assessing the probability at inception and throughout the term of the individual contract that the contract will result in physical delivery; and

•

Ensuring that the contract quantities do not exceed available generating capacity (including purchased capacity).

Contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative or are designated as normal sales (i.e. capacity contracts which provide for the sale of electricity that involve physical delivery in quantities within Southern Power's available generating capacity) are accounted for as executory contracts. For contracts that have a capacity charge, the revenue is generally recognized in the period that it becomes billable. Revenues related to energy and ancillary services are recognized in the period the energy is delivered or the service is rendered. See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional information.

Cash Flow Hedge Transactions

Southern Power further considers the following in designating other derivative contracts for the sale of electricity as cash flow hedges of anticipated sale transactions:

•

Identifying the hedging instrument, the forecasted hedged transaction, and the nature of the risk being hedged; and

•

Assessing hedge effectiveness at inception and throughout the contract term.

These contracts are accounted for on a fair value basis and are recorded in AOCI over the life of the contract. Realized gains and losses are then recognized in operating revenues as incurred.

Derivative (Non-Hedge) Transactions

Contracts for sales of electricity, which meet the definition of a derivative and that either do not qualify or are not designated as normal sales or as cash flow hedges, are accounted for on a fair value basis and are recorded in operating revenues.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles

Southern Power's investments in long-lived assets are primarily generation assets, whether in service or under construction. Southern Power's intangible assets arise from certain acquisitions and consist of acquired PPAs, which are amortized to revenue over the term of the respective PPAs. Southern Power evaluates the carrying value of these assets whenever indicators of potential impairment exist. Examples of impairment indicators could include significant changes in construction schedules, current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses, a significant decrease in market prices, the inability to remarket generating capacity for an extended period, the unplanned termination of a customer contract or inability of a customer to perform under the terms of the contract, or the inability to deploy wind turbine equipment to a development project. If an indicator exists, the asset is tested for recoverability by comparing the asset carrying value to the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows directly attributable to the asset. If the estimate of undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset, the fair value of the asset is determined and a loss is recorded. A high degree of judgment is required in developing estimates related to these evaluations, which are based on projections of various factors, including the following:

•

Future demand for electricity based on projections of economic growth and estimates of available generating capacity;

•

Future power and natural gas prices, which have been quite volatile in recent years; and

•

Future operating costs.

II-163


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

In addition, when assets are identified as held for sale, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of the assets or asset group exceeds the asset fair value less cost to sell. In 2018, an impairment charge of $119 million was recorded for the Florida Plants concurrent with the assets being identified as held for sale as a result of a signed purchase and sale agreement. Also in 2018, an impairment charge of $36 million was recorded for wind turbine equipment that is no longer likely to be deployed to a wind generation project.

Acquisition Accounting

Southern Power may acquire generation assets as part of its overall growth strategy. At the time of an acquisition, Southern Power will assess if these assets and activities meet the definition of a business. For acquisitions that meet the definition of a business, Southern Power includes operating results from the date of acquisition in its consolidated financial statements. The purchase price, including any contingent consideration, is allocated based on the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed (including any intangible assets). Assets acquired that do not meet the definition of a business are accounted for as an asset acquisition.

The purchase price of each asset acquisition is allocated based on the relative fair value of assets acquired. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management judgment and Southern Power may engage independent valuation experts to assist in this process. Fair values are determined by using market participant assumptions, and typically include the timing and amounts of future cash flows, incurred construction costs, the nature of acquired contracts, discount rates, power market prices, and expected asset lives. Any due diligence or transition costs incurred by Southern Power for potential or successful acquisitions are expensed as incurred.

Contingent consideration primarily relates to fixed amounts due to the seller once the facility is placed in service. For contingent consideration with variable payments, Southern Power fair values the arrangement with any changes recorded in the consolidated statements of income. See Note


to the financial statements for additional fair value information and Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information on recent acquisitions.

Accounting for Income Taxes

The consolidated income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as any unrecognized tax benefits and valuation allowances, require significant judgment and estimates. These estimates are supported by historical tax return data, reasonable projections of taxable income, and interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions. The effective tax rate reflects the statutory tax rates and calculated apportionments for the various states in which Southern Power operates.

On behalf of Southern Power, Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and various state income tax returns, some of which are combined or unitary. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement, each Southern Company subsidiary's current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis and no subsidiary is allocated more current expense than would be paid if it filed a separate income tax return. Certain deductions and credits can be limited at the consolidated or combined level resulting in NOL and tax credit carryforwards that would not otherwise result on a stand-alone basis. Utilization of NOL and tax credit carryforwards and the assessment of valuation allowances are based on significant judgment and extensive analysis of Southern Power's, as well as Southern Company's, current financial position and results of operations, including currently available information about future years, to estimate when future taxable income will be realized.

Current and deferred state income tax liabilities and assets are estimated based on laws of multiple states that determine the income to be apportioned to their jurisdictions. States utilize various formulas to calculate the apportionment of taxable income, primarily using sales, assets, or payroll within the jurisdiction compared to the consolidated totals. In addition, each state varies as to whether a stand-alone, combined, or unitary filing methodology is required. The calculation of deferred state taxes considers apportionment factors and filing methodologies that are expected to apply in future years. The apportionments and methodologies which are ultimately finalized in a manner inconsistent with expectations could have a material effect on Southern Power's financial statements.

Given the significant judgment involved in estimating NOL and tax credit carryforwards and multi-state apportionments for all subsidiaries, Southern Power considers federal and state deferred income tax liabilities and assets to be critical accounting estimates.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,

Leases (Topic 842)

(ASU 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases. ASU 2016-02 also changes the recognition, measurement,

and presentation of expense associated with leases and provides clarification regarding the identification of certain components of contracts that would represent a lease. The accounting required by lessors is relatively unchanged

.

ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and

Southern Power

adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2019.

Southern Power

elected the transition methodology provided by ASU No. 2018-11,

Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements

, whereby the requirements of ASU 2016-02 are applied on a prospective basis as of the adoption date of January 1, 2019, without restating prior periods.

Southern Power

elected the package of practical expedients provided by ASU 2016-02 that allows prior determinations of whether existing contracts are, or contain, leases and the classification of existing leases to continue without reassessment. Additionally,

Southern Power expects to apply the use-of-hindsight practical expedient in determining lease terms as of the date of adoption. Southern Power also made accounting policy elections to account for short-term leases in all asset classes as off-balance sheet leases and combined lessee lease and non-lease components in the computations of lease obligations and right-of-use assets for most asset classes, while lessor lease and non-lease components are accounted for separately.

Southern Power

completed the implementation of a new application to track and account for its leases and updated its internal controls and accounting policies to support the accounting for leases under ASU 2016-02.

Southern Power completed its lease inventory and determined its most significant leases as a lessee involve real estate.

In the first quarter 2019, the adoption of ASU 2016-02 resulted in recording lease liabilities and right-of-use assets on

Southern Power's balance sheet each totaling approximately $0.4 billion

, with no impact on

Southern Power's

statement of income.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

Southern Power's financial condition remained stable at

December 31, 2018

. Southern Power's cash requirements primarily consist of funding ongoing business operations, common stock dividends, distributions to noncontrolling interests, capital expenditures, and debt maturities. Capital expenditures and other investing activities may include investments in acquisitions or new construction associated with Southern Power's overall growth strategy and to maintain the existing generation fleet's performance. Operating cash flows, which may include the utilization of tax credits, will only provide a portion of Southern Power's cash needs. For the three-year period from 2019 through 2021, Southern Power's projected common stock dividends, distributions to noncontrolling interests, capital expenditures, and debt maturities are expected to exceed operating cash flows. Southern Power plans to finance future cash needs in excess of its operating cash flows primarily through external securities issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, and equity contributions from Southern Company. Southern Power intends to continue to monitor its access to short-term and long-term capital markets as well as its bank credit agreements to meet future capital and liquidity needs. See "Sources of Capital," "Financing Activities," and "Contractual Obligations" herein for additional information on lines of credit.

Southern Power also utilizes tax equity partnerships, as one of its financing sources, where the tax partner takes significantly all of the federal tax benefits. These tax equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Power's financial statements and are accounted for using a HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses. During 2018, Southern Power obtained tax equity funding for the Gaskell West 1 solar project, the Cactus Flats wind project, and the SP Wind portfolio and received proceeds of approximately $26 million, $122 million, and $1.2 billion, respectively.

On May 22, 2018, Southern Power completed the sale of a noncontrolling 33% equity interest in SP Solar, a limited partnership indirectly owning substantially all of Southern Power's solar facilities, to Global Atlantic for approximately $1.2 billion. Accordingly, Global Atlantic will receive 33% of all cash distributions paid by SP Solar.

On December 4, 2018, Southern Power completed the sale of all of its equity interests in the Florida Plants to NextEra Energy for $203 million. On November 5, 2018, Southern Power entered into an agreement with Northern States Power to sell all of its equity interests in Plant Mankato (including the 385-MW expansion currently under construction) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $650 million. The completion of the disposition is subject to the expansion unit reaching commercial operation as well as various other customary conditions to closing, and is expected to close mid-2019. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Net cash provided from operating activities totaled

$631 million

in


, a decrease of $524 million compared to


. The decrease was primarily due to lower income tax refunds as a result of taxable gains arising from the sales of noncontrolling interests in SP Solar and SP Wind, as well as the sale of the Florida Plants.

At

December 31, 2018

, Southern Power had

$2.1 billion

of unutilized ITCs and PTCs which are expected to be fully utilized by 2022. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Income Tax Matters – Tax Credits" herein for additional information. Net cash provided from operating activities totaled

$1.2 billion

in


, an increase of $816 million compared to


primarily due to income tax refunds received and an increase in energy sales from new solar and wind facilities, partially offset by an increase in interest paid.

See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Acquisitions" and "Construction Projects" herein and Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information.

Net cash used for financing activities totaled

primarily due to payments of common stock dividends and distributions to noncontrolling interests. Net cash provided from financing activities totaled

$4.7 billion

primarily due to the issuance of additional senior notes and capital contributions from Southern Company and noncontrolling interests.

Significant balance sheet changes include a $745 million decrease in plant in service and a $576 million increase in assets held for sale primarily due to completed and planned plant divestitures and a $355 million increase in deferred income taxes primarily due to $551 million related to the sales of noncontrolling interests in SP Solar and SP Wind and $129 million in additional unutilized PTCs, partially offset by a $333 million decrease in the federal NOL carryforward.

Sources of Capital

Southern Power plans to obtain the funds required for acquisitions, construction, development, debt maturities, and other purposes from operating cash flows, external securities issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, tax equity partnership contributions, divestitures, and equity contributions from Southern Company. However, the amount, type, and timing of any future financings, if needed, will depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory approval, and other factors. With respect to the public offering of securities, Southern Power (excluding its subsidiaries) issues and offers debt registered on registration statements filed with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

Southern Power's current liabilities sometimes exceed current assets due to the use of short-term debt as a funding source and construction payables, as well as fluctuations in cash needs due to seasonality. Southern Power believes the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing the commercial paper program, the Facility (as defined below), borrowings from financial institutions, equity contributions from Southern Company, external securities issuances, and operating cash flows.

Southern Power obtains its own financing separately without any credit support from Southern Company or any other affiliate. The Southern Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of Southern Power are not commingled with funds of any other company in the Southern Company system. To meet liquidity and capital resource requirements, Southern Power had cash and cash equivalents of approximately

$181 million

at

December 31, 2018

.

Southern Power's commercial paper program is used to finance acquisition and construction costs related to electric generating facilities and for general corporate purposes, including maturing debt. Southern Power's subsidiaries are not issuers under the commercial paper program. Short-term borrowings are included in notes payable on the consolidated balance sheets.

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

Details of short-term borrowings were as follows:

(*)

Average and maximum amounts are based upon daily balances during the twelve-month periods ended

December 31, 2018

,


, and


.

In addition to the short-term borrowings of Southern Power included in the table above, at December 31, 2016, Southern Power subsidiaries assumed credit agreements (Project Credit Facilities) with the acquisition of certain solar facilities, which were non-recourse to the Southern Power parent company, the proceeds of which were used to finance project costs related to such solar facilities. The Project Credit Facilities were fully repaid in January 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Project Credit Facilities had a maximum amount outstanding of $828 million and an average amount outstanding of $566 million at a weighted average interest rate of 2.1% and had total amounts outstanding of $209 million at a weighted average interest rate of 2.1% at December 31, 2016.

Company Credit Facilities

At

December 31, 2018

, Southern Power had a committed credit facility (Facility) of $

750 million

expiring in 2022, of which $

23 million

has been used for letters of credit and $

727 million

remains unused. Southern Power's subsidiaries are not borrowers under the Facility. Proceeds from the Facility may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes as well as liquidity support for Southern Power's commercial paper program. A portion of the unused credit under the Facility is allocated to provide liquidity support for Southern Power's commercial paper program. Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Power expects to renew or replace the Facility, as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Power may extend the maturity date and/or increase or decrease the lending commitment thereunder. See Note


to the financial statements under "

Bank Credit Arrangements

" for additional information.

The Facility, as well as Southern Power's term loan agreements, contains a covenant that limits the ratio of debt to capitalization (as defined in the Facility) to a maximum of 65% and contains a cross-default provision that is restricted only to indebtedness of Southern Power. For the purposes of this definition, debt would exclude any project debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Southern Power to the extent such debt is non-recourse to Southern Power, and capitalization would exclude the capital stock or other equity attributable to such subsidiary. Southern Power is currently in compliance with all of these covenants.

Southern Power also has a $120 million continuing letter of credit facility for standby letters of credit. In December 2018, Southern Power amended the letter of credit facility, which, among other things, extended the expiration date from 2019 to 2021. At December 31, 2018, $103 million has been used for letters of credit, primarily as credit support for PPA requirements, and $17 million was unused. Southern Power's subsidiaries are not parties to this letter of credit facility.

In addition, at

December 31, 2018

and 2017, Southern Power had

$103 million

and

$113 million

, respectively, of cash collateral posted related to PPA requirements.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

Financing Activities

Senior Notes

In June 2018, Southern Power repaid $350 million aggregate principal amount of Series 2015A 1.50% Senior Notes due June 1, 2018.

In addition to any financings that may be necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual obligations, Southern Power plans to continue, when economically feasible, a program to retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit.

Other Debt

In May 2018, Southern Power repaid $420 million aggregate principal amount of long-term floating rate bank loans.

Also in May 2018, Southern Power entered into two short-term floating rate bank loans, each for an aggregate principal amount of $100 million, which bear interest based on one-month LIBOR, and proceeds being used for general corporate purposes. In November 2018, Southern Power repaid one of these short-term loans.

Credit Rating Risk

Southern Power does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade.

There are certain contracts that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change to BBB and/or Baa2 or below. These contracts are for physical electricity purchases and sales, fuel transportation and storage, energy price risk management, and transmission.

The maximum potential collateral requirements under these contracts at

December 31, 2018

were as follows:

(*)

Any additional credit rating downgrades at or below BB- and/or Ba3 could increase collateral requirements up to an additional $38 million

.

Included in these amounts are certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that either Alabama Power or Georgia Power (affiliate companies of Southern Power) has a credit rating change to below investment grade. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. Additionally, a credit rating downgrade could impact the ability of Southern Power to access capital markets and would be likely to impact the cost at which it does so.

In addition, Southern Power has a PPA that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a downgrade of Southern Power's credit. The PPA requires credit assurances without stating a specific credit rating. The amount of collateral required would depend upon actual losses resulting from a credit downgrade.

On September 28, 2018, Fitch assigned a negative rating outlook to the ratings of Southern Company and certain of its subsidiaries (including Southern Power).

Market Price Risk

Southern Power is exposed to market risks, primarily commodity price risk, interest rate risk, and occasionally foreign currency exchange rate risk. To manage the volatility attributable to these exposures, Southern Power nets its exposures, where possible, to take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to Southern Power's policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and risk management practices. Southern Power's policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including, but not limited to, market valuation, value at risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis. Derivative instruments are recognized at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities and are presented on a gross basis. In the statements of cash flows, the cash impacts of settled energy-related and interest rate derivatives are recorded as operating activities.

II-168


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

At

December 31, 2018

, Southern Power had $525 million of long-term variable rate notes outstanding. If Southern Power sustained a 100 basis point change in interest rates for its variable interest rate exposure, the change would affect annualized interest expense by approximately $5 million at December 31, 2018. Since a significant portion of outstanding indebtedness bears interest at fixed rates, Southern Power is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly affect exposure on existing indebtedness in the near term. However, the impact on future financing costs cannot be determined at this time.

Southern Power had foreign currency denominated debt of €1.1 billion at December 31, 2018. Southern Power has mitigated its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk through the use of foreign currency swaps converting all interest and principal payments to fixed-rate U.S. dollars.

Because energy from Southern Power's facilities is primarily sold under long-term PPAs with tolling agreements and provisions shifting substantially all of the responsibility for fuel cost to the counterparties, Southern Power's exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity is generally limited. However, Southern Power has been and may continue to be exposed to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices as a result of uncontracted generating capacity.

For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts associated with both power and natural gas positions were as follows:

(*)

Current period changes also include changes in the fair value of new contracts entered into during the period, if any.

For the years ending December 31, 2018 and 2017, the changes in contracts outstanding were attributable to both the volume and the prices of power and natural gas as follows:

Gains and losses on energy-related derivatives designated as cash flow hedges which are used by Southern Power to hedge anticipated purchases and sales are initially deferred in OCI before being recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transactions are reflected in earnings. Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the consolidated statements of income as incurred.

Southern Power uses over-the-counter contracts that are not exchange traded but are fair valued using prices which are market observable, and thus fall into Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. See Note


to the financial statements for further discussion of fair value measurements. The energy-related derivative contracts outstanding at

December 31, 2018

mature through 2020.

Southern Power is exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties' nonperformance. Southern Power only enters into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by S&P and Moody's or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. Southern Power has also established risk management policies and controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate Southern Power's exposure to counterparty credit risk. Therefore, Southern Power does not anticipate a material adverse effect on the financial statements as a result of counterparty nonperformance. See Note


to the financial statements under "Financial Instruments" and Note


to the financial statements for additional information.

Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations

The capital program of Southern Power is subject to periodic review and revision and is currently estimated to total $0.9 billion over the next five years through 2023. This includes committed construction, capital improvements, and work to be performed

II-169

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

under LTSAs, totaling approximately $300 million for each of 2019 and 2020 and an average of approximately $100 million each year from 2021 through 2023. In addition, Southern Power has a further $2.3 billion in planned expenditures for plant acquisitions and placeholder growth, or approximately $0.5 billion per year on average for 2019 through 2023. Planned expenditures for plant acquisitions and placeholder growth may vary materially due to market opportunities and Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy. Actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors such as: changes in business conditions; changes in the expected environmental compliance program; changes in environmental laws and regulations; the outcome of any legal challenges to environmental rules; changes in FERC rules and regulations; changes in load projections; changes in legislation; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes; and the cost of capital. See Note

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

OVERVIEW

Business Activities

Southern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas. Subsequent to the dispositions of Elizabethtown Gas, Elkton Gas, and Florida City Gas discussed herein under "

Merger, Acquisition, and Disposition Activities

," Southern Company Gas has natural gas distribution utilities in four states – Illinois, Georgia, Virginia, and Tennessee. Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other complementary businesses.

Southern Company Gas manages its business through four reportable segments – gas distribution operations, gas pipeline investments, wholesale gas services, which includes Sequent, a natural gas asset optimization company, and gas marketing services, which includes SouthStar, a provider of energy-related products and services to natural gas markets – and one non-reportable segment, all other.

During the fourth quarter 2018, Southern Company Gas changed its reportable segments to further align with the way its new Chief Operating Decision Maker reviews operating results and has reclassified prior years' data to conform to the new reportable segment presentation. This change resulted in a new reportable segment, gas pipeline investments, which was formerly included in gas midstream operations. Gas pipeline investments consists primarily of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including a 50% interest in SNG, two significant pipeline construction projects, and a 50% joint ownership interest in the Dalton Pipeline. Gas distribution operations, wholesale gas services, and gas marketing services continue to remain as separate reportable segments and reflect the impact of the Southern Company Gas Dispositions. The all other non-reportable segment includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure, including the storage and fuels operations that were formerly included in gas midstream operations, and other subsidiaries that fall below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure.

See Notes


,


, and


to the financial statements for additional information.

Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of Southern Company Gas' business. These factors include the ability to maintain safety, to maintain constructive regulatory environments, to maintain and grow natural gas sales and number of customers, and to effectively manage and secure timely recovery of costs. These costs include those related to projected long-term demand growth, environmental standards, safety, reliability, resilience, natural gas, and capital expenditures, including updating and expanding the natural gas distribution systems. The natural gas distribution utilities have various regulatory mechanisms that address cost recovery. Effectively operating pursuant to these regulatory mechanisms and appropriately balancing required costs and capital expenditures with customer prices will continue to challenge Southern Company Gas for the foreseeable future. Nicor Gas filed a rate case on November 9, 2018 and Atlanta Gas Light is required to file a rate case no later than June 1, 2019. These rate cases are both expected to conclude in 2019; however, the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. See

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL

" for additional information.

Merger, Acquisition, and Disposition Activities

In 2016, Southern Company Gas completed the Merger, pursuant to which Southern Company Gas became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Company. Southern Company accounted for the Merger using the acquisition method of accounting whereby the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. Pushdown accounting was applied to create a new cost basis for Southern Company Gas' assets, liabilities, and equity as of the acquisition date. Accordingly, the successor financial statements reflect the new basis of accounting, and successor and predecessor period financial results (separated by a heavy black line) are presented, but are not comparable. As a result of the application of acquisition accounting, certain discussions herein include disclosure of the predecessor and successor periods. See Note


to the financial statements under "

Southern Company Merger with Southern Company Gas

" for additional information.

In 2016, Southern Company Gas completed its purchase of Piedmont's

15%

interest in SouthStar for

$160 million

and paid

$1.4 billion

to acquire a

50%

equity interest in SNG, which is the owner of a

7,000

-mile pipeline system connecting natural gas supply basins in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama to markets in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee. The investment in SNG is accounted for using the equity method. In March 2017, Southern Company Gas made an additional $50 million contribution to maintain its

50%

equity interest in SNG. See Note


to the financial statements under "

Southern Company Gas

" and Note


to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas – Investment in SNG" for additional information.

During 2018, Southern Company Gas completed the following sales, resulting in approximately $2.7 billion in aggregate proceeds:

•

On June 4, 2018, Southern Company Gas completed the stock sale of Pivotal Home Solutions to American Water Enterprises LLC for a total cash purchase price of $365 million, which includes the final working capital adjustment.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

This disposition resulted in a net loss of $67 million, which includes $34 million of income tax expense. In contemplation of the transaction, a goodwill impairment charge of $42 million was recorded in 2018.

•

On July 1, 2018, a Southern Company Gas subsidiary, Pivotal Utility Holdings, completed the sales of the assets of two of its natural gas distribution utilities, Elizabethtown Gas and Elkton Gas, to South Jersey Industries, Inc. for a total cash purchase price of $1.7 billion, which includes the final working capital and other adjustments. This disposition resulted in a pre-tax gain that was entirely offset by $205 million of income tax expense, resulting in no material net income impact.

•

On July 29, 2018, Southern Company Gas and its wholly-owned direct subsidiary, NUI Corporation, completed the stock sale of Pivotal Utility Holdings, which primarily consisted of Florida City Gas, to NextEra Energy for a total cash purchase price of $587 million, which includes the final working capital adjustment less indebtedness assumed at closing. This disposition resulted in a net gain of $16 million, which includes $103 million of income tax expense.

The after-tax gain and loss on these dispositions included income tax expense on goodwill not deductible for tax purposes and for which a deferred tax liability had not been recorded previously. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" herein for additional information.

Operating Metrics

Southern Company Gas continues to focus on several operating metrics, including Heating Degree Days, customer count, and volumes of natural gas sold.

Southern Company Gas measures weather and the effect on its business using Heating Degree Days. Generally, increased Heating Degree Days result in higher demand for natural gas on Southern Company Gas' distribution system. With the exception of Nicor Gas, Southern Company Gas has various regulatory mechanisms, such as weather normalization and straight-fixed-variable rate design, which limit its exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in each of its utilities' respective service territory. However, the operating revenues from utility customers in Illinois and gas marketing services customers primarily in Georgia and Illinois can be impacted by warmer- or colder-than-normal weather. Southern Company Gas utilizes weather hedges to limit the negative income impacts in the event of warmer-than-normal weather, while retaining a significant portion of the positive benefits of colder-than-normal weather for these businesses.

The number of customers served by gas distribution operations and gas marketing services can be impacted by natural gas prices, economic conditions, and competition from alternative fuels. Gas marketing services' customers are primarily located in Georgia and Illinois.

Southern Company Gas' natural gas volume metrics for gas distribution operations and gas marketing services illustrate the effects of weather and customer demand for natural gas. Wholesale gas services' physical sales volumes represent the daily average natural gas volumes sold to its customers.

See

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

herein for additional information on these operating metrics.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

Seasonality of Results

During the Heating Season, natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher as more customers are connected to the gas distribution systems and natural gas usage is higher in periods of colder weather. Occasionally in the summer, wholesale gas services' operating revenues are impacted due to peak usage by power generators in response to summer energy demands. Southern Company Gas' base operating expenses, excluding cost of natural gas, bad debt expense, and certain incentive compensation costs, are incurred relatively evenly throughout the year. Seasonality also affects the comparison of certain balance sheet items across quarters, including receivables, unbilled revenues, natural gas for sale, and notes payable. However, these items are comparable when reviewing Southern Company Gas' annual results. Thus, Southern Company Gas' operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonality, which is illustrated in the table below.

Earnings

Net income attributable to Southern Company Gas for the successor year ended December 31,


was

$372 million

was primarily due to lower income tax expense, increased commercial activity at wholesale gas services, increased operating revenues from infrastructure replacement programs and base rate changes at gas distribution operations, and higher earnings from Southern Company Gas' investment in SNG. These increases were partially offset by higher other operations and maintenance expenses primarily due to increased compensation and benefit costs and disposition-related costs, higher depreciation on continued infrastructure investments at gas distribution operations, additional interest expense on new debt issuances, and an increase in charitable donations.

Net income attributable to Southern Company Gas for the successor year ended December 31, 2017 was

$243 million

, which included net income of

$53 million

from Southern Company Gas' investment in SNG and

$44 million

generated from Southern Company Gas' continued investment in infrastructure replacement programs and base rate increases at Atlanta Gas Light, Elizabethtown Gas, and Virginia Natural Gas, less the associated increases in depreciation. Net income also reflects

$130 million

of additional tax expense resulting from the revaluation of deferred tax assets of

$93 million

related to the Tax Reform Legislation and

$37 million

associated with State of Illinois income tax legislation enacted in the third quarter 2017 and new income tax apportionment factors in several states resulting from Southern Company Gas' inclusion in the consolidated Southern Company state tax filings. Also included in net income was

$17 million

of additional expense resulting from the pushdown of acquisition accounting.

, which included $26 million in earnings from the SNG investment, net of related interest expense, partially offset by

$12 million

of additional expense resulting from the impact of the pushdown of acquisition accounting and

$27 million

of Merger-related expenses.

Net income attributable to Southern Company Gas for the predecessor period of January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016 was

$131 million

, which included

$41 million

of Merger-related expenses and $14 million of net income attributable to the SouthStar noncontrolling interest, which Southern Company Gas purchased in October 2016. Net income for the predecessor period reflected higher revenues from continued investment in infrastructure programs, partially offset by warm weather, net of hedging, and low earnings from wholesale gas services due to mark-to-market losses.

Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

For the successor year ended December 31,


, details of operating revenues were as follows:

(*)

Includes a $154 million decrease related to natural gas revenues, including alternative revenue programs, and a $74 million decrease related to other revenues. See Note


to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.

Revenues from infrastructure replacement programs and base rate changes increased in


primarily due to a $48 million increase at Nicor Gas, partially offset by a $12 million decrease at Atlanta Gas Light. These amounts include gas distribution operations' continued investments recovered through infrastructure replacement programs and base rate increases less revenue reductions for the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. See Note


to the financial statements under "

Southern Company Gas

" for additional information.

Revenues increased due to colder weather in


compared to


. See "

Heating Degree Days

" herein for additional information.

Revenues from wholesale gas services increased in


primarily due to increased commercial activity, partially offset by derivative losses. See "Segment Information – Wholesale Gas Services" herein for additional information.

Other revenues increased in


primarily due to a $15 million increase from the Dalton Pipeline being placed in service in August 2017 and a $14 million increase in Nicor Gas' revenue taxes.

For the successor year ended December 31,


, natural gas revenues included recovery of

$1.6 billion

in cost of natural gas and

$6 million

in net revenues from wholesale gas services, net of

$21 million

of amortization associated with assets established in the application of acquisition accounting. Also included in natural gas revenues for the successor year ended December 31,


were

$99 million

in additional revenues generated from gas distribution operations as a result of continued investment in infrastructure replacement programs and increases in base rate revenues at Atlanta Gas Light, Elizabethtown Gas, and Virginia Natural Gas. Natural gas revenues were partially offset by a $13 million negative impact of warmer-than-normal weather, net of hedging.

For the successor period of July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016, natural gas revenues included recovery of

$613 million

in cost of natural gas and

$24 million

in net revenues from wholesale gas services, net of

$5 million

of amortization associated with assets established in the application of acquisition accounting. Natural gas revenues were partially offset by a $5 million negative impact of warmer-than-normal weather, net of hedging.

For the predecessor period of January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016, natural gas revenues included recovery of

$755 million

in cost of natural gas and $32 million in net losses from wholesale gas services. Natural gas revenues were partially offset by a $7 million negative impact of warmer-than-normal weather, net of hedging.

Natural gas distribution rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from gas distribution operations. See "

Cost of Natural Gas

" herein for additional information. Revenue impacts from weather and customer growth are described further below.

Heating Degree Days

During Heating Season, natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher. Weather typically does not have a significant net income impact other than during the Heating Season. The following table presents the Heating Degree Days information for Illinois and Georgia, the primary locations where Southern Company Gas' operations are impacted by weather.

Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

(*)

Normal represents the 10-year average from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2017 for Illinois at Chicago Midway International Airport and for Georgia at Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, based on information obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Climatic Data Center.

Southern Company Gas hedged its exposure to warmer-than-normal weather in Illinois for gas distribution operations and in Illinois and Georgia for gas marketing services. The remaining impacts of weather on earnings are reflected in the chart below.

Customer Count

The following table provides the number of customers served by Southern Company Gas at

December 31, 2018

,


, and


:

(a)

Includes total customers of approximately 407,000 and 402,000 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to Elizabethtown Gas, Elkton Gas, and Florida City Gas, which were sold in 2018. See Note


to the financial statements under "

for additional information.

(b)

Includes customers in Ohio contracted through an annual auction process to serve for a 12-month period beginning April 1 of each year. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were approximately 70,000 and 140,000 contracted customers, respectively. At December 31, 2016, there were no contracted customers.

Southern Company Gas anticipates overall customer growth trends at the remaining four natural gas distribution utilities in gas distribution operations to continue as it expects continued improvement in the new housing market and low natural gas prices. Southern Company Gas uses a variety of targeted marketing programs to attract new customers and to retain existing customers.

Cost of Natural Gas

Excluding Atlanta Gas Light, which does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, gas distribution operations charges its utility customers for natural gas consumed using natural gas cost recovery mechanisms set by the applicable state regulatory agencies. Under these mechanisms, all prudently-incurred natural gas costs are passed through to customers without markup, subject to regulatory review. Gas distribution operations defers or accrues the difference between the actual cost of natural gas and the amount of commodity revenue earned in a given period. The deferred or accrued amount is either billed or refunded to customers prospectively through adjustments to the commodity rate. Deferred natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory assets and accrued natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory liabilities. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal

Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from gas distribution operations. Cost of natural gas at gas distribution operations represented

83.2%

of the total cost of natural gas for 2018.

Gas marketing services customers are charged for actual and estimated natural gas consumed. Cost of natural gas includes the cost of fuel and associated transportation costs, lost and unaccounted for gas, adjustments to reduce the value of inventories to market value, if applicable, and gains and losses associated with certain derivatives.

For the successor year ended December 31,


, cost of natural gas was

$1.5 billion

, a

decrease

of

$62 million

, or

3.9%

, compared to


substantially all as a result of the Southern Company Gas Dispositions.

For the successor year ended December 31,


, cost of natural gas was $1.6 billion, which reflected an increase in natural gas pricing of

26.3%

compared to 2016, partially offset by lower demand for natural gas.

For the successor period of July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and the predecessor period of January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016, cost of natural gas was

$613 million

and

$755 million

, respectively, which reflected low demand for natural gas driven by warm weather during those periods.

Excluding a $329 million increase related to the Southern Company Gas Dispositions, including tax expense on the goodwill for which a deferred tax liability had not been previously provided, income taxes decreased $232 million. This decrease was primarily due to a lower federal income tax rate and the flowback of excess deferred taxes as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation. In addition, 2017 included additional tax expense of $130 million from the revaluation of deferred tax assets associated with the Tax Reform Legislation, the enactment of the State of Illinois income tax legislation, and new income tax apportionment factors in several states.

Effects of Inflation

Southern Company Gas is subject to rate regulation that is generally based on the recovery of historical and projected costs. The effects of inflation can create an economic loss since the recovery of costs could be in dollars that have less purchasing power. Any adverse effect of inflation on Southern Company Gas' results of operations has not been substantial in recent years.

Performance and Non-GAAP Measures

Prior to the Merger, Southern Company Gas evaluated segment performance using EBIT, which includes operating income, earnings from equity method investments, and other income (expense), net. EBIT excludes interest expense, net of amounts capitalized and income taxes (benefit), which were evaluated on a consolidated basis for those periods. EBIT is used herein to discuss the results of Southern Company Gas' segments for the predecessor period as EBIT was the primary measure of segment profit or loss for that period. Subsequent to the Merger, Southern Company Gas changed its segment performance measure from EBIT to net income to better align with the performance measure utilized by Southern Company. EBIT for the successor periods presented herein is considered a non-GAAP measure. Southern Company Gas presents consolidated EBIT, which is considered a non-GAAP measure for all periods presented. The presentation of consolidated EBIT is believed to provide useful supplemental information regarding a consolidated measure of profit or loss. Southern Company Gas further believes the presentation of segment EBIT for the successor periods is useful as it allows for a measure of comparability to other companies with different capital and legal structures, which accordingly may be subject to different interest rates and effective tax rates. The applicable reconciliations of net income to consolidated EBIT and segment EBIT are provided herein.

Adjusted operating margin is a non-GAAP measure that is calculated as operating revenues less cost of natural gas, cost of other sales, and revenue tax expense. Adjusted operating margin excludes other operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation and amortization, taxes other than income taxes, goodwill impairment, gain on dispositions, net, and Merger-related expenses, which are included in the calculation of operating income as calculated in accordance with GAAP and reflected in the statements of income. The presentation of adjusted operating margin is believed to provide useful information regarding the contribution resulting from base rate changes, infrastructure replacement programs and capital projects, and customer growth at gas distribution operations since the cost of natural gas and revenue tax expense can vary significantly and are generally billed directly to customers. Southern Company Gas further believes that utilizing adjusted operating margin at gas pipeline investments, wholesale gas services, and gas marketing services allows it to focus on a direct measure of performance before overhead costs. The applicable reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating margin is provided herein.

EBIT and adjusted operating margin should not be considered alternatives to, or more meaningful indicators of, Southern Company Gas' operating performance than net income attributable to Southern Company Gas or operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, Southern Company Gas' adjusted operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

Adjusted operating margin and operating expenses are adjusted for Nicor Gas' revenue tax expenses, which are passed through directly to customers.

Gas Distribution Operations

Gas distribution operations is the largest component of Southern Company Gas' business and is subject to regulation and oversight by agencies in each of the states it serves. These agencies approve natural gas rates designed to provide Southern Company Gas with the opportunity to generate revenues to recover the cost of natural gas delivered to its customers and its fixed and variable costs, including depreciation, interest, operations and maintenance, taxes, and overhead costs, and to earn a reasonable return on its investments.

With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, Southern Company Gas' second largest utility that operates in a deregulated natural gas market and has a straight-fixed-variable rate design that minimizes the variability of its revenues based on consumption, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are a function of weather conditions, price levels for natural gas, and general economic conditions that may impact customers' ability to pay for natural gas consumed. Southern Company Gas has various weather mechanisms, such as weather normalization mechanisms and weather derivative instruments, that limit its exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in its natural gas distribution utilities' service territories.

Excluding a $90 million decrease attributable to the utilities sold during 2018, adjusted operating margin increased $50 million, which primarily reflects additional revenue from infrastructure investments and colder weather in 2018, partially offset by lower rates and revenue deferrals for regulatory liabilities associated with the Tax Reform Legislation impacts. Excluding a $391 million decrease attributable to the utilities sold during 2018 that includes the related gains on the sales, operating expenses increased $92 million. This increase reflects $40 million of additional depreciation primarily due to additional assets placed in service, $37 million of additional other operations and maintenance expenses primarily due to increased compensation and benefit costs, partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense, and $15 million of additional taxes other than income taxes primarily due to a $12 million increase in Nicor Gas' invested capital tax. Excluding a $3 million decrease attributable to the utilities sold during 2018, other income (expense), net decreased $20 million, which primarily reflects a $13 million decrease in gains from the settlement of contractor litigation claims. The increase in interest expense reflects $14 million of additional interest expense primarily from the issuance of first mortgage bonds at Nicor Gas. Excluding a $290 million decrease attributable to the utilities sold in 2018, income tax expense decreased $59 million, primarily due to lower pretax earnings, a lower federal income tax rate, and the flowback of excess deferred taxes as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation.

Adjusted operating margin reflects a decrease of $5 million due to fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities in the application of acquisition accounting. Also reflected in adjusted operating margin are mark-to-market gains due to changes in natural gas prices in the fourth quarter 2016 and losses from commercial activity due to low volatility in natural gas prices and warm weather. Operating expenses reflect low incentive compensation expense due to low earnings.

Predecessor Period of January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016

Loss before interest and taxes of $68 million includes $(36) million in adjusted operating margin, $33 million in operating expense, and $1 million in other income (expense), net. Adjusted operating margin reflects mark-to-market losses and LOCOM adjustments as a result of changes in natural gas prices and revenues from commercial activity driven by changes in price volatility. Operating expenses reflect lower incentive compensation expense as compared to the same period in the prior year due to lower earnings.

The following table illustrates the components of wholesale gas services' adjusted operating margin for the periods presented:

Change in Commercial Activity

The commercial activity at wholesale gas services includes recognition of storage and transportation values that were generated in prior periods, which reflect the impact of prior period hedge gains and losses as associated physical transactions oc

cur. The increase in commercial activity in 2018 compared to the prior year was primarily due to natural gas price volatility that was generated by favorable weather and a corresponding increase in power generation volumes coupled with decreased natural gas supply.

Change in Storage and Transportation Derivatives

Volatility in the natural gas market arises from a number of factors, such as weather fluctuations or changes in supply or demand for natural gas in different regions of the U.S. The volatility of natural gas commodity prices has a significant impact on Southern Company Gas' customer rates, long-term competitive position against other energy sources, and the ability of wholesale gas

II-185

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

services to capture value from locational and seasonal spreads. Forward storage or time spreads applicable to the locations of wholesale gas services' specific storage positions in 2018 resulted in storage derivative gains. Transportation and forward commodity losses in 2018 are primarily the result of widening transportation spreads due to favorable weather, which impacted forward prices at natural gas receipt and delivery points primarily in the Northeast and Midwest regions.

The natural gas that Southern Company Gas purchases and injects into storage is accounted for at the LOCOM value utilizing gas daily or spot prices at the end of the year. A LOCOM adjustment, net of current period recoveries of $7 million, was recorded during 2018 and LOCOM adjustments for all other periods presented were immaterial. See Note


to the financial statements under "Natural Gas for Sale" for additional information.

Withdrawal Schedule and Physical Transportation Transactions

The expected natural gas withdrawals from storage and expected offset to prior hedge losses/gains associated with the transportation portfolio of wholesale gas services are presented in the following table, along with the net operating revenues expected at the time of withdrawal from storage and the physical flow of natural gas between contracted transportation receipt and delivery points. Wholesale gas services' expected net operating revenues exclude storage and transportation demand charges, as well as other variable fuel, withdrawal, receipt, and delivery charges, and exclude estimated profit sharing under asset management agreements. Further, the amounts that are realizable in future periods are based on the inventory withdrawal schedule, planned physical flow of natural gas between the transportation receipt and delivery points, and forward natural gas prices at December 31, 2018. A portion of wholesale gas services' storage inventory and transportation capacity is economically hedged with futures contracts, which results in the realization of substantially fixed net operating revenues.

(a)

At December 31, 2018, the WACOG of wholesale gas services' expected natural gas withdrawals from storage was

$2.90

per mmBtu.

(b)

Represents expected operating losses from planned storage withdrawals associated with existing inventory positions and could change as wholesale gas services adjusts its daily injection and withdrawal plans in response to changes in future market conditions and forward NYMEX price fluctuations.

(c)

Represents the periods associated with the transportation derivative net gains during which the derivatives will be settled and the physical transportation transactions will occur that offset the derivative gains and losses that were previously recognized.

Gas Marketing Services

Gas marketing services provides energy-related products and services to natural gas markets and participants in customer choice programs that were approved in various states to increase competition. These programs allow customers to choose their natural gas supplier while the local distribution utility continues to provide distribution and transportation services

.

Gas marketing services is weather sensitive and uses a variety of hedging strategies, such as weather derivative instruments and other risk management tools, to partially mitigate potential weather impacts.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL

General

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of future earnings potential. The Southern Company Gas Dispositions are expected to materially decrease future earnings and cash flows to Southern Company Gas. For the year ended December 31, 2018, pre-tax earnings attributable to these dispositions were $297 million, which includes a $291 million gain on dispositions, net and a $42 million goodwill impairment. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net income attributable to these dispositions was $71 million, which included additional tax expense of $16 million associated with the Tax Reform Legislation. Due to the seasonal nature of the natural gas business and other factors including, but not limited to, weather, regulation, competition, customer demand, and general economic conditions, these results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other period. The level of Southern Company Gas' future earnings depends on numerous factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of Southern Company Gas' primary business of natural gas distribution and its complementary businesses in the gas pipeline investments, wholesale gas services, and gas marketing services sectors. These factors include Southern Company Gas' ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments that allow for the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs, the completion and subsequent operation of ongoing infrastructure and other construction projects, creditworthiness of customers, its ability to optimize its transportation and storage positions, and its ability to re-contract storage rates at favorable prices.

Future earnings will be driven by customer growth and are subject to a variety of other factors. These factors include weather, competition, new energy contracts with other utilities and other wholesale customers, energy conservation practiced by customers, the use of alternative energy sources by customers, the price of natural gas, the price elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic growth or decline in Southern Company Gas' service territories. Demand for natural gas is primarily driven by the pace of economic growth that may be affected by changes in regional and global economic conditions, which may impact future earnings.

Volatility of natural gas prices has a significant impact on Southern Company Gas' customer rates, its long-term competitive position against other energy sources, and the ability of its gas marketing services and wholesale gas services segments to capture value from locational and seasonal spreads. Additionally, changes in commodity prices subject a significant portion of Southern Company Gas' operations to earnings variability. Over the longer term, volatility is expected to be low to moderate and locational and/or transportation spreads are expected to decrease as new pipelines are built to reduce the existing supply constraints in the shale areas of the Northeast U.S. To the extent these pipelines are delayed or not built, volatility could increase. See "

FERC Matters

" herein for additional information on permitting challenges experienced by the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. Additional economic factors may contribute to this environment, including a significant drop in oil and natural gas prices, which could lead to consolidation of natural gas producers or reduced levels of natural gas production. Further, if economic conditions continue to improve, the demand for natural gas may increase, which may cause natural gas prices to rise and drive higher volatility in the natural gas markets on a longer-term basis.

As part of its business strategy, Southern Company Gas regularly considers and evaluates joint development arrangements as well as acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and assets.

" for additional information on these dispositions. See BUSINESS – "Seasonality" in Item 1, RISK FACTORS in Item 1A, and OVERVIEW – "Seasonality of Results" for additional information on seasonality.

Environmental Matters

Southern Company Gas' operations are regulated by state and federal environmental agencies through a variety of laws and regulations governing air, water, land, and protection of other natural resources. Southern Company Gas maintains a comprehensive environmental compliance strategy to assess upcoming requirements and compliance costs associated with these environmental laws and regulations. The costs, including capital expenditures and operations and maintenance costs, required to comply with environmental laws and regulations may impact future results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. A major portion of these compliance costs are expected to be recovered through customer rates. The ultimate impact of the environmental laws and regulations discussed herein will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges.

New or revised environmental laws and regulations could affect many areas of

Southern Company Gas'

operations. The impact of any such changes cannot be determined at this time. Environmental compliance costs could affect earnings if such costs cannot continue to be recovered in rates on a timely basis

. Further, increased costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for natural gas

, which could negatively affect results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition.

Additionally, many commercial and industrial customers may also be affected by existing and future environmental requirements, which for some may have the potential to ultimately affect their demand for natural gas

.

Environmental Remediation

Southern Company Gas is subject to environmental remediation liabilities associated with 40 former MGP sites in four different states. Southern Company Gas conducts studies to determine the extent of any required cleanup and has recognized the costs to clean up known impacted sites in its financial statements. An accrued environmental remediation liability of

$294 million

was included in the balance sheets at

December 31, 2018

, of which

$26 million

is expected to be incurred over the next 12 months. The accrued environmental remediation liability decreased at

December 31, 2018

primarily due to the disposition of $85 million that related to Elizabethtown Gas. The natural gas distribution utilities in Illinois and Georgia have received authority from their respective state regulators to recover approved environmental compliance costs through regulatory mechanisms, which covers substantially all of the total accrued remediation costs.

Water Quality

In 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) jointly published a final rule that revised the regulatory definition of waters of the United States (WOTUS) for all Clean Water Act programs. The rule significantly expanded the scope of federal jurisdiction over waterbodies (such as rivers, streams, and canals), which could impact permitting and reporting requirements associated with the installation, expansion, and maintenance of pipeline projects.

The EPA and the Corps are expected to publish a final rule in 2019 to replace the 2015 WOTUS definition. The impact of any changes to the 2015 WOTUS rule will depend on the content of this final rule and the outcome of any legal challenges.

equivalent.

FERC Matters

Southern Company Gas is involved in two significant pipeline construction projects within gas pipeline investments. These projects, along with Southern Company Gas' existing pipelines, are intended to provide diverse sources of natural gas supplies to customers, resolve current and long-term supply planning for new capacity, enhance system reliability, and generate economic development in the areas served. The following table provides an overview of these pipeline projects.

(a)

Represents Southern Company Gas' expected total capital expenditures, excluding AFUDC, at completion, which may change.

(b)

In 2014, Southern Company Gas entered into a joint venture to construct and operate a natural gas pipeline that will run from West Virginia through Virginia and into eastern North Carolina to meet the region's growing demand for natural gas. The proposed pipeline project is expected to transport natural gas to customers in Virginia. In August 2017, the Atlantic Coast Pipeline received FERC approval.

(c)

In 2014, Southern Company Gas entered into a joint venture to construct and operate a natural gas pipeline that will transport low-cost natural gas from the Marcellus Shale area to customers in New Jersey. Southern Company Gas believes this will alleviate takeaway constraints in the Marcellus region and help mitigate some of the price volatility experienced during recent winters. On January 19, 2018, the PennEast Pipeline received FERC approval.

Work continues with state and federal agencies to obtain the required permits to begin construction on the PennEast Pipeline. Any material delays may impact forecasted capital expenditures and the expected in-service date.

The Atlantic Coast Pipeline

has experienced challenges to its permits since construction began in 2018. During the third and fourth quarters 2018, a FERC stop work order, together with delays in obtaining permits necessary for construction and construction delays due to judicial actions, impacted the cost and schedule for the project. As a result, total project cost estimates have increased from between

$6.0 billion and $6.5 billion to between $7.0 billion and $7.8 billion, excluding financing costs. Southern Company Gas' share of the total project costs is 5% and Southern Company Gas' investment at December 31, 2018 totaled $83 million.

The operator of the joint venture currently expects to achieve a late 2020 in-service date for at least key segments of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, while the remainder may extend into early 2021. Southern Company Gas has evaluated the recoverability of its investment and determined there was no impairment as of December 31, 2018. Abnormal weather, work delays (including due to judicial or regulatory action), and other conditions may result in additional cost or schedule modifications, which could result in an impairment of Southern Company Gas' investment and could have a material impact on

On November 16, 2018, SNG completed its purchase of Georgia Power's natural gas lateral pipeline serving Plant McDonough Units 4 through 6 at net book value, as approved by the Georgia PSC on January 16, 2018. SNG expects to pay $142 million to Georgia Power in the first quarter 2020. During the interim period, Georgia Power will receive a discounted shipping rate to reflect the delayed consideration. Southern Company Gas' portion of the expected capital expenditures for the purchase of this pipeline and additional construction is $122 million.

Regulatory Matters

Utility Regulation and Rate Design

The natural gas distribution utilities are subject to regulations and oversight by their respective state regulatory agencies. Rates charged to customers vary according to customer class (residential, commercial, or industrial) and rate jurisdiction. These agencies approve rates designed to provide the opportunity to generate revenues to recover all prudently-incurred costs, including a return on rate base sufficient to pay interest on debt and provide a reasonable ROE. Rate base generally consists of the original

cost of the utility plant in service, working capital, and certain other assets, less accumulated depreciation on the utility plant in service and net deferred income tax liabilities, and may include certain other additions or deductions.

The natural gas market for Atlanta Gas Light was deregulated in 1997. Accordingly, Marketers, rather than a traditional utility, sell natural gas to end-use customers in Georgia and handle customer billing functions. The Marketers file their rates monthly with the Georgia PSC. As a result of operating in a deregulated environment, Atlanta Gas Light's role includes:

•

distributing natural gas for Marketers;

•

constructing, operating, and maintaining the gas system infrastructure, including responding to customer service calls and leaks;

•

reading meters and maintaining underlying customer premise information for Marketers; and

•

planning and contracting for capacity on interstate transportation and storage systems.

Atlanta Gas Light earns revenue by charging rates to its customers based primarily on monthly fixed charges that are set by the Georgia PSC and adjusted periodically. The Marketers add these fixed charges when billing customers. This mechanism, called a straight-fixed-variable rate design, minimizes the seasonality of Atlanta Gas Light's revenues since the monthly fixed charge is not volumetric or directly weather dependent.

Georgia Rate Adjustment Mechanism (GRAM)

In February 2017, the Georgia PSC approved GRAM and a $20 million increase in annual base rate revenues for Atlanta Gas Light, effective March 1, 2017. GRAM adjusts base rates annually, up or down, using an earnings band based on the previously approved ROE of 10.75% and does not collect revenue through special riders and surcharges. Atlanta Gas Light adjusts rates up to the lower end of the band of 10.55% and adjusts rates down to the higher end of the band of 10.95%. Various infrastructure programs previously authorized by the Georgia PSC under Atlanta Gas Light's STRIDE program including the Integrated Vintage Plastic Replacement Program (i-VPR) to replace aging plastic pipe and the Integrated System Reinforcement Program (i-SRP) to upgrade Atlanta Gas Light's distribution system and LNG facilities in Georgia continue under GRAM and the recovery of and return on the infrastructure program investments are included in annual base rate adjustments. The Georgia PSC reviews Atlanta Gas Light's performance annually under GRAM. See "

Rate Proceedings

" herein for additional information.

Pursuant to the GRAM approval, Atlanta Gas Light and the staff of the Georgia PSC agreed to a variation of the Integrated Customer Growth Program to extend pipeline facilities to serve customers in areas without pipeline access and create new economic development opportunities in Georgia, which was formerly part of the STRIDE program. As a result, a new tariff was created, effective October 10, 2017, to provide up to $15 million annually for Atlanta Gas Light to commit to strategic economic development projects. Projects under this tariff must be approved by the Georgia PSC.

PRP

In 2015, Atlanta Gas Light began recovering incremental PRP surcharge amounts through three phased-in increases in addition to its already existing PRP surcharge amount, which was established to address recovery of the unrecovered PRP balance of

$144 million

and the estimated amounts to be earned under the program through 2025. The unrecovered balance is the result of the continued revenue requirement earned under the program offset by the existing and incremental PRP surcharges. The under recovered balance at December 31, 2018 was

$171 million

, including

$95 million

of unrecognized equity return. The PRP surcharge will remain in effect until the earlier of the full recovery of the under recovered amount or December 31, 2025. See "

Rate Proceedings

" and "Unrecognized Ratemaking Amounts" herein for additional information.

With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are largely a function of weather conditions and price levels for natural gas. Specifically, customer demand substantially increases during the Heating Season when natural gas is used for heating purposes. Southern Company Gas has various mechanisms, such as weather normalization mechanisms and weather derivative instruments, that limit exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in these utilities' respective service territories.

With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the natural gas distribution utilities are authorized by the relevant regulatory agencies in the states in which they serve to use natural gas cost recovery mechanisms that adjust rates to reflect changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas and ensure recovery of all costs prudently incurred in purchasing natural gas for customers. Since Atlanta Gas Light does not sell natural gas directly to its end-use customers, it does not utilize a traditional natural gas cost recovery mechanism. However, Atlanta Gas Light does maintain natural gas inventory for the Marketers in Georgia and recovers the cost through recovery mechanisms approved by the Georgia PSC specific to Georgia's deregulated market. In addition to natural gas recovery mechanisms, there are other cost recovery mechanisms, such as regulatory riders, which vary by utility but allow recovery of certain costs, such as those related to infrastructure replacement programs as well as environmental remediation and

Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

energy efficiency plans. In traditional rate designs, utilities recover a significant portion of the fixed customer service and pipeline infrastructure costs based on assumed natural gas volumes used by customers. With the exception of Nicor Gas, the utilities have decoupled regulatory mechanisms that Southern Company Gas believes encourage conservation by separating the recoverable amount of these fixed costs from the amounts of natural gas used by customers. Natural gas cost recovery revenues are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable natural gas costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Changes in the billing factor will not have a significant effect on Southern Company Gas' revenues or net income, but will affect cash flows. See Note

Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects

Southern Company Gas continues to focus on capital discipline and cost control while pursuing projects and initiatives that are expected to have current and future benefits to customers, provide an appropriate return on invested capital, and help ensure the safety and reliability of the utility infrastructure.

In addition to capital expenditures recovered through base rates by each of the natural gas distribution utilities, Nicor Gas and Virginia Natural Gas have separate rate riders that provide timely recovery of capital expenditures for specific infrastructure replacement programs.

Total capital expenditures incurred during


for gas distribution operations were $

1.4 billion

, including $97 million related to Elizabethtown Gas, Elkton Gas, and Florida City Gas, which were sold in 2018.

The following table and discussions provide updates on the infrastructure replacement programs and capital projects at the natural gas distribution utilities at

December 31, 2018

. These programs are risk-based and designed to update and replace cast iron, bare steel, and mid-vintage plastic materials or expand Southern Company Gas' distribution systems to improve reliability and meet operational flexibility and growth. The anticipated expenditures for these programs in


are quantified in the discussion below.

(*)

Includes replacement of pipes, compressors, and transmission mains along with other improvements such as new meters. Scope of program miles is an estimate and subject to change.

Nicor Gas

In 2013, Illinois enacted legislation that allows Nicor Gas to provide more widespread safety and reliability enhancements to its distribution system. The legislation stipulates that rate increases to customers as a result of any infrastructure investments shall not exceed a cumulative annual average of 4.0% or, in any given year, 5.5% of base rate revenues. In 2014, the Illinois Commission approved the nine-year regulatory infrastructure program, Investing in Illinois, subject to annual review. Nicor Gas expects to place into service

$373 million

of qualifying projects under Investing in Illinois in


.

In conjunction with the base rate case order issued by the Illinois Commission on January 31, 2018, Nicor Gas is recovering program costs incurred prior to December 31, 2017 through base rates. Nicor Gas has requested that the program costs incurred subsequent to December 31, 2017, which are currently being recovered through a separate rider, be addressed in the base rate case filed November 9, 2018. See "Rate Proceedings" herein for additional information.

Virginia Natural Gas

In 2012, the Virginia Commission approved the SAVE program, an accelerated infrastructure replacement program, to be completed over a

five

-year period. In 2016, the Virginia Commission approved an extension to the SAVE program for Virginia Natural Gas to replace more than


miles of aging pipeline infrastructure and invest up to

$30 million

in 2016 and up to

$35 million

annually through 2021. Virginia Natural Gas expects to invest

$35 million

under this program in


.

The SAVE program is subject to annual review by the Virginia Commission. In conjunction with the base rate case order issued by the Virginia Commission in December 2017, Virginia Natural Gas is recovering program costs incurred prior to September 1, 2017 through base rates. Program costs incurred subsequent to September 1, 2017 are currently recovered through a separate rider and are subject to future base rate case proceedings.

Atlanta Gas Light

As discussed previously under "

Utility Regulation and Rate Design

," i-SRP and i-VPR will continue under GRAM and the recovery of and return on current and future capital investments under the STRIDE program will be included in annual base rate adjustments.

The orders for the STRIDE program provide for recovery of all prudent costs incurred in the performance of the program. Atlanta Gas Light will recover from end-use customers, through billings to Marketers, the costs related to the program, net of any related cost savings. The regulatory asset represents incurred program costs that will be collected through GRAM. The future expected costs to be recovered through rates related to allowed, but not incurred, costs are recognized in an unrecognized ratemaking amount that is not reflected on the balance sheets. This allowed cost is primarily the equity return on the capital investment under the program. See "

Unrecognized Ratemaking Amounts

"

herein for additional information.

Atlanta Gas Light capitalizes and depreciates the capital expenditure costs incurred from the STRIDE programs over the life of the assets. Operations and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Recoveries, which are recorded as revenue, are based on a formula that allows Atlanta Gas Light to recover operations and maintenance costs in excess of those included in its current base rates, depreciation, and an allowed rate of return on capital expenditures. However, Atlanta Gas Light is allowed the recovery of carrying costs on the under recovered balance resulting from the timing difference.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

Rate Proceedings

Nicor Gas

On January 31, 2018, the Illinois Commission approved a $137 million increase in annual base rate revenues, including $93 million related to the recovery of investments under the Investing in Illinois program, effective February 8, 2018, based on a ROE of 9.8%.

On April 19, 2018, the Illinois Commission approved Nicor Gas' variable income tax adjustment rider. This rider provides for refund or recovery of changes in income tax expense that result from income tax rates that differ from those used in Nicor Gas' last rate case. Customer refunds, via bill credits, related to the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation from January 25, 2018 through May 4, 2018 began on July 1, 2018 and are expected to conclude in the second quarter 2019.

On May 2, 2018, the Illinois Commission approved Nicor Gas' rehearing request for revised base rates to incorporate the reduction in the federal income tax rate as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation. The resulting decrease of approximately $44 million in annual base rate revenues became effective May 5, 2018. Nicor Gas' previously-authorized capital structure and ROE of 9.80% were not addressed in the rehearing and remain unchanged.

On November 9, 2018, Nicor Gas filed a general base rate case with the Illinois Commission requesting a $230 million increase in annual base rate revenues. The requested increase is based on a projected test year for the 12-month period ending September 30, 2020, a ROE of 10.6%, and an increase in the equity ratio from 52.0% to 54.0% to address the negative cash flow and credit metric impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. The Illinois Commission is expected to rule on the requested increase within the 11-month statutory time limit, after which rate adjustments will be effective. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Atlanta Gas Light

On February 23, 2018, Atlanta Gas Light revised its annual base rate filing to reflect the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation and requested a $16 million rate reduction in 2018. On May 15, 2018, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation for Atlanta Gas Light's annual base rates to remain at the 2017 level for 2018 and 2019, with customer credits of $8 million in each of July 2018 and October 2018 to reflect the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. The Georgia PSC maintained Atlanta Gas Light's previously authorized earnings band based on a ROE between 10.55% and 10.95% and increased the allowed equity ratio by 4% to an equity ratio of 55% to address the negative cash flow and credit metric impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. Additionally, Atlanta Gas Light is required to file a traditional base rate case on or before June 1, 2019 for rates effective January 1, 2020.

Atlanta Gas Light's recovery of the previously unrecovered PRP revenue through 2014, as well as the mitigation costs associated with the PRP that were not previously included in its rates, were included in GRAM. In connection with the GRAM approval, the last monthly PRP surcharge increase became effective March 1, 2017.

Virginia Natural Gas

On December 17, 2018, the Virginia Commission approved Virginia Natural Gas' annual information form filing, which reduced annual base rates by $14 million effective January 1, 2019 due to lower tax expense as a result of the lower corporate income tax rate and the impact of the flowback of excess deferred income taxes. This approval also requires Virginia Natural Gas to issue customer refunds, via bill credits, for the entire $14 million which was deferred as a regulatory liability, current, on the balance sheet at December 31, 2018. These customer refunds are expected to be completed in the first quarter 2019.

Affiliate Asset Management Agreements

With the exception of Nicor Gas, the natural gas distribution utilities use asset management agreements with an affiliate, Sequent, for the primary purpose of reducing utility customers' gas cost recovery rates through payments to the utilities by Sequent. For Atlanta Gas Light, these payments are controlled by the Georgia PSC and are utilized for infrastructure improvements and to fund heating assistance programs, rather than as a reduction to gas cost recovery rates. Under these asset management agreements, Sequent supplies natural gas to the utility and markets available pipeline and storage capacity to improve the overall cost of supplying gas to the utility customers. Currently, the natural gas distribution utilities primarily purchase their gas from Sequent. The purchase agreements require Sequent to provide firm gas to the natural gas distribution utilities, but these natural gas distribution utilities maintain the right and ability to make their own long-term supply arrangements if they believe it is in the best interest of their customers.

Upon closing the sales of Elizabethtown Gas and Elkton Gas, an affiliate of South Jersey Industries, Inc. assumed the asset management agreements with wholesale gas services for Elizabethtown Gas and Elkton Gas. The sale of Pivotal Utility Holdings to NextEra Energy did not impact the asset management agreement between Sequent and Florida City Gas, which will remain in

effect until March 31, 2019. See Note


to the financial statements under "

Southern Company Gas

" for additional information on these dispositions.

Each agreement provides for Sequent to make payments to the natural gas distribution utility through either an annual minimum guarantee within a profit sharing structure, a profit sharing structure without an annual minimum guarantee, or a fixed fee. From the inception of these agreements in 2001 through

December 31, 2018

, Sequent made sharing payments to the natural gas distribution utilities under these agreements totaling

$425 million

.

The following table provides payments made by Sequent to the remaining natural gas distribution utilities under these agreements during the last three years:

The Illinois Commission approved Nicor Gas' energySMART program, which includes energy efficiency program offerings and therm reduction goals. Through December 31, 2017, Nicor Gas spent $107 million of the initial authorized expenditure of

$113 million

. A new program began on January 1, 2018, with an additional authorized expenditure of $160 million through 2021. Through December 31, 2018, Nicor Gas had spent

$29 million

.

Unrecognized Ratemaking Amounts

The following table illustrates Southern Company Gas' authorized ratemaking amounts that are not recognized on its balance sheets. These amounts are primarily composed of an allowed equity rate of return on assets associated with certain regulatory infrastructure programs. These amounts will be recognized as revenues in Southern Company Gas' financial statements in the periods they are billable to customers, the majority of which will be recovered by 2025.

Income Tax Matters

Federal Tax Reform Legislation

In December 2017, the Tax Reform Legislation was signed into law and became effective on January 1, 2018. The Tax Reform Legislation, among other things, reduced the federal corporate income tax rate to 21%, retained normalization provisions for public utility property and existing renewable energy incentives, and repealed the corporate alternative minimum tax. In addition, under the Tax Reform Legislation, net operating losses (NOL) generated after December 31, 2017 can no longer be carried back to previous tax years but can be carried forward indefinitely, with utilization limited to 80% of taxable income of the subsequent tax year. The projected reduction of Southern Company's consolidated income tax liability resulting from the tax rate reduction

II-197


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

also delays the expected utilization of existing tax credit carryforwards. See Note 10 to the financial statements for information on Southern Company's joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement.

Following the enactment of the Tax Reform Legislation, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 – "Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" (SAB 118), which provided for a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date to complete accounting under GAAP for the tax effects of the legislation. Due to the complex and comprehensive nature of the enacted tax law changes and their application under GAAP, Southern Company Gas considered all amounts recorded in the financial statements as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation "provisional" as discussed in SAB 118 and subject to revision prior to filing its 2017 tax return in the fourth quarter 2018. Southern Company Gas recognized tax benefits of $3 million and tax expense of $93 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, for a total net tax expense of $90 million as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation. In addition, in total, Southern Company Gas recorded a $781 million increase in regulatory liabilities as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation and $4 million of stranded excess deferred tax balances in AOCI at December 31, 2017 were adjusted through retained earnings in 2018. As of December 31, 2018, Southern Company Gas considered the measurement of impacts from the Tax Reform Legislation on deferred income tax assets and liabilities, primarily due to the impact of the reduction of the corporate income tax rate, to be complete.

However, the IRS continues to issue regulations that provide further interpretation and guidance on the law and each state's adoption of the provisions contained in the Tax Reform Legislation remains uncertain. In addition, the regulatory treatment of certain impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation is subject to the discretion of the FERC and the relevant state regulatory bodies. The ultimate impact of these matters cannot be determined at this time. See Note


to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas –

Rate Proceedings

" for additional information on the natural gas distribution utilities' rate filings to reflect the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. Also see FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Credit Rating Risk" herein and Note


to the financial statements under "

Current and Deferred Income Taxes

" for additional information.

Bonus Depreciation

Under the Tax Reform Legislation, projects with binding contracts prior to September 28, 2017 and placed in service after September 27, 2017 remain eligible for bonus depreciation under the PATH Act. The PATH Act allowed for 50% bonus depreciation for 2015 through 2017, 40% bonus depreciation for 2018, and 30% bonus depreciation for 2019 and certain long-lived assets placed in service in 2020. Based on provisional estimates, bonus depreciation is expected to result in positive cash flows of approximately $40 million for the


tax year and approximately $20 million for the


tax year. See Note


to the financial statements under "Current and Deferred Income Taxes" for additional information. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Other Matters

Southern Company Gas is involved in various other matters being litigated and regulatory matters that could affect future earnings. In addition, Southern Company Gas is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business.

Southern Company Gas is involved in litigation relating to an incident that occurred in one of its prior service territories that resulted in several deaths, injuries, and property damage. Southern Company Gas has resolved all claims for personal injuries or death, but it is continuing to defend litigation seeking to recover alleged property damages. Southern Company Gas has insurance that provides full coverage of the expected financial exposure in excess of $11 million per incident. During the successor period ended December 31, 2016, Southern Company Gas recorded reserves for substantially all of its potential exposure from these cases.

The ultimate outcome of this matter and such pending or potential litigation or regulatory matters cannot be predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically reported herein or in Notes


and


to the financial statements, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings would have a material effect on Southern Company Gas' financial statements. See Notes


and


to the financial statements for a discussion of various other contingencies, regulatory matters, and other matters being litigated which may affect future earnings potential.

Southern Company Gas owns a

50%

interest in a LNG liquefaction and storage facility in Jacksonville, Florida, which was placed in service in October 2018. The facility, outfitted with a

2.0 million

gallon storage tank with the capacity to produce in excess of

120,000

gallons of LNG per day, is not expected to have a material impact on Southern Company Gas' 2019 financial statements.

A wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Company Gas owns and operates a natural gas storage facility consisting of two salt dome caverns in Louisiana. Periodic integrity tests are required in accordance with rules of the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources (DNR). In August 2017, in connection with an ongoing integrity project, updated seismic mapping indicated the proximity of one of the caverns to the edge of the salt dome may be less than the required minimum and could result in Southern

II-198


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

Company Gas retiring the cavern early. At December 31, 2018, the facility's property, plant, and equipment had a net book value of $109 million, of which the cavern itself represents approximately 20%. A potential early retirement of this cavern is dependent upon several factors including compliance with an order from the Louisiana DNR detailing the requirements to place the cavern back in service, which includes, among other things, obtaining core samples to determine the composition of the sheath surrounding the edge of the salt dome.

The cavern continues to maintain its pressures and overall structural integrity. Southern Company Gas intends to monitor the cavern and comply with the Louisiana DNR order through 2020 and place the cavern back in service in 2021. These events were considered in connection with Southern Company Gas' annual long-lived asset impairment analysis, which determined there was no impairment as of December 31, 2018. Any changes in results of monitoring activities, rates at which expiring capacity contracts are re-contracted, timing of placing the cavern back in service, or Louisiana DNR requirements could trigger impairment. Further, early retirement of the cavern could trigger impairment of other long-lived assets associated with the natural gas storage facility. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time, but could have a material impact on Southern Company Gas' financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2018, Southern Company Gas conformed its paid time off policy to align with Southern Company. Under the new policy, paid time off days are vested by the employee on the first day of each year and will continue to be recovered through rates on an as-paid basis. As a result, Southern Company Gas accrued $21 million as of January 1, 2018, of which $9 million was recorded as regulatory assets by the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note


to the financial statements under "

Southern Company Gas

" for additional information.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Southern Company Gas prepares its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Significant accounting policies are described in Notes


,


, and


to the financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may have a material impact on Southern Company Gas' results of operations and related disclosures. Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those recorded in the financial statements. Senior management has reviewed and discussed the following critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors.

Utility Regulation

The natural gas distribution utilities comprised approximately

82%

of Southern Company Gas' total operating revenues for 2018 and are subject to rate regulation by their respective state regulatory agencies, which set the rates utilities are permitted to charge customers based on allowable costs, including a reasonable ROE. As a result, the natural gas distribution utilities apply accounting standards which require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the ratemaking process, the regulators may require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when they would be recognized by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of expenses and the recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery through rates or the deferral of gains or creation of liabilities and the recording of related regulatory liabilities. The application of the accounting standards has a further effect on Southern Company Gas' financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from those actually incurred by the natural gas distribution utilities; therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation and pension and other postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on Southern Company Gas' results of operations and financial condition than they would on a non-regulated company.

As reflected in Note


to the financial statements under "

Southern Company Gas

–

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

," significant regulatory assets and liabilities have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of these regulatory assets and any requirement to refund these regulatory liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines and GAAP. However, adverse legislative, judicial, or regulatory actions could materially impact the amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could adversely impact Southern Company Gas' financial statements.

Accounting for Income Taxes

The consolidated income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as any unrecognized tax benefits and valuation allowances, require significant judgment and estimates. These estimates are supported by historical tax return data, reasonable projections of taxable income, and interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions. The effective tax rate reflects the statutory tax rates and calculated apportionments for the many states in which Southern Company Gas operates.

II-199


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

On behalf of Southern Company Gas, Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and various state income tax returns, some of which are combined or unitary. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement, each Southern Company subsidiary's current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis and no subsidiary is allocated more current expense than would be paid if it filed a separate income tax return. Certain deductions and credits can be limited at the consolidated or combined level resulting in NOL and tax credit carryforwards that would not otherwise result on a stand-alone basis. Utilization of NOL carryforwards and the assessment of valuation allowances are based on significant judgment and extensive analysis of Southern Company Gas', as well as Southern Company's, current financial position and result of operations, including currently available information about future years, to estimate when future taxable income will be realized.

Current and deferred state income tax liabilities and assets are estimated based on laws of multiple states that determine the income to be apportioned to their jurisdictions. States utilize various formulas to calculate the apportionment of taxable income, primarily using sales, assets, or payroll within the jurisdiction compared to the consolidated totals. In addition, each state varies as to whether a stand-alone, combined, or unitary filing methodology is required. The calculation of deferred state taxes considers apportionment factors and filing methodologies that are expected to apply in future years. The apportionments and methodologies which are ultimately finalized in a manner inconsistent with expectations could have a material effect on Southern Company Gas' financial statements.

Given the significant judgment involved in estimating NOL carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards and multi-state apportionments, Southern Company Gas considers state deferred income tax liabilities and assets to be critical accounting estimates.

Assessment of Assets

Goodwill

Southern Company Gas does not amortize its goodwill, but tests it annually for impairment at the reporting unit level during the fourth quarter or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. These indicators include, but are not limited to, a significant change in operating performance, the business climate, legal or regulatory factors, or a planned sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business one level below the operating segment (a component), if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management. Components are aggregated if they have similar economic characteristics.

As part of Southern Company Gas' impairment test, Southern Company Gas may perform an initial qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If Southern Company Gas elects to perform the qualitative assessment, it evaluates relevant events and circumstances, including but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, financial performance, entity specific events, and events specific to each reporting unit. If Southern Company Gas determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or it elects not to perform a qualitative assessment, it compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value to determine if the fair value is greater than its carrying value. Under ASU No. 2017-04, which was adopted effective January 1, 2018, any goodwill impairment loss will be measured as the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value.

For the


and


annual impairment tests, Southern Company Gas performed the qualitative assessment and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of all of its reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying amounts, and therefore no quantitative analysis was required. For the


annual impairment test, Southern Company Gas performed the quantitative assessment, which resulted in the fair value of all of its reporting units that have goodwill exceeding their carrying value. In the first quarter 2018, Southern Company Gas recorded a $42 million impairment charge in contemplation of the sale of Pivotal Home Solutions.

As the determination of an asset's fair value and useful life involves management making certain estimates and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded, Southern Company Gas considers these estimates to be critical accounting estimates.

Long-Lived Assets

Southern Company Gas depreciates or amortizes its long-lived and intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. Southern Company Gas assesses its long-lived and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. When such events or circumstances are present, Southern Company Gas

II-200


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected future cash flows. Impairment is indicated if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If impairment is indicated, Southern Company Gas records an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the long-lived asset.

As the determination of the expected future cash flows generated from an asset, an asset's fair value, and useful life involves management making certain estimates and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded, Southern Company Gas considers these estimates to be critical accounting estimates.

Derivatives and Hedging Activities

Determining whether a contract meets the definition of a derivative instrument, contains an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation, or qualifies for hedge accounting treatment is complex. The treatment of a single contract may vary from period to period depending upon accounting elections, changes in Southern Company Gas' assessment of the likelihood of future hedged transactions, or new interpretations of accounting guidance. As a result, judgment is required in determining the appropriate accounting treatment. In addition, the estimated fair value of derivative instruments may change significantly from period to period depending upon market conditions, and changes in hedge effectiveness may impact the accounting treatment.

Derivative instruments (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) are recorded on the balance sheets as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair value. If the transaction qualifies for, and is designated as, a normal purchase or normal sale, it is exempted from fair value accounting treatment and is, instead, subject to traditional accrual accounting. Southern Company Gas utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the derivative asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs of the valuation technique.

Changes in the derivatives' fair value are recognized concurrently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. If the derivatives meet those criteria, derivative gains and losses offset related results of the hedged item in the income statement in the case of a fair value hedge, or gains and losses are recorded in OCI on the balance sheets until the hedged transaction affects earnings in the case of a cash flow hedge. Additionally, a company is required to formally designate a derivative as a hedge as well as document and assess the effectiveness of derivatives associated with transactions that receive hedge accounting treatment.

Nicor Gas utilizes derivative instruments to hedge the price risk for the purchase of natural gas for customers. These derivatives are reflected at fair value and are not designated as accounting hedges. Realized gains or losses on such instruments are included in the cost of gas delivered and are passed through directly to customers, subject to review by the applicable state regulatory agencies, and therefore have no direct impact on earnings. Unrealized changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities. Prior to its disposition, Elizabethtown Gas utilized the same policy.

Southern Company Gas uses derivative instruments primarily to reduce the impact to its results of operations due to the risk of changes in the price of natural gas and to a lesser extent Southern Company Gas hedges against warmer-than-normal weather and interest rates. The fair value of natural gas derivative instruments used to manage exposure to changing natural gas prices reflects the estimated amounts that Southern Company Gas would receive or pay to terminate or close the contracts at the reporting date, taking into account the current unrealized gains or losses on open contracts. For derivatives utilized at gas marketing services and wholesale gas services that are not designated as accounting hedges, changes in fair value are reported as gains or losses in Southern Company Gas' results of operations in the period of change. Gas marketing services records derivative gains or losses arising from cash flow hedges in OCI and reclassifies them into earnings in the same period that the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings.

Southern Company Gas classifies derivative assets and liabilities based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy. The determination of the fair value of the derivative instruments incorporates various required factors. These factors include:

•

the creditworthiness of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash deposits and letters of credit);

•

events specific to a given counterparty; and

•

the impact of Southern Company Gas' nonperformance risk on its liabilities.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

If there is a significant change in the underlying market prices or pricing assumptions Southern Company Gas uses in pricing its derivative assets or liabilities, Southern Company Gas may experience a significant impact on its financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. See Note


to the financial statements for additional information.

Given the assumptions used in pricing the derivative asset or liability, Southern Company Gas considers the valuation of derivative assets and liabilities a critical accounting estimate. See

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

– "Market Price Risk" herein for more information.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Southern Company Gas' calculation of pension and other postretirement benefits expense is dependent on a number of assumptions. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected long-term return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary and wage increases, and other factors. Components of pension and other postretirement benefits expense include interest and service cost on the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, expected return on plan assets, and amortization of certain unrecognized costs and obligations. Actual results that differ from the assumptions utilized are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While Southern Company Gas believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect its pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations.

Key elements in determining Southern Company Gas' pension and other postretirement benefit expense are the expected long-term return on plan assets and the discount rate used to measure the benefit plan obligations and the periodic benefit plan expense for future periods. The expected long-term return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets is based on Southern Company's investment strategy, historical experience, and expectations for long-term rates of return that consider external actuarial advice. Southern Company determines the long-term return on plan assets by applying the long-term rate of expected returns on various asset classes to Southern Company's target asset allocation. For purposes of determining Southern Company Gas' liability related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, Southern Company discounts the future related cash flows using a single-point discount rate developed from the weighted average of market-observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to expected benefit payments.

A 25 basis point change in any significant assumption (discount rate, salary increases, or long-term rate of return on plan assets) would result in a $3 million or less change in total annual benefit expense, a $30 million or less change in the projected obligation for the pension plan, and a $6 million or less change in the projected obligation for other post retirement benefit plans.

See Note


to the financial statements for additional information regarding pension and other postretirement benefits.

Contingent Obligations

Southern Company Gas is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations as well as other factors and conditions that subject it to environmental, litigation, and other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Notes


and


to the financial statements for more information regarding certain of these contingencies. Southern Company Gas periodically evaluates its exposure to such risks and records reserves for those matters where a non-tax-related loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable. The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or conditions that can be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially affect Southern Company Gas' results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

Southern Company Gas' financial condition remained stable at

December 31, 2018

. Southern Company Gas' cash requirements primarily consist of funding ongoing operations, common stock dividends, capital expenditures, investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, and debt maturities. Capital expenditures and other investing activities include investments to meet projected long-term demand requirements, to maintain existing natural gas distribution systems as well as to update and expand these systems, and to comply with environmental regulations. Operating cash flows provide a substantial portion of Southern Company Gas' cash needs. For the three-year period from


through


, Southern Company Gas' projected common stock dividends, capital expenditures, and debt maturities are expected to exceed operating cash flows. Southern Company Gas plans to finance future cash needs in excess of its operating cash flows primarily through external securities issuances, equity contributions from Southern Company, and borrowings from financial institutions. Southern Company Gas plans to use commercial paper to manage seasonal variations in operating cash flows and other working capital needs. Southern Company Gas intends to continue to monitor its access to short-term and long-term capital markets as well as its bank credit arrangements to meet future capital and liquidity needs. See "

Sources of Capital

," "

Financing Activities

," and "

Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations

" herein for additional information.

By regulation, Nicor Gas is restricted, to the extent of its retained earnings balance, in the amount it can dividend or loan to affiliates and is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. At

December 31, 2018

, the amount of subsidiary retained earnings restricted to dividend totaled

$814 million

. This restriction did not impact Southern Company Gas' ability to meet its cash obligations, nor does management expect such restriction to materially impact Southern Company Gas' ability to meet its currently anticipated cash obligations.

Southern Company Gas' investments in the qualified pension plan decreased in value at

December 31, 2018

as compared to

December 31, 2017

. There were no voluntary contributions to the qualified pension plan in


and no mandatory contributions to its qualified pension plan are anticipated during


. See Note


to the financial statements for additional information.

Net cash provided from operating activities in the successor year ended 2018 totaled

$764 million

, a decrease of

$117 million

from 2017. The decrease was primarily due to higher income tax payments as a result of net taxable gains from the Southern Company Gas Dispositions, partially offset by increased volumes of natural gas sold during 2018 as a result of colder weather compared to 2017. Net cash provided from operating activities totaled

$881 million

for 2017, primarily due to earnings and the timing of cash receipts for the sale of natural gas inventory and vendor payments. Net cash used for operating activities was

$327 million

for the successor period of

July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016

, primarily due to a $125 million voluntary pension contribution, a $35 million payment for the settlement of an interest rate swap, and less cash due to the timing of collecting receivables and disbursing payables. Due to the seasonal nature of its business, Southern Company Gas typically reports negative cash flows from operating activities in the second half of the year. Net cash provided from operating activities was

$1.1 billion

for the predecessor period of

January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016

, primarily due to low volumes of natural gas sales and changes in natural gas inventory as a result of warmer weather and the timing of recovery of related gas costs and weather normalization adjustments from customers.

Net cash provided from investing activities for the successor year ended 2018 totaled

$1.0 billion

and was primarily due to the

$2.6 billion

proceeds from the Southern Company Gas Dispositions, partially offset by gross property additions primarily related to utility capital expenditures and pre-approved rider and infrastructure investments recovered through replacement programs at gas distribution operations as well as capital contributed to equity method pipeline investments partially offset by capital returned from equity method pipeline investments. Net cash used for investing activities totaled

$1.6 billion

for the successor year ended 2017, which reflected $1.5 billion in capital expenditures primarily due to gross property additions for infrastructure replacement programs at gas distribution operations and $145 million in capital contributions to equity method pipeline investments, partially offset by $80 million in capital returned from equity method pipeline investments. Net cash used for investing activities was

$2.1 billion

for the successor period of

July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016

, which reflected

II-203

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

$1.4 billion primarily related to Southern Company Gas' acquisition of the 50% interest in SNG, and $632 million in capital expenditures. Net cash used for investing activities was

$556 million

for the predecessor period of

January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016

which primarily related to capital expenditures. See Note


to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" and Note


to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas – Investment in SNG" for additional information.

Net cash used for financing activities for the successor year ended 2018 of $1.8 billion included payments of common stock dividends to Southern Company, return of capital to Southern Company, redemptions of gas facility revenue bonds and senior notes, and repayments of commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt, partially offset by debt issuances and capital contributions from Southern Company. Net cash provided from financing activities totaled

$741 million

for 2017, primarily due to $850 million in debt issuances, $262 million in net additional commercial paper borrowings, and $103 million in capital contributions from Southern Company, partially offset by $443 million in common stock dividend payments to Southern Company and $22 million in repayment of long-term debt. Net cash provided from financing activities was

$2.4 billion

for the successor period of

July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016

, which reflected $1.1 billion of capital contributions from Southern Company, primarily used to fund Southern Company Gas' investment in SNG, $1.1 billion in net additional commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by $160 million for the purchase of the 15% noncontrolling ownership interest in SouthStar, and $900 million in proceeds from debt issuances, partially offset by $420 million in debt payments. Net cash used for financing activities was

$558 million

for the predecessor period of

January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016

, primarily due to $896 million in net repayment of commercial paper borrowings and $125 million in repayment of long-term debt, partially offset by $600 million in debt issuances. See Note


to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" and Note


to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas – Investment in SNG" for additional information.

Significant balance sheet changes at

December 31, 2018

include

$2.8 billion

and

$403 million

in total assets and liabilities sold, respectively, associated with the Southern Company Gas Dispositions as described in Note 15 to the financial statements herein under "Southern Company Gas." After adjusting for these changes, other significant balance sheet changes included an

increase

of

$1.0 billion

in total property, plant, and equipment primarily due to capital expenditures for infrastructure replacement programs, a

decrease

of

$73 million

in accumulated deferred income tax liabilities primarily due to the change in the federal corporate income tax rate, partially offset by tax depreciation related to infrastructure assets placed in service, as well as the impacts of State of Illinois tax legislation, and a

decrease

of $108 million in long-term debt (including securities due within one year), primarily due to $200 million redemption of gas facility revenue bonds and $155 million in repayments of long-term debt, partially offset by the issuance of $300 million of first mortgage bonds at Nicor Gas. Other significant balance sheet changes include a

decrease

of

$868 million

in notes payable primarily related to a decrease in commercial paper borrowings of $840 million at Southern Company Gas Capital and $28 million at Nicor Gas. See

Sources of Capital

Southern Company Gas plans to obtain the funds to meet its future capital needs from sources similar to those used in the past, which were primarily from operating cash flows, external securities issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, and equity contributions from Southern Company. However, the amount, type, and timing of any future financings, if needed, depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory approval, and other factors. With respect to the public offering of securities, Southern Company Gas (excluding its subsidiaries) and Southern Company Gas Capital file registration statements with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The issuance of securities by Nicor Gas is generally subject to the approval of the Illinois Commission.

Southern Company Gas obtains separate financing without credit support from any affiliate in the Southern Company system. See Note


to the financial statements under "

Bank Credit Arrangements

" for additional information. The Southern Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, except as described below, funds of Southern Company Gas are not commingled with funds of any other company in the Southern Company system.

Southern Company Gas maintains commercial paper programs at Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas that consist of short-term, unsecured promissory notes. Nicor Gas' commercial paper program supports its working capital needs as Nicor Gas is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. All of Southern Company Gas' other subsidiaries benefit from Southern Company Gas Capital's commercial paper program.

At

December 31, 2018

, Southern Company Gas' current liabilities exceeded current assets by

$469 million

, primarily as a result of

$650 million

in notes payable and

$357 million

of securities due within one year. Southern Company Gas' current liabilities frequently exceed current assets because of commercial paper borrowings used to fund daily operations, scheduled maturities of long-term debt, and significant seasonal fluctuations in cash needs.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

At

December 31, 2018

, Southern Company Gas had

$64 million

of cash and cash equivalents. Committed credit arrangements with banks at

December 31, 2018

were as follows:

(a)

Southern Company Gas guarantees the obligations of Southern Company Gas Capital.

(b)

Pursuant to the credit arrangement, the allocations between Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas may be adjusted.

See Note


to the financial statements under "

Bank Credit Arrangements

" for additional information.

The multi-year credit arrangement of Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas (Facility) contains a covenant that limits the debt levels and contains a cross-acceleration provision to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) of the applicable company. Such cross-acceleration provision to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default of the applicable company if Southern Company Gas or Nicor Gas defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. At

December 31, 2018

, both companies were in compliance with such covenant. The Facility does not contain a material adverse change clause at the time of borrowings.

Subject to applicable market conditions, the applicable company expects to renew or replace the Facility as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, the applicable company may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. A portion of unused credit with banks provides liquidity support to Southern Company Gas.

Southern Company Gas has substantial cash flow from operating activities and access to capital markets, including the commercial paper programs, and financial institutions to meet liquidity needs. Southern Company Gas makes short-term borrowings primarily through commercial paper programs that have the liquidity support of the committed bank credit arrangements described above. Short-term borrowings are included in notes payable in the balance sheets.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

Details of short-term borrowings were as follows:

(*)

Average and maximum amounts are based upon daily balances during the 12-month periods.

Southern Company Gas believes that the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing commercial paper programs, lines of credit, and operating cash flows.

Financing Activities

The long-term debt on Southern Company Gas' balance sheets includes both principal and non-principal components. At

December 31, 2018

, the non-principal components totaled

$456 million

, including the amount attributable to long-term debt due within one year, which consisted of the unamortized portions of the fair value adjustment recorded in purchase accounting, debt premiums, debt discounts, and debt issuance costs.

In December 2016, Southern Company Gas executed intercompany promissory notes to further allocate interest expense to its reportable segments that previously remained in the "all other" segment. These intercompany promissory notes allow Southern Company Gas to calculate net income, which is its performance measure subsequent to the Merger, at the segment level that incorporates the full impact of interest costs.

Except as otherwise described herein, Southern Company Gas and its subsidiaries used the proceeds of debt issuances for their redemptions and maturities, to pay common stock dividends, to repay short-term indebtedness, for capital expenditures, and for general corporate purposes, including working capital.

In January 2018, Southern Company Gas issued a floating rate promissory note to Southern Company in an aggregate principal amount of $100 million bearing interest based on one-month LIBOR. In March 2018, Southern Company Gas repaid this promissory note.

Prior to its sale, in the second quarter 2018, Pivotal Utility Holdings caused $200 million aggregate principal amount of gas facility revenue bonds to be redeemed. Also in the second quarter 2018, Pivotal Utility Holdings, as borrower, and Southern Company Gas, as guarantor, entered into a $181 million short-term delayed draw floating rate bank term loan bearing interest

II-206


Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

based on one-month LIBOR, which Pivotal Utility Holdings used to repay the gas facility revenue bonds. In July 2018, Pivotal Utility Holdings repaid this short-term loan.

In May 2018, Southern Company Gas Capital borrowed $95 million pursuant to a short-term uncommitted bank credit arrangement, guaranteed by Southern Company Gas, bearing interest at a rate agreed upon by Southern Company Gas Capital and the bank from time to time and payable on no less than 30 days' demand by the bank. In July 2018, Southern Company Gas Capital repaid this loan.

Nicor Gas issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds in a private placement, of which $100 million was issued in August 2018 and $200 million was issued in November 2018.

In October 2018, Southern Company Gas Capital repaid at maturity $155 million aggregate principal amount of 3.50% Series B Senior Notes.

In addition to any financings that may be necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual obligations, Southern Company Gas plans to continue, when economically feasible, a program to retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit.

Credit Rating Risk

Southern Company Gas does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade.

There are certain contracts that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change below BBB- and/or Baa3. These contracts are for physical gas purchases and sales and energy price risk management. The maximum potential collateral requirement under these contracts at

December 31, 2018

was

$30 million

.

Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. Additionally, a credit rating downgrade could impact the ability of Southern Company Gas to access capital markets and would be likely to impact the cost at which it does so.

On September 28, 2018, Fitch assigned a negative rating outlook to the ratings of Southern Company and certain of its subsidiaries (including Southern Company Gas, Southern Company Gas Capital, and Nicor Gas).

As a result of the Tax Reform Legislation, certain financial metrics, such as the funds from operations to debt percentage, used by the credit rating agencies to assess Southern Company and its subsidiaries, including Southern Company Gas, may be negatively impacted. Southern Company Gas and its regulated subsidiaries have taken actions to mitigate the resulting impacts, which, among other alternatives, include adjusting capital structure. Absent actions by Southern Company and its subsidiaries that fully mitigate the impacts, Southern Company Gas', Southern Company Gas Capital's, and Nicor Gas' credit ratings could be negatively affected. The Georgia PSC's May 15, 2018 approval of a stipulation for Atlanta Gas Light's annual rate adjustment maintained the previously authorized earnings band and increased the equity ratio to address the negative cash flow and credit metric impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. See Note


to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for information on additional rate proceedings for Nicor Gas and Atlanta Gas Light expected to conclude in 2019.

Market Price Risk

Southern Company Gas is exposed to market risks, primarily commodity price risk, interest rate risk, and weather risk. Due to various cost recovery mechanisms, the natural gas distribution utilities of Southern Company Gas that sell natural gas directly to end-use customers have limited exposure to market volatility of natural gas prices. To manage the volatility attributable to these exposures, Southern Company Gas nets the exposures, where possible, to take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to Southern Company Gas' policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and risk management practices. Southern Company Gas uses derivatives to buy and sell natural gas as well as for hedging purposes and mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including, but not limited to, market valuation, value at risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis.

Certain natural gas distribution utilities of Southern Company Gas manage fuel-hedging programs implemented per the guidelines of their respective state regulatory agencies to hedge the impact of market fluctuations in natural gas prices for customers. For the weather risk associated with Nicor Gas, Southern Company Gas has a corporate weather hedging program that utilizes weather derivatives to reduce the risk of lower adjusted operating margins potentially resulting from significantly warmer-than-normal weather. In addition, certain non-regulated operations routinely utilize various types of derivative instruments to economically hedge certain commodity price and weather risks inherent in the natural gas industry. These instruments include a variety of exchange-traded and OTC energy contracts, such as forward contracts, futures contracts, options contracts, and swap agreements.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

Gas marketing services and wholesale gas services also actively manage storage positions through a variety of hedging transactions for the purpose of managing exposures arising from changing natural gas prices. These hedging instruments are used to substantially protect economic margins (as spreads between wholesale and retail natural gas prices widen between periods) and thereby minimize exposure to declining operating margins. Some of these economic hedge activities may not qualify, or may not be designated, for hedge accounting treatment. Southern Company Gas had no material change in market risk exposure for the year ended

December 31, 2018

when compared to the year ended

December 31, 2017

.

For the periods presented below, the changes in net fair value of derivative contracts were as follows:

(a)

Current period changes also include the changes in fair value of new contracts entered into during the period, if any.

(b)

Net fair value of derivative contracts outstanding excludes premium and intrinsic value associated with weather derivatives of $8 million and

$11 million

at

December 31, 2018

and 2017, respectively, and includes premium and intrinsic value associated with weather derivatives of

$4 million

at

December 31, 2016

, and

$5 million

at June 30, 2016.

The net hedge volume of energy-related derivative contracts for natural gas positions at

December 31, 2018

and


were as follows:

Southern Company Gas' derivative contracts are comprised of both long and short natural gas positions. A long position is a contract to purchase natural gas, and a short position is a contract to sell natural gas. The volume presented above represents the net of long natural gas positions of

4.16 billion

mmBtu and short natural gas positions of

4.04 billion

mmBtu at

December 31, 2018

and the net of long natural gas positions of

3.51 billion

mmBtu and short natural gas positions of

3.21 billion

mmBtu at

December 31, 2017

.

Energy-related derivative contracts that are designated as regulatory hedges relate primarily to Southern Company Gas' fuel-hedging programs. Therefore, gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in cost of natural gas as the underlying gas is used in operations and ultimately recovered through the respective cost recovery clause. Certain other gains and losses on energy-related derivatives, designated as cash flow hedges (which are mainly used to hedge anticipated purchases and sales), are initially deferred in OCI before being recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transaction. Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as incurred.

Some energy-related derivative contracts require physical delivery as opposed to financial settlement, and this type of derivative is both common and prevalent within the natural gas industry. When an energy-related derivative contract is settled physically, any cumulative unrealized gain or loss is reversed and the contract price is recognized in the respective line item representing the actual price of the underlying goods being delivered.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

Southern Company Gas uses OTC contracts that are not exchange traded but are fair valued using prices which are market observable, and thus fall into Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. See Note


to the financial statements for further discussion of fair value measurements.

The maturities of the energy-related derivative contracts at

December 31, 2018

were as follows:

(a)

Valued using NYMEX futures prices.

(b)

Valued using basis transactions that represent the cost to transport natural gas from a NYMEX delivery point to the contract delivery point. These transactions are based on quotes obtained either through electronic trading platforms or directly from brokers.

(c)

Excludes cash collateral of

$277 million

as well as premium and associated intrinsic value associated with weather derivatives of

$8 million

at

December 31, 2018

.

Value at Risk (VaR)

VaR is the maximum potential loss in portfolio value over a specified time period that is not expected to be exceeded within a given degree of probability. Southern Company Gas' VaR may not be comparable to that of other companies due to differences in the factors used to calculate VaR. Southern Company Gas' VaR is determined on a 95% confidence interval and a one-day holding period, which means that 95% of the time, the risk of loss in a day from a portfolio of positions is expected to be less than or equal to the amount of VaR calculated. The open exposure of Southern Company Gas is managed in accordance with established policies that limit market risk and require daily reporting of potential financial exposure to senior management. Because Southern Company Gas generally manages physical gas assets and economically protects its positions by hedging in the futures markets, Southern Company Gas' open exposure is generally mitigated. Southern Company Gas employs daily risk testing, using both VaR and stress testing, to evaluate the risk of its positions.

Southern Company Gas actively monitors open commodity positions and the resulting VaR and maintains a relatively small risk exposure as total buy volume is close to sell volume, with minimal open natural gas price risk. Based on a 95% confidence interval and employing a one-day holding period, SouthStar's portfolio of positions for all periods presented was immaterial.

For the periods presented below, wholesale gas services had the following VaRs:

(*)

Increases in VaR at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were driven by significant natural gas price increases in Sequent's key markets. The natural gas price increase in 2018 was driven by an industry-wide lower-than-normal natural gas storage inventory position and colder-than-normal weather in the middle of fourth quarter 2018. The natural gas price increase in 2017 was driven by colder-than-normal weather. As weather and natural gas prices moderated subsequent to December 31, 2018 and 2017, VaR reduced to a level consistent with December 31, 2016.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

Credit Risk

Gas Distribution Operations

Concentration of credit risk occurs at Atlanta Gas Light for amounts billed for services and other costs to its customers, which consist of


Marketers in Georgia. The credit risk exposure to Marketers varies seasonally, with the lowest exposure in the non-peak summer months and the highest exposure in the peak winter months. Marketers are responsible for the retail sale of natural gas to end-use customers in Georgia. The functions of the retail sale of gas include the purchase and sale of natural gas, customer service, billings, and collections. The provisions of Atlanta Gas Light's tariff allow Atlanta Gas Light to obtain credit security support in an amount equal to a minimum of two times a Marketer's highest month's estimated bill from Atlanta Gas Light. For


, the four largest Marketers based on customer count, which includes SouthStar, accounted for

20%

of Southern Company Gas' adjusted operating margin and

25%

of gas distribution operations' adjusted operating margin.

Several factors are designed to mitigate Southern Company Gas' risks from the increased concentration of credit that has resulted from deregulation. In addition to the security support described above, Atlanta Gas Light bills intrastate delivery service to Marketers in advance rather than in arrears. Atlanta Gas Light accepts credit support in the form of cash deposits, letters of credit/surety bonds from acceptable issuers, and corporate guarantees from investment-grade entities. On a monthly basis, a management risk oversight committee reviews the adequacy of credit support coverage, credit rating profiles of credit support providers, and payment status of each Marketer. Southern Company Gas believes that adequate policies and procedures are in place to properly quantify, manage, and report on Atlanta Gas Light's credit risk exposure to Marketers.

Atlanta Gas Light also faces potential credit risk in connection with assignments of interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity to Marketers. Although Atlanta Gas Light assigns this capacity to Marketers, in the event that a Marketer fails to pay the interstate pipelines for the capacity, the interstate pipelines would likely seek repayment from Atlanta Gas Light.

Wholesale Gas Services

Southern Company Gas has established credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties, as well as the quality of pledged collateral. Southern Company Gas also utilizes netting agreements whenever possible to mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk. When Southern Company Gas is engaged in more than one outstanding derivative transaction with the same counterparty and also has a legally enforceable netting agreement with that counterparty, the "net" mark-to-market exposure represents the netting of the positive and negative exposures with that counterparty and a reasonable measure of Southern Company Gas' credit risk. Southern Company Gas also uses other netting agreements with certain counterparties with whom it conducts significant transactions. Netting agreements enable Southern Company Gas to net certain assets and liabilities by counterparty. Southern Company Gas also nets across product lines and against cash collateral, provided the netting and cash collateral agreements include such provisions.

Southern Company Gas may require counterparties to pledge additional collateral when deemed necessary. Southern Company Gas conducts credit evaluations and obtains appropriate internal approvals for a counterparty's line of credit before any transaction with the counterparty is executed. In most cases, the counterparty must have an investment grade rating, which includes a minimum long-term debt rating of Baa3 from Moody's and BBB- from S&P. Generally, Southern Company Gas requires credit enhancements by way of a guaranty, cash deposit, or letter of credit for transaction counterparties that do not have investment grade ratings.

Certain of Southern Company Gas' derivative instruments contain credit-risk-related or other contingent features that could increase the payments for collateral it posts in the normal course of business when its financial instruments are in net liability positions. At

December 31, 2018

, for agreements with such features, Southern Company Gas' derivative instruments with liability fair values totaled

$5 million

for which Southern Company Gas had no collateral posted with derivatives counterparties to satisfy these arrangements.

Southern Company Gas has a concentration of credit risk as measured by its 30-day receivable exposure plus forward exposure. At

December 31, 2018

, wholesale gas services' top 20 counterparties represented approximately

48%

, or

$298 million

, of its total counterparty exposure and had a weighted average S&P equivalent credit rating of A-, all of which is consistent with the prior year. The S&P equivalent credit rating is determined by a process of converting the lower of the S&P or Moody's ratings to an internal rating ranging from 9 to 1, with 9 being equivalent to AAA/Aaa by S&P and Moody's, respectively, and 1 being D / Default by S&P and Moody's, respectively. A counterparty that does not have an external rating is assigned an internal rating based on the strength of the financial ratios of that counterparty. To arrive at the weighted average credit rating, each counterparty is assigned an internal ratio, which is multiplied by their credit exposure and summed for all counterparties. The sum is divided by the aggregate total counterparties' exposures, and this numeric value is then converted to a S&P equivalent.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

The following table provides credit risk information related to Southern Company Gas' third-party natural gas contracts receivable and payable positions at December 31:

Gas Marketing Services

Southern Company Gas obtains credit scores for its firm residential and small commercial customers using a national credit reporting agency, enrolling only those customers that meet or exceed Southern Company Gas' credit threshold. Southern Company Gas considers potential interruptible and large commercial customers based on reviews of publicly available financial statements and commercially available credit reports. Prior to entering into a physical transaction, Southern Company Gas also assigns physical wholesale counterparties an internal credit rating and credit limit based on the counterparties' Moody's, S&P, and Fitch ratings, commercially available credit reports, and audited financial statements.

Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations

Southern Company Gas' capital investments are currently estimated to total

$1.6 billion

for


,

$1.9 billion

for


,

$1.3 billion

for


,

$1.2 billion

for


, and

$1.3 billion

for


. The regulatory infrastructure programs and other construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions; changes in FERC rules and regulations; state regulatory agency approvals; changes in legislation; the cost and efficiency of labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered.

In addition, as discussed in Note


to the financial statements, Southern Company Gas provides postretirement benefits to certain eligible employees and funds trusts to the extent required by the applicable state regulatory agencies.

Funding requirements related to obligations associated with scheduled maturities of long-term debt, including the related interest; pipeline charges, storage capacity, and gas supply; operating leases; asset management agreements; financial derivative obligations; pension and other postretirement benefit plans; and other purchase commitments, primarily related to environmental remediation liabilities, are detailed in the contractual obligations table that follows.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

Contractual Obligations

Contractual obligations at

December 31, 2018

were as follows:

(a)

Amounts are reflected based on final maturity dates. Southern Company Gas plans to continue, when economically feasible, to retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit. Variable rate interest obligations are estimated based on rates at

December 31, 2018

, as reflected in the statements of capitalization.

(b)

Includes charges recoverable through a natural gas cost recovery mechanism, or alternatively billed to Marketers, and demand charges associated with Sequent. The gas supply balance includes amounts for Nicor Gas and SouthStar gas commodity purchase commitments of 47 million mmBtu at floating gas prices calculated using forward natural gas prices at

December 31, 2018

and valued at $150 million. Southern Company Gas provides guarantees to certain gas suppliers for certain of its subsidiaries, including SouthStar, in support of payment obligations.

(c)

Certain operating leases have provisions for step rent or escalation payments and certain lease concessions are accounted for by recognizing the future minimum lease payments on a straight-line basis over the respective minimum lease terms. However, this accounting treatment does not affect the future annual operating lease cash obligations as shown herein. In terms of rental charges and duration of contracts, Southern Company Gas' most significant operating leases relate to real estate.

(d)

Represent fixed-fee minimum payments for Sequent's affiliated asset management agreements.

(e)

See Notes


and


to the financial statements for additional information.

(f)

Amounts presented represent estimated benefit payments for the nonqualified pension plans, estimated non-trust benefit payments for the other postretirement benefit plans, and estimated contributions to the other postretirement benefit plan trusts, all of which will be made from Southern Company Gas' corporate assets. See Note


to the financial statements for additional information related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, including estimated benefit payments. Certain benefit payments will be made through the related benefit plans. Other benefit payments will be made from Southern Company Gas' corporate assets.

(g)

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of The Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of capitalization of The Southern Company and subsidiary companies (Southern Company) as of

December 31, 2018

and


, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2018

, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). We also have audited Southern Company's internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2018

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Southern Company as of

December 31, 2018

and


, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2018

, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, Southern Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2018

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by COSO.

Basis for Opinions

Southern Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on Southern Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Southern Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

To the stockholder and the Board of Directors of Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies

Opinion on the Financial Statements

December 31, 2018

and


, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2018

, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Southern Power as of

December 31, 2018

and


, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2018

, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of Southern Power's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Southern Power's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Southern Power in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Southern Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Southern Power's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of Southern Company Gas' management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Southern Company Gas' financial statements based on our audits. We did not audit the financial statements of Southern Natural Gas Company, L.L.C. (SNG), Southern Company Gas' investment in which is accounted for by the use of the equity method.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report


. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General

Southern Company is the parent company of the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, Southern Company Gas (as of July 1, 2016), SCS, Southern Linc, Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure (as of May 9, 2016), and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional electric operating companies – Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power (through December 31, 2018), and Mississippi Power – are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in

four

Southeastern states. On January 1, 2019, Southern Company completed the sale of Gulf Power to NextEra Energy. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. On May 22, 2018, Southern Power sold a noncontrolling

33%

equity interest in SP Solar, a limited partnership indirectly owning substantially all of Southern Power's solar facilities, and, on December 11, 2018, Southern Power sold a noncontrolling tax equity interest in SP Wind, a holding company owning a portfolio of

eight

operating wind facilities. On November 5, 2018, Southern Power entered into an agreement to sell all of its equity interests in Plant Mankato (including the


-MW expansion currently under construction). On December 4, 2018, Southern Power sold all of its equity interests in Plant Oleander and Plant Stanton Unit A (together, the Florida Plants) to NextEra Energy. Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through natural gas distribution utilities and is involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments, wholesale gas services, and gas marketing services. In July 2018, Southern Company Gas completed sales of

three

of its natural gas distribution utilities (Elizabethtown Gas (New Jersey), Florida City Gas, and Elkton Gas (Maryland)). The remaining natural gas distribution utilities include Nicor Gas (Illinois), Atlanta Gas Light (Georgia), Virginia Natural Gas, and Chattanooga Gas (Tennessee). In June 2018, Southern Company Gas also completed the sale of Pivotal Home Solutions, which provided home equipment protection products and services. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary, primarily for Southern Company's investments in leveraged leases and for other electric services. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants, including Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, and is currently managing construction of and developing Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which are co-owned by Georgia Power. PowerSecure is a provider of energy solutions, including distributed energy infrastructure, energy efficiency products and services, and utility infrastructure services, to customers. See Note


for additional information regarding disposition activities.

The registrants' financial statements reflect investments in subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The equity method is used for investments in entities in which a registrant has significant influence but does not control and for VIEs where a registrant has an equity investment but is not the primary beneficiary. Southern Power has consolidated renewable generation projects that are partially funded by tax equity investors. The related contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. Therefore, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in a HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period. See Note


for additional information.

The traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company Gas, and certain other subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC, and the traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities are also subject to regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. As such, the respective financial statements of the registrants reflect the effects of rate regulation in accordance with GAAP and comply with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by relevant state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates. Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the registrants' results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In addition, Southern Company Gas has recast its reportable segments. See Note


under "

Southern Company Gas

" for additional information.

At December 31, 2018, Southern Company and Southern Power each had assets and liabilities held for sale on their balance sheets. Unless otherwise noted, the disclosures herein related to specific asset and liability balances at December 31, 2018 exclude assets and liabilities held for sale. See Note


under "

Assets Held for Sale

" for additional information including Southern Company's and Southern Power's major classes of assets and liabilities classified as held for sale.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

Southern Company Gas

Pursuant to the Merger, Southern Company pushed down the application of the acquisition method of accounting to the financial statements of Southern Company Gas such that the assets and liabilities are recorded at their respective fair values, and goodwill was established for the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets. Accordingly, the financial statements of Southern Company Gas for periods before and after July 1, 2016 (acquisition date) reflect different bases of accounting, and the financial positions and results of operations of those periods are not comparable. Throughout Southern Company Gas' financial statements and the combined notes to the financial statements, periods prior to July 1, 2016 are identified as "predecessor," while periods after the acquisition date are identified as "successor."

Certain predecessor period data presented in Southern Company Gas' financial statements has been modified or reclassified to conform to the presentation used by Southern Company. Changes to Southern Company Gas' statements of income include classifying operating revenues as natural gas revenues and other revenues, as well as classifying cost of goods sold as cost of natural gas and cost of other sales and presenting interest expense and AFUDC on a gross basis. Changes to Southern Company Gas' statements of cash flows include revised financial statement line item descriptions to align with the new balance sheet descriptions and expanded line items within each category of cash flow activity.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

Revenue

In 2014, the FASB issued ASC 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

(ASC 606), replacing the existing accounting standard and industry-specific guidance for revenue recognition with a five-step model for recognizing and measuring revenue from contracts with customers. The underlying principle of the standard is to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at the amount expected to be collected. ASC 606 became effective on January 1, 2018 and the registrants adopted it using the modified retrospective method applied to open contracts and only to the version of contracts in effect as of January 1, 2018. In accordance with the modified retrospective method, the registrants' previously issued financial statements have not been restated to comply with ASC 606 and the registrants did not have a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. The adoption of ASC 606 had no significant impact on the timing of revenue recognition compared to previously reported results; however, it requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and the related cash flows arising from contracts with customers, which are included herein and in Note


.

ASC 606 provided additional clarity on financial statement presentation that resulted in reclassifications into other revenues and other operations and maintenance from other income/(expense), net at Alabama Power and Georgia Power primarily related to certain unregulated sales of products and services. In addition, contract assets related to certain fixed retail revenues at Georgia Power and Southern Company's unregulated distributed generation business have been reclassified from unbilled revenue in accordance with the guidance in ASC 606. These reclassifications did not affect the timing or amount of revenues recognized or cash flows. ASC 606 also provided additional guidance on revenue recognized over time, resulting in a change in the timing of revenue recognized from guaranteed and fixed billing arrangements at Southern Company Gas.

In 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18,

Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash

(ASU 2016-18). ASU 2016-18 eliminates the need to reflect transfers between cash and restricted cash in operating, investing, and financing activities in the statements of cash flows. In addition, the net change in cash and cash equivalents during the period includes amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. The registrants adopted ASU 2016-18 retrospectively effective January 1, 2018. Southern Company, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas have restated prior periods in the statements of cash flows by immaterial amounts. The change in restricted cash in the statements of cash flows was previously disclosed in operating activities for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas and in investing activities for Southern Company and Southern Power. See "

Restricted Cash

" herein for additional information.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04,

Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment

(ASU 2017-04). ASU 2017-04 removes the requirement to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount as part of Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. Under the new standard, the goodwill impairment loss will be measured as the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value, not exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit, which may increase the frequency of goodwill impairment charges if a future goodwill impairment test does not pass the Step 1 evaluation. ASU 2017-04 is effective prospectively for periods beginning on or after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The registrants adopted ASU 2017-04 effective January 1, 2018 with

no

impact on their respective financial statements.

In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07,

Compensation – Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost

(ASU 2017-07). ASU 2017-07 requires that an employer report the service cost component in the same line item or items as other compensation costs and requires the other components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs to be separately presented in the statements of income outside of income from operations. Additionally, only the service cost component is eligible for capitalization, when applicable. The registrants adopted ASU 2017-07 effective January 1, 2018 with no material impact on their respective financial statements. ASU 2017-07 has been applied retrospectively, with the service cost component of net periodic benefit costs included in operations and maintenance expenses and all other components of net periodic benefit costs included in other income (expense), net in the statements of income for all periods presented for Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Company Gas. The impacted registrants used the practical expedient provided by ASU 2017-07, which permits an employer to use the amounts disclosed in its retirement benefits note for prior comparative periods as the estimation basis for applying the retrospective presentation requirements to those periods. The amounts of the other components of net periodic benefit costs reclassified for the prior periods are presented in Note


. The presentation changes resulted in a decrease in operating income and an increase in other income for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 for each of the impacted registrants. Since Southern Power did not participate in the qualified pension and postretirement benefit plans until December 2017, no retrospective presentation of Southern Power's net periodic benefit costs is required. The requirement to limit capitalization to the service cost component of net periodic benefit costs has been applied on a prospective basis from the date of adoption for all registrants.

In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12,

Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities

(ASU 2017-12). ASU 2017-12 makes more financial and non-financial hedging strategies eligible for hedge accounting, amends the related presentation and disclosure requirements, and simplifies hedge effectiveness assessment requirements. ASU 2017-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The registrants adopted ASU 2017-12 effective January 1, 2018 with

no

material impact on their respective financial statements. See Note


for disclosures required by ASU 2017-12.

On February 14, 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02,

Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

(ASU 2018-02) to address the application of ASC 740,

Income Taxes

(ASC 740) to certain provisions of the Tax Reform Legislation. ASU 2018-02 specifically addresses the ASC 740 requirement that the effect of a change in tax laws or rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities be included in income from continuing operations, even when the tax effects were initially recognized directly in OCI at the previous rate, which strands the income tax rate differential in accumulated OCI. The amendments in ASU 2018-02 allow a reclassification from accumulated OCI to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Reform Legislation. The registrants adopted ASU 2018-02 effective January 1, 2018 with

no

material impact on their respective financial statements.

On August 28, 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14,

Compensation – Retirement Benefits – Defined Benefit Plans – General (Topic 715-20): Disclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans

(ASU 2018-14). ASU 2018-14 amends ASC 715 to add, remove, and clarify disclosure requirements related to defined benefit pension and other

for disclosures required by ASU 2018-14.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

The traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities are subject to accounting requirements for the effects of rate regulation. Regulatory assets represent probable future revenues associated with certain costs that are expected to be recovered from customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be credited to customers through the ratemaking process.

In the event that a portion of a traditional electric operating company's or a natural gas distribution utility's operations is no longer subject to applicable accounting rules for rate regulation, such company would be required to write off to income or reclassify to AOCI related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable through regulated rates. In addition, the traditional electric operating company or natural gas distribution utility would be required to determine if any impairment to other assets, including plant, exists and write down the assets, if impaired, to their fair values. All regulatory assets and liabilities are to be reflected in rates. See Note


for additional information including details of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected in the balance sheets for Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Company Gas.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

Revenues

The registrants generate revenues from a variety of sources which are accounted for under various revenue accounting guidance, including ASC 606, lease, derivative, and regulatory accounting. Other than the timing of recognition of guaranteed and fixed billing arrangements at Southern Company Gas, the adoption of ASC 606 had no impact on the timing or amount of revenue recognized under previous guidance. See "

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

–

Revenue

" herein and Note


for information regarding the registrants' adoption of ASC 606 and related disclosures.

Traditional Electric Operating Companies

The majority of the revenues of the traditional electric operating companies are generated from contracts with retail electric customers. Retail revenues recognized under ASC 606 are consistent with prior revenue recognition policies. These revenues, generated from the integrated service to deliver electricity when and if called upon by the customer, are recognized as a single performance obligation satisfied over time, at a tariff rate, and as electricity is delivered to the customer during the month. Unbilled revenues related to retail sales are accrued at the end of each fiscal period. Retail rates may include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, fuel hedging, the energy component of purchased power costs, and certain other costs. Revenues are adjusted for differences between these actual costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Under or over recovered regulatory clause revenues are recorded in the balance sheets and are recovered from or returned to customers, respectively, through adjustments to the billing factors. See Note


for additional information regarding regulatory matters of the traditional electric operating companies.

Wholesale capacity revenues from PPAs are recognized either on a levelized basis over the appropriate contract period or the amount billable under the contract terms. Energy and other revenues are generally recognized as services are provided. The accounting for these revenues under ASC 606 is consistent with prior revenue recognition policies. The contracts for capacity and energy in a wholesale PPA have multiple performance obligations where the contract's total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the standalone selling price. The standalone selling price is primarily determined by the price charged to customers for the specific goods or services transferred with the performance obligations. Generally, the traditional electric operating companies recognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied over time as electricity is delivered to the customer or as generation capacity is available to the customer.

For both retail and wholesale revenues, the traditional electric operating companies generally have a right to consideration in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the entity's performance completed to date and may recognize revenue in the amount to which the entity has a right to invoice and has elected to recognize revenue for its sales of electricity and capacity using the invoice practical expedient. In addition, payment for goods and services rendered is typically due in the subsequent month following satisfaction of the registrants' performance obligation.

Southern Power

Southern Power sells capacity and energy at rates specified under contractual terms in long-term PPAs. These PPAs are accounted for as operating leases, non-derivatives, or normal sale derivatives. Capacity revenues from PPAs classified as operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. Energy revenues are recognized in the period the energy is delivered.

Southern Power's non-lease contracts commonly include capacity and energy which are considered separate performance obligations. In these contracts, the total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the standalone selling price. The standalone selling price is primarily determined by the price charged to customers for the specific goods or services transferred with the performance obligations. Generally, Southern Power recognizes revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied over time, as electricity is delivered to the customer or as generation capacity is made available to the customer. The timing of revenue recognition was not affected by the adoption of ASC 606.

Southern Power generally has a right to consideration in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the entity's performance completed to date and may recognize revenue in the amount to which the entity has a right to invoice. In addition, payment for goods and services rendered is typically due in the subsequent month following satisfaction of Southern Power's performance obligation.

When multiple contracts exist with the same counterparty, the revenues from each contract are accounted for as separate arrangements.

Southern Power may also enter into contracts to sell short-term capacity in the wholesale electricity markets. These sales are generally classified as mark-to-market derivatives and net unrealized gains and losses on such contracts are recorded in wholesale revenues. See Note

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

Southern Company Gas

Gas Distribution Operations

Southern Company Gas records revenues when goods or services are provided to customers. Those revenues are based on rates approved by the state regulatory agencies of the natural gas distribution utilities. The natural gas market for Atlanta Gas Light was deregulated in 1997. Accordingly, Marketers, rather than a traditional utility, sell natural gas to end-use customers in Georgia and handle customer billing functions. As required by the Georgia PSC, Atlanta Gas Light bills Marketers in equal monthly installments for each residential, commercial, and industrial end-use customer's distribution costs as well as for capacity costs utilizing a seasonal rate design for the calculation of each residential end-use customer's annual straight-fixed-variable charge, which reflects the historic volumetric usage pattern for the entire residential class.

The majority of the revenues of Southern Company Gas are generated from contracts with natural gas distribution customers. Revenues from this integrated service to deliver gas when and if called upon by the customer is recognized as a single performance obligation satisfied over time and is recognized at a tariff rate as gas is delivered to the customer during the month.

The standalone selling price is primarily determined by the price charged to customers for the specific goods or services transferred with the performance obligations. Generally, Southern Company Gas recognizes revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied over time as natural gas is delivered to the customer. The performance obligations related to wholesale gas services are satisfied, and revenue is recognized, at a point in time when natural gas is delivered to the customer.

Southern Company Gas generally has a right to consideration in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the entity's performance completed to date and may recognize revenue in the amount to which the entity has a right to invoice and has elected to recognize revenue for its sales of natural gas using the invoice practical expedient. In addition, payment for goods and services rendered is typically due in the subsequent month following satisfaction of Southern Company Gas' performance obligation.

With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the natural gas distribution utilities have rate structures that include volumetric rate designs that allow the opportunity to recover certain costs based on gas usage. Revenues from sales and transportation services are recognized in the same period in which the related volumes are delivered to customers. Revenues from residential and certain commercial and industrial customers are recognized on the basis of scheduled meter readings. Additionally, unbilled revenues are recognized for estimated deliveries of gas not yet billed to these customers, from the last bill date to the end of the accounting period. For other commercial and industrial customers and for all wholesale customers, revenues are based on actual deliveries through the end of the period.

The tariffs for several of the natural gas distribution utilities include provisions which allow for the recognition of certain revenues prior to the time such revenues are billed to customers. These provisions are referred to as alternative revenue programs and provide for the recognition of certain revenues prior to billing, as long as the amounts recognized will be collected from customers within

24 months

of recognition. These programs are as follows:

•

Weather normalization adjustments

– reduce customer bills when winter weather is colder than normal and increase customer bills when weather is warmer than normal and are included in the tariffs for Virginia Natural Gas, Chattanooga Gas, and, prior to its sale, Elizabethtown Gas;

•

Revenue normalization mechanisms

– mitigate the impact of conservation and declining customer usage and are contained in the tariffs for Virginia Natural Gas, Chattanooga Gas, and, prior to its sale, Elkton Gas; and

•

Revenue true-up adjustment

– included within the provisions of the Georgia Rate Adjustment Mechanism (GRAM) program in which Atlanta Gas Light participates as a short-term alternative to formal rate case filings, the revenue true-up feature provides for a monthly positive (or negative) adjustment to record revenue in the amount of any variance to budgeted revenues, which are submitted and approved annually as a requirement of GRAM. Such adjustments are reflected in customer billings in a subsequent program year.

Wholesale Gas Services

Southern Company Gas nets revenues from energy and risk management activities with the associated costs. Profits from sales between segments are eliminated and are recognized as goods or services sold to end-use customers. Southern Company Gas records transactions that qualify as derivatives at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings in the period of change and characterized as unrealized gains or losses. Gains and losses on derivatives held for energy trading purposes are presented on a net basis in revenue.

II-274


Index to Financial Statements

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

Gas Marketing Services

Southern Company Gas recognizes revenues from natural gas sales and transportation services in the same period in which the related volumes are delivered to customers and recognizes sales revenues from residential and certain commercial and industrial customers on the basis of scheduled meter readings. Southern Company Gas also recognizes unbilled revenues for estimated deliveries of gas not yet billed to these customers from the most recent meter reading date to the end of the accounting period. For other commercial and industrial customers and for all wholesale customers, revenues are based on actual deliveries during the period.

Southern Company Gas recognizes revenues on


-month utility-bill management contracts as the lesser of cumulative earned or cumulative billed amounts. Prior to the sale of Pivotal Home Solutions, revenues for warranty and repair contracts were recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term while revenues for maintenance services were recognized at the time such services were performed. See Note


under "

Southern Company Gas

–

Sale of Pivotal Home Solutions

" for additional information.

Concentration of Revenue

Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power (with the exception of its cost-based MRA electric tariffs described below), and Southern Company Gas each have a diversified base of customers and no single customer or industry comprises

10%

or more of each company's revenues.

Mississippi Power serves long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and municipalities located in southeastern Mississippi under cost-based MRA electric tariffs, which are subject to regulation by the FERC. The contracts with these wholesale customers represent

ed

17.3%

of

Mississippi Power

's total operating revenues in


and are generally subject to


-year rolling

c

ancellation notices. Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any changes in contractual relationships for one customer are likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers.

Significant portions of Southern Power's revenues have been derived from certain customers pursuant to PPAs. The following table shows the percentage of total revenues for Southern Power's top three customers for each of the years presented:

On January 29, 2019, Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) filed petitions to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Southern Power, together with its noncontrolling partners, owns

four

solar facilities where PG&E is the energy off-taker for approximately


MWs of capacity under long-term PPAs. PG&E is also the transmission provider for these facilities and two of Southern Power's other solar facilities. Southern Power has evaluated the recoverability of its investments in these solar facilities under various scenarios, including selling the related energy into the competitive markets, and has concluded they are not impaired. At December 31, 2018, Southern Power had outstanding accounts receivables due from PG&E of

$1 million

related to the PPAs and

$36 million

related to the transmission interconnections (of which

$17 million

is classified in other deferred charges and assets). Southern Power does not expect a material impact to its financial statements if, as a result of the bankruptcy proceedings, PG&E does not perform in accordance with the PPAs or the terms of the PPAs are renegotiated; however, the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Fuel Costs

Fuel costs for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power are expensed as the fuel is used. Fuel expense generally includes fuel transportation costs and the cost of purchased emissions allowances as they are used. For Alabama Power and Georgia Power, fuel expense also includes the amortization of the cost of nuclear fuel. For the traditional electric operating companies, fuel costs also include gains and/or losses from fuel-hedging programs as approved by their respective state PSCs.

Cost of Natural Gas

Excluding Atlanta Gas Light, which does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, Southern Company Gas charges its utility customers for natural gas consumed using natural gas cost recovery mechanisms set by the applicable state regulatory agencies.

II-275


Index to Financial Statements

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

Under these mechanisms, all prudently-incurred natural gas costs are passed through to customers without markup, subject to regulatory review. Southern Company Gas defers or accrues the difference between the actual cost of natural gas and the amount of commodity revenue earned in a given period such that no operating income is recognized related to these costs. The deferred or accrued amount is either billed or refunded to customers prospectively through adjustments to the commodity rate. Deferred and accrued natural gas costs are included in the balance sheets as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities, respectively.

Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services' customers are charged for actual or estimated natural gas consumed. Within cost of natural gas, Southern Company Gas also includes costs of lost and unaccounted for gas, adjustments to reduce the value of inventories to market value, and gains and losses associated with certain derivatives.

Income Taxes

The registrants use the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provide deferred income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences. In accordance with regulatory requirements, deferred federal ITCs for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas are amortized over the average lives of the related property, with such amortization normally applied as a credit to reduce depreciation in the statements of income.

Under current tax law, certain projects at Southern Power related to the construction of renewable facilities are eligible for federal ITCs. Southern Power estimates eligible costs which, as they relate to acquisitions, may not be finalized until the allocation of the purchase price to assets has been finalized. Southern Power applies the deferred method to ITCs. Under the deferred method, the ITCs are recorded as a deferred credit and amortized to income tax expense over the life of the respective asset. Furthermore, the tax basis of the asset is reduced by

50%

of the ITCs received, resulting in a net deferred tax asset. Southern Power has elected to recognize the tax benefit of this basis difference as a reduction to income tax expense in the year in which the plant reaches commercial operation. State ITCs are recognized as an income tax benefit in the period in which the credits are generated. In addition, certain projects are eligible for federal and state PTCs, which are recognized as an income tax benefit based on KWH production.

Federal ITCs and PTCs, as well as state ITCs and other state tax credits available to reduce income taxes payable, were not fully utilized in


and will be carried forward and utilized in future years. In addition, Southern Company is expected to have various state net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards for certain of its subsidiaries, which would result in income tax benefits in the future, if utilized. See Note


under "

Current and Deferred Income Taxes

–

Tax Credit Carryforwards

" and "

–

Net Operating Loss Carryforwards

" for additional information.

The registrants recognize tax positions that are "more likely than not" of being sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities. See Note


under "

Unrecognized Tax Benefits

" for additional information.

Other Taxes

Taxes imposed on and collected from customers on behalf of governmental agencies are presented net on the registrants' statements of income and are excluded from the transaction price in determining the revenue related to contracts with a customer accounted for under ASC 606.

Southern Company Gas is taxed on its gas revenues by various governmental authorities, but is allowed to recover these taxes from its customers. Revenue taxes imposed on the natural gas distribution utilities are recorded at the amount charged to customers, which may include a small administrative fee, as operating revenues, and the related taxes imposed on Southern Company Gas are recorded as operating expenses on the statements of income. Revenue taxes included in operating expenses were

$111 million

and

$98 million

for the successor years ended

December 31, 2018

and


, respectively,

$31 million

for the successor period of

July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016

, and

$56 million

for the predecessor period of

January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016

.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction and Interest Capitalized

The traditional electric operating companies and certain of the natural gas distribution utilities (Atlanta Gas Light, Chattanooga Gas, and Nicor Gas) record AFUDC, which represents the estimated debt and equity costs of capital funds that are necessary to finance the construction of new regulated facilities. While cash is not realized currently, AFUDC increases the revenue requirement and is recovered over the service life of the asset through a higher rate base and higher depreciation. The equity component of AFUDC is not taxable.

Interest related to the construction of new facilities at Southern Power and new facilities not included in the traditional electric operating companies' and Southern Company Gas' regulated rates is capitalized in accordance with standard interest capitalization requirements.

(b)

Variable rate determined by the FERC method of AFUDC accounting.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The registrants evaluate long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on either a specific regulatory disallowance, a sales transaction price that is less than the asset group's carrying value, or an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group, as compared with the carrying value of the assets. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by either the amount of regulatory disallowance or by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. For assets identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value less the cost to sell in order to determine if an impairment loss is required. Until the assets are disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or events change. See Note

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Liabilities

Southern Power's intangible assets consist primarily of certain PPAs acquired, which are amortized over the term of the respective PPA. Southern Company Gas' goodwill and other intangible assets and liabilities primarily relate to its 2016 acquisition by Southern Company. In addition to these items, Southern Company's goodwill and other intangible assets also relate to its 2016 acquisition of PowerSecure. See Note


under "

December 31, 2018

, the accumulated amortization of these intangible liabilities was

$74 million

. In 2019, the remaining

$17 million

of amortization associated with the intangible liabilities will be recorded in natural gas revenues.

Acquisition Accounting

At the time of an acquisition, management will assess whether acquired assets and activities meet the definition of a business. For acquisitions that meet the definition of a business, operating results from the date of acquisition are included in the acquiring entity's financial statements. The purchase price, including any contingent consideration, is allocated based on the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed (including any intangible assets). Assets acquired that do not meet the definition of a business are accounted for as an asset acquisition.

The purchase price of each asset acquisition is allocated based on the relative fair value of assets acquired. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management judgment and management may engage independent valuation experts to assist in this process. Fair values are determined by using market participant assumptions and typically include the timing and amounts of future cash flows, incurred construction costs, the nature of acquired contracts, discount rates, power market prices, and expected asset lives. Any due diligence or transition costs incurred for potential or successful acquisitions are expensed as incurred.

Historically, contingent consideration primarily relates to fixed amounts due to the seller once an acquired construction project is placed in service. For contingent consideration with variable payments, management fair values the arrangement with any changes recorded in the statements of income. See Note


for additional fair value information.

Development Costs

For Southern Power, development costs are capitalized once a project is probable of completion, primarily based on a review of its economics and operational feasibility, as well as status of power off-take agreements and regulatory approvals, if applicable. Southern Power's capitalized development costs are included in CWIP on the balance sheets. All of Southern Power's development costs incurred prior to the determination that a project is probable of completion are expensed as incurred and included in other operations and maintenance expense in the statements of income. If it is determined that a project is no longer probable of completion, any of Southern Power's capitalized development costs are expensed and included in other operations and maintenance expense in the statements of income.

Long-Term Service Agreements

The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power have entered into LTSAs for the purpose of securing maintenance support for certain of their generating facilities. The LTSAs cover all planned inspections on the covered equipment,

II-280


Index to Financial Statements

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

which generally includes the cost of all labor and materials. The LTSAs also obligate the counterparties to cover the costs of unplanned maintenance on the covered equipment subject to limits and scope specified in each contract.

Payments made under the LTSAs for the performance of any planned inspections or unplanned capital maintenance are recorded in the statements of cash flows as investing activities. Receipts of major parts into materials and supplies inventory prior to planned inspections are treated as noncash transactions in the statements of cash flows. Any payments made prior to the work being performed are recorded as prepayments in other current assets and noncurrent assets on the balance sheets. At the time work is performed, an appropriate amount is accrued for future payments or transferred from the prepayment and recorded as property, plant, and equipment or expensed.

Transmission Receivables/Prepayments

As a result of Southern Power's acquisition and construction of generating facilities, Southern Power has transmission receivables and/or prepayments representing the portion of interconnection network and transmission upgrades that will be reimbursed to Southern Power. Upon completion of the related project, transmission costs are generally reimbursed by the interconnection provider within a

five

-year period and the receivable/prepayments are reduced as payments or services are received.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are considered cash equivalents. Temporary cash investments are securities with original maturities of

90 days

or less.

Leveraged Leases

A subsidiary of Southern Holdings has several leveraged lease agreements, with original terms ranging up to

45 years

, which relate to international and domestic energy generation, distribution, and transportation assets. Southern Company receives federal income tax deductions for depreciation and amortization, as well as interest on long-term debt related to these investments. Southern Company reviews all important lease assumptions at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that a change in assumptions has occurred or may occur. These assumptions include the effective tax rate, the residual value, the credit quality of the lessees, and the timing of expected tax cash flows.

The ability of the lessees to make required payments to the Southern Holdings subsidiary is dependent on the operational performance of the assets. In 2017, the financial and operational performance of one of the lessees and the associated generation assets raised significant concerns about the short-term ability of the generation assets to produce cash flows sufficient to support ongoing operations and the lessee's contractual obligations and its ability to make the remaining semi-annual lease payments to the Southern Holdings subsidiary beginning in June 2018. As a result of operational improvements in 2018, the 2018 lease payments were paid in full. However, operational issues and the resulting cash liquidity challenges persist and significant concerns continue regarding the lessee's ability to make the remaining semi-annual lease payments. These operational challenges may also impact the expected residual value of the assets at the end of the lease term in 2047. If any future lease payment is not paid in full, the Southern Holdings subsidiary may be unable to make its corresponding payment to the holders of the underlying non-recourse debt related to the generation assets. Failure to make the required payment to the debtholders could represent an event of default that would give the debtholders the right to foreclose on, and take ownership of, the generation assets from the Southern Holdings subsidiary, in effect terminating the lease and resulting in the write-off of the related lease receivable, which would result in a reduction in net income of approximately

$86 million

after tax based on the lease receivable balance at

December 31, 2018

. Southern Company has evaluated the recoverability of the lease receivable and the expected residual value of

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

the generation assets at the end of the lease under various scenarios and has concluded that its investment in the leveraged lease is not impaired at

December 31, 2018

. Southern Company will continue to monitor the operational performance of the underlying assets and evaluate the ability of the lessee to continue to make the required lease payments. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Southern Company's net investment in domestic and international leveraged leases consists of the following at December 31:

A summary of the components of income from the leveraged leases follows:

Materials and Supplies

Materials and supplies for the traditional electric operating companies generally includes the average cost of transmission, distribution, and generating plant materials. Materials and supplies for Southern Company Gas generally includes propane gas inventory, fleet fuel, and other materials and supplies. Materials and supplies for Southern Power generally includes the average cost of generating plant materials.

Materials are recorded to inventory when purchased and then expensed or capitalized to property, plant, and equipment, as appropriate, at weighted average cost when installed. In addition, certain major parts are recorded as inventory when acquired and then capitalized at cost when installed to property, plant, and equipment.

Fuel Inventory

Fuel inventory for the traditional electric operating companies includes the average cost of coal, natural gas, oil, transportation, and emissions allowances. Fuel inventory for Southern Power, which is included in other current assets, includes the average cost of oil, natural gas, biomass, and emissions allowances. Fuel is recorded to inventory when purchased and then expensed, at weighted average cost, as used. Emissions allowances granted by the EPA are included in inventory at zero cost. The traditional electric operating companies recover fuel expense through fuel cost recovery rates approved by each state PSC or, for wholesale rates, the FERC.

Natural Gas for Sale

With the exception of Nicor Gas, the natural gas distribution utilities record natural gas inventories on a WACOG basis. In Georgia's deregulated, competitive environment, Marketers sell natural gas to firm end-use customers at market-based prices. On a monthly basis, Atlanta Gas Light assigns to Marketers the majority of the pipeline storage services that it has under contract, along with a corresponding amount of inventory. Atlanta Gas Light retains and manages a portion of its pipeline storage assets and related natural gas inventories for system balancing and to serve system demand.

Nicor Gas' natural gas inventory is carried at cost on a LIFO basis. Inventory decrements occurring during the year that are restored prior to year end are charged to cost of natural gas at the estimated annual replacement cost. Inventory decrements that are not restored prior to year end are charged to cost of natural gas at the actual LIFO cost of the inventory layers liquidated. The cost of natural gas, including inventory costs, is recovered from customers under a purchased gas recovery mechanism adjusted

II-283


Index to Financial Statements

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

for differences between actual costs and amounts billed; therefore, LIFO liquidations have no impact on Southern Company's or Southern Company Gas' net income. At

December 31, 2018

, the Nicor Gas LIFO inventory balance was

$165 million

. Based on the average cost of gas purchased in December


, the estimated replacement cost of Nicor Gas' inventory at

December 31, 2018

was

$409 million

. During


, Nicor Gas did not liquidate any LIFO-based inventory.

Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services, wholesale gas services, and all other segments record inventory at LOCOM, with cost determined on a WACOG basis. For these segments, Southern Company Gas evaluates the weighted average cost of its natural gas inventories against market prices to determine whether any declines in market prices below the WACOG are other than temporary. For any declines considered to be other than temporary, Southern Company Gas recorded LOCOM adjustments to cost of natural gas to reduce the value of its natural gas inventories to market value. LOCOM adjustments were

$10 million

during


for wholesale gas services and immaterial for all other periods presented.

Energy Marketing Receivables and Payables

Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas services provides services to retail gas marketers, wholesale gas marketers, utility companies, and industrial customers. These counterparties utilize netting agreements that enable wholesale gas services to net receivables and payables by counterparty upon settlement. Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas services also nets across product lines and against cash collateral, provided the netting and cash collateral agreements include such provisions. While the amounts due from, or owed to, wholesale gas services' counterparties are settled net, they are recorded on a gross basis in the balance sheets as energy marketing receivables and energy marketing payables.

Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas services has trade and credit contracts that contain minimum credit rating requirements. These credit rating requirements typically give counterparties the right to suspend or terminate credit if Southern Company Gas' credit ratings are downgraded to non-investment grade status. Under such circumstances, Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas services would need to post collateral to continue transacting business with some of its counterparties. As of

December 31, 2018

and


, the required collateral in the event of a credit rating downgrade was

$30 million

and

$8 million

, respectively.

Credit policies were established to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties, including requirements to post collateral or other credit security, as well as the quality of pledged collateral. Collateral or credit security is most often in the form of cash or letters of credit from an investment-grade financial institution, but may also include cash or U.S. government securities held by a trustee. When Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas services is engaged in more than one outstanding derivative transaction with the same counterparty and it also has a legally enforceable netting agreement with that counterparty, the "net" mark-to-market exposure represents the netting of the positive and negative exposures with that counterparty combined with a reasonable measure of Southern Company Gas' credit risk. Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas services also uses other netting agreements with certain counterparties with whom it conducts significant transactions.

See "

Concentration of Credit Risk

" herein for additional information.

Provision for Uncollectible Accounts

The customers of the traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities are billed monthly. For the majority of receivables, a provision for uncollectible accounts is established based on historical collection experience and other factors. For the remaining receivables, if the company is aware of a specific customer's inability to pay, a provision for uncollectible accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable balance to the amount reasonably expected to be collected. If circumstances change, the estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could change as well. Circumstances that could affect this estimate include, but are not limited to, customer credit issues, customer deposits, and general economic conditions. Customers' accounts are written off once they are deemed to be uncollectible. For all periods presented, uncollectible accounts averaged less than

1%

of revenues for each registrant.

Credit risk exposure at Nicor Gas is mitigated by a bad debt rider approved by the Illinois Commission. The bad debt rider provides for the recovery from (or refund to) customers of the difference between Nicor Gas' actual bad debt experience on an annual basis and the benchmark bad debt expense used to establish its base rates for the respective year.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas services business has a concentration of credit risk for services it provides to its counterparties. This credit risk is generally concentrated in


of its counterparties and is measured by 30-day receivable exposure plus forward exposure. Counterparty credit risk is evaluated using a S&P equivalent credit rating, which is determined by a process of converting the lower of the S&P or Moody's rating to an internal rating ranging from


to


, with


being equivalent to AAA/Aaa by S&P and Moody's, respectively, and 1 being equivalent to D/Default by S&P and Moody's, respectively. A counterparty that does not have an external rating is assigned an internal rating based on the strength of its financial ratios. As of

II-284


Index to Financial Statements

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

December 31, 2018

, the top


counterparties represented

48%

, or

$298 million

, of the total counterparty exposure and had a weighted average S&P equivalent rating of A-.

Concentration of credit risk occurs at Atlanta Gas Light for amounts billed for services and other costs to its customers, which consist of


Marketers in Georgia (including SouthStar). The credit risk exposure to Marketers varies seasonally, with the lowest exposure in the non-peak summer months and the highest exposure in the peak winter months. Marketers are responsible for the retail sale of natural gas to end-use customers in Georgia. The functions of the retail sale of gas include the purchase and sale of natural gas, customer service, billings, and collections. The provisions of Atlanta Gas Light's tariff allow Atlanta Gas Light to obtain credit security support in an amount equal to a minimum of

two

times a Marketer's highest month's estimated bill from Atlanta Gas Light.

Financial Instruments

The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, the prices of certain fuel purchases, electricity purchases and sales, and occasionally foreign currency exchange rates. Southern Company Gas uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices, weather, interest rates, and commodity prices. All derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheets (included in "Other" or shown separately as "Risk Management Activities") and are measured at fair value. See Note


for additional information regarding fair value. Substantially all of the traditional electric operating companies' and Southern Power's bulk energy purchases and sales contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are excluded from fair value accounting requirements because they qualify for the "normal" scope exception, and are accounted for under the accrual method. Derivative contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions or are recoverable through the traditional electric operating companies' and the natural gas distribution utilities' fuel-hedging programs result in the deferral of related gains and losses in AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities, respectively, until the hedged transactions occur. For 2017 and 2016, ineffectiveness arising from cash flow hedges was recognized in net income. Upon the adoption of ASU 2017-12 in 2018, ineffectiveness is no longer separately measured and recorded in earnings. See "

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

" herein for additional information. Other derivative contracts that qualify as fair value hedges are marked to market through current period income and are recorded on a net basis in the statements of income. Cash flows from derivatives are classified on the statements of cash flows in the same category as the hedged item. See Note


for additional information regarding derivatives.

The registrants offset fair value amounts recognized for multiple derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under netting arrangements. The registrants had

no

outstanding collateral repayment obligations or rights to reclaim collateral arising from derivative instruments recognized at

December 31, 2018

.

The registrants are exposed to potential losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties' nonperformance. The registrants have established risk management policies and controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate their exposure to counterparty credit risk.

Southern Company Gas

Southern Company Gas enters into weather derivative contracts as economic hedges of natural gas revenues in the event of warmer-than-normal weather in the Heating Season. Exchange-traded options are carried at fair value, with changes reflected in natural gas revenues. Non-exchange-traded options are accounted for using the intrinsic value method. Changes in the intrinsic value for non-exchange-traded contracts are also reflected in natural gas revenues in the statements of income.

Wholesale gas services purchases natural gas for storage when the current market price paid to buy and transport natural gas plus the cost to store and finance the natural gas is less than the market price that can be received in the future, resulting in positive net natural gas revenues. NYMEX futures and OTC contracts are used to sell natural gas at that future price to substantially protect the natural gas revenues that will ultimately be realized when the stored natural gas is sold. Southern Company Gas enters into transactions to secure transportation capacity between delivery points in order to serve its customers and various markets. NYMEX futures and OTC contracts are used to capture the price differential or spread between the locations served by the capacity in order to substantially protect the natural gas revenues that will ultimately be realized when the physical flow of natural gas between delivery points occurs. These contracts generally meet the definition of derivatives and are carried at fair value on the balance sheets, with changes in fair value recorded in natural gas revenues on the statements of income in the period of change. These contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.

The purchase, transportation, storage, and sale of natural gas are accounted for on a weighted average cost or accrual basis, as appropriate, rather than on the fair value basis utilized for the derivatives used to mitigate the natural gas price risk associated with the storage and transportation portfolio. Monthly demand charges are incurred for the contracted storage and transportation

capacity and payments associated with asset management agreements, and these demand charges and payments are recognized on the statements of income in the period they are incurred. This difference in accounting methods can result in volatility in reported earnings, even though the economic margin is substantially unchanged from the dates the transactions were consummated.

Comprehensive Income

The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of all changes in common stock equity of an enterprise that result from transactions and other economic events of the period other than transactions with owners. Comprehensive income consists of net income attributable to the registrant, changes in the fair value of qualifying cash flow hedges, and reclassifications for amounts included in net income. Comprehensive income also consists of certain changes in pension and other postretirement benefit plans for Southern Company, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas.

AOCI (loss) balances, net of tax effects, for Southern Company, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas were as follows:

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

Rate RSE

The Alabama PSC has adopted Rate RSE that provides for periodic annual adjustments based upon Alabama Power's projected weighted common equity return (WCER) compared to an allowable range. Rate RSE adjustments are based on forward-looking information for the applicable upcoming calendar year. Rate RSE adjustments for any

two

-year period, when averaged together, cannot exceed

4.0%

and any annual adjustment is limited to

5.0%

. When the projected WCER is under the allowed range, there is an adjusting point of

5.98%

and eligibility for a performance-based adder of seven basis points, or

0.07%

, to the WCER adjusting point if Alabama Power (i) has an "A" credit rating equivalent with at least one of the recognized rating agencies or (ii) is in the top

one-third

of a designated customer value benchmark survey. If Alabama Power's actual retail return is above the allowed WCER range, the excess will be refunded to customers unless otherwise directed by the Alabama PSC; however, there is no provision for additional customer billings should the actual retail return fall below the WCER range. Prior to January 2019, retail rates remained unchanged when the WCER range was between

5.75%

and

6.21%

.

At December 31, 2016, Alabama Power's retail return exceeded the allowed WCER range which resulted in Alabama Power establishing a

$73 million

Rate RSE refund liability. In accordance with an Alabama PSC order issued in February 2017, Alabama Power applied the full amount of the refund to reduce the under recovered balance of Rate CNP PPA as discussed further below.

Effective in January 2017, Rate RSE increased

4.48%

, or

$245 million

annually. At December 31, 2017, Alabama Power's actual retail return was within the allowed WCER range. Retail rates under Rate RSE were unchanged for 2018.

In conjunction with Rate RSE, Alabama Power has an established retail tariff that provides for an adjustment to customer billings to recognize the impact of a change in the statutory income tax rate. In accordance with this tariff, Alabama Power returned

$267 million

to retail customers through bill credits during 2018 as a result of the change in the federal income tax rate under the Tax Reform Legislation.

On May 1, 2018, the Alabama PSC approved modifications to Rate RSE and other commitments designed to position Alabama Power to address the growing pressure on its credit quality resulting from the Tax Reform Legislation, without increasing retail rates under Rate RSE in the near term. Alabama Power plans to reduce growth in total debt by increasing equity, with corresponding reductions in debt issuances, thereby de-leveraging its capital structure. Alabama Power's goal is to achieve an equity ratio of approximately

55%

by the end of 2025. At December 31, 2018, Alabama Power's equity ratio was approximately

47%

.

The approved modifications to Rate RSE began for billings in January 2019. The modifications include reducing the top of the allowed WCER range from

6.21%

to

6.15%

and modifications to the refund mechanism applicable to prior year actual results. The modifications to the refund mechanism allow Alabama Power to retain a portion of the revenue that causes the actual WCER for a given year to exceed the allowed range.

Generally, if Alabama Power's actual WCER is between

6.15%

and

7.65%

, customers will receive

25%

of the amount between

6.15%

and

6.65%

,

40%

of the amount between

6.65%

and

7.15%

, and

75%

of the amount between

7.15%

and

7.65%

. Customers will receive all amounts in excess of an actual WCER of

7.65%

.

In conjunction with these modifications to Rate RSE, on May 8, 2018, Alabama Power consented to a moratorium on any upward adjustments under Rate RSE for 2019 and 2020 and will also return

$50 million

to customers through bill credits in 2019.

On November 30, 2018, Alabama Power made its required annual Rate RSE submission to the Alabama PSC of projected data for calendar year 2019. Projected earnings were within the specified range; therefore, retail rates under Rate RSE remain unchanged for 2019.

At December 31, 2018, Alabama Power's retail return exceeded the allowed WCER range, which resulted in Alabama Power establishing a regulatory liability of

$109 million

for Rate RSE refunds. In accordance with an Alabama PSC order issued on February 5, 2019, Alabama Power will apply

$75 million

to reduce the Rate ECR under recovered balance and the remaining

$34 million

will be refunded to customers through bill credits in July through September 2019.

Rate CNP PPA

Alabama Power's retail rates, approved by the Alabama PSC, provide for adjustments under Rate CNP to recognize the placing of new generating facilities into retail service. Alabama Power may also recover retail costs associated with certificated PPAs under Rate CNP PPA. No adjustments to Rate CNP PPA occurred during the period 2016 through 2018 and no adjustment is expected in 2019. At

December 31, 2018

and


, Alabama Power had an under recovered Rate CNP PPA balance of

$25 million

and

$12 million

, respectively, which is included in deferred under recovered regulatory clause revenues in the balance sheet.

In accordance with an accounting order issued in February 2017 by the Alabama PSC, Alabama Power eliminated the under recovered balance in Rate CNP PPA at December 31, 2016, which totaled approximately

$142 million

. As discussed herein under

"Rate RSE," Alabama Power utilized the full amount of its

$73 million

Rate RSE refund liability to reduce the amount of the Rate CNP PPA under recovery and reclassified the remaining

$69 million

to a separate regulatory asset. The amortization of the new regulatory asset through Rate RSE will begin concurrently with the effective date of Alabama Power's next depreciation study, which is expected to occur no later than 2022. Alabama Power's current depreciation study became effective January 1, 2017.

Rate CNP Compliance

Rate CNP Compliance allows for the recovery of Alabama Power's retail costs associated with laws, regulations, and other such mandates directed at the utility industry involving the environment, security, reliability, safety, sustainability, or similar considerations impacting Alabama Power's facilities or operations. Rate CNP Compliance is based on forward-looking information and provides for the recovery of these costs pursuant to a factor that is calculated annually. Compliance costs to be recovered include operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation, and a return on certain invested capital. Revenues for Rate CNP Compliance, as recorded on the financial statements, are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor will have no significant effect on Southern Company's or Alabama Power's revenues or net income, but will affect annual cash flow. Changes in Rate CNP Compliance-related operations and maintenance expenses and depreciation generally will have

no

effect on Southern Company's or Alabama Power's net income.

In accordance with an accounting order issued in February 2017 by the Alabama PSC, Alabama Power reclassified

$36 million

of its under recovered balance in Rate CNP Compliance to a separate regulatory asset. The amortization of the new regulatory asset through Rate RSE will begin concurrently with the effective date of Alabama Power's next depreciation study, which is expected to occur no later than 2022. Alabama Power's current depreciation study became effective January 1, 2017.

In December 2017, the Alabama PSC issued a consent order that Alabama Power leave in effect for 2018 the factors associated with Alabama Power's compliance costs for the year 2017, with any under-collected amount for prior years deemed recovered before any current year amounts.

On November 30, 2018, Alabama Power submitted calculations associated with its cost of complying with environmental mandates, as provided under Rate CNP Compliance. The filing reflected a projected unrecovered retail revenue requirement for environmental compliance of approximately

$205 million

, which is being recovered in the billing months of January 2019 through December 2019.

At

December 31, 2018

, Alabama Power had an under recovered Rate CNP Compliance balance of

$42 million

, which is included in customer accounts receivable, and

$17 million

at December 31,


included in deferred under recovered regulatory clause revenues in the balance sheet.

Rate ECR

Alabama Power has established energy cost recovery rates under Alabama Power's Rate ECR as approved by the Alabama PSC. Rates are based on an estimate of future energy costs and the current over or under recovered balance. Revenues recognized under Rate ECR and recorded on the financial statements are adjusted for the difference in actual recoverable fuel costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. The difference in the recoverable fuel costs and amounts billed give rise to the over or under recovered amounts recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities. Alabama Power, along with the Alabama PSC, continually monitors the over or under recovered cost balance to determine whether an adjustment to billing rates is required. Changes in the Rate ECR factor have no significant effect on Southern Company's or Alabama Power's net income, but will impact operating cash flows.

In accordance with an accounting order issued in February 2017 by the Alabama PSC, Alabama Power reclassified

$36 million

of its under recovered balance in Rate ECR to a separate regulatory asset. The amortization of the new regulatory asset through Rate RSE will begin concurrently with the effective date of Alabama Power's next depreciation study, which is expected to occur no later than 2022. Alabama Power's current depreciation study became effective January 1, 2017.

In December 2017, the Alabama PSC issued a consent order that Alabama Power leave in effect for 2018 the energy cost recovery rates which began in 2017.

On May 1, 2018, the Alabama PSC approved an increase to Rate ECR from

2.015

cents per KWH to

2.353

cents per KWH effective July 2018 through December 2018. On December 4, 2018, the Alabama PSC issued a consent order to leave this rate in effect through December 31, 2019. This change is expected to increase collections by approximately

$183 million

in 2019. Absent any further order from the Alabama PSC, in January 2020, the rates will return to the originally authorized

5.910

cents per KWH.

As discussed herein under "Rate RSE," in accordance with an Alabama PSC order issued on February 5, 2019, Alabama Power will utilize

$75 million

of the 2018 Rate RSE refund liability to reduce the Rate ECR under recovered balance.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

At

December 31, 2018

, Alabama Power's under recovered fuel costs totaled

$109 million

, of which

$18 million

is included in customer accounts receivable and

$91 million

is included in deferred under recovered regulatory clause revenues on Southern Company's and Alabama Power's balance sheets. At December 31, 2017, Alabama Power had an under recovered fuel balance of

$25 million

, which was included in deferred under recovered regulatory clause revenues on Southern Company's and Alabama Power's balance sheets. These classifications are based on estimates, which include such factors as weather, generation availability, energy demand, and the price of energy. A change in any of these factors could have a material impact on the timing of any recovery or return of fuel costs.

Tax Reform Accounting Order

On May 1, 2018, the Alabama PSC approved an accounting order that authorized Alabama Power to defer the benefits of federal excess deferred income taxes associated with the Tax Reform Legislation for the year ended December 31, 2018 as a regulatory liability and to use up to

$30 million

of such deferrals to offset under recovered amounts under Rate ECR. The estimated deferrals for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled approximately

$63 million

, subject to adjustment following the filing of the 2018 tax return, of which

$30 million

was used to offset the Rate ECR under recovered balance and

$33 million

is recorded in other regulatory liabilities, deferred on the balance sheet to be used for the benefit of customers as determined by the Alabama PSC at a future date. See Note


under "Current and Deferred Income Taxes" for additional information.

Software Accounting Order

On February 5, 2019, the Alabama PSC approved an accounting order that authorizes Alabama Power to establish a regulatory asset for operations and maintenance costs associated with software implementation projects. The regulatory asset will be amortized ratably over the life of the related software.

Rate NDR

Based on an order from the Alabama PSC, Alabama Power maintains a reserve for operations and maintenance expenses to cover the cost of damages from major storms to its transmission and distribution facilities. The order approves a separate monthly Rate NDR charge to customers consisting of two components. The first component is intended to establish and maintain a reserve balance for future storms and is an on-going part of customer billing. When the reserve balance falls below

$50 million

, a reserve establishment charge will be activated (and the on-going reserve maintenance charge concurrently suspended) until the reserve balance reaches

$75 million

. In December 2017, the reserve maintenance charge was suspended and the reserve establishment charge was activated as a result of the NDR balance falling below

$50 million

. Alabama Power expects to collect approximately

$16 million

annually until the reserve balance is restored to

$75 million

. The NDR balance at

December 31, 2018

was

$20 million

and is included in other regulatory liabilities, deferred on the balance sheet.

The second component of the Rate NDR charge is intended to allow recovery of any existing deferred storm-related operations and maintenance costs and any future reserve deficits over a


-month period. The Alabama PSC order gives Alabama Power authority to record a deficit balance in the NDR when costs of storm damage exceed any established reserve balance. Absent further Alabama PSC approval, the maximum total Rate NDR charge consisting of both components is

$10

per month per non-residential customer account and

$5

per month per residential customer account. Alabama Power has the authority, based on an order from the Alabama PSC, to accrue certain additional amounts as circumstances warrant. The order allows for reliability-related expenditures to be charged against the additional accruals when the NDR balance exceeds

$75 million

. Alabama Power may designate a portion of the NDR to reliability-related expenditures as a part of an annual budget process for the following year or during the current year for identified unbudgeted reliability-related expenditures that are incurred. Accruals that have not been designated can be used to offset storm charges. Additional accruals to the NDR will enhance Alabama Power's ability to deal with the financial effects of future natural disasters, promote system reliability, and offset costs retail customers would otherwise bear.

No

such accruals were recorded or designated in any period presented.

As revenue from the Rate NDR charge is recognized, an equal amount of operations and maintenance expenses related to the NDR will also be recognized. As a result, the Rate NDR charge will not have an effect on net income but will impact operating cash flows.

Environmental Accounting Order

Based on an order from the Alabama PSC (Environmental Accounting Order), Alabama Power is allowed to establish a regulatory asset to record the unrecovered investment costs, including the unrecovered plant asset balance and the unrecovered costs associated with site removal and closure associated with future unit retirements caused by environmental regulations. The regulatory asset is being amortized and recovered over the affected unit's remaining useful life, as established prior to the decision regarding early retirement through Rate CNP Compliance. At December 31, 2018, this regulatory asset had a balance of

$42

million

, of which

$10 million

is included in other regulatory assets, current and

$32 million

is included in other regulatory assets, deferred on the balance sheet.

Subsequent to December 31, 2018, Alabama Power determined that Plant Gorgas Units 8, 9, and 10 (approximately

1,000

MWs) will be retired by April 15, 2019 due to the expected costs of compliance with federal and state environmental regulations. In accordance with the Environmental Accounting Order, approximately

$740 million

of net investment costs will be transferred to a regulatory asset at the retirement date and recovered over the affected units' remaining useful lives, as established prior to the decision to retire.

Rate Plans

Pursuant to the terms and conditions of a settlement agreement related to Southern Company's acquisition of Southern Company Gas approved by the Georgia PSC in 2016, the 2013 ARP will continue in effect until December 31, 2019, and Georgia Power will be required to file its next base rate case by July 1, 2019. Furthermore, through December 31, 2019, Georgia Power will retain its merger savings, net of transition costs, as defined in the settlement agreement; through December 31, 2022, such net merger savings will be shared on a


/


basis with customers; thereafter, all merger savings will be retained by customers.

There were no changes to Georgia Power's traditional base tariff rates, Environmental Compliance Cost Recovery (ECCR) tariff, DSM tariffs, or Municipal Franchise Fee tariff in


or


.

Under the 2013 ARP, Georgia Power's retail ROE is set at

10.95%

and earnings are evaluated against a retail ROE range of

10.00%

to

12.00%

. Two-thirds of any earnings above

12.00%

will be directly refunded to customers, with the remaining one-third retained by Georgia Power. There will be no recovery of any earnings shortfall below

10.00%

on an actual basis.

In 2016, Georgia Power's retail ROE exceeded

12.00%

, and Georgia Power refunded to retail customers in 2018 approximately

$40 million

as approved by the Georgia PSC. On February 5, 2019, the Georgia PSC approved a settlement between Georgia Power and the staff of the Georgia PSC under which Georgia Power's retail ROE for 2017 was stipulated to exceed

12.00%

and Georgia Power will reduce certain regulatory assets by approximately

$4 million

in lieu of providing refunds to retail customers. In 2018, Georgia Power's retail ROE exceeded

12.00%

, and Georgia Power accrued approximately

$100 million

to refund to retail customers, subject to review and approval by the Georgia PSC.

On April 3, 2018, the Georgia PSC approved the Georgia Power Tax Reform Settlement Agreement.

Pursuant to the Georgia Power Tax Reform Settlement Agreement, to reflect the federal income tax rate reduction impact of the Tax Reform Legislation, Georgia Power will refund to customers a total of

$330 million

through bill credits. Georgia Power issued bill credits of approximately

$130 million

in 2018 and will issue bill credits of approximately

$95 million

in June 2019 and

$105 million

in February 2020. In addition, Georgia Power is deferring as a regulatory liability (i) the revenue equivalent of the tax expense reduction resulting from legislation lowering the Georgia state income tax rate from

6.00%

to

5.75%

in 2019 and (ii) the entire benefit of federal and state excess accumulated deferred income taxes, which is expected to total approximately

$700 million

at December 31, 2019. At

December 31, 2018

, the related regulatory liability balance totaled

$610 million

. The amortization of these regulatory liabilities is expected to be addressed in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case. If there is not a base rate case in 2019, customers will receive

$185 million

in annual bill credits beginning in 2020, with any additional federal and state income tax savings deferred as a regulatory liability, until Georgia Power's next base rate case.

To address some of the negative cash flow and credit quality impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation, the Georgia PSC also approved an increase in Georgia Power's retail equity ratio to the lower of (i) Georgia Power's actual common equity weight in its capital structure or (ii)

55%

, until the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case. At

December 31, 2018

, Georgia Power's actual retail common equity ratio (on a


-month average basis) was approximately

55%

. Benefits from reduced federal income tax rates in excess of the amounts refunded to customers will be retained by Georgia Power to cover the carrying costs of the incremental equity in 2018 and 2019.

Integrated Resource Plan

In 2016, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's triennial Integrated Resource Plan (2016 IRP) including the reclassification of the remaining net book value of Plant Mitchell Unit 3 and costs associated with materials and supplies remaining at the unit retirement date to a regulatory asset. Recovery of the unit's net book value will continue through December 31, 2019, as provided in the 2013 ARP. The timing of the recovery of the remaining balance of the unit's net book value as of December 31, 2019 and costs associated with materials and supplies remaining at the unit retirement date was deferred for consideration in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case.

In the 2016 IRP, the Georgia PSC also approved recovery of costs up to

$99 million

through June 30, 2019 to preserve nuclear generation as an option at a future generation site in Stewart County, Georgia. In March 2017, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's decision to suspend work at the site due to changing economics, including lower load forecasts and fuel costs. The timing of recovery for costs incurred of approximately

$50 million

is expected to be determined by the Georgia PSC in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case.

On January 31, 2019, Georgia Power filed its triennial IRP (2019 IRP). The filing includes a request to decertify and retire Plant Hammond Units 1 through 4 (


MWs) and Plant McIntosh Unit 1 (

142.5

MWs) upon approval of the 2019 IRP

.

In the 2019 IRP, Georgia Power requested approval to reclassify the remaining net book value of Plant Hammond Units 1 through 4 (approximately

$520 million

at December 31, 2018) upon retirement to a regulatory asset to be amortized ratably over a period equal to the applicable unit's remaining useful life through 2035. For Plant McIntosh Unit 1, Georgia Power requested approval to

II-295


Index to Financial Statements

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

reclassify the remaining net book value (approximately

$40 million

at December 31, 2018) upon retirement to a regulatory asset to be amortized over a

three

-year period to be determined in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case. Georgia Power also requested approval to reclassify any unusable material and supplies inventory balances remaining at the applicable unit's retirement date to a regulatory asset for recovery over a period to be determined in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case.

The 2019 IRP also includes a request to certify approximately


MWs of capacity at Plant Scherer Unit 3 for the retail jurisdiction beginning January 1, 2020, following the expiration of a wholesale PPA.

The 2019 IRP also includes details regarding ARO costs associated with ash pond and landfill closures and post-closure care. Georgia Power requested the timing and rate of recovery of these costs be determined by the Georgia PSC in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case.

See Note


for additional information regarding Georgia Power's AROs.

Georgia Power also requested approval to issue

two

capacity-based requests for proposals (RFP). If approved, the first capacity-based RFP will seek resources that can provide capacity beginning in 2022 or 2023 and the second capacity-based RFP will seek resources that can provide capacity beginning in 2026, 2027, or 2028. Additionally, the 2019 IRP includes a request to procure an additional

1,000

MWs of renewable resources through a competitive bidding process. Georgia Power also proposed to invest in a portfolio of up to


MWs of battery energy storage technologies.

A decision from the Georgia PSC on the 2019 IRP is expected in mid-2019.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Fuel Cost Recovery

Georgia Power has established fuel cost recovery rates approved by the Georgia PSC.

In 2016, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's request to lower annual billings under an interim fuel rider by approximately

$313 million

effective June 1, 2016, which expired on December 31, 2017.

On August 16, 2018, the Georgia PSC approved the deferral of Georgia Power's next fuel case to no later than March 16, 2020, with new rates, if any, to be effective June 1, 2020. Georgia Power continues to be allowed to adjust its fuel cost recovery rates under an interim fuel rider prior to the next fuel case if the under or over recovered fuel balance exceeds

$200 million

. Georgia Power's under recovered fuel balance totaled

$115 million

and

$165 million

at

December 31, 2018

and


, respectively, and is included in under recovered fuel clause revenues on Southern Company's and Georgia Power's balance sheets.

Georgia Power's fuel cost recovery mechanism includes costs associated with a natural gas hedging program, as revised and approved by the Georgia PSC, allowing the use of an array of derivative instruments within a


-month time horizon.

Fuel cost recovery revenues as recorded on the financial statements are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable fuel costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor will not have a significant effect on

Southern Company's or

Georgia Power's revenues or net income, but will affect operating cash flows.

Storm Damage Recovery

Georgia Power defers and recovers certain costs related to damages from major storms as mandated by the Georgia PSC. Beginning January 1, 2014, Georgia Power is accruing

$30 million

annually under the 2013 ARP that is recoverable through base rates. At

December 31, 2018

and


, the balance in the regulatory asset related to storm damage was

$416 million

and

$333 million

, respectively, with

$30 million

included in other regulatory assets, current for each year and

$386 million

and

$303 million

included in other regulatory assets, deferred, respectively.

During October 2018, Hurricane Michael caused significant damage to Georgia Power's transmission and distribution facilities. The incremental restoration costs related to this hurricane deferred in the regulatory asset for storm damage totaled approximately

$115 million

. Hurricanes Irma and Matthew also caused significant damage to Georgia Power's transmission and distribution facilities during September 2017 and October 2016, respectively. The incremental restoration costs related to Hurricanes Irma and Matthew deferred in the regulatory asset for storm damage totaled approximately

$250 million

.

The rate of storm damage cost recovery is expected to be adjusted as part of the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case and further adjusted in future regulatory proceedings as necessary.

The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Nuclear Construction

In 2009, the Georgia PSC certified construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Georgia Power holds a

45.7%

ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. In 2012, the NRC issued the related combined construction and operating licenses, which allowed full construction of the

two

AP1000 nuclear units (with electric generating capacity of approximately

1,100

MWs each) and related facilities to begin. Until March 2017, construction on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 continued under the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement,

II-296


Index to Financial Statements

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

which was a substantially fixed price agreement. In March 2017, the EPC Contractor filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

In connection with the EPC Contractor's bankruptcy filing, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the Vogtle Owners, entered into the Interim Assessment Agreement with the EPC Contractor to allow construction to continue. The Interim Assessment Agreement expired in July 2017 when Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the other Vogtle Owners, and the EPC Contractor entered into the Vogtle Services Agreement. Under the Vogtle Services Agreement, Westinghouse provides facility design and engineering services, procurement and technical support, and staff augmentation on a time and materials cost basis. The Vogtle Services Agreement provides that it will continue until the start-up and testing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are complete and electricity is generated and sold from both units. The Vogtle Services Agreement is terminable by the Vogtle Owners upon


days' written notice.

In October 2017, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the other Vogtle Owners, executed the Bechtel Agreement, a cost reimbursable plus fee arrangement, whereby Bechtel is reimbursed for actual costs plus a base fee and an at-risk fee, which is subject to adjustment based on Bechtel's performance against cost and schedule targets. Each Vogtle Owner is severally (not jointly) liable for its proportionate share, based on its ownership interest, of all amounts owed to Bechtel under the Bechtel Agreement. The Vogtle Owners may terminate the Bechtel Agreement at any time for their convenience, provided that the Vogtle Owners will be required to pay amounts related to work performed prior to the termination (including the applicable portion of the base fee), certain termination-related costs, and, at certain stages of the work, the applicable portion of the at-risk fee. Bechtel may terminate the Bechtel Agreement under certain circumstances, including certain Vogtle Owner suspensions of work, certain breaches of the Bechtel Agreement by the Vogtle Owners, Vogtle Owner insolvency, and certain other events. Pursuant to the Loan Guarantee Agreement between Georgia Power and the DOE, Georgia Power is required to obtain the DOE's approval of the Bechtel Agreement prior to obtaining any further advances under the Loan Guarantee Agreement.

Cost and Schedule

Georgia Power's approximate proportionate share of the remaining estimated capital cost to complete Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 by the expected in-service dates of November 2021 and November 2022, respectively, is as follows:

(a)

Excludes financing costs expected to be capitalized through AFUDC of approximately

$315 million

.

(b)

Net of

$1.7 billion

received from Toshiba under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately

$188 million

in related Customer Refunds.

Georgia Power estimates that its financing costs for construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 will total approximately

$3.1 billion

, of which

$1.9 billion

had been incurred through

December 31, 2018

.

As construction continues, challenges with management of contractors, subcontractors, and vendors; labor productivity, availability, and/or cost escalation; procurement, fabrication, delivery, assembly, and/or installation and testing, including any required engineering changes, of plant systems, structures, and components (some of which are based on new technology that only recently began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale); or other issues could arise and change the projected schedule and estimated cost. Monthly construction production targets required to maintain the current project schedule will continue to increase significantly throughout 2019. To meet these increasing monthly targets, existing craft construction productivity must improve and additional craft laborers must be retained and deployed.

Georgia Power and Southern Nuclear believe it is a leading practice in connection with a construction project of this size and complexity to periodically validate recent construction progress in comparison to the projected schedule and to verify and update quantities of commodities remaining to install, labor productivity, and forecasted staffing needs. This verification process, led by Southern Nuclear, was underway as of December 31, 2018 and is expected to be completed during the second quarter 2019. Georgia Power currently does not anticipate any material changes to the total estimated project capital cost forecast for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 or the expected in-service dates of November 2021 and November 2022, respectively, resulting from this verification process. However, the ultimate impact on cost and schedule, if any, will not be known until the verification process is completed. Georgia Power is required to report the results and any project impacts to the Georgia PSC by May 15, 2019.

II-297


Index to Financial Statements

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

There have been technical and procedural challenges to the construction and licensing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 at the federal and state level and additional challenges may arise. Processes are in place that are designed to assure compliance with the requirements specified in the Westinghouse Design Control Document and the combined construction and operating licenses, including inspections by Southern Nuclear and the NRC that occur throughout construction. As a result of such compliance processes, certain license amendment requests have been filed and approved or are pending before the NRC. Various design and other licensing-based compliance matters, including the timely resolution of ITAAC and the related approvals by the NRC, may arise, which may result in additional license amendments or require other resolution. If any license amendment requests or other licensing-based compliance issues are not resolved in a timely manner, there may be delays in the project schedule that could result in increased costs.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. However, any extension of the project schedule is currently estimated to result in additional base capital costs of approximately

$50 million

per month, based on Georgia Power's ownership interests, and AFUDC of approximately

$12 million

per month. While Georgia Power is not precluded from seeking recovery of any future capital cost forecast increase, management will ultimately determine whether or not to seek recovery. Any further changes to the capital cost forecast that are not expected to be recoverable through regulated rates will be required to be charged to income and such charges could be material.

Joint Owner Contracts

In November 2017, the Vogtle Owners entered into an amendment to their joint ownership agreements for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to provide for, among other conditions, additional Vogtle Owner approval requirements. Effective August 31, 2018, the Vogtle Owners further amended the joint ownership agreements to clarify and provide procedures for certain provisions of the joint ownership agreements related to adverse events that require the vote of the holders of at least

90%

of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to continue construction (as amended, and together with the November 2017 amendment, the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements). The Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements also confirm that the Vogtle Owners' sole recourse against Georgia Power or Southern Nuclear for any action or inaction in connection with their performance as agent for the Vogtle Owners is limited to removal of Georgia Power and/or Southern Nuclear as agent, except in cases of willful misconduct.

As a result of the increase in the total project capital cost forecast and Georgia Power's decision not to seek rate recovery of the increase in the base capital costs as described below, the holders of at least

90%

of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 were required to vote to continue construction. On September 26, 2018, the Vogtle Owners unanimously voted to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.

Amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements

In connection with the vote to continue construction, Georgia Power entered into (i) a binding term sheet (Vogtle Owner Term Sheet) with the other Vogtle Owners and MEAG's wholly-owned subsidiaries MEAG Power SPVJ, LLC (MEAG SPVJ), MEAG Power SPVM, LLC (MEAG SPVM), and MEAG Power SPVP, LLC (MEAG SPVP) to take certain actions which partially mitigate potential financial exposure for the other Vogtle Owners, including additional amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements and the purchase of PTCs from the other Vogtle Owners, and (ii) a term sheet (MEAG Term Sheet) with MEAG and MEAG SPVJ to provide funding with respect to MEAG SPVJ's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (Project J) under certain circumstances. On January 14, 2019, Georgia Power, MEAG, and MEAG SPVJ entered into an agreement to implement the provisions of the MEAG Term Sheet (MEAG Funding Agreement). On February 18, 2019, Georgia Power, the other Vogtle Owners, and MEAG's wholly-owned subsidiaries MEAG SPVJ, MEAG SPVM, and MEAG SPVP entered into certain amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements to implement the provisions of the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet (Global Amendments).

Pursuant to the Global Amendments, and consistent with the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet, the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements were modified as follows: (i) each Vogtle Owner must pay its proportionate share of qualifying construction costs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 based on its ownership percentage up to the estimated cost at completion (EAC) for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 which formed the basis of Georgia Power's forecast of

$8.4 billion

in the nineteenth VCM plus

$800 million

; (ii) Georgia Power will be responsible for

55.7%

of actual qualifying construction costs between

$800 million

and

$1.6 billion

over the EAC in the nineteenth VCM (resulting in

$80 million

of potential additional costs to Georgia Power), with the remaining Vogtle Owners responsible for

44.3%

of such costs pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests; and (iii) Georgia Power will be responsible for

65.7%

of qualifying construction costs between

$1.6 billion

and

$2.1 billion

over the EAC in the nineteenth VCM (resulting in a further

$100 million

of potential additional costs to Georgia Power), with the remaining Vogtle Owners responsible for

34.3%

of such costs pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests.

If the EAC is revised and exceeds the EAC in the nineteenth VCM by more than

$2.1 billion

, each of the other Vogtle Owners will have a one-time option at the time the project budget forecast is so revised to tender a portion of its ownership interest to

II-298

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

Georgia Power in exchange for Georgia Power's agreement to pay

100%

of such Vogtle Owner's remaining share of total construction costs in excess of the EAC in the nineteenth VCM plus

$2.1 billion

. In this event, Georgia Power will have the option of cancelling the project in lieu of purchasing a portion of the ownership interest of any other Vogtle Owner. If Georgia Power accepts the offer to purchase a portion of another Vogtle Owner's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, the ownership interest(s) to be conveyed from the tendering Vogtle Owner(s) to Georgia Power will be calculated based on the proportion of the cumulative amount of construction costs paid by each such tendering Vogtle Owner(s) and by Georgia Power as of the COD of Plant Vogtle Unit 4. For purposes of this calculation, payments made by Georgia Power on behalf of another Vogtle Owner in accordance with the second and third items described in the paragraph above will be treated as payments made by the applicable Vogtle Owner.

In the event the actual costs of construction at completion of a Unit are less than the EAC reflected in the nineteenth VCM report and such Unit is placed in service in accordance with the schedule projected in the nineteenth VCM report (i.e., Plant Vogtle Unit 3 is placed in service by November 2021 or Plant Vogtle Unit 4 is placed in service by November 2022), Georgia Power will be entitled to

60.7%

of the cost savings with respect to the relevant Unit and the remaining Vogtle Owners will be entitled to

39.3%

of such savings on a pro rata basis in accordance with their respective ownership interests.

For purposes of the foregoing provisions, qualifying construction costs will not include costs (i) resulting from force majeure events, including governmental actions or inactions (or significant delays associated with issuance of such actions) that affect the licensing, completion, start-up, operations, or financing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, administrative proceedings or litigation regarding ITAAC or other regulatory challenges to commencement of operation of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, and changes in laws or regulations governing Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, (ii) legal fees and legal expenses incurred due to litigation with contractors or subcontractors that are not subsidiaries or affiliates of Southern Company, and (iii) additional costs caused by requests from the Vogtle Owners other than Georgia Power, except for the exercise of a right to vote granted under the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements, that increase costs by

$100,000

or more.

Pursuant to the Global Amendments, and consistent with the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet, the provisions of the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements requiring that Vogtle Owners holding

90%

of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 vote to continue construction following certain adverse events (Project Adverse Events) were modified. Pursuant to the Global Amendments, the holders of at least

90%

of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 must vote to continue construction if certain Project Adverse Events occur, including: (i) the bankruptcy of Toshiba; (ii) the termination or rejection in bankruptcy of certain agreements, including the Vogtle Services Agreement, the Bechtel Agreement, or the agency agreement with Southern Nuclear; (iii) Georgia Power publicly announces its intention not to submit for rate recovery any portion of its investment in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 or the Georgia PSC determines that any of Georgia Power's costs relating to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 will not be recovered in retail rates, excluding any additional amounts paid by Georgia Power on behalf of the other Vogtle Owners pursuant to the Global Amendments described above and the first

6%

of costs during any

six

-month VCM reporting period that are disallowed by the Georgia PSC for recovery, or for which Georgia Power elects not to seek cost recovery, through retail rates; and (iv) an incremental extension of

one year

or more over the most recently approved schedule. Under the Global Amendments, Georgia Power may cancel the project at any time in its sole discretion.

In addition, pursuant to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements, the required approval of holders of ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is at least (i)

90%

for a change of the primary construction contractor and (ii)

67%

for material amendments to the Vogtle Services Agreement or agreements with Southern Nuclear or the primary construction contractor, including the Bechtel Agreement.

The Global Amendments provide that if the holders of at least

90%

of the ownership interests fail to vote in favor of continuing the project following any future Project Adverse Event, work on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 will continue for a period of


days if the holders of more than

50%

of the ownership interests vote in favor of continuing construction (Majority Voting Owners). In such a case, the Vogtle Owners (i) have agreed to negotiate in good faith towards the resumption of the project, (ii) if no agreement is reached during such


-day period, the project will be cancelled, and (iii) in the event of such a cancellation, the Majority Voting Owners will be obligated to reimburse any other Vogtle Owner for the incremental costs it incurred during such


-day negotiation period.

Purchase of PTCs During Commercial Operation

Pursuant to the Global Amendments, and consistent with the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet, Georgia Power has agreed to purchase additional PTCs from OPC, Dalton, MEAG SPVM, MEAG SPVP, and MEAG SPVJ (to the extent any MEAG SPVJ PTC rights remain after any purchases required under the MEAG Funding Agreement as described below) at varying purchase prices dependent upon the actual cost to complete construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 as compared to the EAC reflected in the nineteenth VCM report. The purchases are at the option of the applicable Vogtle Owner.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

Potential Funding to MEAG Project J

Pursuant to the MEAG Funding Agreement, and consistent with the MEAG Term Sheet, if MEAG SPVJ is unable to make its payments due under the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements solely as a result of the occurrence of one of the following situations that materially impedes access to capital markets for MEAG for Project J: (i) the conduct of JEA or the City of Jacksonville, such as JEA's legal challenges of its obligations under a PPA with MEAG (PPA-J), or (ii) PPA-J is declared void by a court of competent jurisdiction or rejected by JEA under the applicable provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (each of (i) and (ii), a JEA Default), at MEAG's request, Georgia Power will purchase from MEAG SPVJ the rights to PTCs attributable to MEAG SPVJ's share of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (approximately


MWs) within


days of such request at varying prices dependent upon the stage of construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. The aggregate purchase price of the PTCs, together with any advances made as described in the next paragraph, shall not exceed

$300 million

.

At the option of MEAG, as an alternative or supplement to Georgia Power's purchase of PTCs as described above, Georgia Power has agreed to provide up to

$250 million

in funding to MEAG for Project J in the form of advances (either advances under the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements or the purchase of MEAG Project J bonds, at the discretion of Georgia Power), subject to any required approvals of the Georgia PSC and the DOE.

In the event MEAG SPVJ certifies to Georgia Power that it is unable to fund its obligations under the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements as a result of a JEA Default and Georgia Power becomes obligated to provide funding as described above, MEAG is required to (i) assign to Georgia Power its right to vote on any future Project Adverse Event and (ii) diligently pursue JEA for its breach of PPA-J. In addition, Georgia Power agreed that it will not sue MEAG for any amounts due from MEAG SPVJ under MEAG's guarantee of MEAG SPVJ's obligations so long as MEAG SPVJ complies with the terms of the MEAG Funding Agreement as to its payment obligations and the other non-payment provisions of the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements.

Under the terms of the MEAG Funding Agreement, Georgia Power may cancel the project in lieu of providing funding in the form of advances or PTC purchases.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Regulatory Matters

In 2009, the Georgia PSC voted to certify construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 with a certified capital cost of

$4.418 billion

. In addition, in 2009 the Georgia PSC approved inclusion of the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 related CWIP accounts in rate base, and the State of Georgia enacted the Georgia Nuclear Energy Financing Act, which allows Georgia Power to recover financing costs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Financing costs are recovered on all applicable certified costs through annual adjustments to the NCCR tariff up to the certified capital cost of

$4.418 billion

. At

December 31, 2018

, Georgia Power had recovered approximately

$1.9 billion

of financing costs. Financing costs related to capital costs above

$4.418 billion

will be recovered through AFUDC; however, Georgia Power will not record AFUDC related to any capital costs in excess of the total deemed reasonable by the Georgia PSC (currently

$7.3 billion

) and not requested for rate recovery. On December 18, 2018, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's request to increase the NCCR tariff by

$88 million

annually, effective January 1, 2019.

Georgia Power is required to file semi-annual VCM reports with the Georgia PSC by February 28 and August 31 of each year. In 2013, in connection with the eighth VCM report, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation between Georgia Power and the staff of the Georgia PSC to waive the requirement to amend the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 certificate in accordance with the 2009 certification order until the completion of Plant Vogtle Unit 3, or earlier if deemed appropriate by the Georgia PSC and Georgia Power.

In 2016, the Georgia PSC voted to approve a settlement agreement (Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement) resolving certain prudency matters in connection with the fifteenth VCM report. In December 2017, the Georgia PSC voted to approve (and issued its related order on January 11, 2018) Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report, which included a recommendation to continue construction with Southern Nuclear as project manager and Bechtel serving as the primary construction contractor, and modified the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement. The Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, as modified by the January 11, 2018 order, resolved the following regulatory matters related to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4: (i) none of the

$3.3 billion

of costs incurred through December 31, 2015 and reflected in the fourteenth VCM report should be disallowed from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (ii) the Contractor Settlement Agreement was reasonable and prudent and none of the amounts paid pursuant to the Contractor Settlement Agreement should be disallowed from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (iii) (a) capital costs incurred up to

$5.68 billion

would be presumed to be reasonable and prudent with the burden of proof on any party challenging such costs, (b) Georgia Power would have the burden to show that any capital costs above

$5.68 billion

were prudent, and (c) a revised capital cost forecast of

$7.3 billion

(after reflecting the impact of payments received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and related Customer Refunds) was found reasonable; (iv) construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 should be completed, with Southern Nuclear serving as project manager and Bechtel as primary contractor; (v) approved and deemed reasonable Georgia

II-300


Index to Financial Statements

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

Power's revised schedule placing Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in service in November 2021 and November 2022, respectively; (vi) confirmed that the revised cost forecast does not represent a cost cap and that prudence decisions on cost recovery will be made at a later date, consistent with applicable Georgia law; (vii) reduced the ROE used to calculate the NCCR tariff (a) from

10.95%

(the ROE rate setting point authorized by the Georgia PSC in the 2013 ARP) to

10.00%

effective January 1, 2016, (b) from

10.00%

to

8.30%

, effective January 1, 2020, and (c) from

8.30%

to

5.30%

, effective January 1, 2021 (provided that the ROE in no case will be less than Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt); (viii) reduced the ROE used for AFUDC equity for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from

10.00%

to Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt, effective January 1, 2018; and (ix) agreed that upon Unit 3 reaching commercial operation, retail base rates would be adjusted to include carrying costs on those capital costs deemed prudent in the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement. The January 11, 2018 order also stated that if Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are not commercially operational by June 1, 2021 and June 1, 2022, respectively, the ROE used to calculate the NCCR tariff will be further reduced by


basis points each month (but not lower than Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt) until the respective Unit is commercially operational. The ROE reductions negatively impacted earnings by approximately

$100 million

,

$25 million

, and

$20 million

in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, and are estimated to have negative earnings impacts of approximately

$75 million

in 2019 and an aggregate of approximately

$615 million

from 2020 to 2022.

In its January 11, 2018 order, the Georgia PSC also stated if other conditions change and assumptions upon which Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report are based do not materialize, the Georgia PSC reserved the right to reconsider the decision to continue construction.

On February 12, 2018, Georgia Interfaith Power & Light, Inc. (GIPL) and Partnership for Southern Equity, Inc. (PSE) filed a petition appealing the Georgia PSC's January 11, 2018 order with the Fulton County Superior Court. On March 8, 2018, Georgia Watch filed a similar appeal to the Fulton County Superior Court for judicial review of the Georgia PSC's decision and denial of Georgia Watch's motion for reconsideration. On December 21, 2018, the Fulton County Superior Court granted Georgia Power's motion to dismiss the

two

appeals. On January 9, 2019, GIPL, PSE, and Georgia Watch filed an appeal of this decision with the Georgia Court of Appeals. Georgia Power believes the appeal has no merit; however, an adverse outcome in the appeal combined with subsequent adverse action by the Georgia PSC could have a material impact on Southern Company's and Georgia Power's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

In preparation for its nineteenth VCM filing, Georgia Power requested Southern Nuclear to perform a full cost reforecast for the project. This reforecast, performed prior to the nineteenth VCM filing, resulted in a

$0.7 billion

increase to the base capital cost forecast reported in the second quarter 2018. This base cost increase primarily resulted from changed assumptions related to the finalization of contract scopes and management responsibilities for Bechtel and over


subcontractors, labor productivity rates, and craft labor incentives, as well as the related levels of project management, oversight, and support, including field supervision and engineering support.

Although Georgia Power believes these incremental costs are reasonable and necessary to complete the project and the Georgia PSC's order in the seventeenth VCM proceeding specifically states that the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is not subject to a cost cap, Georgia Power did not seek rate recovery for these cost increases included in the current base capital cost forecast (or any related financing costs) in the nineteenth VCM report. In connection with future VCM filings, Georgia Power may request the Georgia PSC to evaluate costs currently included in the construction contingency estimate for rate recovery as and when they are appropriately included in the base capital cost forecast. After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of costs included in the construction contingency estimate since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in these future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded a total pre-tax charge to income of

$1.1 billion

(

$0.8 billion

after tax) in the second quarter 2018, which includes the total increase in the base capital cost forecast and construction contingency estimate.

On August 31, 2018, Georgia Power filed its nineteenth VCM report with the Georgia PSC, which requested approval of

$578 million

of construction capital costs incurred from January 1, 2018 through June 30, 2018. On February 19, 2019, the Georgia PSC approved the nineteenth VCM, but deferred approval of

$51.6 million

of expenditures related to Georgia Power's portion of an administrative claim filed in the Westinghouse bankruptcy proceedings. Through the nineteenth VCM, the Georgia PSC has approved total construction capital costs incurred through June 30, 2018 of

$5.4 billion

(before

$1.7 billion

of payments received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately

$188 million

in related Customer Refunds). In addition, the staff of the Georgia PSC requested, and Georgia Power agreed, to file its twentieth VCM report concurrently with the twenty-first VCM report by August 31, 2019.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Operations Review

In August 2018, the Mississippi PSC began an operations review of Mississippi Power, for which the final report is expected prior to the conclusion of the

Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case.

Mississippi Power expects that the review will include, but not be limited to, a comparative analysis of its costs, its cost recovery framework, and ways in which it may streamline management operations for the reasonable benefit of ratepayers.

The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Performance Evaluation Plan

Mississippi Power's retail base rates generally are set under the PEP, a rate plan approved by the Mississippi PSC.

Two

filings are made for each calendar year: the PEP projected filing, which is typically filed prior to the beginning of the year based on a projected revenue requirement, and the PEP lookback filing, which is filed after the end of the year and allows for review of the actual revenue requirement compared to the projected filing.

In 2011, Mississippi Power submitted its annual PEP lookback filing for 2010, which recommended no surcharge or refund. Later in 2011, the MPUS disputed certain items

in the 2010 PEP lookback filing. In 2012, the Mississippi PSC issued an order canceling Mississippi Power's PEP lookback filing for 2011.

I

n 2013, the MPUS contested Mississippi Power's PEP lookback filing for 2012, which indicated a refund due to customers of

$5 million

.

In 2014 through 2018, Mississippi Power submitted its annual PEP lookback filings for the prior years, which for each of 2013, 2014, and 2017 indicated no surcharge or refund and for each of 2015 and 2016 indicated a

$5 million

surcharge.

Additionally, in July 2016, in November 2016, and in November 2017, Mississippi Power submitted its annual projected PEP filings for 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively, which for 2016 and 2017 indicated no change in rates and for 2018 indicated a rate increase of

4%

, or

$38 million

in annual revenues. The Mississippi PSC suspended each of these filings to allow more time for review.

On February 7, 2018, Mississippi Power revised its annual projected PEP filing for 2018 to reflect the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. The revised filing requested an increase of

$26 million

in annual revenues, based on a performance adjusted ROE of

9.33%

and an increased equity ratio of

55%

. On July 27, 2018, Mississippi Power and the MPUS entered into a settlement agreement, which was approved by the Mississippi PSC on August 7, 2018, with respect to the 2018 PEP filing and all unresolved PEP filings for prior years (PEP Settlement Agreement). Rates under the PEP Settlement Agreement became effective with the first billing cycle of September 2018. The PEP Settlement Agreement provides for an increase of approximately

$21.6 million

in annual base retail revenues, which excludes certain compensation costs contested by the MPUS, as well as approximately

$2 million

which was subsequently approved for recovery through the 2018 Energy Efficiency Cost Rider as discussed below. Under the PEP Settlement Agreement, Mississippi Power is deferring the contested compensation costs for 2018 and 2019 as a regulatory asset, which totaled

$4 million

as of December 31, 2018 and is included in other regulatory assets, deferred on the balance sheet. The Mississippi PSC is currently expected to rule on the appropriate treatment for such costs in connection with the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Pursuant to the PEP Settlement Agreement, Mississippi Power's performance-adjusted allowed ROE is

9.31%

and its allowed equity ratio is capped at

51%

,

pending further review by the Mississippi PSC. In lieu of the requested equity ratio increase, Mississippi Power retained

$44 million

of excess accumulated deferred income taxes resulting from the Tax Reform Legislation until the conclusion of the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case. Further, Mississippi Power agreed to seek equity contributions sufficient to restore its equity ratio to

50%

by December 31, 2018. Since Mississippi Power's actual average equity ratio for 2018 was more than

1%

lower than the

50%

target, Mississippi Power deferred the corresponding difference in its revenue requirement of approximately

$4 million

as a regulatory liability for resolution in the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case.

Pursuant to the PEP Settlement Agreement, PEP proceedings are suspended until after the conclusion of the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case and Mississippi Power is not required to make any PEP filings for regulatory years 2018, 2019, and 2020. The PEP Settlement Agreement also resolved all open PEP filings with no change to customer rates. As a result, in the third quarter 2018, Mississippi Power recognized revenues of

$5 million

previously reserved in connection with the 2012 PEP lookback filing.

Energy Efficiency

In 2013, the Mississippi PSC approved an energy efficiency and conservation rule requiring electric and gas utilities in Mississippi serving more than

25,000

customers to implement energy efficiency programs and standards. Quick Start Plans, which include a portfolio of energy efficiency programs that are intended to provide benefits to a majority of customers, were extended by an order issued by the Mississippi PSC in July 2016, until the time the Mississippi PSC approves a comprehensive portfolio plan program. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

effective with the first billing cycle for June 2018.

On February 5, 2019, the Mississippi PSC issued an order approving Mississippi Power's Energy Efficiency Cost Rider 2019 compliance filing, which included a slight decrease in annual retail revenues, effective with the first billing cycle in March 2019.

Environmental Compliance Overview Plan

In accordance with a 2011 accounting order from the Mississippi PSC, Mississippi Power has the authority to defer in a regulatory asset for future recovery all plant retirement- or partial retirement-related costs resulting from environmental regulations.

The Mississippi PSC approved

$41 million

and

$17 million

of costs that were reclassified to regulatory assets associated with the fuel conversion of Plant Watson and Plant Greene County, respectively, for amortization over

five

-year periods that began in July 2016 and July 2017, respectively. As a result, these decisions are not expected to have a material impact on Mississippi Power's financial statements.

In August 2016, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's revised ECO Plan filing for 2016, which requested the maximum

2%

annual increase in revenues, or approximately

$18 million

,

primarily related to the Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 scrubbers placed in service in 2015. The revised rates became effective with the first billing cycle for September 2016. Approximately

$22 million

of related revenue requirements in excess of the

2%

maximum was deferred for inclusion in the 2017 filing, along with related carrying costs.

In May 2017, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's ECO Plan filing for 2017, which requested the maximum

2%

annual increase in revenues, or approximately

$18 million

, primarily related to the carryforward from the prior year. The rates became effective with the first billing cycle for June 2017. Approximately

$26 million

,

plus carrying costs, of related revenue requirements in excess of the

2%

maximum was deferred for inclusion in the 2018 filing.

On February 14, 2018, Mississippi Power submitted its ECO Plan filing for 2018, including the effects of the Tax Reform Legislation, which requested the maximum

2%

annual increase in revenues, or approximately

$17 million

, primarily related to the carryforward from the prior year.

On August 3, 2018, Mississippi Power and the MPUS entered into the ECO Settlement Agreement, which provides for an increase of approximately

$17 million

in annual base retail revenues and was approved by the Mississippi PSC on August 7, 2018. Rates under the ECO Settlement Agreement became effective with the first billing cycle of September 2018 and will continue in effect until modified by the Mississippi PSC. These revenues are expected to be sufficient to recover the costs included in Mississippi Power's request for 2018, as well as the remaining deferred amounts, totaling

$26 million

at December 31, 2018, along with the related carrying costs. In accordance with the ECO Settlement Agreement, ECO Plan proceedings are suspended until after the conclusion of the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case and Mississippi Power is not required to make any ECO Plan filings for 2018, 2019, and 2020, with any necessary adjustments to be reflected in the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case. The ECO Settlement Agreement contains the same terms as the PEP Settlement Agreement described herein with respect to allowed ROE and equity ratio. At December 31, 2018, Mississippi Power has recorded

$2 million

in other regulatory liabilities, deferred on the balance sheet related to the actual December 31, 2018 average equity ratio differential from target applicable to the ECO Plan.

Fuel Cost Recovery

Mississippi Power establishes, annually, a retail fuel cost recovery factor that is approved by the Mississippi PSC. Mississippi Power is required to file for an adjustment to the retail fuel cost recovery factor annually. In January 2017, the Mississippi PSC approved the 2017 retail fuel cost recovery factor, effective February 2017 through January 2018, which resulted in an annual revenue increase of

$55 million

.

On January 16, 2018, the Mississippi PSC approved the 2018 retail fuel cost recovery factor, effective February 2018 through January 2019, which resulted in an annual revenue increase of

$39 million

.

At December 31, 2018, the amount of over recovered retail fuel costs included in the balance sheet in other accounts payable was approximately

$8 million

compared to

$6 million

under recovered at December 31, 2017.

On January 10, 2019, the Mississippi PSC approved the 2019 retail fuel cost recovery factor, effective February 2019, which results in a

$35 million

decrease in annual revenues as a result of lower expected fuel costs.

Mississippi Power's operating revenues are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable fuel cost and amounts billed in accordance with the currently approved cost recovery rate. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor should have no significant effect on

Southern Company's or Mississippi Power's

revenues or net income but will affect operating cash flows.

Ad Valorem Tax Adjustment

Mississippi Power establishes annually an ad valorem tax adjustment factor that is approved by the Mississippi PSC to collect the ad valorem taxes paid by Mississippi Power. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's annual ad valorem tax adjustment factor filing, which included a rate increase of

0.8%

, or

$7 million

, in 2018, a rate increase of

0.85%

, or

$8 million

, in 2017, and a rate decrease of

0.07%

, or

$1 million

, in 2016.

System Restoration Rider

Mississippi Power carries insurance for the cost of certain types of damage to generation plants and general property. However, Mississippi Power is self-insured for the cost of storm, fire, and other uninsured casualty damage to its property, including transmission and distribution facilities. As permitted by the Mississippi PSC and the FERC, Mississippi Power accrues for the cost of such damage through an annual expense accrual credited to regulatory liability accounts for the retail and wholesale jurisdictions. The cost of repairing actual damage resulting from such events that individually exceed

$50,000

is charged to the reserve. Every

three years

the Mississippi PSC, the MPUS, and Mississippi Power will agree on SRR revenue level(s) for the ensuing period, based on historical data, expected exposure, type and amount of insurance coverage, excluding insurance cost, and any other relevant information. The accrual amount and the reserve balance are determined based on the SRR revenue level(s). If a significant change in circumstances occurs, then the SRR revenue level can be adjusted more frequently if Mississippi Power and the MPUS or the Mississippi PSC deem the change appropriate. The property damage reserve accrual will be the difference between the approved SRR revenues and the SRR revenue requirement, excluding any accrual to the reserve. In addition, SRR allows Mississippi Power to set up a regulatory asset, pending review, if the allowable actual retail property damage costs exceed the amount in the retail property damage reserve. Mississippi Power made retail accruals of

$1 million

,

$3 million

, and

$4 million

for


,


, and


, respectively. Mississippi Power also accrued

$0.3 million

annually in


,


, and


for the wholesale jurisdiction. As of

December 31, 2018

, the property damage reserve balances were

$55 million

and

$1 million

for retail and wholesale, respectively.

Based on Mississippi Power's annual SRR rate filings, the SRR rate was

zero

for all years presented and Mississippi Power accrued

$2 million

,

$4 million

, and

$3 million

to the property damage reserve in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The SRR rate filings were suspended by the Mississippi PSC for review for a period not to exceed

120 days

from their respective filing dates, after which the filings became effective.

In January 2017, a tornado caused extensive damage to Mississippi Power's transmission and distribution infrastructure. The cost of storm damage repairs was approximately

$9 million

. A portion of these costs was charged to the retail property damage reserve and addressed in the 2018 SRR rate filing.

Kemper County Energy Facility

Overview

The Kemper County energy facility was designed to utilize IGCC technology with an expected output capacity of


MWs and to be fueled by locally mined lignite (an abundant, lower heating value coal) from a mine owned by Mississippi Power and situated adjacent to the Kemper County energy facility. The mine, operated by North American Coal Corporation, started commercial operation in 2013. In connection with the Kemper County energy facility construction, Mississippi Power constructed approximately


miles of CO


pipeline infrastructure for the transport of captured CO


for use in enhanced oil recovery.

Schedule and Cost Estimate

In 2012, the Mississippi PSC issued an order (2012 MPSC CPCN Order), confirming the CPCN originally approved by the Mississippi PSC in 2010 authorizing the acquisition, construction, and operation of the Kemper County energy facility. The certificated cost estimate of the Kemper County energy facility included in the 2012 MPSC CPCN Order was

$2.4 billion

, net of approximately

$0.57 billion

for the cost of the lignite mine and equipment, the cost of the CO


pipeline facilities, AFUDC, and certain general exceptions (Cost Cap Exceptions). The 2012 MPSC CPCN Order approved a construction cost cap of up to

$2.88 billion

, with recovery of prudently-incurred costs subject to approval by the Mississippi PSC. The Kemper County energy facility was originally projected to be placed in service in May 2014. Mississippi Power placed the combined cycle and the associated common facilities portion of the Kemper County energy facility in service in August 2014. The combined cycle and associated common facilities portions of the Kemper County energy facility were dedicated as Plant Ratcliffe on April 27, 2018.

On June 21, 2017, the Mississippi PSC stated its intent to issue an order, which occurred on July 6, 2017, directing Mississippi Power to pursue a settlement under which the Kemper County energy facility would be operated as a natural gas plant, rather than an IGCC plant, and address all issues associated with the Kemper County energy facility. The order established a new docket for the purpose of pursuing a global settlement of the related costs (Kemper Settlement Docket). On June 28, 2017, Mississippi

II-306


Index to Financial Statements

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

Power notified the Mississippi PSC that it would begin a process to suspend operations and start-up activities on the gasifier portion of the Kemper County energy facility, given the uncertainty as to its future.

At the time of project suspension in June 2017, the total cost estimate for the Kemper County energy facility was approximately

$7.38 billion

, including approximately

$5.95 billion

of costs subject to the construction cost cap, and was net of the

$137 million

in additional grants from the DOE received in April 2016. In the aggregate, Mississippi Power had recorded charges to income of

$3.07 billion

(

$1.89 billion

after tax) as a result of changes in the cost estimate above the cost cap for the Kemper IGCC through May 31, 2017.

Given the Mississippi PSC's stated intent regarding no further rate increase for the Kemper County energy facility and the subsequent suspension, cost recovery of the gasifier portions became no longer probable; therefore, Mississippi Power recorded an additional charge to income in June 2017 of

$2.8 billion

(

$2.0 billion

after tax), which included estimated costs associated with the gasification portions of the plant and lignite mine. During the third and fourth quarters of 2017, Mississippi Power recorded charges to income of

$242 million

(

$206 million

after tax), including

$164 million

for ongoing project costs, estimated mine and gasifier-related costs, and certain termination costs during the suspension period prior to conclusion of the Kemper Settlement Docket, as well as the charge associated with the Kemper Settlement Agreement discussed below.

In 2018, Mississippi Power recorded pre-tax charges to income of

$37 million

(

$27 million

after tax), primarily resulting from the abandonment and related closure activities and ongoing period costs, net of sales proceeds, for the mine and gasifier-related assets at the Kemper County energy facility. In addition, Mississippi Power recorded a credit to earnings of

$95 million

in the fourth quarter 2018 primarily resulting from the reduction of a valuation allowance for a state income tax

NOL

carryforward associated with the Kemper County energy facility. Additional closure costs for the mine and gasifier-related assets, currently estimated at up to

$10 million

pre-tax

(excluding salvage, net of dismantlement costs), may be incurred through the first half of 2020.

In addition, period costs, including, but not limited to, costs for compliance and safety, ARO accretion, and property taxes for the mine and gasifier-related assets, are estimated to total

$11 million

in 2019 and

$2 million

to

$4 million

annually in 2020 through 2023. Mississippi Power is currently evaluating its options regarding the final disposition of the CO


pipeline, including removal of the pipeline. This evaluation is expected to be complete later in 2019. If Mississippi Power ultimately decides to remove the CO


pipeline, the cost of removal would have a material impact on

Mississippi Power's financial statements and could have a material impact on Southern Company's financial statements.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

See Note 10 for additional information.

Rate Recovery

Kemper Settlement Agreement

In 2015, the Mississippi PSC issued an order (In-Service Asset Rate Order) regarding the Kemper County energy facility assets that were commercially operational and providing service to customers (the transmission facilities, combined cycle, natural gas pipeline, and water pipeline) and other related costs. The In-Service Asset Rate Order provided for retail rate recovery of an annual revenue requirement of approximately

$126 million

which went into effect on December 17, 2015.

On February 6, 2018, the Mississippi PSC voted to approve a settlement agreement related to cost recovery for the Kemper County energy facility among Mississippi Power, the MPUS, and certain intervenors (Kemper Settlement Agreement), which resolved all cost recovery issues, modified the CPCN to limit the Kemper County energy facility to natural gas combined cycle operation, and provided for an annual revenue requirement of approximately

$99.3 million

for costs related to the Kemper County energy facility, which included the impact of the Tax Reform Legislation. The revenue requirement is based on (i) a fixed ROE for 2018 of

8.6%

excluding any performance adjustment, (ii) a ROE for 2019 calculated in accordance with PEP, excluding the performance adjustment, (iii) for future years, a performance-based ROE calculated pursuant to PEP, and (iv) amortization periods for the related regulatory assets and liabilities of

eight

years and

six

years, respectively. The revenue requirement also reflects a disallowance related to a portion of Mississippi Power's investment in the Kemper County energy facility requested for inclusion in rate base, which was recorded in the fourth quarter 2017 as an additional charge to income of approximately

$78 million

(

$85 million

net of accumulated depreciation of

$7 million

) pre-tax (

$48 million

after tax).

Under the Kemper Settlement Agreement, retail customer rates reflect a reduction of approximately

$26.8 million

annually, effective with the first billing cycle of April 2018, and include no recovery for costs associated with the gasifier portion of the Kemper County energy facility in 2018 or at any future date.

Reserve Margin Plan

On August 6, 2018, Mississippi Power filed its proposed Reserve Margin Plan (RMP), as required by the Mississippi PSC's order in the Kemper Settlement Docket. Under the RMP, Mississippi Power proposed alternatives that would reduce its reserve margin,

II-307


Index to Financial Statements

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

with the most economic of the alternatives being the

two

-year and

seven

-year

acceleration of the retirement of Plant Watson Units 4 and 5, respectively, to the first quarter 2022 and the

four

-year acceleration of the retirement of Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 to the third quarter 2021 and the third quarter 2022, respectively, in order to lower or avoid operating costs. The Plant Greene County unit retirements would require the completion by Alabama Power of proposed transmission and system reliability improvements, as well as agreement by Alabama Power. The RMP filing also states that, in the event the Mississippi PSC ultimately approves an alternative that includes an accelerated retirement, Mississippi Power would require authorization to defer in a regulatory asset for future recovery the remaining net book value of the units at the time of retirement. A decision by the Mississippi PSC that does not include recovery of the remaining book value of any generating units retired could have a material impact on

Mississippi Power's and Southern Company's

financial statements. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Lignite Mine and CO


Pipeline Facilities

Mississippi Power owns the lignite mine and equipment and mineral reserves located around the Kemper County energy facility site. The mine started commercial operation in June 2013.

In 2010, Mississippi Power executed a


-year management fee contract with Liberty Fuels Company, LLC (Liberty Fuels), a wholly-owned subsidiary of The North American Coal Corporation, which developed, constructed, and is responsible for the mining operations through the end of the mine reclamation. As the mining permit holder, Liberty Fuels has a legal obligation to perform mine reclamation and Mississippi Power has a contractual obligation to fund all reclamation activities. As a result of the abandonment of the Kemper IGCC, final mine reclamation began in 2018 and is expected to be substantially completed in 2020, with monitoring expected to continue through 2027. See Note 6

and Note 7

under "Mississippi Power" for additional information.

In addition, Mississippi Power constructed the CO


pipeline for the planned transport of captured CO


for use in enhanced oil recovery and entered into an agreement with Denbury Onshore (Denbury) to purchase the captured CO


. The agreement with Denbury was terminated in December 2018 and did not have a material impact on Southern Company's or Mississippi Power's results of operations. Mississippi Power is currently evaluating its options regarding the final disposition of the CO


pipeline, including removal of the pipeline. This evaluation is expected to be complete later in 2019. If Mississippi Power ultimately decides to remove the CO


pipeline, the cost of removal would have a material impact on Mississippi Power's financial statements and could have a material impact on Southern Company's financial statements. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Government Grants

In 2010, the DOE, through a cooperative agreement with SCS, agreed to fund

$270 million

of the Kemper County energy facility through the grants awarded to the project by the DOE under the Clean Coal Power Initiative Round 2. Through December 31, 2018, Mississippi Power received total DOE grants of

$387 million

, of which

$382 million

reduced the construction costs of the Kemper County energy facility and

$5 million

reimbursed Mississippi Power for expenses associated with DOE reporting.

On December 12, 2018, Mississippi Power filed with the DOE its request for property closeout certification under the contract related to the

grants received. Mississippi Power and the DOE are currently in discussions regarding the requested closeout and property disposition, which may require payment to the DOE for a portion of certain property that is to be retained by Mississippi Power. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time; however, it could have a

material impact on Mississippi Power's financial statements and a significant impact on Southern Company's financial statements.

Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects

In addition to capital expenditures recovered through base rates by each of the natural gas distribution utilities, Nicor Gas and Virginia Natural Gas have separate rate riders that provide timely recovery of capital expenditures for specific infrastructure replacement programs.

Descriptions of the infrastructure replacement programs and capital projects at the natural gas distribution utilities follow:

Nicor Gas

In 2013, Illinois enacted legislation that allows Nicor Gas to provide more widespread safety and reliability enhancements to its distribution system. The legislation stipulates that rate increases to customers as a result of any infrastructure investments shall not exceed a cumulative annual average of

4.0%

or, in any given year,

5.5%

of base rate revenues. In 2014, the Illinois Commission approved the

nine

-year regulatory infrastructure program, Investing in Illinois, subject to annual review. In conjunction with the base rate case order issued by the Illinois Commission on January 31, 2018, Nicor Gas is recovering program costs incurred prior to December 31, 2017 through base rates. Nicor Gas has requested that the program costs incurred

II-309


Index to Financial Statements

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

subsequent to December 31, 2017, which are currently being recovered through a separate rider, be addressed in the base rate case filed November 9, 2018. See "

Rate Proceedings

" herein for additional information.

Virginia Natural Gas

In 2012, the Virginia Commission approved the Steps to Advance Virginia's Energy (SAVE) program, an accelerated infrastructure replacement program, to be completed over a

five

-year period. In 2016, the Virginia Commission approved an extension to the SAVE program for Virginia Natural Gas to replace more than


miles of aging pipeline infrastructure and invest up to

$30 million

in 2016 and up to

$35 million

annually through 2021.

The SAVE program is subject to annual review by the Virginia Commission. In conjunction with the base rate case order issued by the Virginia Commission in December 2017, Virginia Natural Gas is recovering program costs incurred prior to September 1, 2017 through base rates. Program costs incurred subsequent to September 1, 2017 are currently recovered through a separate rider and are subject to future base rate case proceedings.

Atlanta Gas Light

GRAM

In February 2017, the Georgia PSC approved GRAM and a

$20 million

increase in annual base rate revenues for Atlanta Gas Light, effective March 1, 2017. GRAM adjusts base rates annually, up or down, using an earnings band based on the previously approved ROE of

10.75%

and does not collect revenue through special riders and surcharges. Atlanta Gas Light adjusts rates up to the lower end of the band of

10.55%

and adjusts rates down to the higher end of the band of

10.95%

. Various infrastructure programs previously authorized by the Georgia PSC under Atlanta Gas Light's STRIDE program including the Integrated Vintage Plastic Replacement Program to replace aging plastic pipe and the Integrated System Reinforcement Program to upgrade Atlanta Gas Light's distribution system and LNG facilities in Georgia continue under GRAM and the recovery of and return on the infrastructure program investments are included in annual base rate adjustments. The Georgia PSC reviews Atlanta Gas Light's performance annually under GRAM. See

Rate Proceedings

" herein for additional information.

Pursuant to the GRAM approval, Atlanta Gas Light and the staff of the Georgia PSC agreed to a variation of the Integrated Customer Growth Program to extend pipeline facilities to serve customers in areas without pipeline access and create new economic development opportunities in Georgia, which was formerly part of the STRIDE program. As a result, a new tariff was created, effective October 10, 2017, to provide up to

$15 million

annually for Atlanta Gas Light to commit to strategic economic development projects. Projects under this tariff must be approved by the Georgia PSC.

The orders for the STRIDE program provide for recovery of all prudent costs incurred in the performance of the program. Atlanta Gas Light will recover from end-use customers, through billings to Marketers, the costs related to the program, net of any related cost savings. The regulatory asset represents incurred program costs that will be collected through GRAM. The future expected costs to be recovered through rates related to allowed, but not incurred, costs are recognized in an unrecognized ratemaking amount that is not reflected on the balance sheets. This allowed cost is primarily the equity return on the capital investment under the program. See "

Unrecognized Ratemaking Amounts

"

herein for additional information.

Atlanta Gas Light capitalizes and depreciates the capital expenditure costs incurred from the STRIDE programs over the life of the assets. Operations and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Recoveries, which are recorded as revenue, are based on a formula that allows Atlanta Gas Light to recover operations and maintenance costs in excess of those included in its current base rates, depreciation, and an allowed rate of return on capital expenditures. However, Atlanta Gas Light is allowed the recovery of carrying costs on the under recovered balance resulting from the timing difference.

PRP

In 2015, Atlanta Gas Light began recovering incremental PRP surcharge amounts through three phased-in increases in addition to its already existing PRP surcharge amount, which was established to address recovery of the under recovered PRP balance of

$144 million

and the estimated amounts to be earned under the program through 2025. The unrecovered balance is the result of the continued revenue requirement earned under the program offset by the existing and incremental PRP surcharges. The under recovered balance at December 31, 2018 was

$171 million

, including

$95 million

of unrecognized equity return. The PRP surcharge will remain in effect until the earlier of the full recovery of the under recovered amount or December 31, 2025. See "

Rate Proceedings

" and "

Unrecognized Ratemaking Amounts

" herein for additional information.

One of the capital projects under the PRP experienced construction issues and Atlanta Gas Light was required to complete mitigation work prior to placing it in service. These mitigation costs were included in base rates in 2018. In 2017, Atlanta Gas Light recovered

$20 million

from the settlement of contractor litigation claims and recovered an additional

$7 million

from the

II-310


Index to Financial Statements

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

final settlement of contractor litigation claims during the first quarter 2018. Mitigation costs recovered through the legal process are retained by Atlanta Gas Light.

Natural Gas Cost Recovery

With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the natural gas distribution utilities are authorized by the relevant regulatory agencies in the states in which they serve to use natural gas cost recovery mechanisms that adjust rates to reflect changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas and ensure recovery of all costs prudently incurred in purchasing natural gas for customers. Natural gas cost recovery revenues are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable natural gas costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Changes in the billing factor will not have a significant effect on Southern Company's or Southern Company Gas' revenues or net income, but will affect cash flows.

Rate Proceedings

Nicor Gas

On January 31, 2018, the Illinois Commission approved a

$137 million

increase in annual base rate revenues, including

$93 million

related to the recovery of investments under the Investing in Illinois program, effective February 8, 2018, based on a ROE of

9.8%

.

On April 19, 2018, the Illinois Commission approved Nicor Gas' variable income tax adjustment rider. This rider provides for refund or recovery of changes in income tax expense that result from income tax rates that differ from those used in Nicor Gas' last rate case. Customer refunds, via bill credits, related to the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation from January 25, 2018 through May 4, 2018 began on July 1, 2018 and are expected to conclude in the second quarter 2019.

On May 2, 2018, the Illinois Commission approved Nicor Gas' rehearing request for revised base rates to incorporate the reduction in the federal income tax rate as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation. The resulting decrease of approximately

$44 million

in annual base rate revenues became effective May 5, 2018. Nicor Gas' previously-authorized capital structure and ROE of

9.80%

were not addressed in the rehearing and remain unchanged.

On November 9, 2018, Nicor Gas filed a general base rate case with the Illinois Commission requesting a

$230 million

increase in annual base rate revenues. The requested increase is based on a projected test year for the 12-month period ending September 30, 2020, a ROE of

10.6%

, and an increase in the equity ratio from

52.0%

to

54.0%

to address the negative cash flow and credit metric impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. The Illinois Commission is expected to rule on the requested increase within the 11-month statutory time limit, after which rate adjustments will be effective. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Atlanta Gas Light

On February 23, 2018, Atlanta Gas Light revised its annual base rate filing to reflect the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation and requested a

$16 million

rate reduction in 2018. On May 15, 2018, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation for Atlanta Gas Light's annual base rates to remain at the 2017 level for 2018 and 2019, with customer credits of

$8 million

in each of July 2018 and October 2018 to reflect the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. The Georgia PSC maintained Atlanta Gas Light's previously authorized earnings band based on a ROE between

10.55%

and

10.95%

and increased the allowed equity ratio by

4%

to an equity ratio of

to address the negative cash flow and credit metric impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. Additionally, Atlanta Gas Light is required to file a traditional base rate case on or before June 1, 2019 for rates effective January 1, 2020.

Atlanta Gas Light's recovery of the previously unrecovered PRP revenue through 2014, as well as the mitigation costs associated with the PRP that were not previously included in its rates, were included in GRAM. In connection with the GRAM approval, the last monthly PRP surcharge increase became effective March 1, 2017.

Virginia Natural Gas

On December 21, 2017, the Virginia Commission approved a settlement for a

$34 million

increase in annual base rate revenues, effective September 1, 2017, including

$13 million

related to the recovery of investments under the SAVE program. See "Regulatory Infrastructure Programs" herein for additional information. An authorized ROE range of

9.0%

to

10.0%

with a midpoint of

9.5%

will be used to determine the revenue requirement in any filing, other than for a change in base rates.

On December 17, 2018, the Virginia Commission approved Virginia Natural Gas' annual information form filing, which reduced annual base rates by

$14 million

effective January 1, 2019 due to lower tax expense as a result of the lower corporate income tax rate and the impact of the flowback of excess deferred income taxes. This approval also requires Virginia Natural Gas to issue

customer refunds, via bill credits, for the entire

$14 million

which was deferred as a regulatory liability, current, on the balance sheet at December 31, 2018. These customer refunds are expected to be completed in the first quarter 2019.

energySMART

The Illinois Commission approved Nicor Gas' energySMART program, which includes energy efficiency program offerings and therm reduction goals. Through December 31, 2017, Nicor Gas spent

$107 million

of the initial authorized expenditure of

$113 million

. A new program began on January 1, 2018, with an additional authorized expenditure of

$160 million

through 2021. Through December 31, 2018, Nicor Gas had spent

$29 million

.

Unrecognized Ratemaking Amounts

The following table illustrates Southern Company Gas' authorized ratemaking amounts that are not recognized on its balance sheets. These amounts are primarily composed of an allowed equity rate of return on assets associated with certain regulatory infrastructure programs. These amounts will be recognized as revenues in Southern Company Gas' financial statements in the periods they are billable to customers, the majority of which will be recovered by 2025.

FERC Matters

Open Access Transmission Tariff

On May 10, 2018, AMEA and Cooperative Energy filed with the FERC a complaint against SCS and the traditional electric operating companies

claiming that the current

11.25%

base ROE used in calculating the annual transmission revenue requirements of the traditional electric operating companies'

open access transmission tariff is unjust and unreasonable as measured by the applicable FERC standards. The complaint requested that the base ROE be set no higher than

8.65%

and that the FERC order refunds for the difference in revenue requirements that results from applying a just and reasonable ROE established in this proceeding upon determining the current ROE is unjust and unreasonable.

On June 18, 2018, SCS and the traditional electric operating companies

filed their response challenging the adequacy of the showing presented by the complainants and offering support for the current ROE. On September 6, 2018, the FERC issued an order establishing a refund effective date of May 10, 2018 in the event a refund is due and initiating an investigation and settlement procedures regarding the current base ROE.

Through December 31, 2018, the estimated maximum potential refund is not expected to be material to

Southern Company's or the traditional electric operating companies'

results of operations or cash flows.

The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Mississippi Power

Municipal and Rural Associations Tariff

Mississippi Power provides wholesale electric service to Cooperative Energy, East Mississippi Electric Power Association, and the City of Collins, all located in southeastern Mississippi, under a long-term cost-based, FERC-regulated MRA tariff.

In 2016, Mississippi Power reached a settlement agreement with its wholesale customers, which was subsequently approved by the FERC, for an increase in wholesale base revenues under the MRA cost-based electric tariff, primarily as a result of placing scrubbers for Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 in service in 2015. The settlement agreement became effective for services rendered beginning May 1, 2016, resulting in an estimated annual revenue increase of

$7 million

under the MRA cost-based electric tariff. Additionally,

under the settlement agreement, the tariff customers agreed to similar regulatory treatment for MRA tariff ratemaking as the treatment approved for retail ratemaking under the In-Service Asset Rate Order.

This regulatory treatment primarily included (i) recovery of the operational Kemper County energy facility assets providing service to customers and other related costs, (ii) amortization of the Kemper County energy facility-related regulatory assets included in rates under the settlement agreement over the

36 months

ending April 30, 2019, (iii) Kemper County energy facility-related expenses included in rates under the settlement agreement no longer being deferred and charged to expense, and (iv) removing all of the Kemper

County energy facility CWIP from rate base with a corresponding increase in accrual of AFUDC, which totaled approximately

$22 million

through the suspension of Kemper IGCC start-up activities.

Mississippi Power expects to reach a subsequent settlement agreement with its wholesale customers and will make a filing with the FERC during the first quarter 2019. The settlement agreement is intended to be consistent with the Kemper Settlement Agreement, including the impact of the Tax Reform Legislation. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

In September 2017, Mississippi Power and Cooperative Energy executed a Shared Service Agreement (SSA), as part of the MRA tariff, under which Mississippi Power and Cooperative Energy will share in providing electricity to all Cooperative Energy delivery points, in lieu of the current arrangement under which each delivery point is specifically assigned to either entity. The SSA accepted by the FERC in October 2017 became effective on January 1, 2018 and may be cancelled by Cooperative Energy with


years

notice after December 31, 2020.

The SSA provides Cooperative Energy the option to decrease its use of Mississippi Power's generation services under the MRA tariff, subject to annual and cumulative caps and a

one

-year

notice requirement. In the event Cooperative Energy elects to reduce these services, the related reduction in Mississippi Power's revenues is not expected to be significant through 2020.

Fuel Cost Recovery

Mississippi Power has a wholesale MRA and a Market Based (MB) fuel cost recovery factor.

Effective with the first billing cycle for January 2018, fuel rates increased

$11 million

annually for wholesale MRA customers and

$1 million

annually for wholesale MB customers. Effective January 1, 2019, the wholesale MRA fuel rate decreased

$16 million

annually

and the wholesale MB fuel rate decreased by an immaterial amount.

At December 31, 2018, over recovered wholesale MRA fuel costs included in other regulatory liabilities, current on the balance sheet were approximately

$6 million

compared to an immaterial amount at December 31, 2017. Under recovered wholesale MB fuel costs included in the balance sheets were immaterial at December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Mississippi Power's operating revenues are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable fuel cost and amounts billed in accordance with the currently approved cost recovery rate. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor should have no significant effect on Mississippi Power's revenues or net income, but will affect cash flow.

Southern Company Gas

At

December 31, 2018

, Southern Company Gas was involved in

two

gas pipeline construction projects. These projects, along with Southern Company Gas' existing pipelines, are intended to provide diverse sources of natural gas supplies to customers, resolve current and long-term supply planning for new capacity, enhance system reliability, and generate economic development in the areas served.

On January 19, 2018, the PennEast Pipeline received FERC approval. Work continues with state and federal agencies to obtain the required permits to begin construction. Any material delays may impact forecasted capital expenditures and the expected in-service date.

In October 2017, the Atlantic Coast Pipeline received FERC approval. This joint venture

has experienced challenges to its permits since construction began in 2018. During the third and fourth quarters 2018, a FERC stop work order, together with delays in obtaining permits necessary for construction and construction delays due to judicial actions, impacted the cost and schedule for the project. As a result, total project cost estimates have increased from between

$6.0 billion

and

$6.5 billion

to between

$7.0 billion

and

$7.8 billion

, excluding financing costs. Southern Company Gas' share of the total project costs is

5%

and Southern Company Gas' investment at December 31, 2018 totaled

$83 million

.

The operator of the joint venture currently expects to achieve a late 2020 in-service date for at least key segments of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, while the remainder may extend into early 2021. Southern Company Gas has evaluated the recoverability of its investment and determined there was no impairment as of December 31, 2018. Abnormal weather, work delays (including due to judicial or regulatory action), and other conditions may result in additional cost or schedule modifications, which could result in an impairment of Southern Company Gas' investment and could have a material impact on

Southern Company's and Southern Company Gas' financial statements.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. See Notes

General Litigation Matters

Each registrant is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the business activities of Southern Company's subsidiaries are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the environment, such as laws and regulations governing air, water, land, and protection of other natural resources. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental laws and regulations has occurred throughout the U.S. This litigation has included claims for damages alleged to have been caused by CO


and other emissions, CCR, and alleged exposure to hazardous materials, and/or requests for injunctive relief in connection with such matters.

The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against each registrant and any subsidiaries cannot be predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically reported herein, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings would have a material effect on such registrant's financial statements.

Southern Company

In January 2017, a putative securities class action complaint was filed against Southern Company, certain of its officers, and certain former Mississippi Power officers in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division, by Monroe County Employees' Retirement System on behalf of all persons who purchased shares of Southern Company's common stock between April 25, 2012 and October 29, 2013. The complaint alleges that Southern Company, certain of its officers, and certain former Mississippi Power officers made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Kemper County energy facility in violation of certain provisions under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The complaint seeks, among other things, compensatory damages and litigation costs and attorneys' fees. In June 2017, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that provided additional detail about their claims, increased the purported class period by one day, and added certain other former Mississippi Power officers as defendants. In July 2017, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' amended complaint with prejudice, to which the plaintiffs filed an opposition in September 2017. On March 29, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division, issued an order granting, in part, the defendants' motion to dismiss. The court dismissed certain claims against certain officers of Southern Company and Mississippi Power and dismissed the allegations related to a number of the statements that plaintiffs challenged as being false or misleading. On April 26, 2018, the defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the court's order, seeking dismissal of the remaining claims in the lawsuit. On August 10, 2018, the court denied the motion for reconsideration and denied a motion to certify the issue for interlocutory appeal.

In February 2017, Jean Vineyard filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit and, in May 2017, Judy Mesirov filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit, each in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. Each of these lawsuits names as defendants Southern Company, certain of its directors, certain of its officers, and certain former Mississippi Power officers. In August 2017, these

two

shareholder derivative lawsuits were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The complaints allege that the defendants caused Southern Company to make false or misleading statements regarding the Kemper County energy facility cost and schedule. Further, the complaints allege that the defendants were unjustly enriched and caused the waste of corporate assets and also allege that the individual defendants violated their fiduciary duties. Each plaintiff seeks to recover, on behalf of Southern Company, unspecified actual damages and, on each plaintiff's own behalf, attorneys' fees and costs in bringing the lawsuit. Each plaintiff also seeks certain changes to Southern Company's corporate governance and internal processes. On April 25, 2018, the court entered an order staying this lawsuit until

30 days

after the resolution of any dispositive motions or any settlement, whichever is earlier, in the putative securities class action.

In May 2017, Helen E. Piper Survivor's Trust filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the Superior Court of Gwinnett County, State of Georgia that names as defendants Southern Company, certain of its directors, certain of its officers, and certain former Mississippi Power officers. The complaint alleges that the individual defendants, among other things, breached their fiduciary duties in connection with schedule delays and cost overruns associated with the construction of the Kemper County energy facility. The complaint further alleges that the individual defendants authorized or failed to correct false and misleading statements regarding the Kemper County energy facility schedule and cost and failed to implement necessary internal controls to prevent harm to Southern Company. The plaintiff seeks to recover, on behalf of Southern Company, unspecified actual damages and disgorgement of profits and, on its behalf, attorneys' fees and costs in bringing the lawsuit. The plaintiff also seeks certain unspecified changes to Southern Company's corporate governance and internal processes. On May 4, 2018, the court entered an order staying this lawsuit until

30 days

after the resolution of any dispositive motions or any settlement, whichever is earlier, in the putative securities class action.

Southern Company believes these legal challenges have no merit; however, an adverse outcome in any of these proceedings could have an impact on Southern Company's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Southern Company will vigorously defend itself in these matters, the ultimate outcome of which cannot be determined at this time.

Alabama Power

On March 2, 2018, the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) issued proposed administrative orders assessing a penalty of

$1.25 million

to Alabama Power for unpermitted discharge of fluids and/or pollutants to groundwater at

five

electric generating plants. The orders were finalized and Alabama Power paid the penalty on September 27, 2018. This matter is now concluded.

Georgia Power

In 2011, plaintiffs filed a putative class action against Georgia Power in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia alleging that Georgia Power's collection in rates of amounts for municipal franchise fees (which fees are paid to municipalities) exceeded the amounts allowed in orders of the Georgia PSC and alleging certain state tort law claims. In 2016, the Georgia Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's previous dismissal of the case and remanded the case to the trial court. Georgia Power filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the Georgia Supreme Court, which was granted in August 2017. On June 18, 2018, the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Georgia Court of Appeals and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings. Following a motion by Georgia Power, on February 13, 2019, the Superior Court of Fulton County entered an order staying this lawsuit for

60 days

and ordered the parties to submit petitions to the Georgia PSC within

20 days

for a declaratory ruling to address certain terms the court previously held were ambiguous as used in the Georgia PSC's orders. The order entered by the Superior Court of Fulton County also conditionally certified the proposed class. Georgia Power believes the plaintiffs' claims have no merit and will continue to vigorously defend itself in this matter. The amount of any possible losses cannot be calculated at this time because, among other factors, it is unknown whether conditional class certification will be upheld and the ultimate composition of any class; and whether any losses would be subject to recovery from any municipalities. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Mississippi Power

In 2016, a complaint against Mississippi Power was filed in Harrison County Circuit Court (Circuit Court) by Biloxi Freezing & Processing Inc., Gulfside Casino Partnership, and John Carlton Dean, which was amended and refiled to include, among other things, Southern Company as a defendant. The individual plaintiff alleged that Mississippi Power and Southern Company violated the Mississippi Unfair Trade Practices Act. All plaintiffs alleged that Mississippi Power and Southern Company concealed, falsely represented, and failed to fully disclose important facts concerning the cost and schedule of the Kemper County energy facility and that these alleged breaches unjustly enriched Mississippi Power and Southern Company. The plaintiffs sought unspecified actual damages and punitive damages; asked the Circuit Court to appoint a receiver to oversee, operate, manage, and otherwise control all affairs relating to the Kemper County energy facility; asked the Circuit Court to revoke any licenses or certificates authorizing Mississippi Power or Southern Company to engage in any business related to the Kemper County energy facility in Mississippi; and sought attorney's fees, costs, and interest. The plaintiffs also sought an injunction to prevent any Kemper County energy facility costs from being charged to customers through electric rates. In June 2017, the Circuit Court ruled in favor of motions by Southern Company and Mississippi Power and dismissed the case. In July 2017, the plaintiffs filed notice of an appeal. On July 13, 2018, Mississippi Power and Southern Company reached a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs' appeal was dismissed with prejudice. The settlement had no material impact on Southern Company's or Mississippi Power's financial statements.

On May 18, 2018, Southern Company and Mississippi Power received a notice of dispute and arbitration demand filed by Martin Product Sales, LLC (Martin) based on two agreements, both related to Kemper IGCC byproducts for which Mississippi Power provided termination notices in September 2017. Martin alleges breach of contract, breach of good faith and fair dealing, fraud and misrepresentation, and civil conspiracy and makes a claim for damages in the amount of approximately

$143 million

,

as well as additional unspecified damages, attorney's fees, costs, and interest.

In the first quarter 2019, Mississippi Power and Southern Company filed motions to dismiss. Southern Company and Mississippi Power believe this legal challenge has no merit; however, an adverse outcome in this proceeding could have a material impact on Southern Company's and Mississippi Power's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Southern Company and Mississippi Power will vigorously defend themselves in this matter, the ultimate outcome of which cannot be determined at this time.

On November 21, 2018, Ray C. Turnage and


other individual plaintiffs filed a putative class action complaint against Mississippi Power and the three current members of the Mississippi PSC in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. Mississippi Power received Mississippi PSC approval in 2013 to charge a mirror CWIP rate premised upon including

II-315


Index to Financial Statements

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

in its rate base pre-construction and construction costs for the Kemper IGCC prior to placing the Kemper IGCC into service. The Mississippi Supreme Court reversed that approval and ordered Mississippi Power to refund the amounts paid by customers under the previously-approved mirror CWIP rate. The plaintiffs allege that the initial approval process, and the amount approved, were improper. They also allege that Mississippi Power underpaid customers in the refund process because it applied the wrong interest rate to the payments. The plaintiffs seek to recover, on behalf of themselves and their putative class, actual damages, punitive damages, pre-judgment interest, post-judgment interest, attorney's fees, and costs.

Mississippi Power believes this legal challenge has no merit; however, an adverse outcome in this proceeding could have a material impact on Mississippi Power's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Mississippi Power will vigorously defend itself in this matter, the ultimate outcome of which cannot be determined at this time.

Southern Power

Southern Power indirectly owns a

51%

membership interest in RE Roserock LLC (Roserock), the owner of the Roserock facility in Pecos County, Texas. Prior to the facility being placed in service in November 2016, certain solar panels were damaged during installation by the construction contractor, McCarthy Building Companies, Inc. (McCarthy), and certain solar panels were damaged by a hail event that also occurred during construction. In connection therewith, Southern Power is withholding payments of approximately

$26 million

from the construction contractor, which has placed a lien on the Roserock facility for the same amount. In May 2017, Roserock filed a lawsuit in the state district court in Pecos County, Texas, (State Court lawsuit) against XL Insurance America, Inc. (XL) and North American Elite Insurance Company (North American Elite) seeking recovery from an insurance policy for damages resulting from the hail storm and McCarthy's installation practices. On June 1, 2018, the court in the State Court lawsuit granted Roserock's motion for partial summary judgment, finding that the insurers were in breach of contract and in violation of the Texas Insurance Code for failing to pay any monies owed for the hail claim. In addition to the State Court lawsuit, lawsuits were filed between Roserock and McCarthy, as well as other parties, and that litigation has been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. Southern Power intends to vigorously pursue and defend these matters, the ultimate outcome of which cannot be determined at this time.

Southern Company Gas

Nicor Energy Services Company, doing business as Pivotal Home Solutions, formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Company Gas, was a defendant in a putative class action initially filed in 2017 in the state court in Indiana. The plaintiffs purported to represent a class of the customers who purchased products from Nicor Energy Services Company and alleged that the marketing, sale, and billing of the products violated the Indiana Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, constituting common law fraud and resulting in unjust enrichment of these entities. In 2018, Nicor Energy Services Company was named in a second class action filed in the state court of Ohio asserting nearly identical allegations and legal claims. The plaintiffs sought, on behalf of the classes they purported to represent, actual and punitive damages, interest costs, attorney fees, and injunctive relief. To facilitate the sale of Pivotal Home Solutions, Southern Company Gas retained most of the financial responsibility for these lawsuits following the completion of the sale. On June 12, 2018, the parties settled these claims and Southern Company Gas recorded an

$11 million

charge, which is included in other operations and maintenance expenses for the year ended

December 31, 2018

.

Southern Company Gas is involved in litigation relating to an incident that occurred in one of its prior service territories that resulted in several deaths, injuries, and property damage. Southern Company Gas has resolved all claims for personal injuries or death, but it is continuing to defend litigation seeking to recover alleged property damages. Southern Company Gas has insurance that provides full coverage of the expected financial exposure in excess of

$11 million

per incident. During the successor period ended December 31, 2016, Southern Company Gas recorded reserves for substantially all of its potential exposure from these cases.

Environmental Remediation

The Southern Company system must comply with environmental laws and regulations governing the handling and disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations, the Southern Company system could incur substantial costs to clean up affected sites. The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities conduct studies to determine the extent of any required cleanup and have recognized the estimated costs to clean up known impacted sites in the financial statements. A liability for environmental remediation costs is recognized only when a loss is determined to be probable and reasonably estimable. The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities in Illinois and Georgia have each received authority from their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies to recover approved environmental compliance costs through regulatory mechanisms. These regulatory mechanisms are adjusted annually or as necessary within limits approved by the state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. At

and


, the environmental remediation liabilities of Alabama Power and Mississippi Power were immaterial.

Georgia Power has been designated or identified as a potentially responsible party at sites governed by the Georgia Hazardous Site Response Act and/or by the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, and assessment and potential cleanup of such sites is expected. In 2013, the Georgia PSC approved the 2013 ARP including the recovery of approximately

$2 million

annually through the ECCR tariff. Georgia Power recognizes a liability for environmental remediation costs only when it determines a loss is probable and reasonably estimable and reduces the reserve as expenditures are incurred. Any difference between the liabilities accrued and costs recovered through rates is deferred as a regulatory asset or liability. The annual recovery amount is expected to be adjusted as part of the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case and further adjusted in future regulatory proceedings.

Southern Company Gas is subject to environmental remediation liabilities associated with


former MGP sites in

four

different states. Southern Company Gas' accrued environmental remediation liability at

December 31, 2018

and


was based on the estimated cost of environmental investigation and remediation associated with known current and former MGP operating sites. These environmental remediation expenditures are recoverable from customers through rate mechanisms approved by the applicable state regulatory agencies of the natural gas distribution utilities, with the exception of one site representing

$2 million

of the accrued remediation costs.

At

December 31, 2018

and


, the environmental remediation liability and the balance of under recovered environmental remediation costs were reflected in the balance sheets as follows:

At December 31, 2017,

$85 million

of Southern Company Gas' total environmental remediation liability related to Elizabethtown Gas, which was sold on July 1, 2018. See Note


under "

Southern Company Gas

" for more information regarding Southern Company Gas' sale of Elizabethtown Gas.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time; however, as a result of the regulatory treatment for environmental remediation expenses described above, the final disposition of these matters is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of Southern Company, Georgia Power, or Southern Company Gas.

Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs

Acting through the DOE and pursuant to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the U.S. government entered into contracts with Alabama Power and Georgia Power that require the DOE to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high level radioactive waste generated at Plants Farley, Hatch, and Vogtle Units 1 and 2 beginning no later than January 31, 1998. The DOE has yet to commence the performance of its contractual and statutory obligation to dispose of spent nuclear fuel. Consequently, Alabama Power and Georgia Power pursued and continue to pursue legal remedies against the U.S. government for its partial breach of contract.

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

In 2014, Alabama Power and Georgia Power filed lawsuits against the U.S. government for the costs of continuing to store spent nuclear fuel at Plants Farley, Hatch, and Vogtle Units 1 and 2 for the period from January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2013. The damage period was subsequently extended to December 31, 2014. In October 2017, Alabama Power and Georgia Power filed additional lawsuits against the U.S. government in the Court of Federal Claims for the costs of continuing to store spent nuclear fuel at Plants Farley, Hatch, and Vogtle Units 1 and 2 for the period from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2017. Damages will continue to accumulate until the issue is resolved, the U.S. government disposes of Alabama Power's and Georgia Power's spent nuclear fuel pursuant to its contractual obligations, or alternative storage is otherwise provided. No amounts have been recognized in the financial statements as of

December 31, 2018

for any potential recoveries from the pending lawsuits. The final outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. However, Alabama Power and Georgia Power expect to credit any recoveries back for the benefit of customers in accordance with direction from their respective PSC and, therefore, no material impact on Southern Company's, Alabama Power's, or Georgia Power's net income is expected.

On-site dry spent fuel storage facilities are operational at all

three

plants and can be expanded to accommodate spent fuel through the expected life of each plant.

Nuclear Insurance

Under the Price-Anderson Amendments Act (Act), Alabama Power and Georgia Power maintain agreements of indemnity with the NRC that, together with private insurance, cover third-party liability arising from any nuclear incident occurring at the companies' nuclear power plants. The Act provides funds up to

$14.1 billion

for public liability claims that could arise from a single nuclear incident. Each nuclear plant is insured against this liability to a maximum of

$450 million

by American Nuclear Insurers (ANI), with the remaining coverage provided by a mandatory program of deferred premiums that could be assessed, after a nuclear incident, against all owners of commercial nuclear reactors. A company could be assessed up to

$138 million

per incident for each licensed reactor it operates but not more than an aggregate of

$20 million

per incident to be paid in a calendar year for each reactor. Such maximum assessment, excluding any applicable state premium taxes, for Alabama Power and Georgia Power, based on its ownership and buyback interests in all licensed reactors, is

$275 million

and

$267 million

, respectively, per incident, but not more than an aggregate of

$41 million

and

$40 million

, respectively, to be paid for each incident in any one year. Both the maximum assessment per reactor and the maximum yearly assessment are adjusted for inflation at least every

five years

. The next scheduled adjustment is due no later than September 10, 2023. See Note


under "

Joint Ownership Agreements

" for additional information on joint ownership agreements.

Alabama Power and Georgia Power are members of Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), a mutual insurer established to provide property damage insurance in an amount up to

$1.5 billion

for members' operating nuclear generating facilities. Additionally, both companies have NEIL policies that currently provide decontamination, excess property insurance, and premature decommissioning coverage up to

$1.25 billion

for nuclear losses and policies providing coverage up to

$750 million

for non-nuclear losses in excess of the

$1.5 billion

primary coverage.

NEIL also covers the additional costs that would be incurred in obtaining replacement power during a prolonged accidental outage at a member's nuclear plant. Members can purchase this coverage, subject to a deductible waiting period of up to

26 weeks

, with a maximum per occurrence per unit limit of

$490 million

. After the deductible period, weekly indemnity payments would be received until either the unit is operational or until the limit is exhausted. Alabama Power and Georgia Power each purchase limits based on the projected full cost of replacement power, subject to ownership limitations, and have each elected a

12-week

deductible waiting period for each nuclear plant.

A builders' risk property insurance policy has been purchased from NEIL for the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. This policy provides the Vogtle Owners up to

$2.75 billion

for accidental property damage occurring during construction.

Under each of the NEIL policies, members are subject to assessments each year if losses exceed the accumulated funds available to the insurer. The maximum annual assessments for Alabama Power and Georgia Power as of

December 31, 2018

under the NEIL policies would be

$56 million

and

$85 million

, respectively.

Claims resulting from terrorist acts are covered under both the ANI and NEIL policies (subject to normal policy limits). The aggregate, however, that NEIL will pay for all claims resulting from terrorist acts in any

12-month

period is

$3.2 billion

plus such additional amounts NEIL can recover through reinsurance, indemnity, or other sources.

For all on-site property damage insurance policies for commercial nuclear power plants, the NRC requires that the proceeds of such policies shall be dedicated first for the sole purpose of placing the reactor in a safe and stable condition after an accident. Any remaining proceeds are to be applied next toward the costs of decontamination and debris removal operations ordered by the NRC, and any further remaining proceeds are to be paid either to the applicable company or to its debt trustees as may be appropriate under the policies and applicable trust indentures. In the event of a loss, the amount of insurance available might not be adequate to cover property damage and other expenses incurred. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not

recovered from customers, would be borne by Alabama Power or Georgia Power, as applicable, and could have a material effect on Southern Company's, Alabama Power's, and Georgia Power's financial condition and results of operations.

All retrospective assessments, whether generated for liability, property, or replacement power, may be subject to applicable state premium taxes.

Other Matters

Mississippi Power

In 2013, Mississippi Power submitted a lost revenue claim under the Deep Horizon Economic and Property Damages Settlement Agreement associated with the oil spill that occurred in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. On May 14, 2018, Mississippi Power's claim was settled. The settlement proceeds of

$18 million

, net of expenses and income tax, are included in Mississippi Power's earnings for 2018. As of December 31, 2018, Mississippi Power had received half of the settlement proceeds.

Southern Company Gas

A wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Company Gas owns and operates a natural gas storage facility consisting of

two

salt dome caverns in Louisiana. Periodic integrity tests are required in accordance with rules of the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources (DNR). In August 2017, in connection with an ongoing integrity project, updated seismic mapping indicated the proximity of one of the caverns to the edge of the salt dome may be less than the required minimum and could result in Southern Company Gas retiring the cavern early. At

December 31, 2018

, the facility's property, plant, and equipment had a net book value of

$109 million

, of which the cavern itself represents approximately

20%

. A potential early retirement of this cavern is dependent upon several factors including compliance with an order from the Louisiana DNR detailing the requirements to place the cavern back in service, which includes, among other things, obtaining core samples to determine the composition of the sheath surrounding the edge of the salt dome.

The cavern continues to maintain its pressures and overall structural integrity. These events were considered in connection with Southern Company Gas' annual long-lived asset impairment analysis, which determined there was

no

impairment as of

December 31, 2018

. Any changes in results of monitoring activities, rates at which expiring capacity contracts are re-contracted, timing of placing the cavern back in service, or Louisiana DNR requirements could trigger impairment. Further, early retirement of the cavern could trigger impairment of other long-lived assets associated with the natural gas storage facility. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time, but could have a significant impact on Southern Company's or Southern Company Gas' financial statements.

Under the terms of the 2013 ARP, Georgia Power amortized approximately

$14 million

annually from 2014 through 2016 of its remaining regulatory liability related to other cost of removal obligations.

Southern Company's 2017 depreciation includes

$34 million

of reductions in depreciation recognized by Gulf Power under the terms of its 2013 rate case settlement agreement with the Florida PSC.

When property, plant, and equipment subject to composite depreciation is retired or otherwise disposed of in the normal course of business, its original cost, together with the cost of removal, less salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation. For other property dispositions, the applicable cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance sheet accounts, and a gain or loss is recognized. Minor items of property included in the original cost of the asset are retired when the related property unit is retired.

Southern Power

Southern Power applies component depreciation, where depreciation is computed principally by the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. Certain of Southern Power's generation assets related to natural gas-fired facilities are depreciated on a units-of-production basis, using hours or starts, to better match outage and maintenance costs to the usage of, and revenues from, these assets. The primary assets in Southern Power's property, plant, and equipment are generating facilities, which generally have estimated useful lives as follows:

Southern Power reviews its estimated useful lives and salvage values on an ongoing basis. The results of these reviews could result in changes which could have a material impact on Southern Power's net income in the near term.

When Southern Power's depreciable property, plant, and equipment is retired, or otherwise disposed of in the normal course of business, the applicable cost and accumulated depreciation is removed and a gain or loss is recognized in the statements of income.

. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

AROs are computed as the present value of the estimated costs for an asset's future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The estimated costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. In the absence of quoted market prices, AROs are estimated using present value techniques in which estimates of future cash outlays associated with the asset retirements are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Estimates of the timing and amounts of future cash outlays are based on projections of when and how the assets will be retired and the cost of future removal activities. Each traditional electric operating company and natural gas distribution utility has received accounting guidance from its state PSC or applicable state regulatory agency allowing the continued accrual or recovery of other retirement costs for long-lived assets that it does not have a legal obligation to retire. Accordingly, the accumulated removal costs for these obligations are reflected in the balance sheets as regulatory liabilities and amounts to be recovered are reflected in the balance sheets as regulatory assets.

The ARO liabilities for the traditional electric operating companies primarily relate to facilities that are subject to the CCR Rule, principally ash ponds. In addition, Alabama Power and Georgia Power have retirement obligations related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities (Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's ownership interests in Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2). See "

Nuclear Decommissioning

" herein for additional information. The traditional electric operating companies also have AROs related to various landfill sites, asbestos removal, and underground storage tanks, as well as, for Alabama Power, disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers and sulfur hexafluoride gas in certain substation breakers, for Georgia Power, gypsum cells, and for Mississippi Power, mine reclamation and water wells. The ARO liability for Southern Power primarily relates to Southern Power's solar and wind facilities, which are located on long-term land leases requiring the restoration of land at the end of the lease.

The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas also have identified other retirement obligations, such as obligations related to certain electric transmission and distribution facilities, certain asbestos containing material within long-term assets not subject to ongoing repair and maintenance activities, certain wireless communication towers, the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers, leasehold improvements, equipment on customer property, and property associated with the Southern Company system's rail lines and natural gas pipelines. However, liabilities for the removal of these assets have not been recorded because the settlement timing for certain retirement obligations related to these assets is indeterminable and, therefore, the fair value of the retirement obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. A liability for these retirement obligations will be recognized when sufficient information becomes available to support a reasonable estimation of the ARO.

Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies will continue to recognize in their respective statements of income allowed removal costs in accordance with regulatory treatment. Any differences between costs recognized in accordance

II-328


Index to Financial Statements

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

with accounting standards related to asset retirement and environmental obligations and those reflected in rates are recognized as either a regulatory asset or liability in the balance sheets as ordered by the various state PSCs.

Details of the AROs included in the balance sheets are as follows:

In June 2018, Alabama Power recorded an increase of approximately

$1.2 billion

to its AROs related to the CCR Rule. Mississippi Power also recorded an increase of approximately

$11 million

to its AROs related to an ash pond at Plant Greene County, which is jointly-owned with Alabama Power. The revised cost estimates were based on information from feasibility studies performed on ash ponds in use at plants operated by Alabama Power, including Plant Greene County. During the second quarter 2018, Alabama Power's management completed its analysis of these studies which indicated that additional closure costs, primarily related to increases in estimated ash volume, water management requirements, and design revisions, will be required to close these ash ponds under the planned closure-in-place methodology. As the level of work becomes more defined in the next


months, it is likely that these cost estimates will change and the change could be material.

In December 2018, Georgia Power recorded an increase of approximately

$3.1 billion

to its AROs related to the CCR Rule and the related state rule. During the second half of 2018, Georgia Power completed a strategic assessment related to its plans to close the ash ponds at all of its generating plants in compliance with the CCR Rule and the related state rule. This assessment included engineering and constructability studies related to design assumptions for ash pond closures and advanced engineering methods. The results indicated that additional closure costs will be required to close these ash ponds, primarily due to changes in closure strategies, the estimated amount of ash to be excavated, and additional water management requirements necessary to support closure strategies. These factors also impact the estimated timing of future cash outlays.

In June 2018, Alabama Power completed an updated decommissioning cost site study for Plant Farley. The estimated cost of decommissioning based on the study resulted in an increase in Alabama Power's ARO liability of approximately

$300 million

. In December 2018, Georgia Power completed updated decommissioning cost site studies for Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2. The estimated cost of decommissioning based on the studies resulted in an increase in Georgia Power's ARO liability of approximately

$130 million

. See "

Nuclear Decommissioning

" below for additional information.

The 2018 reclassification of a portion of the ARO liability to liabilities held for sale by Southern Company represents the AROs related to Gulf Power. See Note


under "

Southern Company's Sale of Gulf Power

" and "

Assets Held for Sale

" for additional information.

In


, Alabama Power's and Georgia Power's cash flow revisions were primarily related to changes in closure strategy for ash ponds and landfills. Georgia Power's cash flow revisions in


also related to changes in closure strategy for gypsum cells. Mississippi Power's cash flow revisions in


primarily related to a revision in the closure date of its lignite mine. The liabilities settled in


for Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power were primarily related to ash pond closure activity.

The cost estimates for AROs related to the CCR Rule are based on information at

December 31, 2018

using various assumptions related to closure and post-closure costs, timing of future cash outlays, inflation and discount rates, and the potential methods for

II-329


Index to Financial Statements

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

complying with the CCR Rule requirements for closure. The traditional electric operating companies expect to continue to periodically update their ARO cost estimates, which could increase further, as additional information becomes available. Absent continued recovery of ARO costs through regulated rates, Southern Company's and the traditional electric operating companies' results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition could be materially impacted. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Nuclear Decommissioning

The NRC requires licensees of commercial nuclear power reactors to establish a plan for providing reasonable assurance of funds for future decommissioning. Alabama Power and Georgia Power have external trust funds (Funds) to comply with the NRC's regulations. Use of the Funds is restricted to nuclear decommissioning activities. The Funds are managed and invested in accordance with applicable requirements of various regulatory bodies, including the NRC, the FERC, and state PSCs, as well as the IRS. While Alabama Power and Georgia Power are allowed to prescribe an overall investment policy to the Funds' managers, neither Southern Company nor its subsidiaries or affiliates are allowed to engage in the day-to-day management of the Funds or to mandate individual investment decisions. Day-to-day management of the investments in the Funds is delegated to unrelated third-party managers with oversight by the management of Alabama Power and Georgia Power. The Funds' managers are authorized, within certain investment guidelines, to actively buy and sell securities at their own discretion in order to maximize the return on the Funds' investments. The Funds are invested in a tax-efficient manner in a diversified mix of equity and fixed income securities and are reported as trading securities.

Alabama Power and Georgia Power record the investment securities held in the Funds at fair value, as disclosed in Note


, as management believes that fair value best represents the nature of the Funds. Gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, are recorded in the regulatory liability for AROs in the balance sheets and are not included in net income or OCI. Fair value adjustments and realized gains and losses are determined on a specific identification basis.

The Funds at Georgia Power participate in a securities lending program through the managers of the Funds. Under this program, Georgia Power's Funds' investment securities are loaned to institutional investors for a fee. Securities loaned are fully collateralized by cash, letters of credit, and/or securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities. At

December 31, 2018

and


, approximately

$27 million

and

$76 million

For ratemaking purposes, Alabama Power's decommissioning costs are based on the site study and Georgia Power's decommissioning costs are based on the NRC generic estimate to decommission the radioactive portion of the facilities and the site study estimate for spent fuel management as of 2012. Significant assumptions used to determine these costs for ratemaking were an estimated inflation rate of

4.5%

and

2.4%

for Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, and an estimated trust earnings rate of

7.0%

and

4.4%

for Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively.

Amounts previously contributed to the Funds for Plant Farley are currently projected to be adequate to meet the decommissioning obligations. Alabama Power will continue to provide site-specific estimates of the decommissioning costs and related projections of funds in the external trust to the Alabama PSC and, if necessary, would seek the Alabama PSC's approval to address any changes in a manner consistent with NRC and other applicable requirements.

Under the 2013 ARP, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's annual decommissioning cost for ratemaking of

$4 million

and

$2 million

for Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, respectively. Georgia Power expects the Georgia PSC to review and adjust, if necessary, the amounts collected in rates for nuclear decommissioning costs in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case.


. CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS

The registrants may hold ownership interests in a number of business ventures with varying ownership structures. Partnership interests and other variable interests are evaluated to determine if each entity is a VIE. If a venture is a VIE for which a registrant is the primary beneficiary, the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the entity are consolidated. The registrants reassess the conclusion as to whether an entity is a VIE upon certain occurrences, which are deemed reconsideration events.

For entities that are not determined to be VIEs, the registrants evaluate whether they have control or significant influence over the investee to determine the appropriate consolidation and presentation. Generally, entities under the control of a registrant are consolidated, and entities over which a registrant can exert significant influence, but which a registrant does not control, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. However, the registrants may also invest in partnerships and limited liability companies that maintain separate ownership accounts. All such investments are required to be accounted for under the equity method unless the interest is so minor that there is virtually no influence over operating and financial policies, as are all investments in joint ventures.

Investments accounted for under the equity method are recorded within equity investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in the balance sheets and, for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas, the equity income is recorded within earnings from equity method investments in the statements of income.

See Note


under "

Guarantees

" for additional information regarding guarantees of Alabama Power and Georgia Power related to SEGCO.

Southern Power

Variable Interest Entities

Southern Power has certain wholly-owned subsidiaries that are determined to be VIEs. Southern Power is considered the primary beneficiary of these VIEs because it controls the most significant activities of the VIEs, including operating and maintaining the respective assets, and has the obligation to absorb expected losses of these VIEs to the extent of its equity interests.

SP Solar

On May 22, 2018, Southern Power sold a noncontrolling

33%

limited partnership interest in SP Solar to Global Atlantic Financial Group Limited (Global Atlantic). See Note


under "

Southern Power

" for additional information. A wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Power is the general partner and holds a

1%

ownership interest in SP Solar and another wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Power owns the remaining

66%

ownership in SP Solar. SP Solar qualifies as a VIE since the arrangement is structured as a limited partnership and the

33%

limited partner does not have substantive kick-out rights against the general partner. Southern Power previously consolidated SP Solar and will continue to do so as the primary beneficiary of the VIE since it controls the most significant activities of the partnership, including operating and maintaining its assets.

At December 31, 2018, SP Solar had total assets of

$6.3 billion

, total liabilities of

$113 million

, and noncontrolling interests of

$1.2 billion

. Cash distributions from SP Solar are allocated

67%

to Southern Power and

33%

to Global Atlantic in accordance with their partnership interest percentage. Under the terms of the limited partnership agreement, distributions without limited partner consent are limited to available cash and SP Solar is obligated to distribute all such available cash to its partners each quarter. Available cash includes all cash generated in the quarter subject to the maintenance of appropriate operating reserves.

Transfers and sales of the assets in the VIE are subject to limited partner consent and the liabilities do not have recourse to the general credit of Southern Power. Liabilities consist of customary working capital items and do not include any long-term debt.

SP Wind

On December 11, 2018, Southern Power sold a noncontrolling tax-equity interest in SP Wind to

three

financial investors. SP Wind owns

eight

operating wind farms. See Note


under "

Southern Power

" for additional information. Southern Power owns

100%

of the class B membership interests and the

three

financial investors own

100%

of the Class A membership interests. SP Wind qualifies as a VIE since the structure of the arrangement is similar to a limited partnership and the Class A members do not have substantive kick-out rights against Southern Power. Southern Power previously consolidated SP Wind and will continue to do so as the primary beneficiary of the VIE since it controls the most significant activities of the entity, including operating and maintaining its assets.

At December 31, 2018, SP Wind had total assets of

$2.5 billion

, total liabilities of

$51 million

, and noncontrolling interests of

$47 million

. Under the terms of the limited liability agreement, distributions without Class A member consent are limited to available cash and SP Wind is obligated to distribute all such available cash to its members each quarter. Available cash includes all cash

generated in the quarter subject to the maintenance of appropriate operating reserves. Cash distributions from SP Wind are generally allocated

60%

to Southern Power and

40%

to the

three

financial investors in accordance with the limited liability agreement.

Transfers and sales of the assets in the VIE are subject to Class A member consent and the liabilities do not have recourse to the general credit of Southern Power. Liabilities consist of customary working capital items and do not include any long-term debt.

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests

In April 2017, Southern Power reclassified approximately

$114 million

from redeemable noncontrolling interests to non-redeemable noncontrolling interests due to the expiration of an option allowing SunPower Corporation to require Southern Power to purchase its redeemable noncontrolling interest at fair market value. In addition, in October 2017, Turner Renewable Energy, LLC redeemed at fair value its

10%

interest of redeemable noncontrolling interest in certain of Southern Power's solar facilities. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were

no

outstanding redeemable noncontrolling interests.

Southern Company Gas

SouthStar, previously a joint venture owned

85%

by Southern Company Gas and

15%

by Piedmont, was the only VIE for which Southern Company Gas was the primary beneficiary, prior to October 2016 when Southern Company Gas completed its purchase of Piedmont's remaining interest in SouthStar.

In 2015, Georgia Natural Gas Company (GNG), a

100%

-owned, direct subsidiary of Southern Company Gas, notified Piedmont of its election, pursuant to a change in control of SouthStar, to purchase Piedmont's

15%

interest in SouthStar at fair market value. This purchase was contingent upon the closing of the merger between Piedmont and Duke Energy Corporation (Duke Energy). In October 2016, after Piedmont and Duke Energy completed their merger, GNG completed its purchase of Piedmont's interest in SouthStar and paid a purchase price of

$160 million

and

$15 million

for Piedmont's share of SouthStar's 2016 earnings through the date of acquisition.

Southern Company Gas' cash flows used for financing activities included SouthStar's distribution to Piedmont for its portion of SouthStar's annual earnings from the previous year. For the successor period of

July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016

, SouthStar made a distribution of

$15 million

upon completion of the purchase of Piedmont's interest in SouthStar. For the predecessor period of

January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016

DOE Loan Guarantee Borrowings

Pursuant to the loan guarantee program established under Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Title XVII Loan Guarantee Program), Georgia Power and the DOE entered into the Loan Guarantee Agreement in 2014, under which the DOE agreed to guarantee the obligations of Georgia Power under a note purchase agreement (FFB Note Purchase Agreement) among the DOE, Georgia Power, and the FFB and a related promissory note (FFB Promissory Note). The FFB Note Purchase Agreement and the FFB Promissory Note provide for a multi-advance term loan facility (FFB Credit Facility), under which Georgia Power may make term loan borrowings through the FFB.

In July 2017, Georgia Power entered into an amendment to the Loan Guarantee Agreement (LGA Amendment) in connection with the DOE's consent to Georgia Power's entry into the Vogtle Services Agreement and the related intellectual property licenses (IP Licenses).

Under the terms of the Loan Guarantee Agreement, upon termination of the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement, further advances are conditioned upon the DOE's approval of any agreements entered into in replacement of the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement. Under the terms of the LGA Amendment, Georgia Power will not request any advances unless and until certain conditions are satisfied, including (i) receipt of the DOE's approval of the Bechtel Agreement (together with the Vogtle Services Agreement and the IP Licenses, the Replacement EPC Arrangements) and (ii) Georgia Power's entry into a further amendment to the Loan Guarantee Agreement with the DOE to reflect the Replacement EPC Arrangements.

Proceeds of advances made under the FFB Credit Facility are used to reimburse Georgia Power for Eligible Project Costs. Aggregate borrowings under the FFB Credit Facility may not exceed the lesser of (i)

70%

of Eligible Project Costs or (ii) approximately

$3.46 billion

.

In September 2017, the DOE issued a conditional commitment to Georgia Power for up to approximately

$1.67 billion

of additional guaranteed loans under the Loan Guarantee Agreement. This conditional commitment expires on

March 31, 2019

, subject to any further extension approved by the DOE. Final approval and issuance of these additional loan guarantees by the DOE cannot be assured and are subject to the negotiation of definitive agreements, completion of due diligence by the DOE, receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals, and satisfaction of other conditions.

All borrowings under the FFB Credit Facility are full recourse to Georgia Power, and Georgia Power is obligated to reimburse the DOE for any payments the DOE is required to make to the FFB under the guarantee. Georgia Power's reimbursement obligations to the DOE are full recourse and secured by a first priority lien on (i) Georgia Power's

45.7%

undivided ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (primarily the units under construction, the related real property, and any nuclear fuel loaded in the reactor core) and (ii) Georgia Power's rights and obligations under the principal contracts relating to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. There are no restrictions on Georgia Power's ability to grant liens on other property.

In addition to the conditions described above, future advances are subject to satisfaction of customary conditions, as well as certification of compliance with the requirements of the Title XVII Loan Guarantee Program, including accuracy of project-related representations and warranties, delivery of updated project-related information, and evidence of compliance with the

II-340


Index to Financial Statements

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

prevailing wage requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act of 1931, as amended, and certification from the DOE's consulting engineer that proceeds of the advances are used to reimburse Eligible Project Costs.

Upon satisfaction of all conditions described above, advances may be requested under the FFB Credit Facility on a quarterly basis through 2020. The final maturity date for each advance under the FFB Credit Facility is February 20, 2044. Interest is payable quarterly and principal payments will begin on February 20, 2020. Borrowings under the FFB Credit Facility will bear interest at the applicable U.S. Treasury rate plus a spread equal to

0.375%

.

At both

December 31, 2018

and


, Georgia Power had

$2.6 billion

of borrowings outstanding under the FFB Credit Facility.

Under the Loan Guarantee Agreement, Georgia Power is subject to customary borrower affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. In addition, Georgia Power is subject to project-related reporting requirements and other project-specific covenants and events of default.

In the event certain mandatory prepayment events (including any decision not to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4) occur, the FFB's commitment to make further advances under the FFB Credit Facility will terminate and Georgia Power will be required to prepay the outstanding principal amount of all borrowings under the FFB Credit Facility over a period of

five years

(with level principal amortization). Among other things, these mandatory prepayment events include (i) the termination of the Vogtle Services Agreement or rejection of the Vogtle Services Agreement in bankruptcy if Georgia Power does not maintain access to intellectual property rights under the IP Licenses; (ii) a decision by Georgia Power not to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4; (iii) cancellation of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 by the Georgia PSC, or by Georgia Power if authorized by the Georgia PSC; and (iv) cost disallowances by the Georgia PSC that could have a material adverse effect on completion of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 or Georgia Power's ability to repay the outstanding borrowings under the FFB Credit Facility. Under certain circumstances, insurance proceeds and any proceeds from an event of taking must be applied to immediately prepay outstanding borrowings under the FFB Credit Facility. In addition, if Georgia Power discontinues construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, Georgia Power would be obligated to immediately repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the FFB Credit Facility to the extent such outstanding borrowings exceed

70%

of Eligible Project Costs, net of the proceeds received by Georgia Power under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement. Georgia Power also may voluntarily prepay outstanding borrowings under the FFB Credit Facility. Under the FFB Credit Facility, any prepayment (whether mandatory or optional) will be made with a make-whole premium or discount, as applicable.

In connection with any cancellation of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 that results in a mandatory prepayment event, the DOE may elect to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. In such an event, the DOE will have the right to assume Georgia Power's rights and obligations under the principal agreements relating to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and to acquire all or a portion of Georgia Power's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.

During 2017, Alabama Power and Gulf Power redeemed all of their outstanding preference stock and Georgia Power redeemed all of its outstanding preferred and preference stock. During 2018, Mississippi Power redeemed all of its outstanding preferred stock. The remaining preferred stock of Alabama Power contains a feature that allows the holders to elect a majority of such subsidiary's board of directors if preferred dividends are not paid for four consecutive quarters. Because such a potential redemption-triggering event is not solely within the control of Alabama Power, this preferred stock is presented as "Redeemable Preferred Stock of Subsidiaries" on Southern Company's balance sheets and statements of capitalization in a manner consistent with temporary equity under applicable accounting standards.

The preferred stock and Class A preferred stock of Alabama Power contain a feature that allows the holders to elect a majority of Alabama Power's board of directors if preferred dividends are not paid for four consecutive quarters. Because such a potential redemption-triggering event is not solely within the control of Alabama Power, the preferred stock and Class A preferred stock is presented as "Redeemable Preferred Stock" on Alabama Power's balance sheets and statements of capitalization in a manner consistent with temporary equity under applicable accounting standards.

Structural Considerations

Since Southern Company and Southern Company Gas are holding companies, the right of Southern Company and Southern Company Gas and, hence, the right of creditors of Southern Company or Southern Company Gas to participate in any distribution of the assets of any respective subsidiary of Southern Company or Southern Company Gas, whether upon liquidation, reorganization or otherwise, is subject to prior claims of creditors and preferred stockholders of such subsidiary.

Southern Company Gas'

100%

-owned subsidiary, Southern Company Gas Capital, was established to provide for certain of Southern Company Gas' ongoing financing needs through a commercial paper program, the issuance of various debt, hybrid securities, and other financing arrangements. Southern Company Gas fully and unconditionally guarantees all debt issued by Southern Company Gas Capital. Nicor Gas is not permitted by regulation to make loans to affiliates or utilize Southern Company Gas Capital for its financing needs.

Southern Power Company's senior notes, bank term loans, commercial paper, and bank credit arrangement

are unsecured senior indebtedness, which rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated debt of Southern Power Compan

y. Southern Power's subsidiaries are not issuers, borrowers, or obligors, as applicable, under the senior notes,

borrowings from financial institutions

, commercial paper, or the bank credit arrangement. The se

nior notes, borrowings from financial institutions, commercial paper, and the bank credit arrangement are effectively subordinated to any future secured debt of Southern Power Company and any potential claims of creditors of Southern Power's subsidiaries.

For the traditional electric operating companies, a majority of the railcar and barge lease expenses are recoverable through fuel cost recovery provisions.

In addition to the above rental commitments, Alabama Power and Georgia Power have potential obligations upon expiration of certain railcar leases with respect to the residual value of the leased property. These leases have terms expiring in 2023 for Alabama Power and in 2024 for Georgia Power with maximum obligations under these leases of

$12 million

for Alabama Power and

$9 million

for Georgia Power. At the termination of the leases, Alabama Power and Georgia Power may renew the leases, exercise their purchase options, or the property can be sold to a third party. Alabama Power and Georgia Power expect that the fair market value of the leased property would substantially reduce or, for Alabama Power, potentially eliminate the loss under the residual value obligations.

Guarantees

Alabama Power has guaranteed unconditionally the obligation of SEGCO under an installment sale agreement for the purchase of certain pollution control facilities at SEGCO's generating units, pursuant to which

$25 million

principal amount of pollution control revenue bonds are outstanding and mature in June 2019. Alabama Power also guaranteed a

$100 million

principal amount long-term bank loan entered into by SEGCO on November 28, 2018. Georgia Power has agreed to reimburse Alabama Power for the portion of such obligations corresponding to Georgia Power's proportionate ownership of SEGCO's stock if Alabama Power is called upon to make such payment under its guarantee. At

December 31, 2018

, the capitalization of SEGCO consisted of

$90 million

of equity and

$125 million

of long-term debt, on which the annual interest requirement is

$4 million

. In addition, SEGCO had short-term debt outstanding of

$5 million

. See Note


under "

SEGCO

" for additional information.

In 2013, Georgia Power entered into an agreement that requires Georgia Power to guarantee certain payments of a gas supplier for Plant McIntosh for a period up to

15 years

. The agreement was subsequently amended on May 31, 2018. The guarantee is expected to be terminated if certain events occur by October 2019. In the event the gas supplier defaults on payments, the maximum potential exposure under the guarantee and amendment is approximately

$30 million

.

In October 2017, Atlantic Coast Pipeline executed a

$3.4 billion

revolving credit facility with a stated maturity date of October 2021. Southern Company Gas entered into a guarantee agreement to support its share of the revolving credit facility. Southern Company Gas' maximum exposure to loss under the terms of the guarantee is limited to

5%

of the outstanding borrowings under the credit facility, and totaled

$72 million

as of December 31, 2018. See Note


under "FERC Matters – Southern Company Gas" for additional information regarding the Atlantic Coast Pipeline.

As discussed above under "

Operating Leases

," Alabama Power and Georgia Power have entered into certain residual value guarantees related to railcar leases.


. INCOME TAXES

Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and the registrants file various state income tax returns, some of which are combined or unitary. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement, each Southern Company subsidiary's current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis and no subsidiary is allocated more current expense than would be paid if it filed a separate income tax return. PowerSecure and Southern Company Gas became participants in the income

tax allocation agreement as of May 9, 2016 and July 1, 2016, respectively. See Note 15 for additional information on these acquisitions, as well as disposition activity during 2018. In accordance with IRS regulations, each company is jointly and severally liable for the federal tax liability. Prior to the Merger, Southern Company Gas filed a U.S. federal consolidated income tax return and various state income tax returns.

Federal Tax Reform Legislation

Following the enactment of the Tax Reform Legislation, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 – "Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" (SAB 118), which provided for a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date to complete accounting under GAAP for the tax effects of the legislation. Due to the complex and comprehensive nature of the enacted tax law changes and their application under GAAP, the registrants considered all amounts recorded in the financial statements as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation "provisional" as discussed in SAB 118 and subject to revision prior to filing the 2017 tax return in the fourth quarter 2018. As of December 31, 2018, each of the registrants considered the measurement of impacts from the Tax Reform Legislation on deferred income tax assets and liabilities, primarily due to the impact of the reduction of the corporate income tax rate, to be complete.

However, the IRS continues to issue regulations that provide further interpretation and guidance on the law and each respective state's adoption of the provisions contained in the Tax Reform Legislation remains uncertain. In addition, the regulatory treatment of certain impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation is subject to the discretion of the FERC and each state regulatory commission. The ultimate impact of these matters cannot be determined at this time. See Note


for additional information.

Current and Deferred Income Taxes

, and

$1.13 billion

for


. These ITCs and PTCs for Southern Company and Southern Power are included in "

Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities

" herein.

In accordance with regulatory requirements, federal ITCs for the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities, as well as certain state ITCs for Nicor Gas, are deferred, and, upon utilization, amortized over the average life of the related property with such amortization normally applied as a credit to reduce depreciation in the statements of income. Southern Power's deferred federal ITCs are amortized to income tax expense over the life of the respective asset. ITCs amortized in


,


, and


were immaterial for Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas and were as follows for Southern Company and Southern Power:

Southern Power received

$5 million

of cash related to federal ITCs under renewable energy initiatives in 2018.

No

cash was received in 2017 or 2016. Southern Power recognized tax credits and reduced the tax basis of the asset by

50%

of the ITCs received, resulting in a net deferred tax asset. Southern Power has elected to recognize the tax benefit of this basis difference as a reduction to income tax expense in the year in which the plant reaches commercial operation. The tax benefit of the related basis differences reduced income tax expense by

$1 million

in


,

$18 million

in


, and

$173 million

in


. See "

Unrecognized Tax Benefits

" herein for further information.

State ITCs and other state credits, which are recognized in the period in which the credits are generated, reduced Georgia Power's income tax expense by

$21 million

in 2018,

$37 million

in 2017, and

$31 million

in 2016 and reduced Southern Power's income tax expense by

$32 million

in 2017 and

in 2016.

Southern Power's federal and state PTCs, which are recognized in the period in which the credits are generated, reduced Southern Power's income tax expense by

$141 million

Legal Entity Reorganizations

In April 2018, Southern Power completed the final stage of a legal entity reorganization of various direct and indirect subsidiaries that own and operate substantially all of its solar facilities, including certain subsidiaries owned in partnership with various third parties. In September 2018, Southern Power also completed a legal entity reorganization of

eight

operating wind facilities under a new holding company, SP Wind. The reorganizations resulted in net state tax benefits related to certain changes in apportionment rates totaling approximately

$65 million

, which were recorded in 2018.

Effective Tax Rate

Southern Company's effective tax rate is typically lower than the statutory rate due to employee stock plans' dividend deduction, non-taxable AFUDC equity at the traditional electric operating companies, flowback of excess deferred income taxes at the regulated utilities, and federal income tax benefits from ITCs and PTCs primarily at Southern Power. Each registrant's effective tax rate for 2018 varied significantly as compared to 2017 due to the 14% lower 2018 federal tax rate resulting from the Tax Reform Legislation.

for Southern Company, Mississippi Power, and Southern Power are provided below. The remaining registrants did not have any material unrecognized tax benefits for the periods presented.

Mississippi Power's tax positions increase from current and prior periods for 2017 and 2016 relate to state tax benefits, deductions for R&E expenditures, and charitable contribution carryforwards that were impacted as a result of the settlement of R&E expenditures associated with the Kemper County energy facility, as well as federal income tax benefits from deferred ITCs. Mississippi Power's tax positions decrease from prior periods and the reductions due to settlements for 2017 relate primarily to the settlement of R&E expenditures associated with the Kemper County energy facility. See Note

" herein for more information.

Southern Power's increase in unrecognized tax benefits from current periods for 2016, and the decrease from prior periods for 2017 and 2016, primarily relate to federal income tax benefits from deferred ITCs.

There were

no

unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2018. The impact on the effective tax rate of Southern Company, Mississippi Power, and Southern Power, if recognized, was as follows for 2017 and 2016:

Mississippi Power's tax positions not impacting the effective tax rate for 2016 relate to deductions for R&E expenditures associated with the Kemper County energy facility. See "

II-363


Index to Financial Statements

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

Southern Power's impact on the effective tax rate was determined based on the amount of ITCs, which were uncertain.

All of the registrants classify interest on tax uncertainties as interest expense. Accrued interest for all tax positions other than the Section 174 R&E deductions was immaterial for all years presented. None of the registrants accrued any penalties on uncertain tax positions.

It is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits could change within

12 months

. New audit findings or settlements associated with ongoing audits could result in significant unrecognized tax benefits. At this time, a range of reasonably possible outcomes cannot be determined.

The IRS has finalized its audits of Southern Company's consolidated federal income tax returns through 2017, as well as the pre-Merger Southern Company Gas tax returns. Southern Company is a participant in the Compliance Assurance Process of the IRS. The audits for the registrants' state income tax returns have either been concluded, or the statute of limitations has expired, for years prior to 2012.

Section 174 Research and Experimental Deduction

Southern Company, on behalf of Mississippi Power, has reflected deductions for R&E expenditures related to the Kemper County energy facility in its federal income tax calculations since 2013 and filed amended federal income tax returns for 2008 through 2013 to also include such deductions. In September 2017, the U.S. Congress Joint Committee on Taxation approved a settlement between Southern Company and the IRS, resolving a methodology for these deductions. As a result of this approval, Mississippi Power recognized

$176 million

in 2017 of previously unrecognized tax benefits and reversed

$36 million

of associated accrued interest.


. RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Southern Company system has a qualified defined benefit, trusteed, pension plan covering substantially all employees, with the exception of employees at PowerSecure. The qualified defined benefit pension plan is funded in accordance with requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA).

No

contributions to the qualified pension plan were made for the year ended

December 31, 2018

and

no

mandatory contributions to the qualified pension plan are anticipated for the year ending

December 31, 2019

. The Southern Company system also provides certain non-qualified defined benefits for a select group of management and highly compensated employees, which are funded on a cash basis. In addition, the Southern Company system provides certain medical care and life insurance benefits for retired employees through other postretirement benefit plans. The traditional electric operating companies fund other postretirement trusts to the extent required by their respective regulatory commissions. Southern Company Gas has a separate unfunded supplemental retirement health care plan that provides medical care and life insurance benefits to employees of discontinued businesses. For the year ending

December 31, 2019

,

no

other postretirement trust contributions are expected.

On January 1, 2018, the qualified defined benefit pension plan of Southern Company Gas was merged into the Southern Company system's qualified defined benefit pension plan and the pension plan was reopened to all non-union employees of Southern Company Gas. Prior to January 1, 2018, Southern Company Gas had a separate qualified defined benefit, trusteed, pension plan covering certain eligible employees, which was closed in 2012 to new employees. Also on January 1, 2018, Southern Company Gas' non-qualified retirement plans were merged into the Southern Company system's non-qualified retirement plan (defined benefit and defined contribution).

Effective in December 2017,


employees transferred from SCS to Southern Power. Accordingly, Southern Power assumed various compensation and benefit plans including participation in the Southern Company system's qualified defined benefit, trusteed, pension plan covering substantially all employees. With the transfer of employees, Southern Power assumed the related benefit obligations from SCS of

$139 million

for the qualified pension plan (along with trust assets of

$138 million

) and

$11 million

for other postretirement benefit plans, together with

$36 million

in prior service costs and net gains/losses in OCI. In 2018, Southern Power also began providing certain defined benefits under the non-qualified pension plan for a select group of management and highly compensated employees. No obligation related to these benefits was assumed in the employee transfer; however, obligations for services rendered by employees following the transfer are being recognized by Southern Power and are funded on a cash basis. In addition, Southern Power provides certain medical care and life insurance benefits for retired employees through other postretirement benefit plans that are funded on a cash basis. Prior to the transfer of employees in December 2017, substantially all expenses charged by SCS, including pension and other postretirement benefit costs, were recorded in Southern Power's other operations and maintenance expense. The disclosures included herein exclude Southern Power for periods prior to the transfer of employees in December 2017.

On January 1, 2019, Southern Company completed the sale of Gulf Power to NextEra Energy. See Note

The registrants estimate the expected rate of return on pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan assets using a financial model to project the expected return on each current investment portfolio. The analysis projects an expected rate of return on each of the different asset classes in order to arrive at the expected return on the entire portfolio relying on each trust's target asset allocation and reasonable capital market assumptions. The financial model is based on four key inputs: anticipated returns by asset class (based in part on historical returns), each trust's target asset allocation, an anticipated inflation rate, and the projected impact of a periodic rebalancing of each trust's portfolio.

Components of net periodic pension cost for Southern Company Gas were as follows:

Net periodic pension cost is the sum of service cost, interest cost, and other costs netted against the expected return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets is determined by multiplying the expected rate of return on plan assets and the market-related value of plan assets. In determining the market-related value of plan assets, the registrants have elected to amortize changes in the

Benefit Plan Assets

Pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan assets are managed and invested in accordance with all applicable requirements, including ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code. The registrants' investment policies for both the pension plans and the other postretirement benefit plans cover a diversified mix of assets as described below. Derivative instruments may be used to gain efficient exposure to the various asset classes and as hedging tools. Additionally, the registrants minimize the risk of large losses primarily through diversification but also monitor and manage other aspects of risk.

The investment strategy for plan assets related to the Southern Company system's qualified pension plan is to be broadly diversified across major asset classes. The asset allocation is established after consideration of various factors that affect the assets and liabilities of the pension plan including, but not limited to, historical and expected returns and interest rates, volatility, correlations of asset classes, the current level of assets and liabilities, and the assumed growth in assets and liabilities. Because a significant portion of the liability of the pension plans is long-term in nature, the assets are invested consistent with long-term investment expectations for return and risk. To manage the actual asset class exposures relative to the target asset allocation, the Southern Company system employs a formal rebalancing program. As additional risk management, external investment managers and service providers are subject to written guidelines to ensure appropriate and prudent investment practices. Management believes the portfolio is well-diversified with no significant concentrations of risk.

Investment Strategies and Benefit Plan Asset Fair Values

. STOCK COMPENSATION

Stock-Based Compensation

Stock-based compensation primarily in the form of Southern Company performance share units (PSU) and restricted stock units (RSU) may be granted through the Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan to a large segment of Southern Company system employees ranging from line management to executives. Southern Company Gas and Southern Power had no employee participants in the stock-based compensation plans until 2017 and 2018, respectively. In conjunction with the Merger, stock-based compensation in the form of Southern Company RSUs and PSUs was granted to certain executives of Southern Company Gas through the Southern Company Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan.

At

December 31, 2018

, the number of current and former employees participating in stock-based compensation programs for the registrants was as follows:

Employees become immediately vested in PSUs and RSUs upon retirement. As a result, compensation expense for employees that are retirement eligible at the grant date is recognized immediately, while compensation expense for employees that become retirement eligible during the vesting period is recognized over the period from grant date to the date of retirement eligibility. In addition, the registrants recognize forfeitures as they occur.

All unvested PSUs and RSUs vest immediately upon a change in control where Southern Company is not the surviving corporation.

Performance Share Units

PSUs granted to employees vest at the end of a

three

-year performance period. Shares of Southern Company common stock are delivered to employees at the end of the performance period with the number of shares issued ranging from

0%

to

200%

of the target number of PSUs granted, based on achievement of the performance goals established by the Compensation Committee of the Southern Company Board of Directors.

Southern Company has issued

three

types of PSUs, each with a unique performance goal. These types of PSUs include total shareholder return (TSR) awards based on the TSR for Southern Company common stock during the

three

-year performance period as compared to a group of industry peers; ROE awards based on Southern Company's equity-weighted return over the performance period; and EPS awards based on Southern Company's cumulative EPS over the performance period. EPS awards were not granted in 2018.

II-394


Index to Financial Statements

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

The fair value of TSR awards is determined as of the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the TSR of Southern Company's common stock among industry peers over the performance period. In determining the fair value of the TSR awards issued to employees, the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of Southern Company's stock over a period equal to the performance period. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant that covers the performance period of the awards. The following table shows the assumptions used in the pricing model and the weighted average grant-date fair value of TSR awards granted:

The registrants recognize TSR award compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the

three

-year performance period without remeasurement.

The fair values of EPS awards and ROE awards are based on the closing stock price of Southern Company common stock on the date of the grant. The weighted average grant-date fair value of the awards granted during


,


, and


was

$43.49

,

$49.21

, and

$48.87

, respectively. Compensation expense for EPS and ROE awards is generally recognized ratably over the

three

-year performance period adjusted for expected changes in EPS and ROE performance. Total compensation cost recognized for vested EPS awards and ROE awards reflects final performance metrics.

Southern Company's total unvested PSUs outstanding at

Merger Stock Compensation

At the effective time of the Merger, each share of Southern Company Gas common stock, other than certain excluded shares, was converted into the right to receive

$66

in cash, without interest. Also, at the effective time of the Merger:

•

Southern Company Gas' outstanding RSUs, restricted stock awards, and non-employee director stock awards were deemed fully vested and were canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Southern Company Gas' common stock subject to such award and (ii) the Merger consideration of

$66

per share;

•

Southern Company Gas' outstanding stock options, all of which were fully vested, were canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Southern Company Gas' common stock subject to such options and (ii) the excess of the Merger consideration of

$66

per share over the applicable exercise price per share of such options; and

•

each outstanding award of a Southern Company Gas PSU was converted into an award of Southern Company RSUs. The conversion ratio was the product of (i) the greater of (a)

125%

of the number of units underlying such award based on target level achievement of all relevant performance goals and (b) the number of units underlying such award based on the actual level of achievement of all relevant performance goals against target and (ii) an exchange ratio based on the Merger consideration of

$66

per share as compared to the volume-weighted average price per share of Southern Company common stock.

Southern Company Restricted Stock Awards

At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding award of existing Southern Company Gas PSUs was converted into an award of Southern Company RSUs. Under the terms of the restricted stock awards, the employees received Southern Company stock when they satisfy the requisite service period by being continuously employed through the original

three

-year vesting schedule of the award being replaced. Southern Company issued

0.7 million

RSUs with a grant-date fair value of

$53.83

, based on the closing stock price of Southern Company common stock on the date of the grant. As a portion of the fair value of the award related to pre-combination service, the grant date fair value was allocated to pre- or post-combination service and accounted for as Merger consideration or compensation cost, respectively. Approximately

$13 million

of the grant date fair value was allocated to Merger consideration. Southern Company Gas recognized the remaining fair value as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining vesting period. As of December 31, 2018, all RSUs are vested and compensation cost is fully recognized.

For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, total compensation cost for RSUs recognized in income was

$2 million

,

$8 million

, and

$13 million

, respectively, with the related tax benefit of

$1 million

,

$4 million

, and

$4 million

, respectively, also recognized in income. The compensation cost related to the grant of RSUs to Southern Company Gas employees is recognized in Southern Company Gas' financial statements with a corresponding credit to equity, representing a capital contribution from Southern Company.

Southern Company Gas Change in Control Awards

Southern Company awarded PSUs to certain Southern Company Gas employees who continued their employment with the Southern Company in lieu of certain change in control benefits the employee was entitled to receive following the Merger (change in control awards). Shares of Southern Company common stock and/or cash equal to the dollar value of the change in control benefit will vest and be issued one-third each year as long as the employee remains in service with Southern Company or its subsidiaries at each vest date. In addition to the change in control benefit, Southern Company common stock could be issued to the employees at the end of a performance period based on achievement of certain Southern Company common stock price metrics, as well performance goals established by the Compensation Committee of the Southern Company Board of Directors (achievement shares).

The change in control benefits are accounted for as a liability award with the fair value equal to the guaranteed dollar value of the change in control benefit. The compensation cost of the change in control benefit is recognized in Southern Company Gas' financial statements with a corresponding credit to a liability. The grant-date fair value of the achievement portion of the award was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the number of achievement shares expected to vest based on the Southern Company common stock price. The compensation cost of the achievement shares is recognized in Southern Company Gas' financial statements with a corresponding credit to equity, representing a capital contribution from Southern Company. The expected payout is reevaluated annually with expense recognized to date increased or decreased proportionately based on the expected performance. The compensation cost ultimately recognized for the achievement shares will be based on the actual performance.

Predecessor

For the predecessor period of January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016, the employees of Southern Company Gas and subsidiaries participated in the AGL Resources Inc. Omnibus Performance Incentive Plan, as amended and restated.

The AGL Resources Inc. Omnibus Performance Incentive Plan, as amended and restated, and the Long-Term Incentive Plan (1999) provided for the grant of incentive and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, shares of restricted stock, RSUs, performance cash awards, and other stock-based awards to officers and key employees. Effective July 1, 2016, all Southern Company Gas shares of stock were canceled and/or converted as a result of the Merger. No further grants will be made from the Long-Term Incentive Plan (1999) or the AGL Resources Inc. Omnibus Performance Incentive Plan, as amended and restated.

For the predecessor period, Southern Company Gas recognized stock-based compensation cost for its stock-based awards over the requisite service period based on the estimated fair value at the date of grant for its stock-based awards using the modified prospective method.

Performance-based stock awards and performance units contained market and performance conditions. Stock options, restricted stock awards, and performance units also contained a service condition. Southern Company Gas estimated forfeitures over the requisite service period when recognizing compensation cost. These estimates were adjusted to the extent that actual forfeitures differ, or were expected to materially differ, from such estimates. The difference between the proceeds from the exercise of Southern Company Gas' stock-based awards and the par value of the stock was recorded within additional paid-in capital.

Southern Company Gas granted stock awards with a grant price that was equal to the fair market value on the date of the grant. Fair market value was defined under the terms of the applicable plans as the closing price per share of Southern Company Gas' common stock on the grant date. For the predecessor period of January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016, total compensation cost for cash and stock-based awards recognized in income was

$24 million

with related tax benefits of an immaterial amount also recognized in income.


. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value measurements are based on inputs of observable and unobservable market data that a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. The use of observable inputs is maximized where available and the use of unobservable inputs is minimized for fair value measurement and reflects a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used for fair value measurement.

•

Level 1 consists of observable market data in an active market for identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2 consists of observable market data, other than that included in Level 1, that is either directly or indirectly observable.

•

Level 3 consists of unobservable market data. The input may reflect the assumptions of each registrant of what a market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability. If there is little available market data, then each registrant's own assumptions are the best available information.

In the case of multiple inputs being used in a fair value measurement, the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement represents the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurement is reported.

Valuation Methodologies

The energy-related derivatives primarily consist of exchange-traded and over-the-counter financial products for natural gas and physical power products, including, from time to time, basis swaps. These are standard products used within the energy industry and are valued using the market approach. The inputs used are mainly from observable market sources, such as forward natural gas prices, power prices, implied volatility, and overnight index swap interest rates. Interest rate derivatives are also standard over-the-counter products that are valued using observable market data and assumptions commonly used by market participants. The fair value of interest rate derivatives reflects the net present value of expected payments and receipts under the swap

II-405


Index to Financial Statements

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

agreement based on the market's expectation of future interest rates. Additional inputs to the net present value calculation may include the contract terms, counterparty credit risk, and occasionally, implied volatility of interest rate options. The fair value of cross-currency swaps reflects the net present value of expected payments and receipts under the swap agreement based on the market's expectation of future foreign currency exchange rates. Additional inputs to the net present value calculation may include the contract terms, counterparty credit risk, and discount rates. The interest rate derivatives and cross-currency swaps are categorized as Level 2 under Fair Value Measurements as these inputs are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments. See Note


for additional information on how these derivatives are used.

For fair value measurements of the investments within the nuclear decommissioning trusts and the non-qualified deferred compensation trusts, external pricing vendors are designated for each asset class with each security specifically assigned a primary pricing source. For investments held within commingled funds, fair value is determined at the end of each business day through the net asset value, which is established by obtaining the underlying securities' individual prices from the primary pricing source. A market price secured from the primary source vendor is then evaluated by management in its valuation of the assets within the trusts. As a general approach, fixed income market pricing vendors gather market data (including indices and market research reports) and integrate relative credit information, observed market movements, and sector news into proprietary pricing models, pricing systems, and mathematical tools. Dealer quotes and other market information, including live trading levels and pricing analysts' judgments, are also obtained when available.

The NRC requires licensees of commissioned nuclear power reactors to establish a plan for providing reasonable assurance of funds for future decommissioning. See Note


under "

Nuclear Decommissioning

" for additional information.

Southern Power has contingent payment obligations related to certain acquisitions whereby Southern Power is primarily obligated to make generation-based payments to the seller, which commenced at the commercial operation of the respective facility and continue through 2026. The obligation is categorized as Level 3 under Fair Value Measurements as the fair value is determined using significant unobservable inputs for the forecasted facility generation in MW-hours, as well as other inputs such as a fixed dollar amount per MW-hour, and a discount rate. The fair value of contingent consideration reflects the net present value of expected payments and any periodic change arising from forecasted generation is expected to be immaterial.

"Other investments" include investments categorized as Level 3 under Fair Value Measurements that are not traded in the open market. The fair value of these investments has been determined based on market factors including comparable multiples and the expectations regarding cash flows and business plan executions.

The fair value measurements of private equity investments held in Alabama Power's nuclear decommissioning trusts that are calculated at net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient totaled

$45 million

and

$29 million

Private equity funds include funds-of-funds that invest in high-quality private equity funds across several market sectors, funds that invest in real estate assets, and a fund that acquires companies to create resale value. Private equity funds do not have redemption rights. Distributions from these funds will be received as the underlying investments in the funds are liquidated.

. DERIVATIVES

Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas are exposed to market risks, including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, weather risk, and occasionally foreign currency exchange rate risk. To manage the volatility attributable to these exposures, each company nets its exposures, where possible, to take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to each company's policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and risk management practices. Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas operations use various contracts in its commercial activities that generally meet the definition of derivatives. For the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas' other businesses, each company's policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including, but not limited to, market valuation, value at risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis. Derivative instruments are recognized at fair value in the balance sheets as either assets or liabilities and are presented on a net basis. See Note


for additional fair value information. In the statements of cash flows, any cash impacts of settled energy-related and interest rate derivatives are recorded as operating activities. Any cash impacts of settled foreign currency derivatives are classified as operating or financing activities to correspond with classification of the hedged interest or principal, respectively.

Energy-Related Derivatives

The traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas enter into energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, natural gas, and other fuel price changes. However, due to cost-based rate regulations and other various cost recovery mechanisms, the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities have limited exposure to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices. Each of the traditional electric operating companies and certain of the natural gas distribution utilities of Southern Company Gas manage fuel-hedging programs, implemented per the guidelines of their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies, through the use of financial derivative contracts, which are expected to continue to mitigate price volatility. The traditional electric operating companies (with respect to wholesale generating capacity) and Southern Power have limited exposure to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices because their long-term sales contracts shift substantially all fuel cost responsibility to the purchaser. However, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power may be exposed to market volatility in energy-related commodity

prices to the extent any uncontracted capacity is used to sell electricity. Southern Company Gas retains exposure to price changes that can, in a volatile energy market, be material and can adversely affect its results of operations.

Southern Company Gas also enters into weather derivative contracts as economic hedges of operating margins in the event of warmer-than-normal weather. Exchange-traded options are carried at fair value, with changes reflected in operating revenues. Non-exchange-traded options are accounted for using the intrinsic value method. Changes in the intrinsic value for non-exchange-traded contracts are reflected in operating revenues.

Energy-related derivative contracts are accounted for under one of three methods:

•

Regulatory Hedges

– Energy-related derivative contracts designated as regulatory hedges relate primarily to the traditional electric operating companies' and the natural gas distribution utilities' fuel-hedging programs, where gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense as the underlying fuel is used in operations and ultimately recovered through the respective fuel cost recovery clauses.

•

Cash Flow Hedges

– Gains and losses on energy-related derivatives designated as cash flow hedges (which are mainly used to hedge anticipated purchases and sales) are initially deferred in AOCI before being recognized in the statements of income in the same period and in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged transactions.

•

Not Designated

– Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as incurred.

Some energy-related derivative contracts require physical delivery as opposed to financial settlement, and this type of derivative is both common and prevalent within the electric and natural gas industries. When an energy-related derivative contract is settled physically, any cumulative unrealized gain or loss is reversed and the contract price is recognized in the respective line item representing the actual price of the underlying goods being delivered.

At

December 31, 2018

, the net volume of energy-related derivative contracts for natural gas positions, together with the longest hedge date over which the respective entity is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions and the longest non-hedge date for derivatives not designated as hedges, were as follows:

(*)

Southern Company Gas' derivative instruments include both long and short natural gas positions. A long position is a contract to purchase natural gas and a short position is a contract to sell natural gas. Southern Company Gas' volume represents the net of long natural gas positions of

4,159 million

mmBtu and short natural gas positions of

4,039 million

mmBtu at

December 31, 2018

, which is also included in Southern Company's total volume.

At

December 31, 2018

, the net volume of Southern Power's energy-related derivative contracts for power to be sold was

2 million

MWHs, all of which expire by


.

In addition to the volumes discussed above, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power enter into physical natural gas supply contracts that provide the option to sell back excess natural gas due to operational constraints. The maximum expected volume of natural gas subject to such a feature is

23 million

mmBtu for Southern Company, which includes

4 million

mmBtu for Alabama Power,

7 million

mmBtu for Georgia Power,

3 million

mmBtu for Mississippi Power, and

7 million

mmBtu for Southern Power.

For cash flow hedges of energy-related derivatives, the estimated pre-tax gains (losses) expected to be reclassified from AOCI to earnings for the year ending

December 31, 2019

are immaterial for all registrants.

Interest Rate Derivatives

Southern Company and certain subsidiaries may enter into interest rate derivatives to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates. The derivatives employed as hedging instruments are structured to minimize ineffectiveness. Derivatives related to existing

II-408


Index to Financial Statements

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

variable rate securities or forecasted transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges where the derivatives' fair value gains or losses are recorded in OCI and are reclassified into earnings at the same time and presented on the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged transactions. Derivatives related to existing fixed rate securities are accounted for as fair value hedges, where the derivatives' fair value gains or losses and hedged items' fair value gains or losses are both recorded directly to earnings on the same income statement line item. Fair value gains or losses on derivatives that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as incurred.

At

December 31, 2018

, the following interest rate derivatives were outstanding:

Foreign Currency Derivatives

Southern Company and certain subsidiaries, including Southern Power, may enter into foreign currency derivatives to hedge exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, such as that arising from the issuance of debt denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars. Derivatives related to forecasted transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges where the derivatives' fair value gains or losses are recorded in OCI and are reclassified into earnings at the same time and on the same income statement line as the earnings effect of the hedged transactions, including foreign currency gains or losses arising from changes in the U.S. currency exchange rates. The derivatives employed as hedging instruments are structured to minimize ineffectiveness.

Derivative Financial Statement Presentation and Amounts

Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas enter into derivative contracts that may contain certain provisions that permit intra-contract netting of derivative receivables and payables for routine billing and offsets related to events of default and settlements. Southern Company and certain subsidiaries also utilize master netting agreements to mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk. These agreements may contain provisions that permit netting across product lines and against cash collateral. The fair value amounts of derivative assets and liabilities on the balance sheets are presented net to the extent that there are netting arrangements or similar agreements with the counterparties.

Contingent Features

Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas do not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. There are certain derivatives that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of various credit rating changes of certain Southern Company subsidiaries. At

December 31, 2018

, the registrants had

no

collateral posted with derivative counterparties to satisfy these arrangements.

For the registrants with interest rate derivatives at

December 31, 2018

, the fair value of interest rate derivative liabilities with contingent features and the maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features, at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, was immaterial. At

December 31, 2018

, the fair value of energy-related derivative liabilities with contingent features and the maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features, at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, were immaterial for all registrants. The maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power include certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that one or more Southern Company power pool participants has a credit rating change to below investment grade. Following the sale of Gulf Power to NextEra Energy, Gulf Power is continuing to participate in the Southern Company power pool for a defined transition period that, subject to certain potential adjustments, is scheduled to end on January 1, 2024.

Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. If collateral is required, fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral are not offset against fair value amounts recognized for derivatives executed with the same counterparty.

Alabama Power and Southern Power maintain accounts with certain regional transmission organizations to facilitate financial derivative transactions. Based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements, Alabama Power and Southern Power may be required to post collateral. At

December 31, 2018

, cash collateral posted in these accounts was immaterial. Southern Company Gas maintains accounts with brokers or the clearing houses of certain exchanges to facilitate financial derivative transactions. Based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements, Southern Company Gas may be required to deposit cash into these accounts. At

December 31, 2018

, cash collateral held on deposit in broker margin accounts was

$277 million

.

The registrants are exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties' nonperformance. The registrants only enter into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody's and S&P or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. The registrants have also established risk management policies and controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate their exposure to counterparty credit risk. Prior to entering into a physical transaction, Southern Company Gas assigns physical wholesale counterparties an internal credit rating and credit limit based on the counterparties' Moody's, S&P, and Fitch ratings, commercially available credit reports, and audited financial statements. Southern Company Gas may require counterparties to pledge additional collateral when deemed necessary.

II-418


Index to Financial Statements

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

In addition, Southern Company Gas conducts credit evaluations and obtains appropriate internal approvals for the counterparty's line of credit before any transaction with the counterparty is executed. In most cases, the counterparty must have an investment grade rating, which includes a minimum long-term debt rating of Baa3 from Moody's and BBB- from S&P. Generally, Southern Company Gas requires credit enhancements by way of a guaranty, cash deposit, or letter of credit for transaction counterparties that do not have investment grade ratings.

Southern Company Gas also utilizes master netting agreements whenever possible to mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk. When Southern Company Gas is engaged in more than one outstanding derivative transaction with the same counterparty and it also has a legally enforceable netting agreement with that counterparty, the "net" mark-to-market exposure represents the netting of the positive and negative exposures with that counterparty and a reasonable measure of Southern Company Gas' credit risk. Southern Company Gas also uses other netting agreements with certain counterparties with whom it conducts significant transactions. Master netting agreements enable Southern Company Gas to net certain assets and liabilities by counterparty. Southern Company Gas also nets across product lines and against cash collateral provided the master netting and cash collateral agreements include such provisions. Southern Company Gas may require counterparties to pledge additional collateral when deemed necessary.

The registrants do not anticipate a material adverse effect on their respective financial statements as a result of counterparty nonperformance.


. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

Southern Company Merger with Southern Company Gas

On July 1, 2016, Southern Company completed the Merger for a total purchase price of approximately

$8.0 billion

and Southern Company Gas became a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of Southern Company. At the effective time of the Merger, each share of Southern Company Gas common stock, other than certain excluded shares, was converted into the right to receive

$66

in cash, without interest. Also at the effective time of the Merger, all of the outstanding Southern Company Gas RSUs, restricted stock awards, non-employee director stock awards, stock options, and PSUs were either redeemed or converted into Southern Company RSUs. See Note


for additional information.

The application of the acquisition method of accounting was pushed down to Southern Company Gas. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of Southern Company Gas' assets and liabilities was recorded as goodwill, which represents a different basis of accounting from Southern Company Gas' historical basis prior to the Merger. The following table presents the final purchase price allocation:

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

Southern Company Gas' Results of Operations and Pro Forma Financial Information

The results of operations for Southern Company Gas have been included in Southern Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition and consisted of operating revenues of

$1.7 billion

and net income of

$114 million

in 2016.

The following summarized unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of earnings information assumes that the acquisition of Southern Company Gas was completed on January 1, 2015. The summarized unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of earnings information includes adjustments for (i) intercompany sales, (ii) amortization of intangible assets, (iii) adjustments to interest expense to reflect current interest rates on Southern Company Gas debt and additional interest expense associated with borrowings by Southern Company to fund the Merger, and (iv) the elimination of nonrecurring expenses associated with the Merger.

These unaudited pro forma results are for comparative purposes only and may not be indicative of the results that would have occurred had this acquisition been completed on January 1, 2015 or the results that would be attained in the future.

Southern Company Acquisition of PowerSecure

In May 2016, Southern Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of PowerSecure for

$18.75

per common share in cash, resulting in an aggregate purchase price of

$429 million

. As a result, PowerSecure became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Company.

The acquisition of PowerSecure was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting with the assets acquired and liabilities assumed recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. The following table presents the final purchase price allocation:

The results of operations for PowerSecure have been included in Southern Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition and are immaterial to the consolidated financial results of Southern Company. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented for the acquisition because the effects of the acquisition were immaterial to Southern Company's consolidated financial results for all periods presented.

Southern Company's Sale of Gulf Power

On January 1, 2019, Southern Company completed the sale of all of the capital stock of Gulf Power to 700 Universe, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy, for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately

$5.8 billion

(less

$1.3 billion

of indebtedness assumed), subject to customary working capital adjustments.

of the class B membership interests. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Development Projects

During 2017, Southern Power purchased wind turbine equipment to be used for various development and construction projects. Any wind projects using this equipment and reaching commercial operation by the end of 2021 are expected to qualify for

80%

PTCs.

During 2016, Southern Power entered into a joint development agreement with Renewable Energy Systems Americas, Inc. (RES) to develop and construct wind projects. Concurrent with the agreement, Southern Power purchased wind turbine equipment from Siemens Wind Power, Inc. and Vestas-American Wind Technology, Inc. to be used for construction of these projects. Several wind projects using this equipment, as well as other purchased equipment, have successfully originated, directly or indirectly, from the partnership with RES and are expected to reach commercial operation before the end of 2020, thus qualifying for

100%

PTCs.

Southern Power continues to evaluate and refine the deployment of the wind turbine equipment to potential joint development and construction projects as well as the amount of MW capacity to be constructed. During the third quarter 2018, as a result of a review of various options for probable dispositions of wind turbine equipment not deployed to development or construction projects, Southern Power recorded a

$36 million

asset impairment charge on the equipment.

Subsequent to December 31, 2018 and as part of management's continuous review of disposition options, approximately

$53 million

of this equipment is being marketed for sale and will be classified as held for sale.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Sales of Renewable Facility Interests

On May 22, 2018, Southern Power completed the sale of a noncontrolling

33%

equity interest in SP Solar, a limited partnership indirectly owning substantially all of Southern Power's solar facilities, to Global Atlantic for approximately

$1.2 billion

. Since Southern Power retains control of the limited partnership through its wholly-owned general partner, the sale was recorded as an

II-422


Index to Financial Statements

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

equity transaction and Southern Power will continue to consolidate SP Solar in its financial statements. On the date of the transaction, the noncontrolling interest was increased by

$511 million

to reflect

33%

of the carrying value of the partnership. This difference, partially offset by the tax impact and other related transaction charges, also resulted in a

$410 million

decrease to Southern Power's common stockholder's equity.

On December 11, 2018, Southern Power completed the sale of a noncontrolling tax equity interest in SP Wind, which owns a portfolio of

eight

operating wind facilities, to

three

financial investors for approximately

$1.2 billion

. Since Southern Power retains control of SP Wind, it will continue to consolidate SP Wind in its financial statements. The tax equity investors together will generally receive

40%

of the cash distributions from available cash and will receive a

99%

allocation of tax attributes, including future PTCs.

Sales of Natural Gas Plants

On December 4, 2018, Southern Power completed the sale of all of its equity interests in the Florida Plants to NextEra Energy for

$203 million

. In contemplation of this sale transaction, Southern Power recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately

$119 million

(

$89 million

after tax) in May 2018.

On November 5, 2018, Southern Power entered into an agreement with Northern States Power to sell all of its equity interests in Plant Mankato (including the


-MW expansion currently under construction) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately

$650 million

. The completion of the disposition is subject to the expansion unit reaching commercial operation as well as various other customary conditions to closing, including working capital and timing adjustments. The ultimate purchase price will decrease

$66,667

per day for each day after June 1, 2019 that the expansion has not achieved commercial operation, not to exceed

$15 million

. This transaction is subject to FERC and state commission approvals and is expected to close in mid-2019. The assets and liabilities of Plant Mankato are classified as assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale on Southern Company's and Southern Power's balance sheet as of December 31, 2018.

Investment in SNG

In 2016, Southern Company Gas, through a wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary, acquired a

50%

equity interest in SNG from Kinder Morgan, Inc. for

$1.4 billion

. SNG owns a

7,000

-mile pipeline system connecting natural gas supply basins in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama to markets in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee. The purchase price exceeded the underlying ownership interest in the net assets of SNG by approximately

$700 million

. This basis difference was attributable to goodwill and deferred tax assets. While the deferred tax assets will be amortized through deferred tax expense, the goodwill will not be amortized and is not required to be tested for impairment on an annual basis.

In March 2017, Southern Company Gas made an additional

$50 million

contribution to maintain its

50%

equity interest in SNG. See Note


under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information on this investment.

Southern Company Gas' investment in SNG decreased by

$104 million

at December 31, 2017 related to the impact of the Tax Reform Legislation and new income tax apportionment factors in several states resulting from Southern Company Gas' inclusion in the consolidated Southern Company state tax filings.

Sale of Pivotal Home Solutions

On June 4, 2018, Southern Company Gas completed the stock sale of Pivotal Home Solutions to American Water Enterprises LLC for a total cash purchase price of

$365 million

, which includes the final working capital adjustment. This disposition resulted in a net loss of

$67 million

, which includes

$34 million

of income tax expense. In contemplation of the transaction, a goodwill impairment charge of

$42 million

was recorded during the first quarter 2018. The income tax expense included tax on goodwill not deductible for tax purposes and for which a deferred tax liability had not been recorded previously. Southern Company Gas and American Water Enterprises LLC entered into a transition services agreement whereby Southern Company Gas provided certain administrative and operational services through November 4, 2018.

Sale of Elizabethtown Gas and Elkton Gas

On July 1, 2018, a Southern Company Gas subsidiary, Pivotal Utility Holdings, completed the sales of the assets of

two

of its natural gas distribution utilities, Elizabethtown Gas and Elkton Gas, to South Jersey Industries, Inc. for a total cash purchase price

II-423


Index to Financial Statements

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report

of

$1.7 billion

, which includes the final working capital and other adjustments. This disposition resulted in a pre-tax gain that was entirely offset by

$205 million

of income tax expense, resulting in

no

material net income impact. The income tax expense included tax on goodwill not deductible for tax purposes and for which a deferred tax liability had not been recorded previously. Southern Company Gas and South Jersey Industries, Inc. entered into transition services agreements whereby Southern Company Gas will provide certain administrative and operational services through no later than July 31, 2020.

Sale of Florida City Gas

On July 29, 2018, Southern Company Gas and its wholly-owned direct subsidiary, NUI Corporation, completed the stock sale of Pivotal Utility Holdings, which primarily consisted of Florida City Gas, to NextEra Energy for a total cash purchase price of

$587 million

, which includes the final working capital adjustment. This disposition resulted in a net gain of

$16 million

, which includes

$103 million

of income tax expense. The income tax expense included tax on goodwill not deductible for tax purposes and for which a deferred tax liability had not been recorded previously. Southern Company Gas and NextEra Energy entered into a transition services agreement whereby Southern Company Gas will provide certain administrative and operational services through no later than July 29, 2020.

Assets Held for Sale

As discussed previously, Southern Company and Southern Power each have assets and liabilities held for sale on their balance sheets at

December 31, 2018

. Assets and liabilities held for sale have been classified separately on each company's balance sheet at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell at the time the criteria for held-for-sale classification were met. For assets and liabilities held for sale recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, the fair value of assets held for sale is based primarily on unobservable inputs (Level 3), which includes the agreed upon sales prices in executed sales agreements.

Upon classification as held for sale in May 2018 for the Florida Plants and November 2018 for Plant Mankato, Southern Power ceased recognizing depreciation on the property, plant, and equipment to be sold. The Florida Plants sale was completed on December 4, 2018. Since the depreciation of the assets sold in the Gulf Power transaction continued to be reflected in customer rates through the closing date and was reflected in the carryover basis of the assets when sold, Southern Company continued to record depreciation on those assets through the date the transaction closed. Likewise, since the depreciation of the assets sold in the Elizabethtown Gas, Elkton Gas, and Florida City Gas transactions continued to be reflected in customer rates and was reflected in the carryover basis of the assets when sold, Southern Company Gas continued to record depreciation on those assets through the respective date that each transaction closed.

The following table provides Southern Company's and Southern Power's major classes of assets and liabilities classified as held for sale at

December 31, 2018

:

Southern Company, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas each concluded that the asset sales, both individually and combined, did not represent a strategic shift in operations that has, or is expected to have, a major effect on its operations and financial results; therefore, none of the assets related to the sales have been classified as discontinued operations for any of the periods presented.

. SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION

Southern Company

The primary businesses of the Southern Company system are electricity sales by the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power and the distribution of natural gas by Southern Company Gas. The traditional electric operating companies – Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power (through December 31, 2018), and Mississippi Power – are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in

four

Southeastern states. On January 1, 2019, Southern Company completed its sale of Gulf Power to NextEra Energy. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through its natural gas distribution utilities and is involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments, wholesale gas services, and gas marketing services. In July 2018, Southern Company Gas completed sales of

three

of its natural gas distribution utilities. See Note


for additional information regarding disposition activities.

Southern Company's reportable business segments are the sale of electricity by the traditional electric operating companies, the sale of electricity in the competitive wholesale market by Southern Power, and the sale of natural gas and other complementary products and services by Southern Company Gas.

Products and Services

Southern Company Gas

Southern Company Gas manages its business through

four

reportable segments - gas distribution operations, gas pipeline investments, wholesale gas services, and gas marketing services. The non-reportable segments are combined and presented as all other. During 2018, Southern Company Gas changed its reportable segments to further align the way its new Chief Operating Decision Maker reviews operating results and has reclassified prior years' data to conform to the new reportable segment presentation. This change resulted in a new reportable segment, gas pipeline investments, which was formerly included in gas midstream operations.

Gas distribution operations is the largest component of Southern Company Gas' business and includes natural gas local distribution utilities that construct, manage, and maintain intrastate natural gas pipelines and gas distribution facilities in

four

states. In July 2018, Southern Company Gas sold

three

of its natural gas distribution utilities, Elizabethtown Gas, Elkton Gas, and Florida City Gas. See Note


under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.

Gas pipeline investments consists of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including a

50%

interest in SNG,

two

significant pipeline construction projects, and a

50%

joint ownership interest in the Dalton Pipeline. These natural gas pipelines enable the provision of diverse sources of natural gas supplies to the customers of Southern Company Gas. See Notes


and


for additional information.

Wholesale gas services provides natural gas asset management and/or related logistics services for each of Southern Company Gas' utilities except Nicor Gas as well as for non-affiliated companies. Additionally, wholesale gas services engages in natural gas storage and gas pipeline arbitrage and related activities.

Gas marketing services provides natural gas marketing to end-use customers primarily in Georgia and Illinois through SouthStar. On June 4, 2018, Southern Company Gas sold Pivotal Home Solutions, which provided home equipment protection products and services. See Note


under "Southern Company Gas

–

Sale of Pivotal Home Solutions

" for additional information.

The all other column includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure, including the storage and fuels operations, which was formerly included in gas midstream operations, and the other subsidiaries that fall below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure.

After the Merger, Southern Company Gas changed the segment performance measure to net income, which is utilized by its parent company. In order to properly assess net income by segment, Southern Company Gas executed various intercompany note agreements to revise interest charges to its segments. Since such agreements did not exist in the predecessor period, Southern Company Gas is unable to provide the comparable net income for that period.

Item 9B.

OTHER INFORMATION

Georgia Power is disclosing the information below in this Item 9B in lieu of filing a Current Report on Form 8-K.

Amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements

As previously reported, on September 26, 2018, Georgia Power entered into a binding term sheet with the other Vogtle Owners and MEAG's wholly-owned subsidiaries MEAG Power SPVJ, LLC (MEAG SPVJ), MEAG Power SPVM, LLC (MEAG SPVM), and MEAG Power SPVP, LLC (MEAG SPVP) to take certain actions which partially mitigate potential financial exposure for the other Vogtle Owners (Vogtle Owner Term Sheet).

On February 18, 2019, Georgia Power, the other Vogtle Owners, MEAG SPVJ, MEAG SPVM, and MEAG SPVP entered into certain amendments to the joint ownership agreements for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements) to implement the provisions of the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet (Global Amendments).

Pursuant to the Global Amendments, and consistent with the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet, the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements were modified as follows: (i) each Vogtle Owner must pay its proportionate share of qualifying construction costs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 based on its ownership percentage up to the estimated cost at completion (EAC) for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 which formed the basis of Georgia Power's forecast of $8.4 billion in the nineteenth VCM plus $800 million; (ii) Georgia Power will be responsible for 55.7% of actual qualifying construction costs between $800 million and $1.6 billion over the EAC in the nineteenth VCM (resulting in $80 million of potential additional costs to Georgia Power), with the remaining Vogtle Owners responsible for 44.3% of such costs pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests; and (iii) Georgia Power will be responsible for 65.7% of qualifying construction costs between $1.6 billion and $2.1 billion over the EAC in the nineteenth VCM (resulting in a further $100 million of potential additional costs to Georgia Power), with the remaining Vogtle Owners responsible for 34.3% of such costs pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests.

If the EAC is revised and exceeds the EAC in the nineteenth VCM by more than $2.1 billion, each of the other Vogtle Owners will have a one-time option at the time the project budget forecast is so revised to tender a portion of its ownership interest to Georgia Power in exchange for Georgia Power's agreement to pay 100% of such Vogtle Owner's remaining share of total construction costs in excess of the EAC in the nineteenth VCM plus $2.1 billion. In this event, Georgia Power will have the option of cancelling the project in lieu of purchasing a portion of the ownership interest of any other Vogtle Owner. If Georgia Power accepts the offer to purchase a portion of another Vogtle Owner's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, the ownership interest(s) to be conveyed from the tendering Vogtle Owner(s) to Georgia Power will be calculated based on the proportion of the cumulative amount of construction costs paid by each such tendering Vogtle Owner(s) and by Georgia Power as of the COD of Plant Vogtle Unit 4. For purposes of this calculation, payments made by Georgia Power on behalf of another Vogtle Owner in accordance with the second and third items described in the paragraph above will be treated as payments made by the applicable Vogtle Owner.

In the event the actual costs of construction at completion of a Unit are less than the EAC reflected in the nineteenth VCM report and such Unit is placed in service in accordance with the schedule projected in the nineteenth VCM report (i.e., Plant Vogtle Unit 3 is placed in service by November 2021 or Plant Vogtle Unit 4 is placed in service by November 2022), Georgia Power will be entitled to 60.7% of the cost savings with respect to the relevant Unit and the remaining Vogtle Owners will be entitled to 39.3% of such savings on a pro rata basis in accordance with their respective ownership interests.

For purposes of the foregoing provisions, qualifying construction costs will not include costs (i) resulting from force majeure events, including governmental actions or inactions (or significant delays associated with issuance of such actions) that affect the licensing, completion, start-up, operations, or financing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, administrative proceedings or litigation regarding ITAAC or other regulatory challenges to commencement of operation of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, and changes in laws or regulations governing Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, (ii) legal fees and legal expenses incurred due to litigation with contractors or subcontractors that are not subsidiaries or affiliates of Southern Company, and (iii) additional costs caused by requests from the Vogtle Owners other than Georgia Power, except for the exercise of a right to vote granted under the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements, that increase costs by $100,000 or more.

Pursuant to the Global Amendments, and consistent with the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet, the provisions of the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements requiring that Vogtle Owners holding 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 vote to continue construction following certain adverse events (Project Adverse Events) were also modified. In particular, an increase in the construction cost estimate for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 no longer constitutes a Project Adverse Event and thus would no longer require a vote. In addition, the Project Adverse Event relating to disallowances of cost recovery by Georgia Power now excludes any additional amounts paid by Georgia Power on behalf of the other Vogtle Owners pursuant to the provisions of the Global Amendments described above and the first 6% of costs during any six-month VCM reporting period that are disallowed by the Georgia PSC for recovery, or for which Georgia Power elects not to seek cost recovery, through retail rates. Further, the Global Amendments provide that Georgia Power may cancel the project at any time in its sole discretion.

II-440


Index to Financial Statements

The Global Amendments provide that if the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests fail to vote in favor of continuing the project following any future Project Adverse Event, work on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 will continue for a period of 30 days if the holders of more than 50% of the ownership interests vote in favor of continuing construction (Majority Voting Owners). In such a case, the Vogtle Owners (i) have agreed to negotiate in good faith towards the resumption of the project, (ii) if no agreement is reached during such 30-day period, the project will be cancelled, and (iii) in the event of such a cancellation, the Majority Voting Owners will be obligated to reimburse any other Vogtle Owner for the incremental costs it incurred during such 30-day negotiation period.

Purchase of PTCs During Commercial Operation

Pursuant to the Global Amendments, and consistent with the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet, Georgia Power has agreed to purchase additional PTCs from OPC, Dalton, MEAG SPVM, MEAG SPVP, and MEAG SPVJ (to the extent any MEAG SPVJ PTC rights remain after any purchases required under Georgia Power's agreement with MEAG and MEAG SPVJ to provide funding with respect to MEAG SPVJ's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 under certain circumstances) at varying purchase prices dependent upon the actual cost to complete construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 as compared to the EAC reflected in the nineteenth VCM report. The purchases are at the option of the applicable Vogtle Owner. The purchases will occur during the month after such PTCs are earned and will be at the following purchase prices: (i) 88% of face value if the actual cost remains at or below the EAC projected in the nineteenth VCM report; (ii) 91% of face value if the actual cost increases by no more than $299 million over the EAC projected in the nineteenth VCM report; (iii) 95% of face value if the actual cost increases at least $300 million but less than $600 million over the EAC in the nineteenth VCM report; and (iv) 98% of face value if the actual cost increases by $600 million or more over the EAC in the nineteenth VCM report.
