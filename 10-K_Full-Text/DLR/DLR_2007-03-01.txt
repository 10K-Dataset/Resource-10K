FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006



PART 1

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

General

As used herein, the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “the company” and “our company” refer to Digital Realty
Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation, together with our consolidated subsidiaries, including Digital Realty Trust, L.P., a Maryland limited partnership of which we are the sole general partner and which we refer to as our operating partnership. We
target high-quality, strategically located properties containing applications and operations critical to the day-to-day operations of technology industry tenants and corporate enterprise datacenter users, including the information technology, or IT,
departments of Fortune 1000 and financial services companies. Our tenant base is diversified and reflects a broad spectrum of regional, national and international tenants that are leaders in their respective areas. We operate as a real estate
investment trust, or REIT, for federal income tax purposes.

Through our operating partnership, at December 31, 2006 we owned 59
properties, excluding one property held as an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture. Our properties are primarily located throughout North America with seven properties in Europe. Our properties contain a total of approximately 9.4
million net rentable square feet, excluding approximately 1.6 million square feet held for redevelopment. Our operations and acquisition activities are focused on a limited number of markets where technology industry tenants and corporate
datacenter users are concentrated, including the Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Silicon Valley metropolitan areas. As of December 31, 2006, our portfolio, excluding space held for redevelopment, was
approximately 95.0% leased at an average gross annualized rent per leased square foot of $27.73. The types of properties within our focus include:

•

Internet gateways, which serve as hubs for Internet and data communications within and between major metropolitan areas;

•

Data centers, which provide secure, continuously available environments for the storage and processing of critical electronic information. Data centers are used for
disaster recovery purposes, transaction processing and to house corporate IT operations;

•

Technology manufacturing properties, which contain highly specialized manufacturing environments for such purposes as disk drive manufacturing, semiconductor
manufacturing and specialty pharmaceutical manufacturing; and

•

Regional or national offices of technology companies that are located in our target markets.

Most of our properties have extensive tenant improvements that have been installed at our tenants’ expense. Unlike traditional office and
flex/research and development space, the location of and improvements to our facilities are generally essential to our tenants’ businesses, which we believe results in high occupancy levels, long lease terms and low tenant turnover. The
tenant-installed improvements in our facilities are readily adaptable for use by similar tenants. We also have approximately 1.6 million square feet available for redevelopment at December 31, 2006.

Our portfolio includes 20 properties contributed to us by Global Innovation Partners, LLC, or GI Partners, in connection with our initial public offering
in November 2004. GI Partners is a private equity fund that was formed to pursue investment opportunities that intersect the real estate and technology industries. GI Partners was formed in February 2001 after a competitive six-month selection
process conducted by the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, or CalPERS, the largest U.S. pension fund.

Our principal
executive offices are located at 560 Mission Street, Suite 2900, San Francisco, California 94105. Our telephone number at that location is (415) 738-6500. Our website is located at www.digitalrealtytrust.com. The information found on, or
otherwise accessible through, our website is not



incorporated into, and does not form a part of, this annual report on Form 10-K or any other report or document we file with or furnish to the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission, or the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Recent Developments

On December 20, 2006 we acquired Unit 9, Blanchardstown Corporate Park, a property located in Dublin, Ireland for approximately
€36.5 million ($47.9 million based on the rate of exchange on December 20, 2006).

On December 5, 2006 we acquired 114
Rue Ambroise Croizat, a property located in Paris, France for approximately €40.4 million ($53.8 million based on the rate of exchange on December 5, 2006).

On November 1, 2006 we acquired a 49% interest in 2001 Sixth Avenue, a property located in Seattle for approximately $29.6 million.

On October 24, 2006, we completed the financing of 1100 Space Park Drive in Santa Clara, California. The new loan for $55.0 million has a
10-year maturity with no principal amortization for three years, and a fixed rate of 5.886%.

On October 17, 2006 we acquired 2055 E.
Technology Drive and a related ground lease, a property located in Tempe, Arizona for approximately $9.7 million.

On October 4, 2006
we issued 9.2 million common shares for net proceeds of $267.7 million after offering costs. We used proceeds from this issuance to pay $133.8 million for the redemption of 4.6 million common Operating Partnership units tendered by GI
Partners, with the balance being used to pay down our unsecured credit facility.

On October 1, 2006, we acquired three datacenters
from AboveNet for approximately $40.1 million. The purchase included a fee-simple ownership of 1807 Michael Faraday Court in Reston, Virginia and two leasehold interests at 111 Eight Avenue in New York City and 8100 Boone Boulevard in Vienna,
Virginia.

Subsequent Events

On
February 27, 2007 we acquired 44470 Chillum Place, a property located in Ashburn, Virginia, a suburb of Washington D.C. for approximately $42.5 million. The acquisition was financed with borrowings under our unsecured credit facility.

On February 15, 2007, we declared the following distributions per share and the Operating Partnership made an equivalent distribution
per unit.

On February 2, 2007 we completed the financing of 150 South First Street in San Jose,
California. The new loan for $53.3 million has a 10-year maturity with no principal amortization for two years, and a fixed rate of 6.2995%.

On January 31, 2007 we completed the financing of 2045 & 2055 LaFayette in Santa Clara, California. The new loan for $68.0 million has a 10-year maturity with no principal amortization for two years, and a fixed rate of
5.9265%.



On January 22, 2007 we acquired 3011 LaFayette Street, a property located in Santa Clara, California
for approximately $13.5 million. The acquisition was financed with borrowings under our unsecured credit facility.

On January 5, 2007
we acquired 21110 Ridgetop Circle in Sterling, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C. for approximately $17.0 million. The acquisition was financed with borrowings under our unsecured credit facility.

Our Competitive Strengths

We believe we distinguish
ourselves from other owners, acquirors and managers of technology-related real estate through our competitive strengths, which include:

•

High-Quality Portfolio that is Difficult to Replicate.

Our portfolio contains state-of-the-art facilities with extensive tenant improvements. Based on
current market rents and the estimated replacement costs of our properties and their improvements, we believe that they could not be replicated today on a cost-competitive basis. Many of the properties in our portfolio are located on major
aggregation points formed by the physical presence of multiple major telecommunications service providers, which reduces our tenants’ costs and operational risks and increases the attractiveness of our buildings.

•

Presence in Key Markets.

Our portfolio is located in 25 metropolitan areas, including the Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and
Silicon Valley metropolitan areas, and is diversified so that no one market represented more than 20% of the aggregate gross annualized rent of our portfolio as of December 31, 2006.

•

Long-Term Leases.

We have long-term leases with stable cash flows. As of December 31, 2006, our average lease term was in excess of 12.2 years,
with an average of 6.9 years remaining, excluding renewal options. Through 2008, leases representing only 6.5% of our net rentable square feet excluding space held for development, or 11.3% of our aggregate gross annualized rent, are scheduled to
expire. Moreover, through 2007, leases representing only 2.0% of our net rentable square feet excluding space held for development, or 4.2% of our aggregate gross annualized rent, are scheduled to expire.

•

Specialized Focus in Dynamic and Growing Industry.

We focus solely on technology-related real estate because we believe that the growth of the technology
industry, particularly Internet and data communications and corporate datacenter use, will be superior to that of the overall economy. We believe that our specialized understanding of both real estate and technology gives us a significant
competitive advantage over less specialized investors. We use our in-depth knowledge of the technology industry, particularly Internet and data communications and corporate datacenter use, to identify strategically located properties, market our
properties to tenants with specific technology needs, evaluate tenants’ creditworthiness and business models and assess the long-term value of in-place technical improvements.

•

Proven Acquisition Capability.

As of December 31, 2006, our portfolio consists of 59 technology-related real estate properties, excluding one property
held as an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture, that we, together with GI Partners, our predecessor, acquired beginning in 2002, (including 37 properties, which contain over 4.5 million net rentable square feet excluding
1.3 million square feet held for redevelopment, since our initial public offering in November 2004), for an aggregate of 9.4 million net rentable square feet, excluding approximately 1.6 million square feet held for redevelopment. Our
broad network of contacts within a highly fragmented universe of sellers and brokers of technology-related real estate enables us to capitalize on acquisition opportunities. We have developed detailed, standardized procedures for evaluating
acquisitions to ensure that they meet our financial, technical and other criteria, which allows us to evaluate investment opportunities efficiently and, as appropriate, commit and close quickly. We acquired more than half of our properties before
they were broadly marketed by real estate brokers.

•

Experienced and Committed Management Team.

Our senior management team, including our Executive Chairman, has an average of over 23 years of experience in the
technology or real estate industries, including experience as investors in, advisors to and founders of technology companies. We



believe that our senior management team’s extensive knowledge of both the real estate and the technology industries provides us with a key competitive
advantage. At December 31, 2006 our senior management team collectively owned a common equity interest in our company of approximately 2.7%, which aligns management’s interests with those of our stockholders.

•

Proven ability to sign new leases.

We have considerable experience in identifying and leasing to new tenants. The combination of our specialized datacenter
leasing team, external resources and customer referrals provided a robust funnel of new tenants in 2006. During the year ended December 31, 2006 we leased approximately 455,000 square feet to new tenants which resulted in gross annualized rent
on a straight line basis of $31.0 million.

Business and Growth Strategies

Our primary business objectives are to maximize sustainable long-term growth in earnings, funds from operations and cash flow per share and to maximize
returns to our stockholders. Our business strategies to achieve these objectives are:

•

Capitalize on Acquisition Opportunities.

We believe that acquisitions enable us to increase cash flow and create long-term stockholder value. Our
relationships with corporate information technology groups, technology tenants and real estate brokers who are dedicated to serving these tenants provide us with ongoing access to potential acquisitions and often enable us to avoid competitive
bidding. Furthermore, the specialized nature of technology-related real estate makes it more difficult for traditional real estate investors to understand, which fosters reduced competition for acquisitions relative to other property types. We
believe this dynamic creates an opportunity for us to obtain better risk-adjusted returns on our capital.

•

Maximize the Cash Flow of our Properties.

We aggressively manage and lease our assets to increase their cash flow. We often acquire properties with
substantial in-place cash flow and some vacancy, which enables us to create upside through lease-up. Our portfolio, excluding space held for redevelopment, was approximately 95.0% leased as of December 31, 2006, leaving approximately
0.5 million square feet of net rentable space available for lease-up and approximately 1.6 million square feet held for redevelopment. Moreover, many of our properties contain extensive in-place infrastructure or buildout which may result
in higher rents when leased to tenants seeking these improvements. We control our costs by negotiating expense pass-through provisions in tenant leases for operating expenses and certain capital expenditures. Leases covering more than 95% of the
leased net rentable square feet in our portfolio as of December 31, 2006 required tenants to pay all or a portion of increases in operating expenses, including real estate taxes, insurance, common area charges and other expenses. Since our
initial public offering in November 2004, we have executed leases for approximately 820,000 square feet of technical space at an average gross annualized rent of $59.19 per square foot and approximately 399,000 square feet of nontechnical space at
an average gross annualized rent of $22.49 per square foot, in each case including lease renewals and expansions commencing in 2004 through 2019.

•

Develop and obtain optimal returns on our space held for redevelopment.

At December 31, 2006 we had approximately 1.6 million square feet held for
redevelopment. We intend to redevelop this space for lease when justified by anticipated returns. The rate of return on our initial capital investment will be subject to many factors and we currently expect to obtain a 10% annual return on our
investment.

•

Subdivide Improved Space for Turn-Key Datacenter Use.

Turn-Key Datacenter space is move-in-ready space for the placement of computer and network
equipment required to provide a datacenter environment. We own approximately 850,000 net rentable square feet of turn-key datacenter space with extensive datacenter improvements. We had leased approximately 681,000 square feet of this space at
December 31, 2006. Rather than leasing all of this space to large single tenants, we are subdividing some of it for multi-tenant turn-key datacenter use, with tenants averaging between 100 and 15,000 square feet of net rentable space.
Multi-tenant turn-key datacenters are effective solutions for



tenants who lack the expertise or capital budget to provide their own extensive datacenter infrastructure and security. As experts in datacenter construction
and operations, we are able to lease space to these tenants at a significant premium over other uses.

•

Leverage Strong Industry Relationships.

We use our strong industry relationships with national and regional corporate enterprise information technology
groups and technology-intensive companies to identify and comprehensively respond to their real estate needs. Our leasing and sales professionals are real estate and technology industry specialists who can develop complex facility solutions for the
most demanding corporate datacenter and other technology tenants.

•

Use Capital Efficiently.

We intend to occasionally sell our assets held for investment opportunistically. We believe that we can increase stockholder returns
by effectively redeploying asset sales proceeds into new investment opportunities. Recently, datacenters have been particularly attractive candidates for sale to owner/users, as the cost of acquisition is usually substantially lower than the cost to
construct a new facility. We will occasionally seek such opportunities to realize gains from these investment assets and reinvest our capital.

Competition

We compete with numerous regional developers, owners and operators of office and commercial real estate, many
of which own properties similar to ours in the same submarkets in which our properties are located. If our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates, or below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants, we may lose
potential tenants and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge in order to retain tenants when our tenants’ leases expire. In addition, developers and operators may compete with us for acquisitions.

Regulation

General

Office properties in our submarkets are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas. We believe
that each of our properties as of December 31, 2006 has the necessary permits and approvals to operate its business.

Americans With
Disabilities Act

Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or ADA, to the extent
that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily
achievable. We believe that our properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. However, noncompliance with the ADA could result
in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect.

Environmental Matters

Under
various laws relating to the protection of the environment, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances at that property, and may be
required to investigate and clean up such contamination at that property or emanating from that property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the
contaminants, and the liability may be joint and several. Previous owners used some of our properties for industrial and retail purposes, so those properties may contain some level of environmental contamination. The presence of contamination or the
failure to remediate



contamination at our properties may expose us to third-party liability or materially adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or develop the real estate
or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.

Some of the properties may contain asbestos-containing building materials. Environmental
laws require that asbestos-containing building materials be properly managed and maintained, and may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements. These laws may also allow third parties to
seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos-containing building materials.

In
addition, some of our tenants, particularly those in the biotechnology and life sciences industry and those in the technology manufacturing industry, routinely handle hazardous substances and wastes as part of their operations at our properties.
Environmental laws and regulations subject our tenants, and potentially us, to liability resulting from these activities or from previous industrial or retail uses of those properties. Environmental liabilities could also affect a tenant’s
ability to make rental payments to us. We require our tenants to comply with these environmental laws and regulations and to indemnify us for any related liabilities.

Independent environmental consultants have conducted Phase I or similar environmental site assessments on all of the properties in our portfolio. Site assessments are intended to discover and evaluate information
regarding the environmental condition of the surveyed property and surrounding properties. These assessments do not generally include soil samplings, subsurface investigations or an asbestos survey. None of the recent site assessments revealed any
past or present environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations. However, the assessments may have failed to reveal all environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance
concerns. Material environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance concerns may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future; and future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose material additional environmental
liability.

Insurance

We carry
comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage, earthquake, business interruption and rental loss insurance covering all of the properties in our portfolio under a blanket policy. We select policy specifications and insured limits which we believe
to be appropriate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice and, in the opinion of our company’s management, the properties in our portfolio are currently adequately insured. We do not carry insurance for
generally uninsured losses such as loss from riots, war, terrorist threats or nuclear reaction. In addition, we carry earthquake insurance on our properties in an amount and with deductibles which we believe are commercially reasonable. Certain of
the properties in our portfolio are located in areas known to be seismically active. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Operations—Potential losses may not be covered by insurance.”

Employees

As of December 31, 2006 we had 109
employees. None of these employees is represented by a labor union.

Offices

Our headquarters is located in San Francisco. We have regional offices in Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York and international offices in
London and Dublin, Ireland.

ITEM 1A.    RISK

FACTORS

For purposes of this section, the term
“stockholders” means the holders of shares of our common stock and of our preferred stock. Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our stockholders. You should carefully consider the following factors in evaluating
our company, our properties and our business. The



occurrence of any of the following risks might cause our stockholders to lose all or a part of their investment. Some statements in this report including
statements in the following risk factors constitute forward-looking statements. Please refer to the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” on page 20.

Risks Related to Our Business and Operations

Our properties depend upon the demand for
technology-related real estate.

Our portfolio of properties consists primarily of technology-related real estate. A decrease in the
demand for or adoption of datacenter space, Internet gateway facilities or other technology-related real estate could have a greater adverse effect on our business and financial condition than if we owned a portfolio with a more diversified tenant
base. We are susceptible to adverse developments in the corporate datacenter, Internet and data communications and broader technology industries (such as reduced corporate IT budgets, business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, relocations
of businesses, costs of complying with government regulations or increased regulation and other factors) and the technology-related real estate market (such as oversupply of or reduced demand for space). Changes in technology or industry practice
could reduce demand for the physical datacenter space we provide or make the tenant improvements in our facilities obsolete or in need of significant upgrades to remain viable. In addition, the development of new technologies, the adoption of new
industry standards or other factors could render many of our tenants’ current products and services obsolete or unmarketable and contribute to a downturn in their businesses, thereby increasing the likelihood that they default under their
leases, become insolvent or file for bankruptcy.

We depend on significant tenants, and many of our properties are single-tenant
properties or are currently occupied by single tenants.

As of December 31, 2006, the 15 largest tenants in our property portfolio
represented approximately 50% of the total gross annualized rent generated by our properties. Our largest tenants by gross annualized rent are Savvis Communications and Qwest Communications International. Savvis Communications leased approximately
1.4 million square feet of net rentable space as of December 31, 2006, representing approximately 11.9% of the total gross annualized rent generated by our properties. Qwest Communications International leased approximately 685,000 square
feet of net rentable space as of December 31, 2006, representing approximately 7.7% of the total gross annualized rent generated by our properties. In addition, 26 of our 59 properties are occupied by single tenants, including properties
occupied solely by Savvis Communications and Qwest Communications International. Our tenants may experience a downturn in their businesses, which may weaken their financial condition and result in their failure to make timely rental payments or
their default under their leases. If any tenant defaults or fails to make timely rent payments, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment.

The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant may adversely affect the income produced by our properties.

If any tenant becomes a debtor in a case under the federal Bankruptcy Code, we cannot evict the tenant solely because of the bankruptcy. In addition, the
bankruptcy court might authorize the tenant to reject and terminate its lease with us. Our claim against the tenant for unpaid, future rent would be subject to a statutory cap that might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed
under the lease. In either case, our claim for unpaid rent would likely not be paid in full. At December 31, 2006, we had no tenants in bankruptcy.

Our revenue and cash available for distribution, including cash available to pay dividends to our preferred stockholders or pay distributions to our common stockholders, could be materially adversely affected if any
of our significant tenants were to become bankrupt or insolvent, or suffer a downturn in its business, or fail to renew its lease or renew on terms less favorable to us than its current terms.



Our portfolio of properties depends upon local economic conditions and is geographically concentrated
in certain locations.

Our properties are located in 25 metropolitan areas. We depend upon the local economic conditions in these
markets, including local real estate conditions. Many of these markets experienced downturns within recent years. Our operations may also be affected if too many competing properties are built in any of these markets. If there is a downturn in the
economy in any of these markets, our operations and our revenue and cash available for distribution, including cash available to pay dividends to our preferred stockholders or pay distributions to our common stockholders, could be materially
adversely affected. We cannot assure you that these markets will grow or will remain favorable to technology-related real estate.

In
addition, our portfolio is geographically concentrated in the following metropolitan markets.

(1)

Gross annualized rent is monthly contractual rent under existing leases as of December 31, 2006 multiplied by 12.

Any negative changes in real estate, technology or economic conditions in these markets in particular could negatively impact our performance.

We have owned our properties for a limited time.

We owned 59 properties at December 31, 2006, excluding one property held as an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture. These properties are primarily located throughout North America and seven properties
are located in Europe. The properties contain a total of approximately 9.4 million net rentable square feet, excluding 1.6 million square feet held for redevelopment. All the properties have been under our management for less than five
years, and we have owned 17 of the properties for less than one year at December 31, 2006. The properties may have characteristics or deficiencies unknown to us that could affect their valuation or revenue potential. We cannot assure you that
the operating performance of the properties will not decline under our management.

We have space available for redevelopment that may
be difficult to redevelop or successfully lease to tenants.

We have approximately 1.6 million square feet held for redevelopment
at December 31, 2006 including 4 vacant buildings. Successful redevelopment of this space depends on numerous factors including success in engaging contractors, obtaining permits and availability of financing. We are and intend to continue
building out a large portion of this space on a speculative basis at significant cost. In addition there can be no assurance that once completed we will be able to successfully lease redeveloped space to new or existing tenants. If we are not able
to lease redevelopment space, or lease it at rates below those we expected to achieve when we started the project, our financial performance would be materially adversely affected.



We may have difficulty managing our growth.

We have significantly expanded the size of our company. For example, during 2006, we acquired 16 properties, including five properties outside the United
States, and our number of employees increased from 53 to 109. The growth in our company may significantly strain our management, operational and financial resources and systems. In addition, as a public company, we are subject to the reporting
requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and regulations of the NYSE. The requirements of these rules and regulations have
increased our accounting, legal and financial compliance costs and may strain our management and financial, legal and operational resources and systems. An inability to manage our growth effectively or the increased strain on management of our
resources and systems could result in deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting and could negatively impact our cash available for distribution, including cash available to pay preferred
stock dividends to our preferred stockholders or pay distributions to our common stockholders.

We have limited operating history as a
REIT and as a public company.

We were formed in March 2004 and have limited operating history as a REIT and as a public company. We
cannot assure you that our past experience will be sufficient to successfully operate our company as a REIT or as a public company. Failure to maintain REIT status or failure to meet the requirements of being a public company would have an adverse
effect on our cash available for distribution, including cash available to pay dividends to our preferred stockholders or pay distributions to our common stockholders.

Tax protection provisions on certain properties could limit our operating flexibility.

We have
agreed with the third-party contributors who contributed the direct and indirect interests in the 200 Paul Avenue 1-4 and 1100 Space Park Drive properties to indemnify them against adverse tax consequences if we were to sell, convey, transfer or
otherwise dispose of all or any portion of these interests, in a taxable transaction, in these properties. However, we can sell these properties in a taxable transaction if we pay the contributors cash in the amount of their tax liabilities arising
from the transaction and tax payments. The 200 Paul Avenue 1-4 and 1100 Space Park Drive properties represented 9.3% of our portfolio’s gross annualized rent as of December 31, 2006. These tax protection provisions apply for a period
expiring on the earlier of November 3, 2013 and the date on which these contributors (or certain transferees) hold less than 25% of the units issued to them in connection with the contribution of these properties to our operating partnership.
Although it may be in our stockholders’ best interest that we sell a property, it may be economically disadvantageous for us to do so because of these obligations. We have also agreed to make up to $20.0 million of debt available for these
contributors to guarantee. We agreed to these provisions in order to assist these contributors in preserving their tax position after their contributions.

Potential losses may not be covered by insurance.

We carry comprehensive liability, fire, extended
coverage, earthquake, business interruption and rental loss insurance covering all of the properties in our portfolio under various insurance policies. We select policy specifications and insured limits which we believe to be appropriate and
adequate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice. We do not carry insurance for generally uninsured losses such as loss from riots, terrorist threats, war or nuclear reaction. Most of our policies, like those
covering losses due to floods, are insured subject to limitations involving large deductibles or co-payments and policy limits which may not be sufficient to cover losses. A substantial portion of the properties we own are located in California, an
area especially subject to earthquakes. Together, these properties represented approximately 30% of our portfolio’s gross annualized rent as of December 31, 2006. While we carry earthquake insurance on our properties, the amount of our
earthquake insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover losses from earthquakes. In addition, we may discontinue earthquake or other insurance on some or all of our properties in the future if the cost of premiums for any of these
policies exceeds, in our judgment, the value of the coverage relative to the risk of loss.



In addition, many of our buildings contain extensive and highly valuable technology-related improvements.
Under the terms of our leases, tenants generally retain title to such improvements and are obligated to maintain adequate insurance coverage applicable to such improvements and under most circumstances use their insurance proceeds to restore such
improvements after a casualty. In the event of a casualty or other loss involving one of our buildings with extensive installed tenant improvements, our tenants may have the right to terminate their leases if we do not rebuild the base building
within prescribed times. In such cases, the proceeds from tenants’ insurance will not be available to us to restore the improvements, and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to replicate the technology-related improvements made by such
tenants. Furthermore, the terms of our mortgage indebtedness at certain of our properties may require us to pay insurance proceeds over to our lenders under certain circumstances, rather than use the proceeds to repair the property.

If we or one or more of our tenants experiences a loss which is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the
damaged properties as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties. In addition, if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness, even if these properties were
irreparably damaged.

Payments on our debt reduce cash available for distribution and may expose us to the risk of default under our
debt obligations.

Our total consolidated indebtedness at December 31, 2006 was approximately $1,122.6 million, and we may incur
significant additional debt to finance future acquisition and development activities. We also have an unsecured credit facility which has a borrowing limit based upon a percentage of the value of our unsecured properties included in the
facility’s borrowing base. At December 31, 2006, $148.0 million was available under this facility. In addition, under our contribution agreement with respect to the 200 Paul Avenue 1-4 and 1100 Space Park Drive properties, we have agreed
to make available for guarantee up to $20.0 million of indebtedness and may enter into similar agreements in the future.

Payments of
principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash resources to operate our properties, pay the dividends to our preferred stockholders or pay distributions to our common stockholders necessary to maintain our REIT
qualification. Our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences, including the following:

•

our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments;

•

we may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms;

•

we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness;

•

because a significant portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates, increases in interest rates could materially increase our interest expense;

•

we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties, possibly on disadvantageous terms;

•

we may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our properties or our interests in the entities that own the properties that secure
their loans and receive an assignment of rents and leases;

•

we may violate restrictive covenants in our loan documents, which would entitle the lenders to accelerate our debt obligations; and

•

our default under any one of our mortgage loans with cross default provisions could result in a default on other indebtedness.

If any one of these events were to occur, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, cash available for distribution, including cash
available to pay dividends to our preferred stockholders or pay distributions to our common stockholders, per share trading price of our common stock or preferred stock, and



our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations could be materially adversely affected. Furthermore, foreclosures could create taxable income without
accompanying cash proceeds, a circumstance which could hinder our ability to meet the REIT distribution requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended (the Code).

We may be unable to identify and complete acquisitions and successfully operate acquired properties.

We continually evaluate the market of available properties and may acquire additional technology-related real estate when opportunities exist. Our ability
to acquire properties on favorable terms and successfully operate them may be exposed to the following significant risks:

•

we may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other real estate investors with significant capital, including both publicly traded
REITs and institutional investment funds;

•

even if we are able to acquire a desired property, competition from other potential acquirors may significantly increase the purchase price or result in other less
favorable terms;

•

even if we enter into agreements for the acquisition of technology-related real estate, these agreements are subject to customary conditions to closing, including
completion of due diligence investigations to our satisfaction;

•

we may be unable to finance acquisitions on favorable terms or at all;

•

we may spend more than budgeted amounts to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired properties;

•

we may be unable to integrate new acquisitions quickly and efficiently, particularly acquisitions of operating businesses or portfolios of properties, into our
existing operations, and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected;

•

acquired properties may be subject to reassessment, which may result in higher than expected property tax payments;

•

market conditions may result in higher than expected vacancy rates and lower than expected rental rates; and

•

we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities such as liabilities
for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination, claims by tenants, vendors or other persons dealing with the former owners of the properties and claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by
the former owners of the properties.

If we cannot finance property acquisitions on favorable terms, or operate acquired
properties to meet our financial expectations, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, cash available for distribution, including cash available to pay dividends to our preferred stockholders or pay distributions to our common
stockholders, per share trading price of our common stock or preferred stock, and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations could be materially adversely affected.

We may be unable to source off-market deal flow in the future.

A key component of our growth
strategy is to continue to acquire additional technology-related real estate. To date, more than half of our acquisitions were acquired before they were widely marketed by real estate brokers, or “off-market.” Properties that are acquired
off-market are typically more attractive to us as a purchaser because of the absence of competitive bidding, which could potentially lead to higher prices. We obtain access to off-market deal flow from numerous sources. If we cannot obtain
off-market deal flow in the future, our ability to locate and acquire additional properties at attractive prices could be adversely affected.



We face significant competition, which may decrease or prevent increases of the occupancy and rental
rates of our properties.

We compete with numerous regional developers, owners and operators of real estate, many of which own
properties similar to ours in the same submarkets in which our properties are located. If our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates, or below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants, we may lose potential
tenants and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge in order to retain tenants when our tenants’ leases expire. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, cash available for
distribution, including cash available to pay dividends to our preferred stockholders or pay distributions to our common stockholders, per share trading price of our common stock or preferred stock, and ability to satisfy our debt service
obligations could be materially adversely affected.

We may be unable to renew leases, lease vacant space or re-lease space as leases
expire.

As of December 31, 2006, leases representing 2.0% of the square footage of the properties in our portfolio, excluding
space held for redevelopment were scheduled to expire in 2007, and an additional 5.0% of the net rentable square footage excluding space held for redevelopment was available to be leased. We cannot assure you that leases will be renewed or that our
properties will be re-leased at net effective rental rates equal to or above the current average net effective rental rates. If the rental rates for our properties decrease, our existing tenants do not renew their leases or we do not re-lease a
significant portion of our available space and space for which leases are scheduled to expire, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, cash available for distribution, including cash available to pay dividends to our preferred
stockholders or pay distributions to our common stockholders, per share trading price of our common stock or preferred stock, and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations could be materially adversely affected.

In addition at December 31, 2006 we owned approximately 1.6 million square feet held for redevelopment. Successful redevelopment of this space
depends on numerous factors including success in engaging contractors, obtaining environmental and legal permits and availability of financing. In addition, there can be no assurance that once we have redeveloped a space we will be able to
successfully lease to new or existing tenants. If we are not able to successfully redevelop this space, if redevelopment costs are higher than we currently estimate, or if we are not able to lease space that has been redeveloped, our revenue and
operating results could be adversely effected.

Our growth depends on external sources of capital which are outside of our control.

In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we are required under the Code to annually distribute at least 90% of our net taxable
income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain. In addition, we will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our net taxable income,
including any net capital gains. Because of these distribution requirements, we may not be able to fund future capital needs, including any necessary acquisition or redevelopment financing, from operating cash flow. Consequently, we rely on
third-party sources to fund our capital needs. We may not be able to obtain the financing on favorable terms or at all. Any additional debt we incur will increase our leverage. Our access to third-party sources of capital depends, in part, on:

•

general market conditions;

•

the market’s perception of our business prospects and growth potential;

•

our current debt levels;

•

our current and expected future earnings;

•

our cash flow and cash distributions; and

•

the market price per share of our common stock and preferred stock.



If we cannot obtain capital from third-party sources, we may not be able to acquire or develop properties
when strategic opportunities exist, satisfy our debt service obligations or make the cash distributions to our stockholders necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT.

Our unsecured credit facility restricts our ability to engage in some business activities.

Our unsecured credit facility contains negative covenants and other financial and operating covenants that, among other things:

•

restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness;

•

restrict our ability to make certain investments;

•

restrict our ability to merge with another company;

•

restrict our ability to create, incur or assume liens;

•

restrict our ability to make distributions to our stockholders;

•

require us to maintain financial coverage ratios; and

•

require us to maintain a pool of unencumbered assets approved by the lenders.

These restrictions could cause us to default on our unsecured credit facility or negatively affect our operations and our ability to pay dividends to our
preferred stockholders or distributions to our common stockholders.

The exchange and repurchase rights of our exchangeable debentures
may be detrimental to holders of common stock.

Our operating partnership has $172.5 million principal amount of 4.125% Exchangeable
Senior Debentures due 2026, which we refer to as the exchangeable debentures. The exchangeable debentures may under certain circumstances, be exchanged for cash (up to the principal amount of the exchangeable debentures) and, with respect to any
excess exchange value, into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock at an initial exchange rate of 30.6828 shares per $1,000 principal amount of exchangeable debentures. At the initial exchange rate,
the exchangeable debentures are exchangeable for our common stock at an exchange price of approximately $32.5916 per share. The exchange rate of the exchangeable debentures is subject to adjustment for certain events, including, but not limited to,
certain dividends on our common stock in excess of $0.265 per share per quarter, the issuance of certain rights, options or warrants to holders of our common stock, subdivisions or combinations of our common stock, certain distributions of assets,
debt securities, capital stock or cash to holders of our common stock and certain tender or exchange offers. The exchangeable debentures are redeemable at the Company’s option for cash at any time on or after August 18, 2011 and are
subject to repurchase for cash at the option of the holder on August 15 in the years 2011, 2016 and 2021, or upon the occurrence of certain events. The exchangeable debentures are our senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations.

The exchange of exchangeable debentures for our common stock would dilute stockholder ownership in our company, and could adversely affect the market
price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. Any adjustments to the exchange rate of the exchangeable debentures would exacerbate their dilutive effect. If the exchangeable
debentures are not exchanged, the repurchase rights of holder of the exchangeable debentures may discourage or impede transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of holders of common stock. Further, these exchange or repurchase rights might
be triggered in situations where we need to conserve our cash reserves, in which event such repurchase might adversely affect us and our stockholders.

Joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on co-venturers’ financial condition and disputes between us and our co-venturers.

We currently and may in the future co-invest in the future with third parties through partnerships, joint ventures or other entities,
acquiring non-controlling interests in or sharing responsibility for managing the affairs



of a property, partnership, joint venture or other entity. In that event, we would not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding
the property, partnership, joint venture or other entity. Investments in partnerships, joint ventures, or other entities may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present when a third party is not involved, including the possibility that
partners or co-venturers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. Partners or co-venturers may have economic, tax or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or
goals, and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives. Our joint venture partners may take actions that are not within our control, which would require us to dispose of the joint venture asset or transfer it to a
taxable REIT subsidiary in order to maintain our status as a REIT. Such investments may also lead to impasses, for example, as to whether to sell a property, because neither we nor the partner or co-venturer would have full control over the
partnership or joint venture. Disputes between us and partners or co-venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and/or directors from focusing their time and effort on our day-to-day
business. Consequently, actions by or disputes with partners or co-venturers may subject properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk. In addition, we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our
third-party partners or co-venturers. Each of these factors may result in returns on these investments being less than we expect or in losses and our financial and operating results may be adversely effected.

Our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed.

We depend on the efforts of key personnel, particularly Michael Foust, our Chief Executive Officer, A. William Stein, our Chief Financial Officer and
Chief Investment Officer, Scott Peterson, our Senior Vice President, Acquisitions, Christopher Crosby, our Senior Vice President, Sales and Technical Services and James R. Trout, our Senior Vice President of Portfolio and Technical Operations. They
are important to our success for many reasons, including that each has a national or regional reputation in our industry and the investment community that attracts investors and business and investment opportunities and assists us in negotiations
with investors, lenders, existing and potential tenants and industry personnel. If we lost their services, our business and investment opportunities and our relationships with lenders and other capital markets participants, existing and prospective
tenants and industry personnel could suffer. Many of our other senior executives also have strong technology and real estate industry reputations. As a result, we have greater access to potential acquisitions and leasing and other opportunities, and
are better able to negotiate with tenants. The loss of any of these key personnel would result in the loss of these and other benefits and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.

Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect results of operations.

We seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements, such as interest cap and interest rate swap
agreements. These agreements involve risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes and that a
court could rule that such an agreement is not legally enforceable. Our policy is to use derivatives only to hedge interest rate risks related to our borrowings, not for speculative or trading purposes, and to enter into contracts only with major
financial institutions based on their credit ratings and other factors. However, we may choose to change this policy in the future. Including loans currently subject to interest rate swaps, approximately 87% of our total indebtedness as of
December 31, 2006 was subject to fixed interest rates. We do not currently hedge our unsecured credit facility and as our borrowings under our unsecured credit facility increases, so will our percentage of indebtedness not subject to fixed
rates and our exposure to interest rates increases. Hedging may reduce the overall returns on our investments. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may materially adversely affect our results of operations.

Our properties may not be suitable for lease to traditional datacenter or technology office tenants without significant expenditures or renovations.

Because many of our properties contain extensive tenant improvements installed at our tenants’ expense, they may be better suited
for a specific corporate enterprise datacenter user or technology industry tenant and could require modification in order for us to re-lease vacant space to another corporate enterprise datacenter user



or technology industry tenant. The tenant improvements may also become outdated or obsolete as the result of technological change, the passage of time or
other factors. In addition, our redevelopment space will generally require substantial improvement to be suitable for datacenter use. For the same reason, our properties also may not be suitable for lease to traditional office tenants without
significant expenditures or renovations. As a result, we may be required to invest significant amounts or offer significant discounts to tenants in order to lease or re-lease that space, either of which could adversely effect our financial and
operating results.

Ownership of properties located outside of the United States subjects us to foreign currency and related risks which
may adversely impact our ability to make distributions.

We owned eight properties located outside of the U.S. at December 31, 2006
and have a right of first offer with respect to another property. In addition, we are currently considering, and will in the future consider, additional international acquisitions.

The ownership of properties located outside of the U.S. subjects us to risk from fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S.
dollar. We expect that our principal foreign currency exposure will be to the British pound and the Euro. Changes in the relation of these currencies to U.S. dollars will affect our revenues and operating margins, may materially adversely impact our
financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, cash available for distribution, including cash available to pay dividends to our preferred stockholders or pay distributions to our common stockholders, per share trading price of our common
stock or preferred stock, ability to satisfy our debt obligations and ability to qualify as a REIT.

We may attempt to mitigate some or all
of the risk of currency fluctuation by financing our properties in the local currency denominations, although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so or that this will be effective. We may also engage in direct hedging activities to
mitigate the risks of exchange rate fluctuations.

Any foreign currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates as well
as any income recognized with respect to foreign currency exchange rate hedging activities may not qualify under the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a
REIT.

Acquisition and ownership of foreign properties involve risks greater than those faced by us in the U.S.

Foreign real estate investments usually involve risks not generally associated with investments in the United States. Our international acquisitions and
operations are subject to a number of risks, including:

•

acquisition risk resulting from our lack of knowledge of local real estate markets, economies and business practices and customs;

•

our limited knowledge of and relationships with sellers and tenants in these markets;

•

due diligence, transaction and structuring costs higher than those we may face in the U.S.;

•

complexity and costs associated with managing international operations;

•

difficulty in hiring qualified management, sales personnel and service providers in a timely fashion;

•

multiple, conflicting and changing legal, regulatory, tax and treaty environments;

•

exposure to increased taxation, confiscation or expropriation;

•

currency transfer restrictions and limitations on our ability to distribute cash earned in foreign jurisdictions to the U.S.;

•

difficulty in enforcing agreements in non-U.S. jurisdictions, including those entered into in connection with our acquisitions or in the event of a default by one
or more of our tenants; and

•

political and economic instability in certain geographic regions.



Our inability to overcome these risks could adversely affect our foreign operations and could harm our
business and results of operations.

Risks Related to the Real Estate Industry

Our performance and value are subject to risks associated with real estate assets and with the real estate industry.

Our ability to pay dividends to our preferred stockholders or pay distributions to our common stockholders depends on our ability to generate revenues in
excess of expenses, scheduled principal payments on debt and capital expenditure requirements. Events and conditions generally applicable to owners and operators of real property that are beyond our control may decrease cash available for
distribution, including cash available to pay dividends to our preferred stockholders or pay distributions to our common stockholders, and the value of our properties. These events and conditions include:

•

local oversupply, increased competition or reduction in demand for technology-related space;

•

inability to collect rent from tenants;

•

vacancies or our inability to rent space on favorable terms;

•

inability to finance property development and acquisitions on favorable terms;

•

increased operating costs, including insurance premiums, utilities and real estate taxes;

•

costs of complying with changes in governmental regulations; and

•

the relative illiquidity of real estate investments.

In addition, periods of economic slowdown or recession, rising interest rates or declining demand for real estate, or the public perception that any of these events may occur, could result in a general decline in
rents or an increased incidence of defaults under existing leases, which would materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, cash available for distribution, including cash available to pay dividends to our
preferred stockholders or pay distributions to our common stockholders, per share trading price of our common stock or preferred stock and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations.

Illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties and
harm our financial condition.

Because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to promptly sell properties in our
portfolio in response to adverse changes in their performance may be limited, which may harm our financial condition. The real estate market is affected by many factors that are beyond our control, including:

•

adverse changes in national and local economic and market conditions;

•

changes in interest rates and in the availability, cost and terms of debt financing;

•

changes in laws and regulations, fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and costs of compliance with laws and regulations, fiscal policies and ordinances;

•

the ongoing need for capital improvements, particularly in older structures;

•

changes in operating expenses; and

•

civil unrest, acts of war, terrorist attacks and natural disasters, including earthquakes and floods, which may result in uninsured and underinsured losses.

We could incur significant costs related to government regulation and private litigation over environmental matters.

Under various laws relating to the protection of the environment, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable
for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic



substances at that property, and may be required to investigate and clean up such contamination at or emanating from that property. Such laws often impose
liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the contaminants, and the liability may be joint and several. Previous owners used some of our properties for industrial and retail purposes,
so those properties may contain some level of environmental contamination. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties may expose us to third-party liability or materially adversely affect our ability to
sell, lease or develop the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.

Some of the properties may contain
asbestos-containing building materials. Environmental laws require that asbestos-containing building materials be properly managed and maintained, and may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these
requirements. These laws may also allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos-containing building materials.

In addition, some of our tenants, particularly those in the biotechnology and life sciences industry and those in the technology manufacturing industry,
routinely handle hazardous substances and wastes as part of their operations at our properties. Environmental laws and regulations subject our tenants, and potentially us, to liability resulting from these activities or from previous industrial or
retail uses of those properties. Environmental liabilities could also affect a tenant’s ability to make rental payments to us.

Existing conditions at some of our properties may expose us to liability related to environmental matters.

Independent
environmental consultants have conducted Phase I or similar environmental site assessments on all of the properties in our portfolio. Site assessments are intended to discover and evaluate information regarding the environmental condition of the
surveyed property and surrounding properties. These assessments do not generally include soil samplings, subsurface investigations or an asbestos survey and the assessments may fail to reveal all environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance
concerns. In addition material environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance concerns may arise after these reviews are completed or may arise in the future. Future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose additional material environmental
liability.

We cannot assure you that costs of future environmental compliance will not affect our ability to pay dividends to our
preferred stockholders or pay distributions to our common stockholders or that such costs or other remedial measures will not have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations.

Our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other air quality issues, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects
and costs to remedy the problem.

When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold may grow, particularly
if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or
outdoor sources and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria. Indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants above certain levels can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic
or other reactions. As a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from
the affected property or increase indoor ventilation. In addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants, employees of our tenants and others if property damage or health
concerns arise.

We may incur significant costs complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act and similar laws.

Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA, all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by
disabled persons. We have not conducted an audit or investigation of all of our properties to determine our compliance with the ADA. If one or more of the properties



in our portfolio does not comply with the ADA, then we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the property into compliance. Additional federal,
state and local laws also may require modifications to our properties, or restrict our ability to renovate our properties. We cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with the ADA or other legislation. If we incur substantial costs to comply
with the ADA and any other similar legislation, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, cash available for distribution, including cash available to pay dividends to our preferred stockholders or pay distributions to our common
stockholders, per share trading price of our common stock or preferred stock and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations could be materially adversely affected.

We may incur significant costs complying with other regulations.

The properties in our portfolio are subject to various federal, state and local regulations, such as state and local fire and life safety regulations. If we fail to comply with these various regulations, we may have
to pay fines or private damage awards. In addition, we do not know whether existing regulations will change or whether future regulations will require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures that will materially adversely impact our
financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, cash available for distribution, including cash available to pay dividends to our preferred stockholders or pay distributions to our common stockholders, per share trading price of our common
stock or preferred stock and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations.

Risks Related to Our Organizational Structure

Conflicts of interest may exist or could arise in the future with holders of units in our operating partnership.

Conflicts of interest may exist or could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates, on the one hand, and our
operating partnership or any partner thereof, on the other. Our directors and officers have duties to our company and our stockholders under Maryland law in connection with their management of our company. At the same time, we, as general partner,
have fiduciary duties under Maryland law to our operating partnership and to the limited partners in connection with the management of our operating partnership. Our duties as general partner to our operating partnership and its partners may come
into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our company and our stockholders. Under Maryland law, a general partner of a Maryland limited partnership owes its limited partners the duties of good faith, fairness and loyalty, unless
the partnership agreement provides otherwise. The partnership agreement of our operating partnership provides that for so long as we own a controlling interest in our operating partnership, any conflict that cannot be resolved in a manner not
adverse to either our stockholders or the limited partners will be resolved in favor of our stockholders.

The provisions of Maryland law
that allow the fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been tested in a court of law, and we have not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement that
purport to waive or restrict our fiduciary duties.

We are also subject to the following additional conflicts of interest with holders of
units in our operating partnership:

We may pursue less vigorous enforcement of terms of certain agreements because of conflicts of
interest with GI Partners and certain of our officers.

GI Partners and its related funds, which collectively owned a 9.5% interest in our operating partnership at December 31, 2006, owns a property on which we have a right of
first offer. In addition, GI Partners owns The Linc Group, a provider of operations and maintenance repair services for mechanical, electrical, plumbing and general building service systems that we have contracted with to provide these services at
five of our properties. GI Partners Fund II, LLP, or GI Partners II, owns The tel(x) Group, an operator of “Meet-Me-Room” network interconnection facilities that leases 87,305 square feet from us under ten lease agreements. Richard
Magnuson, the Chairman of our board of directors, is also, and will continue to be, the chief executive officer of the advisor to GI Partners and GI Partners II. In the future, we may enter into additional



agreements with The Linc Group, The tel(x) Group or other companies owned by GI Partners or GI Partners II. We may choose not to enforce, or to enforce less
vigorously, our rights under theses agreements because of our desire to maintain our ongoing relationship with GI Partners and the other individuals involved.

Tax consequences upon sale or refinancing.

Sales of properties and repayment of related indebtedness will affect holders of common units in our operating partnership and our stockholders
differently. The parties who contributed the 200 Paul Avenue 1-4 and 1100 Space Park Drive properties to our operating partnership would incur adverse tax consequences upon the sale of these properties and on the repayment of related debt which
differ from the tax consequences to us and our stockholders. Consequently, these holders of common units in our operating partnership may have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any such sale or repayment of debt.
While we have exclusive authority under the limited partnership agreement of our operating partnership to determine when to refinance or repay debt or whether, when, and on what terms to sell a property, any such decision would require the approval
of our board of directors. Certain of our directors and executive officers could exercise their influence in a manner inconsistent with the interests of some, or a majority, of our stockholders, including in a manner which could prevent completion
of a sale of a property or the repayment of indebtedness.

Our charter and Maryland law contain provisions that may delay, defer or
prevent a change of control transaction.

Our charter and the articles supplementary with respect to the preferred stock contain
9.8% ownership limits.

Our charter, subject to certain exceptions, authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT and to limit any person to actual or constructive
ownership of no more than 9.8% (by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding shares of our common stock, 9.8% (by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding shares of any
series of preferred stock and 9.8% of the value of our outstanding capital stock. Our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may exempt a proposed transferee from the ownership limit. However, our board of directors may not grant an exemption
from the ownership limit to any proposed transferee whose direct or indirect ownership of more than 9.8% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, more than of 9.8% of the outstanding shares of any series of preferred stock or more than 9.8% of
the value of our outstanding capital stock could jeopardize our status as a REIT. These restrictions on transferability and ownership will not apply if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to
qualify, or to continue to qualify, as a REIT. The ownership limit may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might be in the best interest of our common or preferred stockholders.

We could increase the number of authorized shares of stock and issue stock without stockholder approval.

Our charter
authorizes our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to increase the aggregate number of authorized shares of stock or the number of authorized shares of stock of any class or series, to issue authorized but unissued shares of our common
stock or preferred stock and, subject to the voting rights of holders of preferred stock, to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock and to set the preferences, rights and other terms of such classified or
reclassified shares. Although our board of directors has no such intention at the present time, it could establish a series of preferred stock that could, depending on the terms of such series, delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of
control that might be in the best interest of our common or preferred stockholders.

Certain provisions of Maryland law could
inhibit changes in control.

Certain provisions of the MGCL may have the effect of impeding a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change of control under circumstances that otherwise could be in the best
interests of our common or preferred stockholders, including:

•

“business combination” provisions that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between us and an “interested
stockholder” (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10%



or more of the voting power of our shares or an affiliate or associate of ours who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was
the beneficial owner of 10% or more of our then outstanding voting shares) or an affiliate thereof for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, and thereafter imposes special appraisal rights
and special stockholder voting requirements on these combinations; and

•

“control share” provisions that provide that “control shares” of our company (defined as shares which, when aggregated with other shares
controlled by the stockholder, entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a “control share acquisition” (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership
or control of “control shares”) have no voting rights except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares.

We have opted out of these provisions of the MGCL, in the case of the business combination provisions of the MGCL by
resolution of our board of directors, and in the case of the control share provisions of the MGCL pursuant to a provision in our bylaws. However, our board of directors may by resolution elect to opt in to the business combination provisions of the
MGCL and we may, by amendment to our bylaws, opt in to the control share provisions of the MGCL in the future.

The provisions of our
charter on removal of directors and the advance notice provisions of the bylaws could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control of our company that might be in the best interest of our common or preferred stockholders. Likewise,
if our company’s board of directors were to opt in to the business combination provisions of the MGCL or the provisions of Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the MGCL, or if the provision in our bylaws opting out of the control share acquisition provisions
of the MGCL were rescinded, these provisions of the MGCL could have similar anti-takeover effects. Further, our partnership agreement provides that our company may not engage in any merger, consolidation or other combination with or into another
person, sale of all or substantially all of our assets or any reclassification or any recapitalization or change in outstanding shares of our common stock, unless in connection with such transaction we obtain the consent of the holders of at least
35% of our operating partnership’s common and long-term incentive units (including units held by us), and certain other conditions are met.

Our board of directors may change our investment and financing policies without stockholder approval and we may become more highly leveraged, which may increase our risk of default under our debt obligations.

Our board of directors adopted a policy of limiting our indebtedness to 60% of our total market capitalization. Our total market capitalization is defined
as the sum of the market value of our outstanding common stock (which may decrease, thereby increasing our debt to total capitalization ratio), excluding options issued under our incentive award plan, plus the aggregate value of the units not held
by us, plus the liquidation preference of outstanding preferred stock, plus the book value of our total consolidated indebtedness. However, our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness, funded or otherwise, that
we may incur. Our board of directors may alter or eliminate our current policy on borrowing at any time without stockholder approval. If this policy changed, we could become more highly leveraged which could result in an increase in our debt service
and which could materially adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make distributions, including cash available to pay dividends to our preferred stockholders or pay distribution to our common stockholders. Higher leverage also increases
the risk of default on our obligations.

Our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers
are limited.

Maryland law provides that our directors and officers have no liability in their capacities as directors or officers if they perform their
duties in good faith, in a manner they reasonably believe to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. As permitted



by the MGCL, our charter limits the liability of our directors and officers to us and our stockholders for money damages, except for liability resulting
from:

•

actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services; or

•

a final judgment based upon a finding of active and deliberate dishonesty by the director or officer that was material to the cause of action adjudicated.

In addition, our charter authorizes us to obligate our company, and our bylaws require us, to indemnify our directors
and officers for actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law and we have entered in indemnification agreements with our officers and directors. As a result, we and our stockholders may have more limited
rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law. Accordingly, in the event that actions taken in good faith by any of our directors or officers impede the performance of our company, your ability to recover
damages from that director or officer will be limited.

Risks Related to Our Status as a REIT

Failure to qualify as a REIT would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our stock.

We have operated and intend to continue operating in a manner that we believe will allow us to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes under the
Code. We have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the IRS that we qualify as a REIT. If we lose our REIT status, we will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce our cash available for distribution, including
cash available to pay dividends to our preferred stockholders or pay distributions to our common stockholders, for each of the years involved because:

•

we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular
corporate rates;

•

we also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; and

•

unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, we could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during
which we were disqualified.

In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be required to make distributions
to stockholders. As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, and would materially adversely affect the value of our capital stock.

Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and
administrative interpretations. The complexity of these provisions and of the applicable Treasury Regulations that have been promulgated under the Code is greater in the case of a REIT that, like us, holds its assets through a partnership. Our
ability to qualify as a REIT may be affected by facts and circumstances that are not entirely within our control. In order to qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy a number of requirements, including requirements regarding the composition of our assets
and a requirement that at least 95% of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources, such as “rents from real property.” Also, we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our net
taxable income, excluding net capital gains. In addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may materially adversely affect our investors, our ability to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes
or the desirability of an investment in a REIT relative to other investments.

Even if we qualify as a REIT for federal income tax
purposes, we may be subject to some federal, state and local taxes on our income or property and, in certain cases, a 100% penalty tax, in the event we sell property as a dealer. In addition, our domestic taxable REIT subsidiary could be subject to
Federal and state taxes, and our foreign properties and companies are subject to tax in the jurisdictions in which they operate and are located.



To maintain our REIT status, we may be forced to borrow funds on a short-term basis during unfavorable
market conditions.

To qualify as a REIT, we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our net taxable income each
year, excluding capital gains, and we will be subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our net taxable income each year. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the
amount, if any, by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income, 95% of our capital gain net income and 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. In order to maintain our REIT
status and avoid the payment of income and excise taxes, we may need to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the REIT distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. These
short-term borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required
debt or amortization payments.

The ability of our board of directors to revoke our REIT election without stockholder approval may cause
adverse consequences to our stockholders.

Our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT
election, without the approval of our stockholders, if it determines that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to qualify as a REIT. If we cease to qualify as a REIT, we would become subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable
income and we would no longer be required to distribute most of our taxable income to our stockholders, which may have adverse consequences on the total return to our common or preferred stockholders.

Forward-Looking Statements

We make statements in
this report that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. In particular, statements pertaining to our capital resources, portfolio performance and results of operations contain forward-looking statements.
Likewise, all of our statements regarding anticipated market conditions, demographics and results of operations are forward-looking statements. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as
“believes,” “expects,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “approximately,” “intends,” “plans,” “pro forma,” “estimates” or
“anticipates” or the negative of these words and phrases or similar words or phrases which are predictions of or indicate future events or trends and which do not relate solely to historical matters. You can also identify forward looking
statements by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions.

Forward-looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties and you
should not rely on them as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements depend on assumptions, data or methods which may be incorrect or imprecise and we may not be able to realize them. We do not guarantee that the transactions and
events described will happen as described (or that they will happen at all). The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward-looking
statements:

•

adverse economic or real estate developments in our markets or the technology industry;

•

our dependence upon significant tenants;

•

our inability to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to public companies or to manage our growth effectively;

•

difficulty acquiring or operating properties in foreign jurisdictions;

•

defaults on or non-renewal of leases by tenants;

•

increased interest rates and operating costs;



•

our failure to obtain necessary outside financing;

•

decreased rental rates or increased vacancy rates;

•

difficulties in identifying properties to acquire and completing acquisitions;

•

our failure to successfully operate acquired properties and operations;

•

our failure to maintain our status as a REIT;

•

possible adverse changes to tax laws;

•

environmental uncertainties and risks related to natural disasters;

•

financial market fluctuations;

changes in foreign currency exchange rates;

•

changes in foreign laws and regulations, including those related to taxation and real estate ownership and operation;

•

changes in real estate and zoning laws and increases in real property tax rates; and

•

inability to successfully redevelop and lease space held for redevelopment.

While forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs, they are not guaranties of future performance. We disclaim any obligation to publicly
update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, new information, data or methods, future events or other changes. For a further discussion of these and other factors that could impact our
future results, performance or transactions, see the sections above.

ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES

Our Portfolio

As of December 31, 2006, we owned 59 properties through our operating partnership, excluding one property held as an investment in an
unconsolidated joint venture. These properties are primarily located throughout North America, with seven properties located in Europe, and contain a total of approximately 9.4 million net rentable square feet excluding 1.6 million square
feet held for redevelopment. The following table presents an overview of our portfolio of properties excluding the one property held as an investment in a joint venture, based on information as of December 31, 2006.







(1)

We have categorized the properties in our portfolio by their principal use based on gross annualized rent. However, many of our properties support multiple uses.

(2)

Net rentable square feet at a building represents the current square feet at that building under lease as specified in the lease agreements plus management’s estimate of space
available for lease based on engineering drawings. Net rentable square feet includes tenants’ proportional share of common areas but excludes space held for redevelopment.

(3)

Redevelopment space is unoccupied space that requires significant capital investment in order to develop datacenter facilities that are ready for use. Most often this is shell
space. However, in certain circumstances this may include partially built datacenter space that was not completed by previous ownership and requires a large capital investment in order to build out the space.

(4)

Excludes space held for redevelopment. Includes unoccupied space for which we are receiving rent and excludes space for which leases had been executed as of December 31, 2006
but for which we are not receiving rent.

(5)

Gross annualized rent represents the monthly contractual rent under existing leases as of December 31, 2006 multiplied by 12.

(6)

Gross annualized rent per square foot represents gross annualized rent as computed above, divided by the total square footage under lease as of the same date.

(7)

Rental amounts for 6 Braham Street were calculated based on the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006 of $1.96 per £1.00 and rental amounts for Unit 9,
Blanchardstown Corporate Park, 114 Rue Ambroise Croizat, Gyroscoopweg 2E-2F, Paul van Vlissingenstraat 16, Chemin de l’Epinglier 2 and Clonshaugh Industrial Estate were calculated based on the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006
of $1.32 per € 1.00. Paul Van Vlissingenstraat 16, Chemin de l’Epinglier 2 and Clonshaugh Industrial Estate are subject to ground leases, which expire in the years 2054, 2074 and 2981, respectively.

(8)

111 Eighth Avenue and 8100 Boone Boulevard are subject to operating leases, which expire in June 2014 and October 2007, respectively.

(9)

We are party to a ground sublease for this property. The term of the ground sublease expires in September 2083. All of the lease payments were prepaid by prior owner of this
property.

(10)

We are party to a ground sublease for this property. The term of the ground sublease expires in the year 2082.



Tenant Diversification

As of December 31, 2006 our portfolio was leased to more than 426 companies, many of which are nationally recognized firms. The following table sets forth information regarding the 15 largest tenants in our
portfolio based on gross annualized rent as of December 31, 2006.

(1)

Occupied square footage is defined as leases that have commenced on or before December 31, 2006.

(2)

Gross annualized rent represents the monthly contractual rent under existing leases as of December 31, 2006 multiplied by 12.

(3)

Microsoft subleases 192,000 net rentable square feet (approximately $3.8 million of gross annualized rent) of this space and has the right to become tenant if the primary lessor
defaults.

(4)

Verio is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nippon Telegraph & Telephone.

(5)

Leslie & Godwin is a UK subsidiary of AON Corporation.

(6)

Level 3 Communications includes Wiltel Communications, OnFiber Communications & Broadwing Communications.

(7)

Stone & Webster is a subsidiary of The Shaw Group.

Lease
Distribution

The following table sets forth information relating to the distribution of leases in the properties in our portfolio,
based on net rentable square feet (excluding space held for redevelopment) under lease as of December 31, 2006.

(1)

Excludes approximately 1.6 million square feet held for redevelopment at December 31, 2006.



Lease Expirations

The following table sets forth a summary schedule of the lease expirations for leases in place as of December 31, 2006 plus available space for each of the next ten full calendar years at the properties in our
portfolio. Unless otherwise stated in the footnotes, the information set forth in the table assumes that tenants exercise no renewal options and all early termination rights.

(1)

Excludes approximately 1.6 million square feet held for redevelopment at December 31, 2006.

(2)

Includes 63,233 square feet of net rentable space in 6 Braham Street. This property is subleased by Level 3 Communications from Leslie & Godwin, a United Kingdom subsidiary
of AON Corporation, through December 2009. Level 3 Communications has executed a lease that will commence upon expiration of the Leslie & Godwin lease and continue through December 2014. Leslie & Godwin remain liable to us for
rents under its lease.

Right of First Offer Property

At December 31, 2006 there is one property located in Germany owned by GI Partners that is subject to right of first offer agreements, whereby we have the right to make the first offer to purchase this property
if GI Partners decides to sell it. We acquired one property from GI Partners that was subject to a right of first offer in June 2005.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In the ordinary course of our
business, we may become subject to tort claims and other claims and administrative proceedings. As of December 31, 2006, we were not a party to any legal proceedings which we believe would have a material adverse effect on us.

ITEM 4.

SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matters were submitted to a vote of our stockholders during the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2006.



PART II

ITEM 5.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Our common stock has been listed and is traded on the NYSE under the symbol “DLR” since October 29, 2004. The following table sets forth,
for the periods indicated, the high, low and last sale prices in dollars on the NYSE for our common stock and the distributions we declared with respect to the periods indicated.

We intend to continue to declare quarterly dividends on our common stock. The actual amount and
timing of dividends, however, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our financial condition in addition to the requirements of the Code, and no assurance can be given as to the amounts or timing of future
dividends. The exchange rate on our $172.5 million principal amount of exchangeable debentures is subject to adjustment for certain events, including, but not limited to, certain dividends on our common stock in excess of $0.265 per share per
quarter. Therefore, increases to our quarterly dividend may increase the dilutive impact of the exchangeable debentures on our common stockholders. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors “Risks Related to Our Business and Operations—The
exchange and repurchase rights of our exchangeable debentures may be detrimental to holders of common stock.”

Subject to the dividend
requirements applicable to REITs under the Code, we intend, to the extent practicable, to invest substantially all of the proceeds from sales and refinancings of our assets in real estate-related assets and other assets. We may, however, under
certain circumstances, make a dividend of capital or of assets. Such dividends, if any, will be made at the discretion of our board of directors. Dividends will be made in cash to the extent that cash is available for dividend.

As of February 23, 2007, there were 8 stockholders of record of our common stock. This figure does not reflect the beneficial ownership of shares
held in nominee name.

STOCK PERFORMANCE GRAPH

The following graph compares the yearly change in the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock during the period from November 3, 2004 (the date of our initial public offering) through
December 31, 2006, with the cumulative total return on the Morgan Stanley REIT Index (RMS) and the S&P 500 Market Index. The comparison assumes that $100 was invested on November 3, 2004 in our common stock and in each of these indices
and assumes reinvestment of dividends, if any.

ITEM 6.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

The following table sets
forth selected consolidated financial and operating data on an historical basis for our company and on a combined historical basis for our company’s Predecessor. The Predecessor is comprised of the real estate activities and holdings of GI
Partners related to the properties in our portfolio. We have not presented historical information for the Company for periods prior to the consummation of our initial public offering because we did not have any corporate activity until the
completion of our initial public offering other than the issuance of shares of common stock in connection with the initial capitalization of our company, and because we believe that a discussion of the results of the Company would not be meaningful.
The Predecessor’s combined historical financial information includes:

•

the wholly owned real estate subsidiaries and majority-owned real estate joint ventures that GI Partners contributed to our operating partnership in connection with
our initial public offering;

•

an allocation of GI Partners’ line of credit to the extent that borrowings and related interest expense relate to (1) borrowings to fund acquisitions of
the properties in our portfolio and (2) borrowings to pay asset management fees paid by GI Partners that were allocated to the properties in our portfolio; and

•

an allocation of the asset management fees paid to a related party and incurred by GI Partners, along with an allocation of the liability for any such fees that
were unpaid as of December 31, 2003 and an allocation of GI Partners’ general and administrative expenses.

The
following data should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included below in this Form 10-K. Certain prior
year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated and combined financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in
this report. Where appropriate, the following discussion includes analysis of the effects of our initial public offering, the formation transactions and related refinancing transactions and certain other transactions. We make statements in this
section that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of forward-looking statements, see the section in this Form 10-K entitled “Forward-Looking Statements.” Certain risk
factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion. For a discussion of such risk factors, see the sections in this report entitled “Risk
Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements.”

Overview

Our company.

We completed our initial public offering, or IPO, of common stock on November 3, 2004. We have operated in a manner that we
believe has enabled us to qualify, and have elected to be treated, as a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code. Our company was formed on
March 9, 2004. During the period from our formation until we commenced operations in connection with the completion of our IPO, we did not have any corporate activity other than the issuance of shares of common stock in connection with the
initial capitalization of our company. Because we believe that a discussion of the results of our company prior to the completion of our IPO would not be meaningful, we have set forth below a discussion of historical combined operations for our
company and our company’s Predecessor and as such, any reference in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to “our,” “we” and “us” in this Item 7
includes the Predecessor.

Business and strategy.

Our primary business objectives are to maximize sustainable long-term growth in
earnings, funds from operations and cash flow per share and to maximize returns to our stockholders. We expect to achieve our objectives by focusing on our core business of investing in technology-related real estate. We target high quality,
strategically located properties containing applications and operations critical to the day-to-day operations of corporate enterprise datacenter and technology industry tenants. Most of our properties contain fully redundant electrical supply
systems, multiple power feeds, above-standard precision cooling systems, raised floor areas, extensive in-building communications cabling and high-level security systems. We focus solely on technology-related real estate because we believe that the
growth in corporate datacenter adoption and the technology-related real estate industry generally will be superior to that of the overall economy.

As of December 31, 2006, our portfolio consisted of an aggregate of 59 technology-related real estate properties that we acquired beginning in 2002 with 9.4 million net rentable square feet excluding approximately 1.6 million
square feet of space held for redevelopment, excluding one property held as an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture. We have developed detailed, standardized procedures for evaluating acquisitions to ensure that they meet our financial and
other criteria. We expect to continue to acquire additional assets as a key part of our growth strategy. We intend to aggressively manage and lease our assets to increase their cash flow.

We may acquire properties subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness or we may incur new indebtedness in connection with acquiring or
refinancing these properties. Debt service on such indebtedness will have a priority over any dividends with respect to our common stock and our preferred stock. As mandated by our board of directors, we limit our indebtedness to 60% of our total
market capitalization and, based on the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2006 of $34.23, our ratio of debt to total market capitalization was approximately 31%. Our total market capitalization is defined as the sum of the
market value of our outstanding common stock (which may decrease, thereby increasing our debt to total market capitalization ratio), excluding options issued under our incentive award plan, plus the liquidation value of our preferred stock, plus the
aggregate value of the units not held by us, plus the book value of our total consolidated indebtedness.



In addition, we may sell properties from time to time that no longer meet our business objectives. In
June 2006, 7979 East Tufts Avenue met the criteria to be presented as held for sale, which resulted in the reclassification of the operating results of this property to discontinued operations for all periods presented. This property was sold on
July 12, 2006.

Revenue Base.

As of December 31, 2006, we owned 59 properties through our Operating Partnership, excluding
one property held as an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture. These properties are mainly located throughout the U.S., with seven properties located in Europe and one property in Canada. We acquired our first portfolio property in January
2002 and have added properties as follows:

(1)

Excludes 7979 East Tufts Avenue, a property we acquired in October 2003 and sold on July 12, 2006.

(2)

Excludes space held for redevelopment.

(3)

Redevelopment space is unoccupied space that requires significant capital investment in order to develop datacenter facilities that are ready for use. Most often this is shell
space. However, in certain circumstances this may include partially built datacenter space that was not completed by previous ownership and requires a large capital investment in order to build out the space. The amounts included in this table
represent redevelopment space as of December 31, 2006 in the properties acquired during the relevant period.

As of
December 31, 2006, the properties in our portfolio were approximately 95.0% leased excluding 1.6 million square feet held for redevelopment. Due to the capital intensive and long term nature of the operations being supported, our lease
terms are generally longer than standard commercial leases. As of December 31, 2006, our original average lease term was approximately 12 years, with an average of seven years remaining. Leasing since the completion of our initial public
offering in November 2004 has been at lease terms shorter than 12 years. Our lease expirations through 2008 are 6.5% of net rentable square feet excluding space held for redevelopment as of December 31, 2006. Operating revenues from properties
outside the United States were $13.2 million, $6.0 million and $4.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Operating expenses.

Our operating expenses generally consist of utilities, property and ad valorem taxes, property management fees, insurance and site operating and maintenance costs, as well as rental
expenses. Since the consummation of our IPO, our asset management function has been internalized and we currently incur our general and administrative expenses directly. Prior to April 2005, we had a transition services agreement with CB Richard
Ellis Investors with respect to transitional accounting and other services. In addition, as a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses related to corporate governance, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
reporting and compliance with the various provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In addition, we engage third-party property managers to manage most of our properties. As of December 31, 2006, 32 of our properties were managed by CB Richard
Ellis, an affiliate of GI Partners.

Formation Transactions.

In connection with the completion of our IPO, our operating partnership
received contributions of direct and indirect interests in 23 of the properties in our portfolio in exchange for consideration that included cash, assumption of debt, and an aggregate of 38,262,206 units in our operating partnership (with the cash,
assumed debt and units having an aggregate value of $1,097.7 million based on the IPO price per share of $12.00).



We accounted for the ownership interests contributed to us by GI Partners in exchange for a partnership
interest in our operating partnership as a reorganization of entities under common control in a manner similar to a pooling of interests. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities contributed by GI Partners are accounted for by our operating
partnership at GI Partners’ historical cost. We utilized purchase accounting to account for the acquisition of ownership interests in 200 Paul Avenue 1-4 and 1100 Space Park Drive, which were contributed to us by third parties in exchange for
interests in our operating partnership, cash and the assumption of debt and the 10% minority ownership interest in 2323 Bryan Street, which was contributed to us by our joint venture partner in exchange for an interest in our operating partnership
and the repayment of debt. Accordingly, the purchase price for these interests, which are equal to the value of the operating partnership units that we issued in exchange for these interests plus cash paid and debt assumed, were allocated to the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the fair value of the assets and liabilities.

Factors Which May Influence Future Results of Operations

Rental income

. The amount of net rental income generated by the properties in our portfolio depends principally on our ability
to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease currently available space and space available from lease terminations. Excluding 1.6 million square feet held for redevelopment, as of December 31, 2006, the occupancy
rate in the properties in our portfolio was approximately 95.0% of our net rentable square feet.

The amount of rental income generated by
us also depends on our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our properties. Included in our approximately 9.4 million square feet of net rentable square feet excluding redevelopment space at December 31, 2006 is approximately
850,000 net rentable square feet of space with extensive datacenter improvements that is currently, or will shortly be, available for lease. We had leased approximately 681,000 square feet of similar space at December 31, 2006. Rather than
leasing all of this space to large single tenants, we are subdividing some of it for multi-tenant turn-key datacenter use, with tenants averaging between 100 and 15,000 square feet of net rentable space. Multi-tenant turn-key datacenters are
effective solutions for tenants who lack the expertise or capital budget to provide their own extensive datacenter infrastructure and security. As experts in datacenter construction and operations we are able to lease space to these tenants at a
significant premium over other uses. Negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our rental income in future periods.

In addition, as of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 1.6 million square feet of redevelopment space, or approximately 14.5% of the total space in our portfolio, including four vacant properties comprising approximately
501,000 square feet. Redevelopment space requires significant capital investment in order to develop datacenter facilities that are ready for use, and in addition, we may require additional time or encounter delays in securing tenants for
redevelopment space. We intend to purchase additional vacant properties and properties with vacant redevelopment space in the future.

Future economic downturns or regional downturns affecting our submarkets or downturns in the technology-related real estate industry that impair our ability to renew or re-lease space and the ability of our tenants to fulfill their lease
commitments, as in the case of tenant bankruptcies, could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our properties. As of December 31, 2006, we had no material tenants in bankruptcy.

Scheduled lease expirations.

Our ability to re-lease expiring space will impact our results of operations. In addition to approximately
0.5 million square feet of available space in our portfolio, excluding approximately 1.6 million square feet available for redevelopment as of December 31, 2006, leases representing approximately 2.0% and 4.5% of the square footage of
our portfolio, excluding redevelopment space, and approximately 4.2% and 7.1% of our gross annualized rents, are scheduled to expire during the years ending December 31, 2007 and 2008, respectively.



Market concentration.

We depend on the market for technology based real estate in specific
geographic regions and significant changes in these regional markets can impact our future results. As of December 31, 2006 our portfolio was geographically concentrated in the following metropolitan markets:

(1)

Gross annualized rent is monthly contractual rent under existing leases as of December 31, 2006 multiplied by 12.

Operating expenses.

Our operating expenses generally consist of utilities, property and ad valorem taxes, property management fees, insurance and
site maintenance costs, as well as rental expense. We are also incurring general and administrative expenses, including expenses relating to the internalization of our asset management function, as well as significant legal, accounting and other
expenses related to corporate governance, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reporting and compliance with the various provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Increases or decreases in such operating expenses will impact our overall performance.
We expect to incur additional operating expenses as we expand our various business functions.

Interest Rates

. As of
December 31, 2006, we had approximately $435.1 million of variable rate debt, of which approximately $289.6 million was mortgage debt subject to interest rate swap agreements, and $145.5 million was outstanding on our line of credit facility.
Since 2002, the United States Federal Reserve has generally been increasing short term interest rates, which has recently had a significant upward impact on shorter-term interest rates, including the interest rates that our variable rate debt is
based upon. Continued increases in interest rates may increase our interest expense and therefore negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. Increased interest rates may also increase the risk that the counterparties to our
swap agreements will default on their obligations, which would further increase our interest expense.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated and combined financial statements, which have
been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses in the reporting period. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in
Note 2 to our financial statements included elsewhere in this report. We describe below those accounting policies that require material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on our financial condition and results
of operations. Our management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis, based upon information currently available and on various assumptions management believes are reasonable as of the date on the front cover of this report.



Investments in Real Estate

Acquisition of real estate.

The price that we pay to acquire a property is impacted by many factors including the condition of the property and
improvements, the occupancy of the building, the existence of above and below market tenant leases, the creditworthiness of the tenants, favorable or unfavorable financing, above or below market ground leases and numerous other factors. Accordingly,
we are required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate among the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our estimate of the fair values of such assets and liabilities. This
includes determining the value of the property and improvements, land, any ground leases, tenant improvements, in-place tenant leases, tenant relationships, the value (or negative value) of above (or below) market leases and any debt assumed from
the seller or loans made by the seller to us. Each of these estimates requires a great deal of judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations. Our allocation methodology is summarized in Note 2 to our consolidated financial
statements. These allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations. For example, if we were to allocate more value to land, there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount. If we were to allocate more value to the
property as opposed to allocating to the value of tenant leases, this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time. This potential effect occurs because the amounts allocated to property are depreciated over the
estimated lives of the property whereas amounts allocated to tenant leases are amortized over the terms of the leases. Additionally, the amortization of value (or negative value) assigned to above (or below) market rate leases is recorded as an
adjustment to rental revenue as compared to amortization of the value of in-place leases and tenant relationships, which is included in depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statements of operations.

Useful lives of assets.

We are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the
amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate. These assessments have a direct impact on our net income because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate we
would depreciate such investments over fewer years, resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis.

Asset impairment evaluation.

We review the carrying value of our properties when circumstances, such as adverse market conditions, indicate potential impairment may exist. We base our review on an estimate of the future cash flows
(excluding interest charges) expected to result from the real estate investment’s use and eventual disposition. We consider factors such as future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and
other factors. If our evaluation indicates that we may be unable to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. These
losses have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding
future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. Since cash flows on properties considered to be long-lived assets to be held and used are considered on an undiscounted basis
to determine whether an asset has been impaired, our strategy of holding properties over the long-term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss. If our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale
date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. If we determine that impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value. No such impairment losses have been recognized to date.

We estimate the fair value of rental properties utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis that includes projections of future revenues, expenses and
capital improvement costs, similar to the income approach that is commonly utilized by appraisers.

Capitalization of costs.

We capitalize pre-acquisition costs related to probable property acquisitions. We also capitalize direct and indirect costs related to
construction and development, including property and ad valorem taxes, insurance and



financing costs relating to space under development. Costs previously capitalized related to any property acquisitions no longer considered probable are
written off, which may have a material effect on our net income. The selection of costs to capitalize and which acquisitions are probable is subjective and depends on many assumptions including the timing of potential acquisitions and the
probability that future acquisitions occur. If we made different assumptions in this respect we would have a different amount of capitalized costs in the periods presented leading to different net income.

Revenue Recognition

Rental income is
recognized using the straight-line method over the terms of the tenant leases. Deferred rents included in our balance sheets represent the aggregate excess of rental revenue recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual rental payments
that would be recognized under the remaining terms of the leases. Our leases generally contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse us for a portion of property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred by us. Such reimbursements are
recognized in the period that the expenses are incurred. Lease termination fees are recognized over the remaining term of the lease, effective as of the date the lease modification is finalized, assuming collection is not considered doubtful. As
discussed above, we recognize amortization of the value of acquired above or below market tenant leases as a reduction of rental income in the case of above market leases or an increase to rental revenue in the case of below market leases.

We must make subjective estimates as to when our revenue is earned and the collectibility of our accounts receivable related to minimum
rent, deferred rent, expense reimbursements, lease termination fees and other income. We specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts, tenant concentrations, tenant creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating
the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts. These estimates have a direct impact on our net income because a higher bad debt allowance would result in lower net income, and recognizing rental revenue as earned in one period versus another would
result in higher or lower net income for a particular period.

Share-based awards

We recognize compensation expense related to share-based awards. We generally amortize this compensation expense over the vesting period of the award. The
calculation of the fair value of share-based awards is subjective and requires several assumptions over such items as expected stock volatility, dividend payments and future company results. These assumptions have a direct impact on our net income
because a higher share-based awards amount would result in lower net income for a particular period.

Results of Operations

The discussion below relates to our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. We have
combined the results of operations for the period from November 3, 2004 through December 31, 2004 and the period from January 1, 2004 through November 2, 2004 to provide a meaningful comparison to the results of operations for
the other years. A summary of our results for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was as follows (in thousands).



Our property portfolio has experienced consistent and significant growth since the first property
acquisition in January 2002. As a result of such growth, a period-to-period comparison of our financial performance focuses on the impact on our revenues and expenses resulting both from the new property additions to our portfolio, as well as on a
“same store” property basis (same store properties are properties that were owned and operated for the entire current year and the entire immediate preceding year). The following table identifies each of the properties in our portfolio
acquired from January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2006.



(1)

Redevelopment space requires significant capital investment in order to develop datacenter facilities that are ready for use. Most often this is shell space. However, in
certain circumstances this may include partially built datacenter space that was not completed by previous ownership and requires a large capital investment in order to build out the space.

(2)

Occupancy rates exclude redevelopment space.

Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2006 to the Year Ended December 31, 2005 and comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2005 to the Year Ended December 31, 2004

Portfolio

As of December 31,
2006, our portfolio consisted of 59 properties, excluding one property held as an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture, with an aggregate of 9.4 million net rentable square feet excluding 1.6 million square feet held for
redevelopment compared to a portfolio consisting of 44 properties with an aggregate of 8.1 million net rentable square feet excluding space held for redevelopment as of December 31, 2005 compared to a portfolio consisting of 24 properties
with an aggregate of 5.4 million net rentable square feet excluding space held for redevelopment as of December 31, 2004. The increase in our portfolio reflects the acquisition of 11 properties in 2004, 20 properties in 2005 and 16
properties in 2006, net of one property sold during 2006.

Revenues

Total operating revenues from continuing operations were as follows (in thousands):

As shown by the same store and new properties table shown below, the increases in rental revenues
and tenant reimbursement revenues in the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005 were primarily due to our acquisitions of properties leading to a larger portfolio size. These factors also caused the increases in rental revenues and
tenant reimbursements in the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Other revenues changes in the years presented were primarily due to varying tenant termination revenues. We acquired 16, 20 and 11 properties during the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Included in the 2006 rental revenues is $0.8 million of straight-line rent adjustment attributable to prior years. This $0.8 million out-of-period adjustment is considered by management to be
immaterial to each of the years in which it accumulated.

The following table shows total operating revenues from continuing operations for
same store properties and new properties (in thousands).



Same store rental revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same
period in 2005 primarily as a result of new leases at our properties during 2006, the largest of which was for space in 200 Paul Avenue 1-4, 300 Boulevard East and 1100 Space Park Drive. Same store tenant reimbursement revenues increased for the
year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 primarily as a result of higher utility and operating expenses being billed to our tenants, the largest occurrences of which were at 200 Paul Avenue 1-4, 2323 Bryan Street and
1100 Space Park Drive. The decrease in same store other revenues was due to termination fee revenues recognized for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily for a tenant located at 600 West Seventh Street, while the decrease in new
properties other revenues was due to termination fee revenues recognized for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily for a tenant located at 833 Chestnut Street.

New property increases were caused by properties acquired during the period from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2006, 350 East Cermak Road, Savvis portfolio
(comprising five properties acquired in June 2005), 12001 North Freeway and 120 E. Van Buren Street contributed $36.7 million, or approximately 54% of the total new properties increase in total operating revenues compared to the same period in 2005.

Same store tenant reimbursement revenues increased in the year ended December 31, 2005
compared to 2004 primarily as a result of increased operating expenses leading to higher tenant reimbursement income and favorable outcomes of tenant reimbursement billings in 2005.

Expenses

Total expenses from
continuing operations were as follows (in thousands):



As shown in the same store expense and new properties table below, total expenses in the year ended
December 31, 2006 increased compared to 2005 primarily as a result of higher operating expenses following acquisition of properties. The following table shows expenses from continuing operations for same store properties and new properties (in
thousands).

(1)

General and administrative expenses are included in same store as they are not allocable to specific properties.

New property increases were caused by properties acquired during the period from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2006. For the year ended
December 31, 2006, 350 East Cermak Road, 600-780 S. Federal Street, 12001 North Freeway and 120 E. Van Buren Street contributed $29.0 million, or approximately 47% in total expenses compared to the same period in 2005.

Same store rental property operating and maintenance expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005
primarily as a result of higher utility rates in several of our properties leading to higher utility expense in 2006. Rental property operating and maintenance expenses included amounts paid to related parties, CB Richard Ellis and The Linc Group,
for property management and other fees of $2.6 million and $1.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. CB Richard Ellis and The Linc Group are related parties of GI Partners. We capitalized amounts relating to
compensation expense of employees directly engaged in construction and successful leasing activities of $2.4 million and $0.4 million in the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Same store depreciation and amortization expense increased in the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005, principally because of the
acceleration of depreciation on assets associated with leases by VarTec, a former tenant, which was in bankruptcy.

General and
administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased compared to the same period in 2005 primarily due to the growth of our company, which resulted in more employees, incentive compensation, and higher insurance, legal and
consulting costs. Included in the 2006 general and administrative expenses is a writeoff of approximately $0.5 million of pre-acquisition costs related to a previously targeted acquisition in Germany.

Other expenses are primarily comprised of write-offs of the carrying amounts for deferred tenant improvements, acquired in place lease value and acquired
above market lease values as a result of the early termination of tenant leases. Other expenses decreased for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 primarily due to the write off of assets following the
termination of a tenant in 2005.



Same store interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the same
period in 2005 primarily as a result of higher average outstanding debt balances during 2006 compared to 2005 related to refinancings on 200 Paul Avenue 1-4, 600 West Seventh Street, 34551 Ardenwood Boulevard 1-4 and 2334 Lundy Place partially
offset by lower average outstanding balances during 2006 compared to 2005 for 47700 Kato Road and 1055 Page Avenue. Interest incurred on our unsecured credit facility and senior exchangeable debentures is allocated entirely to new properties in the
table above. Interest capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $3.9 million and $0.3 million.

(1)

General and administrative expenses and asset management fees to related party are included in same store as they are not allocable to specific properties.

Same store rental property and maintenance expenses increased in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily as a result of utility rate increases in the Dallas
region.

Property taxes increases in the years presented were primarily a result of new properties acquired in later years leading to a
larger expense. Same store property taxes decreased in the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to a favorable outcome of appealing a property tax amount at 4055 Valley View Lane.

Insurance expense increases in the years presented was primarily a result of new properties acquired in later years leading to a larger expense. Same
store insurance decreased in the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004 primarily as a result of more favorable insurance rates on our properties following a more established insurance history and claim pattern of properties under our
ownership.

Depreciation and amortization expense increases were primarily due to our acquisitions of properties leading to a higher
portfolio size in later years.

The changes in general and administrative expenses for the years presented was caused by higher expenses in
2005 offset by $17.9 million of compensation expense recorded upon completion of our IPO related to fully vested long-term incentive units granted in connection with the IPO in 2004. As a public company, we are incurring significant legal,
accounting and other costs related to corporate governance, Securities and Exchange Commission reporting and other public company overhead. We incurred higher general and administrative expenses as we internalized our accounting functions in 2005,
partially related to increased staff necessary to manage the growth of operations. In addition we incurred expenses related to compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act. Prior to the completion of our IPO, general and administrative
expenses were incurred by our Predecessor’s related party asset manager and our Predecessor incurred an asset management fee, which is included separately in the combined statement of operations.



For the year ended December 31, 2004, the monthly asset management fee to a related party was based
on a fixed percentage of capital commitments by the investors in GI Partners, a portion of which was allocated to the Company Predecessor. Effective as of the completion of our IPO, no such fees are allocated to us.

Other expenses are primarily comprised of write-offs of the carrying amounts for deferred tenant improvements, acquired in place lease value and acquired
above market lease values as a result of the early termination of tenant leases. Other expenses during the years presented varied as a result of the level of terminations and the carrying values of the assets associated with the leases that
terminated early. Same store other expenses decreased in the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004 primarily as a result of reduced write off or assets following tenant terminations.

Interest expense increases were associated with new mortgage and other secured debt incurred primarily in connection with the properties added to our
portfolio. The increase in interest related to property acquisitions in all years presented was partially offset by a reduction in interest related to loans repaid or refinanced. Same store interest expense increased in 2005 compared to 2004
primarily because the interest rates obtained on interest rate swaps upon completion of our IPO in November 2004 were higher than interest rates prevailing throughout 2004. This effect was partially offset by the repayment of $22.0 million of a
mezzanine loan in November 2005.

Net loss from early extinguishment of debt related to prepayment costs and the write offs of unamortized
deferred financing costs when we prepaid loans. The net loss from early extinguishment of debt increased in the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004 as a result of higher loan prepayments.

Discontinued operations

Discontinued
operations relate to 7979 East Tufts Avenue, a property acquired in October 2003 which we classified as held for sale in June 2006 and sold on July 12, 2006. Results of discontinued operations were as follows (in thousands):

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Analysis of Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2006, we had $22.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, excluding $28.1 million of restricted cash. Restricted cash primarily consists of interest bearing cash deposits required by the terms of several of our
mortgage loans for a variety of purposes, including real estate taxes, insurance, anticipated or contractually obligated tenant improvements and leasing deposits.

Our short term liquidity requirements primarily consist of operating expenses and other expenditures associated with our properties, dividend payments on our preferred stock, dividend payments to our stockholders and
distributions to our unitholders in the Operating Partnership required to maintain our REIT status, capital expenditures, debt service on our loans and, potentially, acquisitions. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through net
cash provided by operations, restricted cash accounts established for certain future payments and by drawing upon our unsecured credit facility.

As of December 31, 2006, our Operating Partnership had a $500 million unsecured credit facility. Borrowings under this credit facility currently bear interest at a rate based on LIBOR and EURIBOR plus a



margin ranging from 1.250% to 1.625%, depending on our Operating Partnership’s overall leverage, which margin was 1.50% as of December 31, 2006.
The unsecured credit facility matures in October 2008, subject to a one-year extension option that we may exercise if certain conditions are met. The unsecured credit facility has a $150.0 million sub-facility for foreign exchange advances in Euros
and British Sterling. We intend to use available borrowings under the unsecured credit facility to, among other things, finance the acquisition of additional properties, to fund tenant improvements and capital expenditures, fund redevelopment
activities and to provide for working capital and other corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2006, we had outstanding $145.5 million under the credit facility and the amount available for use was $148.0 million.

Financing transactions in 2006

On
December 20, 2006, we closed on the acquisition of Unit 9, Blanchardstown Corporate Park in Dublin, Ireland for approximately €36.5 million ($47.9 million based on the rate of exchange on December 20, 2006). Simultaneously,
we closed on a €28.2 million ($37.1 million based on the rate of exchange on December 20, 2006) loan with 1.5% amortization per annum at a swapped fixed interest rate of 5.350% which matures on January 18, 2012.

On December 5, 2006, we closed on the acquisition of 114 Rue Ambroise Croizat in Paris, France for approximately €40.4 million ($53.8
million based on the rate of exchange on December 5, 2006). Simultaneously, we closed on a €32.8 million ($43.7 million based on the rate of exchange on December 5, 2006) loan with 1.5% amortization per annum at a swapped
fixed interest rate of 5.126% which matures on January 18, 2012.

On October 24, 2006, we completed the financing of 1100 Space
Park Drive in Santa Clara, California. The new $55.0 million loan has an interest rate of 5.886%, no principal amortization for three years, and the maturity date is December 11, 2016. The proceeds from the financing were used to
reduce the balance of our unsecured credit facility.

On October 4, 2006 we issued 9.2 million common shares for net proceeds of
$267.7 million after offering costs. We used proceeds from this issuance to pay $133.8 million for the redemption of 4.6 million common Operating Partnership units tendered by GI Partners, with the remainder used to temporarily reduce the
balance of our unsecured credit facility.

On September 8, 2006, we re-financed the mortgage related to the Global Marsh properties
(34551 Ardenwood Boulevard 1-4, 2334 Lundy Place, and 2440 Marsh Lane) and put in place two separate mortgages. 34551 Ardenwood Boulevard 1-4 was refinanced with a $55.0 million loan at an interest rate of 5.950% and a maturity date of
November 11, 2016. 2334 Lundy Place was refinanced with a $40.0 million loan at an interest rate of 5.955% and a maturity date of November 11, 2016. 2440 Marsh Lane has been placed in our redevelopment asset pool. The excess
proceeds from the re-financings were used to reduce the balance on our unsecured credit facility.

On August 15, 2006, our Operating
Partnership issued $172.5 million of its 4.125% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due August 15, 2026. The Debentures are general unsecured senior obligations of the Operating Partnership and rank equally in right of payment with all other senior
unsecured indebtedness of the Operating Partnership. Interest is payable on August 15 and February 15 of each year beginning February 15, 2007 until the maturity date of August 15, 2026. The Debentures bear interest at
4.125% per annum and contain an exchange settlement feature, which provides that the Debentures may, under certain circumstances, be exchangeable for cash (up to the principal amount of the Debentures) and, with respect to any excess exchange
value, into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock at an initial exchange rate of approximately 30.68 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Debentures. The $166.3 million in net proceeds from the
sale of the Debentures were used to reduce the balance on our unsecured credit facility.

On July 27, 2006, we closed on the
acquisition of Gyroscoopweg 2E-2F in Amsterdam, Netherlands for approximately €8.9 million ($11.3 million based on the rate of exchange on July 27, 2006). Simultaneously, we



closed a €7.1 million ($9.0 million based on the rate of exchange on July 27, 2006) with 1.5% amortization per annum at a swapped fixed rate
of 5.49% which matures on October 18, 2013.

On June 23, 2006, we completed the financing of Chemin de l’Epingler 2 in Geneva,
Switzerland. The €8.1 million ($10.1 million based on the rate of exchange on June 23, 2006) loan with 1.5% amortization per annum has a swapped fixed interest rate of 5.57% and matures on July 18, 2013. Proceeds from
the financing were used to reduce the balance on our unsecured credit facility.

On May 17, 2006, we completed the financing of Paul
van Vlissingenstraat 16 in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The €11.2 million ($14.3 million based on the rate of exchange on May 17, 2006) loan with 1.5% amortization per annum has a swapped fixed interest rate of 5.58% and matures on
July 18, 2013. Proceeds from the financing were used to reduce the balance on our unsecured credit facility.

On May 30,
2006, we issued 4.0 million shares of common stock at a price of $24.40, which resulted in net proceeds of approximately $94.5 million after offering costs which were used to temporarily reduce the balance on our unsecured credit facility.

On April 20, 2006, we re-financed the mortgage related to 6 Braham Street in London, England, which resulted in a new loan for
£13.2 million ($23.0 million based on the rate of exchange on April 20, 2006) at a variable interest rate of UK LIBOR plus 0.90% which matures in April 2011. In April 2006, we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement to
hedge variability in cash flows related to this loan. The swapped fixed interest rate of 5.84% is effective from July 10, 2006 through April 10, 2011.

On March 3, 2006, we re-financed the mortgage related to 600 West Seventh Street in Los Angeles, California. The new $60.0 million loan has an interest rate of 5.80% and a maturity date of March 15,
2016. Excess proceeds from the re-financing were used to reduce the balance on our unsecured credit facility.

On February 28, 2006, we
prepaid the outstanding balance of $17.5 million on our 47700 Kato Road & 1055 Page Avenue property mortgage. No prepayment fees were incurred as a result of this prepayment.

During the year ended December 31, 2006 we acquired the following properties:

(1)

The purchase includes a fee-simple ownership of 1807 Michael Faraday Court in Reston, Virginia and two leasehold interests at 111 Eight Avenue in New York City and 8100 Boone
Boulevard in Vienna, Virginia.



(2)

Excludes investment in property in Seattle, Washington, in which we acquired a 49% interest in November 2006 for approximately $30.5 million.

We financed the purchase of these properties through the sale of common stock in May 2006 and October 2006, the issuance of $172.5 million of senior
exchangeable debentures in August 2006, borrowings under our line of credit facility as well as secured mortgage financings.

Future
uses of cash

Our properties require periodic investments of capital for tenant-related capital expenditures and for general capital
improvements. As of December 31, 2006, we had commitments under leases in effect for $13.0 million of tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions all of which we expect to incur in the near future.

As of December 31, 2006, we have identified from our existing properties approximately 1.6 million square feet of redevelopment space and we
also owned approximately 850,000 net rentable square feet of datacenter space with extensive installed tenant improvements that we may subdivide for multi-tenant turn-key datacenter use during the next two years rather than lease such space to large
single tenants. Turn-Key Datacenter space is move-in-ready space for the placement of computer and network equipment required to provide a datacenter environment. Depending on demand for additional turn-key data space, we may incur significant
tenant improvement costs to build out and redevelop these spaces for which we would we need to raise significant additional capital.

Subsequent to December 31, 2006 we acquired the following properties:

We are also subject to the commitments discussed below under “Commitments and
Contingencies” and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, and Distributions as described below.

We expect to meet our long-term liquidity
requirements to pay for scheduled debt maturities and to fund property acquisitions and non-recurring capital improvements with net cash from operations, future long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness and the issuance of equity and debt
securities. We also may fund future property acquisitions and non-recurring capital improvements using our unsecured credit facility pending permanent financing.

Distributions

We are required to distribute 90% of our REIT taxable income (excluding capital gains)
on an annual basis in order to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, we intend to make, but are not contractually bound to make, regular quarterly distributions to preferred stockholders, common stockholders and
unit holders from cash flow from operating activities. All such distributions are at the discretion of our board of directors. We may be required to use borrowings under the credit facility, if necessary, to meet REIT distribution requirements and
maintain our REIT status. We consider market factors and our performance in addition to REIT requirements in determining distribution levels. Amounts accumulated for distribution to stockholders are invested primarily in interest-bearing accounts
and short-term interest-bearing securities, which are consistent with our intention to maintain our status as a REIT. The exchange rate on our $172.5 million



principal amount of exchangeable debentures is subject to adjustment for certain events, including, but not limited to, certain dividends on our common stock
in excess of $0.265 per share per quarter. Therefore, increases to our quarterly dividend may increase the dilutive impact of the exchangeable debentures on our common stockholders. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors “Risks Related to Our
Business and Operations—The exchange and repurchase rights of our exchangeable debentures may be detrimental to holders of common stock.”

In 2006, 2005 and 2004, we have declared the following dividends:



Total dividends and distributions declared through December 31, 2006:

The tax treatment of dividends on common stock paid in 2006 is estimated as follows: approximately
74% ordinary income and 26% return of capital. The tax treatment of dividends on common stock paid in 2005 is as follows: approximately 87% ordinary income and 13% return of capital. All dividends paid on our preferred stock in 2006 and 2005 were
classified as ordinary income for income tax purposes.

Contractual Commitments

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006, including the maturities and scheduled principal on our secured
debt and unsecured credit facility debt, and provides information about the commitments due in connection with our ground leases, tenant improvement and leasing commissions (in thousands):

This is comprised of ground lease payments on 2010 East Centennial Circle, Chemin de l’Epinglier 2, Clonshaugh Industrial Estate, Paul van Vlissingenstraat 16 and Gyroscoopweg
2E-2F. After February 2036, rent for the remaining term of the 2010 East Centennial Circle ground lease will be determined based on a fair market value appraisal of the asset and, as a result, is excluded from the above information. The Chemin de
l’Epinglier 2 ground lease which expires in July 2074 contains potential inflation increases which are not reflected in the table above. The Paul van Vlissingenstraat, 16 Chemin de l’Epinglier 2, Gyroscoopweg 2E-2F and Clonshaugh
Industrial Estate amounts are translated at the December 31, 2006 exchange rate of $1.32 per € 1.00.



We have agreed with the seller of the 350 East Cermak Road to share a portion, not to exceed $135,000 per
month, of rental revenue, adjusted for our costs to lease the premises, from the lease of the 263,000 square feet of space held for redevelopment. This revenue sharing agreement will terminate in May 2013. We have no liability for this contingent
liability on our balance sheet at December 31, 2006.

As of December 31, 2006, we were a party to interest rate swap agreements
which hedge variability in cash flows related to LIBOR, GBP LIBOR and EURIBOR based mortgage loans. Under these swaps, we pay or receive cash net settlements from our swap counterparties based on the notional amounts of our swap agreements and the
difference between the fixed swap rate and the underlying benchmark interest rate on our variable rate debt which effectively converts the hedged variable rate debt to a fixed rate over the term of the interest rate swap agreements. See Item 7A
“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.”

Outstanding Consolidated Indebtedness

The table below summarizes our debt, at December 31, 2006 (in millions):

As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately $1.1 billion of outstanding consolidated
long-term debt as set forth in the table above. Our ratio of debt to total market capitalization was approximately 31% (based on the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2006 of $34.23). The variable rate debt shown above bears
interest at interest rates based on various LIBOR, GBP LIBOR and EURIBOR rates ranging from one to twelve months, depending on the respective agreement governing the debt. Assuming maturity of our exchangeable senior debentures at their first
redemption date in August 2011, as of December 31, 2006, our debt had a weighted average term to initial maturity of approximately 5.8 years (approximately 6.1 years assuming exercise of extension options).

Unsecured Credit Facility.

As of December 31, 2006, we had an unsecured credit facility (credit facility) under which we can borrow up to
$500.0 million. Borrowings under the credit facility currently bear interest at a rate of based on LIBOR and EURIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.250% to 1.625%, depending on our Operating Partnership’s overall leverage. This margin was 1.50%
as of December 31, 2006, resulting in an interest rate at this date of 6.82% on U.S. borrowings and 5.13% on Euro borrowings. The credit facility matures in October 2008, subject to a one-year extension option, which we may exercise if certain
conditions are met. The credit facility has a $150.0 million sub-facility for foreign exchange advances in Euros and British Sterling. As of December 31, 2006 we had outstanding $145.5 million under the credit facility and $148.0 million was
available for use.



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of December 31, 2006, we were a party to interest rate cap agreements in connection with debt and interest rate swap agreements related to $289.6 million of outstanding principal on our variable rate debt. See
Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.”

The exchangeable senior debentures provide for excess
exchange value to be paid in shares of our common stock if our stock price exceeds a certain amount. See note 6 to our financial statements for a further description of our senior exchangeable debentures.

Cash Flows

The following summary discussion of our
cash flows is based on the consolidated and combined statements of cash flows in Item 8—“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the
periods presented below.

Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2006 to Year Ended December 31, 2005 and Comparison of Year
Ended December 31, 2005 to Year Ended December 31, 2004

The following table shows cash flows and ending cash and cash
equivalent balances for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Cash flows include the cash flows of 7979 East Tufts Avenue, a property which we classified as held for sale in June 2006 and sold on July 12, 2006 (in
thousands).

The increases in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to revenues from the
properties added to our portfolio which was partially offset by increased operating and interest expenses. We acquired 16, 20 and 11 properties during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 respectively.

Net cash used in investing activities increased primarily as a result of new properties acquired during the year and higher capital improvements being
added to our redevelopment projects.

Net cash flows from financing activities consisted of the following amounts (in thousands).

Proceeds from issuance of stock were primarily related to our common stock offering in October
2006, May 2006 and July 2005 along with our initial public offering in 2004 and preferred stock offerings in February 2005



and July 2005. We obtained mortgage loans for approximately $347.3 million, $181.0 million and $267.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively. We issued $172.5 million of Senior Exchangeable Debentures on August 15, 2006.

Minority interest

Minority interests relate to the interests in the Operating Partnership that are not owned by us, which, as of December 31, 2006, amounted to 20.1%
of the Operating Partnership common units. In conjunction with our formation, GI Partners received common units, in exchange for contributing ownership interests in properties to the Operating Partnership. Also in connection with acquiring real
estate interests owned by third parties, the Operating Partnership issued common units to those sellers.

Limited partners who acquired
common units in the formation transactions have the right to require the Operating Partnership to redeem part or all of their common units for cash based upon the fair market value of an equivalent number of shares of our common stock at the time of
the redemption. Alternatively, we may elect to acquire those common units in exchange for shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits, stock dividends, issuance of stock rights, specified
extraordinary distributions and similar events. Pursuant to registration rights agreements we entered into with GI Partners and the other third party contributors, we filed a shelf registration statement covering the issuance of the shares of our
common stock issuable upon redemption of the common units, and the resale of those shares of common stock by the holders. GI Partners distributed approximately 4.0 million Operating Partnership common units to its owners and these units were
redeemed for shares of our common stock and sold to third parties in an underwritten public offering, which closed on April 3, 2006. On October 4, 2006 we issued 9.2 million common shares for net proceeds of $267.7 million after
offering costs. We used approximately $133.8 million of the proceeds to pay GI Partners for the redemption of 4.6 million common Operating Partnership units. On December 1, 2006, GI Partners redeemed 3.3 million Operating Partnership
common units for shares of common stock, which were sold to third parties in an underwritten public offering.

During the year ended
December 31, 2006, third parties redeemed 775,665 Operating Partnership units in exchange for shares of our common stock. These redemptions by GI Partners and the third parties were each recorded as a reduction to minority interest and an
increase to common stock and additional paid in capital based on the book value per unit in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet. We did not receive any cash proceeds upon redemption of any of these Operating Partnership units.

Inflation

Substantially all of our
leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations. In addition, many of the leases provide for fixed base rent increases. We believe that inflationary increases may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent
increases and expense escalations described above.

New Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

(FIN
48). FIN 48 prescribes a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This Interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax
assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, accounting for income taxes in interim periods, and income tax disclosures. This
Interpretation is effective as of January 1, 2007 and the cumulative effects of applying this Interpretation will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2007. Additional guidance from the FASB on FIN 48 is
pending. As a result, we are currently unable to finalize our estimate of the impact that adopting this Interpretation will have on our consolidated financial statements.



In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(SFAS 157). SFAS 157
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement does not require any new fair value measurements;
however, the standard will impact how other fair value based GAAP is applied. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years with early
adoption encouraged. We are currently assessing the impact this statement will have on our consolidated financial statements.

ITEM

7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our future income, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments depend upon prevalent market interest rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest
rates. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors.

Analysis of debt between fixed and variable rate.

We use interest rate swap agreements and fixed rate debt to reduce our exposure to interest rate movements. As of December 31, 2006, our consolidated debt was as follows (in millions):

Interest rate swaps included in this table and their fair values as of December 31, 2006 were
as follows (in thousands):



(1)

Translation to US amounts is based on exchange rate of $1.96 to £1.00 as of December 31, 2006.

(2)

Translation to US amounts is based on exchange rate of $1.32 to €1.00 as of December 31, 2006.

Sensitivity to changes in interest rates.

The following table shows the effect if assumed changes in interest rates occurred:

Interest risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on
our financial instruments. These analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur in that environment. Further, in the event of a change of that magnitude, we may take actions to further mitigate our
exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure.

Foreign currency forward exchange risk

As of December 31, 2006, we have foreign operations in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, France, Ireland, Canada and The Netherlands and, as such, are subject to risk from the effects of exchange rate movements of foreign currencies,
which may affect future costs and cash flows. Our foreign operations are conducted in the Euro, Swiss Francs and the British Pound, except for our Canadian property for which the functional currency is the U.S. dollar. For these currencies we are a
net receiver of the foreign currency (we receive more cash then we pay out) and therefore our foreign investments benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currency. For the year
ended December 31, 2006, operating revenues from properties outside the United States contributed $13.2 million which represented 4.7% of our operating revenues.

As of December 31, 2006, we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, however, $34.5 million of
borrowings under our line of credit are foreign currency denominated borrowings. Prior to January 2006, we were party to a foreign currency forward sale contract with a notional value of approximately £7.9 million. We terminated this contract
in January 2006 and received cash of approximately $0.7 million.



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

INDEX TO THE CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The management of Digital Realty Trust,
Inc. (the Company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such item is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f). Our internal control system was designed to provide
reasonable assurance to the company’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation and presentation.

Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial and Investment Officer, we assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control—Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment we believe that, as of December 31, 2006, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based
on those criteria.

Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on our assessment of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting. This report appears on page 58.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and
Stockholders

Digital Realty Trust, Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (the Company) maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Digital Realty Trust, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO. Also, in our opinion, Digital Realty Trust, Inc. maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets
of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss) for each of the years in the two-year period ended
December 31, 2006 and for the period from November 3, 2004 (commencement of operations) through December 31, 2004, the related combined statements of operations, owners’ equity and comprehensive income of Digital Realty Trust,
Inc. Predecessor, as defined in note 1 to the financial statements, for the period from January 1, 2004 through November 2, 2004, the related consolidated statement of cash flows of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. and subsidiaries for each of
the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2006 and the related consolidated and combined statement of cash flows of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. and subsidiaries and Digital Realty Trust, Inc. Predecessor for the year ended
December 31, 2004, and the related financial statement schedule III, and our report dated February 28, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated and combined financial statements, and the related financial statement
schedule III.

Digital Realty Trust, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss) for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2006 and for the period from November 3, 2004 (commencement of operations) through December 31, 2004, the
related combined statements of operations, owners’ equity and comprehensive income of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. Predecessor, as defined in note 1 to the financial statements, for the period from January 1, 2004 through November 2,
2004, the related consolidated statement of cash flows of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. and subsidiaries for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2006 and the related consolidated and combined statement of cash flows of
Digital Realty Trust, Inc. and subsidiaries and Digital Realty Trust, Inc. Predecessor for the year ended December 31, 2004. In connection with our audits of the consolidated and combined financial statements, we also have audited financial
statement schedule III, properties and accumulated depreciation. These consolidated and combined financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated and combined financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our
audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and
2005, the consolidated results of operations for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2006 and for the period from November 3, 2004 (commencement of operations) through December 31, 2004, the combined results of
operations of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. Predecessor for the period from January 1, 2004 through November 2, 2004, the consolidated cash flows of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. and subsidiaries for each of the years in the two-year period

accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule III, properties and accumulated depreciation, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated and combined financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated

Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 28, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal
control over financial reporting.

1. Organization and Description of Business

Digital Realty Trust, Inc. through its controlling interest in Digital Realty
Trust, L.P. (the Operating Partnership) and the subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership (collectively, “we” or the Company) is engaged in the business of owning, acquiring, repositioning and managing technology-related real estate. As of
December 31, 2006, our portfolio consists of 59 properties, excluding one property held as an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture; 52 are located throughout North America and seven are located in Europe. Our properties are diversified
in major markets where corporate enterprise datacenter and technology tenants are concentrated, including the Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Silicon Valley metropolitan areas. The portfolio consists of Internet
gateway properties, datacenter properties, technology manufacturing properties and regional or national headquarters of technology companies.

We completed our initial public offering (IPO) on November 3, 2004 and commenced operations on that date. The Operating Partnership was formed on July 21, 2004 in anticipation of our IPO. As of December 31, 2006, we own a
79.9% common interest and a 100% preferred interest in the Operating Partnership. As general partner, we have control over the Operating Partnership. The limited partners of the Operating Partnership do not have rights to replace us as the general
partner nor do they have participating rights, although they do have certain protective rights.

The IPO resulted in the sale of 20,000,000
shares of common stock at a price per share of $12.00, generating gross proceeds to us of $240.0 million. Our aggregate proceeds, net of underwriters’ discounts, commissions and financial advisory fees and other offering costs were
approximately $214.9 million. On November 30, 2004, an additional 1,421,300 shares of common stock were sold at $12.00 per share as a result of the underwriters’ exercising their over-allotment option. This resulted in additional net
proceeds to us of approximately $15.9 million.

On February 9, 2005, we completed the offering of 4.14 million shares of 8.50%
Series A cumulative redeemable preferred stock (liquidation preference $25.00 per share) for total net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and other offering costs, of $99.3 million, including the proceeds from the exercise of the
underwriters’ over-allotment option. The net proceeds from this offering were used to reduce borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, acquire properties and for investment and general corporate purposes.

On July 26, 2005, we completed the offering of 2.53 million shares of 7.875% Series B cumulative redeemable preferred stock (liquidation
preference $25.00 per share) for total net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and other offering costs, of $60.5 million, including the proceeds from the exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option. On July 26, 2005 we also
completed the offering of 5.87 million shares of common stock for total net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and other offering costs, of $97.8 million, including the proceeds from the exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment
option. The net proceeds from these offerings were used to reduce borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, acquire properties and for investment and general corporate purposes. In May 2006, we issued 4.0 million shares of common stock at
a price of $24.40, which resulted in net proceeds of approximately $94.5 million after offering costs. In October 2006 we issued 9.2 million common shares for net proceeds of $267.7 million after offering costs. We used proceeds from this
issuance to pay $133.8 million for the redemption of 4.6 million common Operating Partnership units tendered by Global Innovation Partners, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (GI Partners), with the balance being used to pay down our
unsecured credit facility.

We continue to operate and expand the business of our predecessor (the Predecessor). The Predecessor is not a
legal entity; rather it is a combination of certain of the real estate subsidiaries of GI Partners contributed to us in connection with the IPO, along with an allocation of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of GI Partners related to
the real estate owned by such subsidiaries.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Beginning November 3, 2004 the financial statements presented are our consolidated financial
statements. The financial statements presented for periods prior to November 3, 2004 are the combined financial statements of the Predecessor.

Pursuant to a contribution agreement among GI Partners, the owner of the Predecessor and the Operating Partnership, certain of GI Partners’ properties were contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for limited partnership
interests in the Operating Partnership (Units) and the assumption of debt and other specified liabilities. Additionally, pursuant to contribution agreements between the Operating Partnership and third parties, which were also executed in July 2004,
the Operating Partnership received contributions of interests in certain additional real estate properties in exchange for Units and the assumption of specified liabilities.

We purchased a portion of the Units that were issued to GI Partners (which Units were subsequently allocated out to certain members of GI Partners)
immediately following the completion of the IPO and upon exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option, the aggregate purchase price of which was $91.9 million. The purchase price was equal to the value of the Operating Partnership units
based on the IPO price of our stock, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and financial advisory fees. GI Partners distributed approximately 4.0 million Operating Partnership common units to its owners and these units were redeemed for
shares of our common stock and sold to third parties in an underwritten public offering, which closed on April 3, 2006. On December 1, 2006, GI Partners redeemed 3.3 million Operating Partnership common units for shares of common
stock, which were sold to third parties in an underwritten public offering.

We have operated in a manner that we believe has enabled us to
qualify and have elected to be treated, as a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, (the Code) as amended.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a) Principles of Consolidation and Combination
and Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include all of the accounts of Digital Realty Trust,
Inc., the Operating Partnership, the subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership and a consolidated joint venture through the date of sale of the property that was owned by the joint venture. Intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated.

Property interests contributed to the Operating Partnership by GI Partners in exchange for Units have been accounted for as a
reorganization of entities under common control in a manner similar to a pooling of interests. Accordingly, the contributed assets and assumed liabilities were recorded at the Predecessor’s historical cost basis. Property interests acquired
from third parties for cash or Units are accounted for using purchase accounting.

The accompanying combined financial statements of the
Predecessor include the accounts of the wholly owned real estate subsidiaries and two majority-owned real estate joint ventures that GI Partners contributed to the Operating Partnership on October 27, 2004 in connection with the IPO.
Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The interests of the joint venture partners, all of whom are third parties, are reflected in minority interests in the accompanying combined financial statements.

The accompanying financial statements of the Predecessor do not include the accounts of the real estate subsidiaries for a property owned by GI Partners
that is subject to a right of first offer agreement, whereby the Operating Partnership has the right to make the first offer to purchase this property if GI Partners decides to sell



DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. AND

DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. PREDECESSOR

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

it, nor do the combined financial statements of the Predecessor include the accounts of another right of first offer property prior to our acquisition that
we acquired from GI Partners during 2005. The accompanying combined financial statements of the Predecessor also do not include any of GI Partners’ investments in privately held companies, which GI Partners did not contribute to the Operating
Partnership.

The accompanying combined statements of the Predecessor include an allocation of interest expense related to GI
Partners’ line of credit to the extent that borrowings under this line of credit related to acquisitions of the real estate owned by the subsidiaries and joint ventures that GI Partners contributed to the Operating Partnership. Additionally,
the accompanying combined financial statements of the Predecessor include an allocation of asset management fees to a related party incurred by GI Partners and an allocation of GI Partners’ general and administrative expenses. Although neither
the Company nor the Operating Partnership were parties to the agreement requiring the payment of the asset management fees, an allocation of such fees has been included in the accompanying combined financial statements since such fees were
essentially the Company Predecessor’s historical general and administrative expense. The Predecessor did not directly incur personnel costs, home office space rent or other general and administrative expenses that subsequent to the completion
of the IPO are incurred directly by the Company and the Operating Partnership. These types of expenses were historically incurred by the asset manager and were passed through to GI Partners via the asset management fee.

(b) Cash Equivalents

For
purpose of the consolidated and combined statements of cash flows, the Company considers short-term investments with maturities of 90 days or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, cash equivalents consist
of investments in a money market fund.

(c) Investments in Real Estate

Investments in real estate are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are recorded on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives as follows:

Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life, increase capacity,
or improve the efficiency of the asset. Repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.

(d) Investment in Unconsolidated
Joint Venture

The Company’s investment in joint venture is accounted for using the equity method, whereby the investment is
increased for capital contributed and the Company’s share of the joint venture’s net income and decreased by distributions received and the Company’s share of any losses of the joint venture.

(e) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We assess whether there has been impairment in the value of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of



DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. AND

DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. PREDECESSOR

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to the future net cash flows, undiscounted and without interest, expected to be
generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at
the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell. Management believes no impairment in the net carrying value of the investments in real estate has occurred.

(f) Purchase Accounting for Acquisition of Investments in Real Estate

Purchase accounting is applied to the assets and liabilities related to all real estate investments acquired from third parties. In accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141,

Business Combinations,

the fair value of the real estate acquired is allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting primarily of land, building and tenant improvements, and
identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases, other value of in-place leases, value of tenant relationships and acquired ground leases, based in each case on their fair values. Loan
premiums, in the case of above market rate loans, or loan discounts, in the case of below market loans, are recorded based on the fair value of any loans assumed in connection with acquiring the real estate.

The fair values of the tangible assets of an acquired property are determined based on comparable land sales for land and replacement costs adjusted for
physical and market obsolescence for the improvements. The fair values of the tangible assets of an acquired property are also determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the “as-if-vacant” value is then allocated to land,
building and tenant improvements based on management’s determination of the relative fair values of these assets. Management determines the as-if-vacant fair value of a property using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers.
Factors considered by management in performing these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs,
management includes real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease-up periods based on current market demand. Management also estimates costs to execute similar leases
including leasing commissions, legal and other related costs.

In allocating the fair value of the identified intangible assets and
liabilities of an acquired property, above-market and below-market in–place lease values are recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between
(i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term
of the lease and, for below-market leases, over a period equal to the initial term plus any below market fixed rate renewal periods. The leases do not currently include any below market fixed rate renewal periods. The capitalized above-market lease
values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining non-cancelable terms of the respective leases. The capitalized below-market lease values, also referred to as acquired lease obligations, are amortized as an increase to rental
income over the initial terms of the respective leases and any below market fixed rate renewal periods.

In addition to the intangible
value for above market leases and the intangible negative value for below market leases, there is intangible value related to having tenants leasing space in the purchased property, which is referred to as in-place lease value and tenant
relationship value. Such value results primarily from the buyer of a leased property avoiding the costs associated with leasing the property and also avoiding rent losses and unreimbursed operating expenses during the lease up period. The estimated
avoided costs and avoided revenue



DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. AND

DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. PREDECESSOR

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

losses are calculated and this aggregate value is allocated between in-place lease value. The value of in-place leases exclusive of the value of above-market
in-place leases is amortized to expense over the remaining non-cancelable periods of the respective leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be written off. The
estimated future amortization of intangible assets and liabilities (assuming no early termination of leases acquired) at December 31, 2006 is as follows (in thousands):

(g) Capitalization of costs.

We capitalize pre-acquisition costs related to probable property acquisitions. We also capitalize direct and indirect costs related to construction and
development, including property taxes, insurance and financing costs relating to space under development. Costs previously capitalized related to any property acquisitions no longer considered probable are written off. Interest capitalized during
the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $3.9 million and $0.3 million. No interest was capitalized during the year ended December 31, 2004. We capitalized amounts relating to compensation expense of employees directly engaged in
construction and successful leasing activities of $2.4 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively and no such amounts were capitalized during the year ended December 31, 2004. We had a writeoff of
approximately $0.5 million of pre-acquisition costs in the year ended December 31, 2006, related to a previously targeted acquisition in Germany.

(h) Deferred Leasing Costs

Deferred leasing commissions and other direct and indirect costs
associated with the acquisition of tenants are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over the terms of the related leases.

(i) Foreign Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries that own real estate investments outside
the United States with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates as of the balance sheet dates. Income and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates for the reporting period.
Translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.

(j) Deferred Financing Costs

Loan fees and costs are capitalized and amortized over the life of the related loans on a straight-line basis, which approximates
the effective interest method. Such amortization is included as a component of interest expense.



DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. AND

DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. PREDECESSOR

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

(k) Restricted Cash

Restricted cash consists of deposits for real estate taxes and insurance and other amounts as required by our loan agreements including funds for leasing
costs and improvements related to unoccupied space.

(l) Offering Costs

Underwriting commissions and other offering costs are reflected as a reduction in additional paid-in capital.

(m) Share Based Compensation

We account for share based compensation using the fair value method of accounting. The estimated fair value of each of the long-term incentive units granted in connection with our IPO was equal to the IPO price of our stock and such amount
was recorded as an expense upon closing of the IPO since those long-term incentive units were fully vested as of the grant date. The estimated fair value of the stock options granted by us is being amortized over the vesting period of the stock
options. The estimated fair value of the Class C Partnership units (discussed in note 9) is being amortized over the expected service period of five years.

(n) Derivative Financial Instruments

We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair
value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm
commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation.

Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow
hedges. Our objective in using derivatives is to add stability to our cash flows due to our exposure to interest rate risks on our variable rate mortgages. To accomplish this objective, we primarily use interest rate swaps as part of our cash flow
hedging strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts in exchange for fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount. Through
December 31, 2006, we used such derivatives to hedge the variable cash flows associated with variable rate mortgages.

For derivatives
designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income (outside of earnings) and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged forecasted
transactions affect earnings as a component of interest expense, and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized directly in earnings. For derivatives designated as net investment hedges, changes in the fair
value of the derivative are reported in other comprehensive income (outside of earnings) as part of the cumulative translation adjustment. As of December 31, 2006, no derivatives were designated as fair value or net investment hedges.
Additionally, we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.

(o) Income Taxes

We have elected to be treated and believe that we have operated in a manner that has enabled us to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the
Code. As a REIT, we generally are not required to pay federal corporate income taxes on our taxable income to the extent it is currently distributed to our stockholders.



DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. AND

DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. PREDECESSOR

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

However, qualification and taxation as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet the various
qualification tests imposed under the Code including tests related to annual operating results, asset composition, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we will be organized or be able to
operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular
corporate tax rates.

There are currently two subsidiaries of our operating partnership, which we have elected to treat as taxable REIT
subsidiaries (each, a TRS). In general, a TRS may perform non-customary services for tenants, hold assets that we cannot hold directly and generally may engage in any real estate or non-real estate related business (except for the operation or
management of health care facilities or lodging facilities or the provision to any person, under a franchise, license or otherwise, rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility or health care facility is operated). A TRS is subject to
corporate federal income taxes on its taxable income at regular corporate tax rates. There is no tax provision for either of our TRS entities for the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated and combined statements of operations due to net
operating losses incurred. No tax benefits have been recorded since it is not considered more likely than not that the deferred tax asset related to the net operating loss carryforward will be utilized.

To the extent that any foreign taxes are incurred by the subsidiaries invested in real estate located outside of the United States, a provision is made
for such taxes.

No provision has been made in the combined financial statements of the Predecessor for U.S. income taxes, as any such
taxes are the responsibility of GI Partners’ Members, as GI Partners is a limited liability company.

(p) Revenue Recognition

All leases are classified as operating leases and minimum rents are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the
leases. The excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases is included in deferred rent in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and contractually due but unpaid rents are included in accounts and
other receivables.

Tenant reimbursements for real estate taxes, common area maintenance, and other recoverable costs are recognized in the
period that the expenses are incurred. Lease termination fees, which are included in other income in the accompanying statements of operations, are recognized over the new remaining term of the lease, effective as of the date the lease modification
is finalized, assuming collection is probable.

A provision for loss is made if the collection of the receivable balances related to
contractual rent, rent recorded on a straight-line basis, tenant reimbursements and lease termination fees are considered to be doubtful.

(q) Asset Retirement Obligations

We record accruals for estimated retirement obligations, as required by SFAS
No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” and FASB Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations” (FIN 47). The amount of asset retirement obligations relates primarily to
estimated asbestos removal costs at the end of the economic life of properties that were built before 1984. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the amount included in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet
was approximately $1.2 million and $0.8 million, respectively, and the equivalent asset is recorded at $1.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively, net of accumulated amortization.



DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. AND

DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. PREDECESSOR

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

(r) Discontinued Operations

Discontinued operations represent a component of an entity that has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale if both the operations and
cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from ongoing operations of the entity as a result of the disposal transaction and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after
the disposal transaction. Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”, provides that the assets and liabilities of the component of the entity that has
been classified as discontinued operations be presented separately in the entity’s balance sheet. The results of operations of the component of the entity that has been classified as discontinued operations are also reported as discontinued
operations for all periods presented. A property is classified as held for sale when certain criteria, as outlined in SFAS No. 144, are met. At such time, depreciation is no longer recognized. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of
their carrying amount or their estimated fair value less the estimated costs to sell the assets. The results of operations of assets held for sale are reported as discontinued operations. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, no assets were held
for sale. During 2006, we sold 7979 East Tufts Avenue and accounted for this property as a discontinued operation.

(s)
Management’s Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates made.

(t) New Accounting
Pronouncement

In September 2006, the SEC’s Office of the Chief Accountant and Divisions of Corporation Finance and Investment
Management released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 (SAB 108), which provides interpretive guidance on how registrants should quantify financial-statement misstatements. Currently, the two methods most commonly used by preparers and auditors to
quantify misstatements are the “rollover” method (which focuses primarily on the income statement impact of misstatements) and the “iron curtain” method (which focuses primarily on the balance sheet impact of misstatements).
Under SAB 108, registrants will be required to consider both the rollover and iron curtain methods (i.e., a dual approach) when evaluating the materiality of financial statement errors. Registrants will need to revisit their prior materiality
assessments and consider them using both the rollover and iron curtain methods. SAB 108 is effective for annual financial statements in the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006, therefore for us, the year ended December 31, 2006. The SAB
provides transition accounting and disclosure guidance for situations in which a registrant concludes that a material error(s) existed in prior-period financial statements under the dual approach. Specifically, registrants will be permitted to
restate prior period financial statements or recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying SAB 108 through an adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the year of adoption. Our adoption of the dual method did not have a material impact
on our annual consolidated financial statements.

(u) Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications to prior year amounts have been made to conform to the current year presentation.

3. Minority Interests in the Operating Partnership

Minority interests in the Operating Partnership relate to the interests that are not owned by us. The following table shows the ownership interest in the
Operating Partnership at December 31, 2006 and 2005:

The following table shows activity for the Operating Partnership units that are not owned by us

(1)

This redemption was recorded as a reduction to minority interest and an increase to common stock and additional paid in capital based on the book value per unit in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet.

Limited partners who acquired common units have the right to require the Operating Partnership
to redeem part or all of their common units for cash based on the fair market value of an equivalent number of shares of our common stock at the time of the redemption. Alternatively, we may elect to acquire those common units in exchange for shares
of our common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits, stock dividends, issuance of stock rights, specified extraordinary distributions and similar events. We have filed a shelf registration statement
covering the issuance of the shares of our common stock issuable upon redemption of the common units, and the resale of those shares of common stock by the holders. Richard Magnuson, the Executive Chairman of our board of directors, Michael Foust,
our Chief Executive Officer and a member of our board of directors, and Scott Peterson, our Senior Vice President, Acquisitions, are minority indirect investors in GI Partners.

Under the terms of certain third parties’ (the eXchange parties) contribution agreement signed
in the third quarter of 2004, we have agreed to indemnify each eXchange party against adverse tax consequences in the event the Operating Partnership directly or indirectly, sells, exchanges or otherwise disposes of (whether by way of merger, sale
of assets or otherwise) in a taxable transaction any interest in 200 Paul Avenue 1-4 or 1100 Space Park Drive until the earlier of November 3, 2013 and the date on which these contributors hold less than 25% of the Units issued to them in the
formation transactions consummated concurrently with the IPO. Under the eXchange parties’ contribution agreement, these parties have agreed to guarantee $20.0 million of indebtedness until the earlier of November 3, 2013 and the date on

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

As of December 31, 2006, we had an unsecured credit facility (credit facility) under which we can
borrow up to $500.0 million. Borrowings under the credit facility currently bear interest at a rate of based on 1-month LIBOR and 1-month EURIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.250% to 1.625%, depending on our Operating Partnership’s overall
leverage. This margin was 1.50% as of December 31, 2006, resulting in an interest rate at this date of 6.82% on U.S. borrowings and 5.13% on Euro borrowings. The credit facility matures in October 2008, subject to a one-year extension option, which
we may exercise if certain conditions are met. The credit facility has a $150.0 million sub-facility for foreign exchange advances in Euros and British Sterling. As of December 31, 2006 we had outstanding $145.5 million under the credit facility.
The credit facility contains various restrictive covenants, including limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make certain investments or merge with another company, and requirements to maintain financial coverage ratios and
maintain a pool of unencumbered assets. In addition, except to enable us to maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we will not during any four consecutive fiscal quarters make distributions with respect to common stock or
other equity interests in an aggregate amount in excess of 95% of Funds From Operations, as defined, for such period, subject to certain other adjustments. As of December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with all the covenants.

Some of the loans impose penalties upon prepayment. The terms of the following mortgage loans do not permit prepayment of the loan prior to the dates
listed below:

(1)

We can prepay this loan prior to June 11, 2007.

Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2026

On August 15, 2006, our Operating Partnership issued $172.5 million of its
4.125% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due August 15, 2026 (the Debentures). Costs incurred to issue the Debentures were approximately $6.2 million. These costs are being amortized over a period of five years, which represents the projected
estimated term of the Debentures, and are included in deferred financing costs, net in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006. The Debentures are general unsecured senior obligations of the Operating Partnership and rank equally
in right of payment with all other senior unsecured indebtedness of the Operating Partnership.

Interest is payable on August 15 and
February 15 of each year beginning February 15, 2007 until the maturity date of August 15, 2026. The Debentures bear interest at 4.125% per annum and contain an exchange settlement feature, which provides that the Debentures may,
under certain circumstances, be exchangeable for cash (up to the principal amount of the Debentures) and, with respect to any excess exchange value, into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock at an
initial exchange rate of approximately 30.68 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Debentures.

Prior to August 18, 2011, the
Operating Partnership may not redeem the Debentures except to preserve its status as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. On or after August 18, 2011, at the Operating Partnership’s option, the Debentures
are redeemable in cash in whole or in part at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, accrued to, but excluding, the redemption date, upon at least 30 days’ but not more than 60 days’ prior written notice to
holders of the Debentures.



DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. AND

DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. PREDECESSOR

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The holders of the Debentures have the right to require the Operating Partnership to repurchase the
Debentures in cash in whole or in part on each of August 15, 2011, August 15, 2016 and August 15, 2021, and in the event of a designated event, for a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Debentures plus
unpaid interest, if any, accrued to, but excluding, the repurchase date. Designated events include certain merger or combination transactions, non-affiliates becoming the beneficial owner of more than 50% of the total voting power of our capital
stock, a substantial turnover of our company’s directors within a 12-month period, or if we cease to be the general partner of the Operating Partnership. Certain events are considered “Events of Default,” which may result in the
accelerated maturity of the Debentures, including a default for 30 days in payment of any installment of interest under the Debentures, a default in the payment of the principal amount or any repurchase price or redemption price due with respect to
the Debentures and the Operating Partnership’s failure to deliver cash or any shares of our common stock within 15 days after the due date upon an exchange of the Debentures, together with any cash due in lieu of fractional shares of our common
stock.

We have entered into a registration rights agreement whereby we must register the shares of common stock which could be issued in
the future upon exchange. If we fail to file a shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission within 270 days of the closing of the offering of the Debentures, and such registration statement is not declared effective
within such 270-day period, for the first 90 days following such failure, the annual interest rate of the Debentures will increase to 4.375% per annum until the registration statement is declared effective. Thereafter, the annual interest rate
of the Debentures will increase to 4.625% per annum until the registration statement is declared effective.

7. Income (loss) per Share

The following is a summary of the elements used in calculating basic and diluted income per share (in thousands, except share and per
share amounts):

DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. PREDECESSOR

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

We have excluded the following amounts in the calculations above:

On or after July 15, 2026, the $172.5 million exchangeable senior debentures may be exchanged
at the then applicable exchange rate for cash (up to the principal amount of the Debentures) and, with respect to any excess exchange value, into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock at an initial
exchange rate of 30.6828 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Debentures. The exchangeable senior debentures will also be exchangeable prior to July 15, 2026, but only upon the occurrence of certain specified events. During the period from
initial issuance or August 15, 2006 through December 31, 2006, the weighted average common stock price exceeded the current strike price of $32.59 per share. Therefore, using the treasury method, 43,364 shares of common stock contingently
issuable upon settlement of the excess exchange value was included in the diluted share count in determining diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2006.

8. Stockholders Equity

(a) Redeemable Preferred Stock

Underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs totaling approximately $7.0 million are reflected as a reduction to preferred stock in the
accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.

8.50% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock

We currently have outstanding 4,140,000 shares of our 8.50% series A cumulative redeemable preferred stock, or series A preferred stock. Dividends are
cumulative on our series A preferred stock from the date of original issuance in the amount of $2.125 per share each year, which is equivalent to 8.50% of the $25.00 liquidation preference per share. Dividends on our series A preferred stock are
payable quarterly in arrears. Our series A preferred stock does not have a stated maturity date and is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption provisions. Upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, our series A preferred stock will
rank senior to our common stock with respect to the payment of distributions and other amounts and rank on parity with our Series B Preferred Stock. We are not allowed to redeem our series A preferred stock before February 9, 2010, except in
limited circumstances to preserve our status as a REIT. On or after February 9, 2010, we may, at our option, redeem our series A preferred stock, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, for cash at a redemption price of $25.00
per share, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends on such series A preferred stock up to but excluding the redemption date. Holders of our series A preferred stock generally have no voting rights except for limited voting rights if we fail to pay
dividends for six or more quarterly periods (whether or not consecutive) and in certain other circumstances. Our series A preferred stock is not convertible into or exchangeable for any other property or securities of our company.

7.875% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock

We currently have outstanding 2,530,000 shares of our 7.875% series B cumulative redeemable preferred stock, or series B preferred stock. Dividends are cumulative on our series B preferred stock from the date of



DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. AND

DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. PREDECESSOR

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

original issuance in the amount of $1.96875 per share each year, which is equivalent to 7.875% of the $25.00 liquidation preference per share. Dividends on
our series B preferred stock are payable quarterly in arrears. Our series B preferred stock does not have a stated maturity date and is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption provisions. Upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up,
our series B preferred stock will rank senior to our common stock with respect to the payment of distributions and other amounts and rank on parity with our Series A Preferred Stock. We are not allowed to redeem our series B preferred stock before
July 26, 2010, except in limited circumstances to preserve our status as a REIT. On or after July 26, 2010, we may, at our option, redeem our series B preferred stock, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, for cash at a
redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends on such series B preferred stock up to but excluding the redemption date. Holders of our series B preferred stock generally have no voting rights except for limited voting
rights if we fail to pay dividends for six or more quarterly periods (whether or not consecutive) and in certain other circumstances. Our series B preferred stock is not convertible into or exchangeable for any other property or securities of our
company.

(b) Shares and Units

A common unit and a share of our common stock have essentially the same economic characteristics as they share equally in the total net income or loss and distributions of the Operating Partnership. The common units
are further discussed in note 3 and the long term incentive units are discussed in note 9. Limited partners who acquired common units in the formation transactions have the right to require the Operating Partnership to redeem part or all of their
common units for cash based upon the fair market value of an equivalent number of shares of our common stock at the time of the redemption. Alternatively, we may elect to acquire those common units in exchange for shares of our common stock on a
one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits, stock dividends, issuance of stock rights, specified extraordinary distributions and similar events. Pursuant to registration rights agreements we entered into with GI Partners
and the other third party contributors, we filed a shelf registration statement covering the issuance of the shares of our common stock issuable upon redemption of the common units, and the resale of those shares of common stock by the holders. GI
Partners distributed approximately 4.0 million Operating Partnership common units to its owners and these units were redeemed for shares of our common stock and sold to third parties in an underwritten public offering, which closed on
April 3, 2006. On October 4, 2006 we issued 9.2 million common shares for net proceeds of $267.7 million after offering costs. We used approximately $133.8 million of the proceeds to pay GI Partners for the redemption of
4.6 million Operating Partnership common units. On December 1, 2006, GI Partners redeemed 3.3 million Operating Partnership common units for shares of common stock, which were sold to third parties in an underwritten public offering.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Total dividends and distributions declared through December 31, 2006:

The tax treatment of dividends on common stock paid in 2006 is estimated as follows: approximately
74% ordinary income and 26% return of capital. The tax treatment of dividends on common stock paid in 2005 is as follows: approximately 87% ordinary income and 13% return of capital. All dividends paid on our preferred stock in 2006 and 2005 were
classified as ordinary income for income tax purposes.

(d) Stock Options

The fair value of each option granted under the 2004 Incentive Award Plan is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model with the weighted-average assumptions listed below for grants in 2006, 2005 and 2004. The fair values are being expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the options, which ranges from four to five years. The expense
recorded for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 and the period from November 3, 2004 to December 31, 2004 was approximately $0.3 million, $0.2 million and $32,000, respectively. Unearned compensation representing the unvested
portion of the stock options totaled $2.8 million as of December 31, 2006. We expect to recognize this unearned compensation over the next 4.0 years on a weighted average basis.

The following table sets forth the weighted-average assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the stock options granted during the years ended
December 31, 2006 and 2005 and the period from November 3, 2004 to December 31, 2004:

The following table summarizes the 2004 Incentive Award Plan’s stock option activity for the
year ended December 31, 2006:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

We issued new common shares for the common stock options exercised during the years ended
December 31, 2006 and 2005. The intrinsic value of options exercised in the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was approximately $6.0 million and $0.6 million, respectively. There were no options exercised in 2004.

The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2006:

9. Incentive Plan

(a) Incentive Award Plan

Our 2004 Incentive Award Plan provides for the grant of incentive
awards to employees, directors and consultants. Awards issuable under the 2004 Incentive Award Plan include stock options, restricted stock, dividend equivalents, stock appreciation rights, long-term incentive units, cash performance bonuses and
other incentive awards. Only employees are eligible to receive incentive stock options under the 2004 Incentive Award Plan. We have reserved a total of 4,474,102 shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to the 2004 Incentive Award Plan, subject
to certain adjustments set forth in the 2004 Incentive Award Plan. As of December 31, 2006, 436,744 shares of common stock or awards convertible into or exchangeable for common stock remained available for future issuance under the 2004
Incentive Award Plan. Each long-term incentive and Class C unit issued under the 2004 Incentive Award Plan will count as one share of common stock for purposes of calculating the limit on shares that may be issued under the 2004 Incentive Award Plan
and the individual award limit discussed below.

(b) Long Term Incentive Units

Long-term incentive units may be issued to eligible participants for the performance of services to or for the benefit of the Operating Partnership.
Long-term incentive units, whether vested or not, will receive the same quarterly per unit distributions as common units in the Operating Partnership, which equal per share distributions on our common stock. Initially, long-term incentive units do
not have full parity with common units with respect to liquidating distributions. Upon the occurrence of specified events, long-term incentive units may over time achieve full parity with common units in the Operating Partnership for all purposes,
and therefore accrete to an economic value for participants equivalent to our common stock on a one-for-one basis. If such parity is reached, vested long-term incentive units may be converted into an equal number of common units of the Operating
Partnership at any time, and thereafter enjoy all the rights of common units of the Operating Partnership.

In connection with the IPO, an
aggregate of 1,490,561 of fully vested long-term incentive units were issued and compensation expense totaling $17.9 million was recorded at the completion of the IPO. Parity was reached for these units on February 9, 2005 upon completion of
our series A preferred stock offering.

DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. PREDECESSOR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

(c) Class C Profits Interests Units

During the fourth quarter of 2005, we granted to each of our named executive officers and certain other employees an award of Class C Profits Interest
Units (Class C Units) of the Operating Partnership under our 2004 Incentive Award Plan. If the performance condition and the other vesting conditions are satisfied with respect to a Class C Unit, as described below, the Class C Unit will be treated
in the same manner as the existing long-term incentive units issued by the Operating Partnership.

The Class C Units subject to each award
will vest based on the achievement of a 10% or greater compound annual total shareholder return, as defined, for the period from the grant date through earlier of September 30, 2008 and the date of a change of control of our Company (the
Performance Condition) combined with the employee’s continued service with our company or the Operating Partnership through September 30, 2010. Upon achievement of the Performance Condition, the Class C units will receive the same
quarterly per unit distribution as common units in the Operating Partnership.

The aggregate amount of the performance award pool will be
equal to 7% of the excess shareholder value, as defined, created during the applicable performance period, but in no event will the amount of the pool exceed the lesser of $40,000,000 or the value of 2.5% of the total number of shares of our common
stock and limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership at the end of the performance period.

Except in the event of a change in control of our company, 60% of the Class C Units that satisfy the Performance Condition will vest at the end of the three year performance period and an additional


/


th of such Class C Units will vest on the date of each monthly anniversary thereafter, provided that the
employee’s service has not terminated prior to the applicable vesting date.

To the extent that any Class C Units fail to
satisfy the Performance Condition, such Class C Units will automatically be cancelled and forfeited by the employee. In addition, any Class C Units which are not eligible for pro rata vesting in the event of a termination of the employee’s
employment due to death or disability or without cause (or for good reason, if applicable) will automatically be cancelled and forfeited upon a termination of the employee’s employment.

In the event that the value of the employee’s allocated portion of the award pool that satisfies the performance condition equates to a number of
Class C Units that is greater than the number of Class C Units awarded to the executive, we will make an additional payment to the executive in the form of a number of shares of our restricted stock equal to the difference subject to the same
vesting requirements as the Class C Units.

A portion of the award pool remains unallocated and available for grants to other future senior
executives or to the then current grantees (including the named executive officers) if the compensation committee determines that the award pool percentage allocated to one or more of such executives should be increased.

On October 26, 2005, the Operating Partnership amended and restated its agreement of limited partnership in order to create the Class C Units. As of
December 31, 2006, 2005, approximately 1,203,000 and 1,180,000 Class C units had been awarded to our executive officers and other employees, respectively, and approximately 57,000 Class C units are currently available for future awards. The
fair value of these awards of approximately $4.0 million is being recognized as compensation expense on a straight line basis over the expected service period of five years. The unearned compensation as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $3.0
million and $3.8 million respectively, respectively. As of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, none of the above awards had vested. We recognized compensation expense related to these Class C units of $0.8 million and $0.2 million



DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. AND

DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. PREDECESSOR

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. If the Performance Condition is not met, the unamortized amount will be recognized as an
expense at that time.

(d) 401(k) Plan

We have a 401(k) plan whereby our employees may contribute a portion of their compensation to their respective retirement accounts, in an amount not to exceed the maximum allowed under the Code. The 401(k) Plan
complies with Internal Revenue Service requirements as a 401(k) Safe Harbor Plan whereby discretionary contributions made by us are 100% vested. The aggregate cost of our contributions to the 401(k) Plan was approximately $0.3 and $0.1 million for
the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and we incurred no cost during the year ended December 31, 2004.

10. Fair Value of
Instruments

We disclose fair value information about all financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the balance sheets, for
which it is practicable to estimate fair value.

The estimates of the fair value financial instruments at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively, were determined using available market information and appropriate valuation methods. Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop estimated fair value. The use of different market assumptions or estimation
methods may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, restricted
cash, accounts and other receivables, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, security deposits and prepaid rents approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. As described in note 11, the interest rate cap,
interest rate swap and foreign currency forward sale contracts are recorded at fair value.

We calculate the fair value of our notes
payable under line of credit, mortgage and other secured loans, and exchangeable senior debentures based on currently available market rates assuming the loans are outstanding through maturity and considering the collateral and other loan terms,
including excess exchange value which exists related to our exchangeable senior debentures. In determining the current market rate for fixed rate debt, a market spread is added to the quoted yields on federal government treasury securities with
similar maturity dates to debt.

At December 31, 2006 the aggregate fair value of our mortgage and other secured loans and
exchangeable senior debentures are estimated to be $1,142.1 million compared to the carrying value of $1,122.6 million. As of December 31, 2005 the fair value of our mortgage and other secured loans was estimated to be approximately $754.1
million compared to a carrying value of $749.1 million.

11. Derivative Instruments

(a) Interest rate swap agreements

As of December 31, 2006, we were a party to interest rate swap agreements which hedge variability in cash flows related to LIBOR, GBP LIBOR and EURIBOR based mortgage loans. The fair value of these derivatives was $3.3 million at
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

As of December 31, 2006, we estimate that $1.9 million of accumulated other comprehensive income
will be reclassified to earnings through a reduction to interest expense during the twelve months ending December 31, 2007, when the hedged forecasted transactions impact earnings.

The table below summarizes the terms of these interest rate swaps and their fair values as of December 31, 2006 (in thousands):

(1)

Translation to US amounts is based on exchange rate of $1.96 to £1.00 as of December 31, 2006.

(2)

Translation to US amounts is based on exchange rate of $1.32 to €1.00 as of December 31, 2006.

We have two LIBOR interest rate caps that are not designated as hedges. The fair values of the caps were immaterial as of December 31, 2006 and
December 31, 2005.

(b) Foreign currency contract

On January 4, 2006, we received net proceeds of $0.7 million when we terminated a foreign currency forward sale contract entered into on
January 24, 2005 which was used to hedge our equity investment in 6 Braham Street, located in London, England. This forward contract was designated as a net investment hedge. The cumulative translation adjustment amounts related to the net
investment hedge (including the $0.7 million received upon termination in January 2006) are included in other accumulated comprehensive income and will be reclassified to earnings when the hedged investment is sold or liquidated.

In 2003, the Predecessor entered into a foreign currency forward sale contract of approximately £7.9 million, with a delivery date of
January 24, 2005, to hedge the equity investment in 6 Braham Street, located in London, England. On January 24, 2005, we settled our obligations under this arrangement for a payment of approximately $2.5 million and entered into a new
forward contract of the same notional amount expiring in January 2006. On February 4, 2005, GI Partners reimbursed us for $1.9 million of the $2.5 million settlement since it was determined that the negative value associated with the forward
contract that we assumed was not otherwise factored into the determination of the number of common units that were granted to GI Partners in exchange for our interests in 6 Braham Street.

recognized from Savvis Communications comprised approximately 12.5%, 11.8% and 11.9% of total revenues, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, revenues recognized from Qwest Communications International, Inc. comprised
approximately 10.6% and 10.6% of total revenues, respectively. Other than noted here, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, no single tenant comprised more than 10% of total revenues.

In April 2005, we entered into two agreements with Linc Facility Services, LLC, or LFS primarily for
personnel providing for operations and maintenance repairs of the mechanical, electrical, plumbing and general building service systems of five of our properties. LFS belongs to The Linc Group, which GI Partners has owned since late 2003. Our
consolidated statement of operations includes expenses of $1.3 million and approximately $0.7 million for these services for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 and we owed LFS approximately $117,000 at December 31, 2006.

In December 2006, we entered into ten leases with tel(x), in which tel(x) will provide enhanced meet-me-room services to customers. tel(x)
was acquired by GI Partners Fund II, LLP in November 2006. Richard Magnuson, the Chairman of our board of directors, is also the chief executive officer of the advisor to GI Partners Fund II, LLP. Our consolidated statements of operations include
rental revenues of approximately $1.1 million from tel(x) for the year ended December 31, 2006. In connection with the lease agreements, we entered into an operating agreement with tel(x), effective as of December 1, 2006, with respect to joint
sales and marketing efforts, designation of representatives to manage the national relationship between us and tel(x) and future meet-me-room facilities. Under the operating agreement, tel(x) has a sixty-day option to enter into a meet-me-room lease
for certain future meet-me-room buildings acquired by us or any buildings currently owned by us that are converted into a meet-me-room building.

We also entered into a referral agreement with tel(x), effective as of December 1, 2006, with respect to referral fees arising out of potential future lease agreements for rentable space in buildings covered by the meet-me-room lease
agreements. Additionally, we have the right to purchase approximately 10% or 1.6 million shares of tel(x) preferred stock. The purchase price would be calculated as GI Partners Fund II, LLP’s initial cost plus a 12% per annum return.
We have the right to purchase, at market, a pro-rata share of any follow on tel(x) equity transactions to prevent dilution to our option to acquire approximately 10%. The option to purchase the preferred stock will expire in November 2008.

Asset management fees incurred by GI Partners totaling approximately $2.7 million for the period from January 1, 2004 to
November 2, 2004 have been allocated to the Predecessor. These fees were paid to an affiliate of GI Partners. Although neither we nor the Operating Partnership are or will be parties to the agreement requiring the payment of the asset
management fees, an allocation of such fees has been included in the accompanying combined financial statements of the Predecessor. This is because this fee is essentially the Predecessor’s historical general and administrative expense as the
Predecessor did not directly incur personnel costs, home office space rent or other general and administrative expenses that are incurred directly by us and the Operating Partnership subsequent to the completion of the IPO. These types of expenses
were historically incurred by the asset manager and were passed through to GI Partners via the asset management fee.

We acquired 8534
Concord Center Drive from GI Partners in May 2005 for approximately $16.5 million pursuant to the exercise of a right of first offer agreement. As of December 31, 2005, GI Partners had $1.2 million of letters of credit outstanding that secure
obligations relating to two of our properties, 600 West Seventh Street and 7979 East Tufts Avenue. These letters of credit were initially issued in lieu of making deposits required by a local utility and in lieu of establishing a restricted cash
account on behalf of a lender. These letters of credit were transferred to us on January 1, 2006. Prior to December 31, 2005 we reimbursed GI Partners for the costs of maintaining the letters of credit, which payments were less than $5,000
per quarter.

and, as result, rent after February 2036 is excluded from the minimum commitment information below.

We have ground leases on Paul van
Vlissingenstraat 16 that expires in 2054, Chemin de l’Epinglier 2 that expires in July 2074, Clonshaugh Industrial Estate that expires in 2981 and Gyroscoopweg 2E-2F, which has a continuous ground lease and will be adjusted on January 1,
2042. We have an operating lease for our current headquarters, which we occupied in June 2005 and expires in May 2012 with an option to extend the lease until September 2017. We also have operating leases at 8100 Boone Boulevard and 111 Eighth
Avenue, which expire in October 2007 and June 2014, respectively. The lease at 8100 Boone Boulevard has an option to extend the lease until September 2012 and the lease at 111 Eighth Avenue has an option to extend the lease until June 2019.

We have a fully prepaid ground lease on 2055 E. Technology Circle that expires in 2083.

Rental expense for these leases was approximately $2.0 million, $440,000 and $339,000 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004
respectively.

The minimum commitment under these leases, excluding the fully prepaid ground lease, as of December 31, 2006 was as
follows (in thousands):

(b) Contingent liabilities

We have agreed with the seller of 350 East Cermak Road to share a portion, not to exceed $135,000 per month, of rental revenue, adjusted for our costs to
lease the premises, from the lease of the 260,000 square feet of space held for redevelopment. This revenue sharing agreement will terminate in May 2013. We have recorded no liability for this contingent liability on our consolidated balance sheet
at December 31, 2006, as the events causing this contingency had not occurred at December 31, 2006.

As part of the acquisition
of Clonshaugh Industrial Estate, we entered into an agreement with the seller whereby the seller is entitled to receive 40% of the net rental income generated by the existing building, after we have received a 9% return on all capital invested in
the property. As of February 6, 2006, the date we acquired this property, we have estimated the present value of these expected payments over the 10 year lease term to be approximately $1.1 million and this value has been capitalized. Accounts
payable and other liabilities include $1.3 million for this liability as of December 31, 2006. No amounts have been paid to the seller as of December 31, 2006.

(c) Purchase commitments

As of December 31, 2006, we had signed purchase agreements to acquire the following properties:

Our properties require periodic investments of capital for tenant-related capital expenditures and
for general capital improvements. As of December 31, 2006, we had commitments under leases in effect for approximately $13.0 million of tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions all of which we expect to incur in the near future.

15. Discontinued Operations

In June
2006, we classified 7979 East Tufts Avenue as “held for sale” upon committing to sell this property and we also ceased recording depreciation expense at that time. We purchased the minority interest joint venture partner’s limited
partnership interest in 7979 East Tufts Avenue on July 12, 2006 for approximately $5.3 million which was included in the cost basis of the property in calculating the gain on sale. We sold this property on July 12, 2006 for approximately
$60.4 million which resulted in a gain on sale of approximately $18.1 million.

The results of operations of 7979 East Tufts Avenue are
reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated condensed financial statements. The following table summarizes the income and expense components that comprise loss from discontinued operations for the
years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 (in thousands):
