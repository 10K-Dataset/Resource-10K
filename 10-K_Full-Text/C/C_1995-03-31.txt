                                        ------


          Item 1.   BUSINESS.

                                     THE COMPANY

                The Travelers Inc. (the "Company") is a financial services
          holding company engaged, through its subsidiaries, principally in
          four business segments:  (i) Investment Services; (ii) Consumer
          Finance Services; (iii) Life Insurance Services; and (iv)
          Property & Casualty Insurance Services.

                On December 31, 1993, the Company acquired the
          approximately 73% of the common stock of The Travelers
          Corporation, a Connecticut corporation ("old Travelers"), it did
          not already own, through the merger of old Travelers into the
          Company (the "Merger").  The Company's results of operations for
          periods prior to the Merger do not include those of old
          Travelers, other than for the equity in earnings relating to the
          27% previously owned.  See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated
          Financial Statements.

                In December 1994, the Company sold all of the capital
          stock of American Capital Management & Research, Inc. ("ACMR")
          owned by it to The Van Kampen Merritt Companies, Inc. ("VKM") for
          a purchase price of approximately $430 million.  See "Investment
          Services -- Other Operations."

                On January 3, 1995, the Company completed the sale of its
          group life and related businesses to Metropolitan Life Insurance
          Company ("MetLife").  The purchase price for the group life
          business was $350 million.  In connection with the sale, the
          Company agreed to cede to MetLife 100% of its risks in the
          businesses sold on an indemnity reinsurance basis, effective
          January 1, 1995.

                Also on January 3, 1995, the Company and MetLife, and
          certain of their subsidiaries, contributed their medical
          businesses to The MetraHealth Companies, Inc. ("MetraHealth"), a
          newly formed joint venture, in exchange for shares of common
          stock of MetraHealth.  The Company and MetLife are equal partners
          in the joint venture.  The Company's total contribution to
          MetraHealth amounted to approximately $448 million, at carrying
          value.  The Company owns approximately 48% of the outstanding
          capital stock of MetraHealth, and its investment will be
          accounted for on the equity method.  See Note 3 of Notes to
          Consolidated Financial Statements and "Other Information --
          MetraHealth."  All of the businesses sold to MetLife or
          contributed to MetraHealth were included in the Company's Managed
          Care and Employee Benefits Operations.

                The periodic reports of Commercial Credit Company ("CCC"),
          Smith Barney Holdings Inc. ("SB Holdings"), and The Travelers
          Insurance Company ("TIC"), subsidiaries of the Company that make
          filings pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as





          amended (the "Exchange Act"), provide additional business and
          financial information concerning those companies and their
          consolidated subsidiaries.

                The principal executive offices of the Company are located
          at 65 East 55th Street, New York, New York  10022; telephone
          number 212-891-8900.  The Company plans to relocate its executive
          offices to 388 Greenwich Street, New York, New York 10013 during
          the second quarter of 1995.

                This discussion of the Company's business is organized as
          follows: (i) a description of each of the Company's four business
          segments; (ii) combined product line information for the
          property-casualty businesses; (iii) a description of the
          Corporate and Other Operations segment; and (iv) certain other
          information.  A glossary of insurance terms is included beginning
          on page 54.

                                 INVESTMENT SERVICES

                This segment includes the operations of SB Holdings and
          its subsidiaries and, through 1994, the mutual fund and other
          asset management activities of ACMR and the Company's interest in
          RCM Capital Management, a California Limited Partnership ("RCM").

          Smith Barney

                SB Holdings provides investment banking, asset management,
          brokerage and other financial services through its subsidiaries. 
          Its principal operating subsidiary is Smith Barney Inc. ("SBI"),
          an investment banking, securities trading and brokerage firm that
          traces its origins back to 1873.  In July 1993, SB Holdings
          acquired substantially all of the assets and certain of the
          liabilities of the domestic retail brokerage business and the
          asset management business of Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings
          Inc. and its subsidiaries ("SLB") for approximately $1.6 billion
          (the "Shearson Acquisition").  Smith Barney has agreed to pay
          additional amounts based upon its performance, consisting of up
          to $50 million per year for three years based on revenues and 10%
          of after-tax profits in excess of $250 million per year over a
          five-year period.  See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
          Statements.  As part of the Shearson Acquisition, The Robinson-
          Humphrey Company ("R-H"), a regional firm headquartered in
          Atlanta, Georgia, became a subsidiary of SBI.  As used herein,
          unless the context otherwise requires, "Smith Barney" refers to
          SB Holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries.

                Smith Barney operates through approximately 475 offices
          throughout the United States, and 12 offices in nine foreign
          countries.  With over 11,000 financial consultants, the Company
          believes that Smith Barney is the second largest brokerage firm
          in the United States.
































             Investment Banking and Securities Brokerage

                Smith Barney is an investment banking and securities
          trading and brokerage firm serving United States and foreign
          corporations, governments and institutional and individual
          investors.  Its business includes securities, options and
          commodities brokerage for domestic and international
          institutional and individual clients; underwriting and
          distribution of securities; arranging for the private placement
          of securities; assisting in mergers and acquisitions and
          providing financial advisory services; market making and trading
          in corporate debt and equity, United States government and agency,
          mortgage-related and municipal securities and foreign exchange,
          futures and forward contracts; customer financing activities; 
          securities lending activities; investment management and advisory
          services; securities research; and other related activities.

                Smith Barney's investment banking services include the
          underwriting of debt and equity issues for United States and
          foreign corporations and for state, local and other governmental
          authorities.  Frequently, Smith Barney acts as managing
          underwriter in corporate and public securities offerings.  Smith
          Barney also acts as a private placement agent for various
          clients.  In this role Smith Barney helps to place securities for
          clients with large institutions and other eligible investors. 
          Smith Barney also provides financial advice to investment banking
          clients on a wide variety of transactions including securities
          offerings, mergers and acquisitions and corporate restructurings.

                Smith Barney executes securities brokerage transactions on
          all major United States exchanges and distributes a wide variety
          of financial products.  It makes inter-dealer markets and trades
          as principal in corporate debt and equity securities primarily of
          United States corporate issuers, United States and foreign
          government and agency securities, mortgage-related securities,
          whole loans, municipal and other tax-exempt securities and
          emerging market debt securities.  The firm carries inventories of
          securities to facilitate sales to customers and other dealers and
          with a view to realizing trading gains.  SBI is one of the
          leading dealers in municipal securities and is a "Primary Dealer"
          in United States government securities, as designated by the
          Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  Its daily trading inventory
          positions in United States government and agency securities are
          financed largely through the use of repurchase agreements
          pursuant to which Smith Barney sells the securities and
          simultaneously agrees to repurchase them at a future date.  Smith
          Barney also acts as an intermediary between borrowers and lenders
          of short-term funds utilizing repurchase and reverse repurchase
          agreements.  Smith Barney uses derivative financial instruments
          to facilitate customer transactions and to manage exposure to
          interest rate, currency and market risk.  On a limited basis,
          Smith Barney also began structuring derivative financial
          instruments in 1994, as part of its proprietary trading
          activities.  In addition, for its own account Smith Barney
          engages in a limited manner in certain arbitrage activities,
          which primarily seek to benefit from temporary price
          discrepancies that occur with respect to related securities or to
          the same security on different markets.  Smith Barney also
          engages in the borrowing and lending of securities.  In June
          1994, the Smith Barney network of financial consultants began
          selling TIC individual products, primarily variable annuities. 
          See "Life Insurance Services -- Travelers Life and Annuities."

























                Smith Barney executes transactions in large blocks of
          exchange-listed stocks, usually with institutional investors, and
          often acts as principal to facilitate these transactions.  It
          makes markets, buying and selling as principal, in common stocks,
          convertible preferred stocks, warrants and other securities
          traded on the NASDAQ system or otherwise in the over-the-counter
          market.  Smith Barney also maintains trading positions in equity
          options, convertible securities, debt options, foreign exchange
          and commodities instruments.  It executes significant client
          transactions in both listed and unlisted options and in foreign
          exchange, and often acts as principal to facilitate these
          transactions.  Smith Barney also sells various types of
          structured securities on both a principal and an agency basis. 
          The firm's securities trading and investment activities involve
          significant risk in that the values of positions carried in its
          trading and investment accounts are subject to market
          fluctuations.  Smith Barney engages in a variety of financial
          techniques designed to manage this risk.

             Customer Financing

                Customers' securities transactions are executed on either
          a cash or margin basis.  Federal regulations prescribe the
          minimum original margin that must be deposited by securities
          purchasers, and exchange regulations prescribe the minimum
          margins that must be maintained by customers.  Smith Barney
          imposes margin maintenance requirements that are equal to or
          exceed those required by exchange regulations.  Such requirements
          are intended to reduce the risk assumed by Smith Barney that a
          market decline will reduce the value of a customer's collateral
          below the amount of the customer's indebtedness before the
          collateral can be sold.  Substantially all transactions in
          commodities futures contracts are on margin subject to individual
          exchange regulations.  Margin, in the case of commodities futures
          contracts, is primarily funded in the form of cash or United
          States Treasury securities. Commodities transactions involve 
          substantial risk, principally because of low margin requirements
          permitted by the exchanges.

                Income earned on financing customers' securities
          transactions provides Smith Barney with an additional source of
          income.  Credit losses may arise as a result of this financing
          activity; however, such losses have not been material.

             Asset Management

                Smith Barney provides asset management services to
          corporations, not-for-profit institutions, pension and profit-
          sharing plans, municipalities and individual investors in equity,
          fixed income and other securities, including commodities futures
          contracts.  The Smith Barney Consulting Group is a money
          management consulting service that offers "wrap fee" and other
          programs for individual as well as institutional investors. 
          "Wrap fee" accounts consist of customer accounts paying a single
          asset-based fee for multiple services that may include brokerage,
          custody and advisory services.  The Smith Barney TRAK(R) program
          provides investors with personalized investment management
          through a broad array of investment portfolios.  SBI receives a
          fee, but does not have specific investment discretion, with
          respect to assets invested through TRAK(R).

























                Smith Barney provides asset management services to, and
          sponsors, 132 separate portfolios within 50 investment companies
          that invest in United States and foreign corporate debt and
          equity securities, and municipal and United States and foreign
          government and agency securities, including 11 taxable or tax-
          exempt money market portfolios.  The portfolios managed by Smith
          Barney have various investment objectives, including growth,
          growth and income, income and tax-exempt income.  Smith Barney
          also provides investment management and advisory services to four
          affiliated insurance company separate accounts.

                At December 31, 1994, Smith Barney had total assets under
          management of approximately $74.1 billion, consisting of
          approximately $28.9 billion of money market funds, $26.0 billion
          of other mutual funds and closed-end funds and $19.2 billion of
          other portfolio assets of institutional and individual clients. 
          These amounts exclude assets held in trust by the trust companies
          owned directly by the Company and described under the heading
          "Miscellaneous Activities" below, except for the portion of such
          assets that are held in accounts actively managed by Smith
          Barney.  Smith Barney also sells mutual funds sponsored by other
          organizations.  In addition, Smith Barney's Unit Trust business
          (i.e., unit investment trusts that do not involve continuing
          investment management) consists of the TEST and CST series of
          securities trusts and other proprietary unit trusts.  The TEST
          and CST securities trusts, for which Smith Barney is the sole
          sponsor of the syndicate, consist of municipal and corporate
          securities.  A total of $2.8 billion par value of all series of
          TEST and CST trusts was outstanding as of December 31, 1994.  The
          other proprietary unit trusts, consisting primarily of equity and
          taxable bond trusts for which Smith Barney is the sole sponsor,
          have a market value of approximately $1.8 billion as of December
          31, 1994.  Smith Barney also participates in a syndicate that
          sponsors unit trusts including equity, taxable and tax-exempt
          fixed income trusts.

             Miscellaneous Activities

                In November 1994, Smith Barney sold its interest in HG
          Asia (Holdings) Limited ("HG Asia") for $55 million.  HG Asia and
          its subsidiaries act as brokers and dealers in securities that
          are primarily traded in countries in Asia.

                Certain subsidiaries of the Company are chartered as trust
          companies and provide a full range of fiduciary services with a
          particular emphasis on personal trust services.  Another
          subsidiary offers a broad range of trustee services for qualified
          retirement plans, with particular emphasis on the 401(k) plan
          market.  Each of these trust companies is subject to the
          supervision of the state banking authority where it was chartered
          and uses the distribution network of SBI to market its services. 
          Although these trust companies are subsidiaries of the Company
          and not of SB Holdings, their results are included with Smith
          Barney for segment reporting purposes.  Smith Barney provides
          certain advisory and support services to the trust companies and
          receives fees for such services.





























          Other Operations

                In December 1994, the Company sold all of the capital
          stock of ACMR owned by it to VKM for approximately $430 million. 
          Following the sale, ACMR was merged into a subsidiary of VKM, and
          the surviving entity was renamed VK/AC Holding, Inc. ("VK/AC
          Holding").  In connection with the transaction a subsidiary of
          the Company purchased common stock of VK/AC Holding, representing
          approximately 4.9% of the issued and outstanding common stock. 
          The Company also has an option to purchase up to an additional 5%
          of the common stock of VK/AC Holding, exercisable for a two-year
          period beginning in December 1999.  Certain subsidiaries of the
          Company continue to provide services to the Common Sense(R) II
          Funds.1  See "Life Insurance Services -- Primerica Financial
          Services."

                A subsidiary of the Company is the sole limited partner in
          RCM, a limited partnership headquartered in San Francisco,
          California, which provides investment management services,
          principally for pension funds, other institutional clients and
          high net worth individuals.  Assets under management by RCM were
          $22.4 billion at December 31, 1994, as compared to $24.5 billion
          at December 31, 1993 and $23.8 billion at December 31, 1992.

          General

             Competition

                The businesses included in the Investment Services segment
          are highly competitive.  The principal factors affecting
          competition in the investment banking and securities brokerage
          industry are the quality and ability of professional personnel
          and the relative prices of services and products offered.  In
          addition to competition from other investment banking firms, both
          domestic and international, and securities brokerage companies
          and discount securities brokerage operations, including regional
          firms in the United States, there has been increasing competition
          from other sources, such as commercial banks, insurance companies
          and other major companies that have entered the investment
          banking and securities brokerage industry, in many cases through
          acquisitions.  Certain of those competitors may have greater
          capital and other resources than Smith Barney.  The Federal
          Reserve Board has substantially removed the barrier originally
          erected by the Glass-Steagall Act restricting investment banking
          activities of commercial banks and their affiliates, by
          permitting certain commercial banks to engage, through
          affiliates, in the underwriting of and dealing in certain types
          of securities, subject to certain limitations.  Proposed
          legislation has been introduced in Congress that would modify
          certain other provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act and other laws
          and regulations affecting the financial services industry.  The
          potential impact of such legislation on the Company's businesses
          cannot be predicted at this time.

                Competitors of the Company's mutual funds and asset

          management and sales companies and asset management firms. 
          Competition in mutual fund sales and investment management is

          Regulation

                Certain of the Company's subsidiaries are registered as
          broker-dealers and as investment advisers with the Securities and
          Exchange Commission (the "Commission") and as futures commission
          merchants and as a commodity pool operator with the Commodity
          Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC").  SBI and R-H are members of
          the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE") and other
          principal United States securities exchanges, as well as the
          National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD") and the
          National Futures Association ("NFA"), a not-for-profit membership
          corporation which has been designated as a registered futures
          association by the CFTC.  SBI and R-H are registered as broker-
          dealers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto
          Rico, and in addition are registered as investment advisers in
          certain states that require such registration.  SBI is also a
          reporting dealer to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, a
          member of the principal United States futures exchanges and a
          registered broker-dealer in Guam.  Both SBI and R-H are subject
          to extensive regulation, primarily for the benefit of their
          customers, including minimum capital requirements, which are
          promulgated and enforced by, among others, the Commission, the
          CFTC, the NFA, the NYSE, various self-regulatory organizations of
          which SBI and R-H are members and the securities administrators of
          the 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico and, in SBI's
          case, Guam. The Commission and the CFTC also require certain
          registered broker-dealers (including SBI) to maintain records
          concerning certain financial and securities activities of affiliated
          companies that may be material to the broker-dealer, and to file
          certain financial and other information regarding such affiliated
          companies.

                In addition, the Investment Company Act of 1940 generally
          prohibits registered investment companies managed by affiliates
          of the Company from, among other things, entering into securities
          transactions on a principal basis with affiliated broker-dealers,
          including SBI, and restricts their ability to purchase securities
          in underwritings in which an affiliated broker-dealer
          participates as an underwriting syndicate member.  Transactions
          between Smith Barney and RCM are also subject to certain
          limitations.  

                Smith Barney's operations abroad, described in this
          paragraph, are conducted through various subsidiaries.  Smith
          Barney has representative offices in Paris, Beijing and Manama,
          Bahrain.  Its activities in the United Kingdom, which include
          investment banking, brokerage and asset management services, are
          subject to the Financial Services Act 1986, which regulates
          organizations that conduct investment businesses in the United
          Kingdom (including imposing capital and liquidity requirements),
          and to the rules of the Securities and Futures Authority and the
          Investment Management Regulatory Organisation.  Smith Barney is a
          member of the International Petroleum Exchange, the London Metals
          Exchange and the 























          London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, and
          as such is subject to the rules and regulations of those
          Exchanges.  In France, Smith Barney operates as a regulated
          securities house, a member of the MATIF, and an authorized mutual
          fund manager.  Smith Barney is a licensed securities company in
          Japan and, as such, its activities in Japan are subject to
          Japanese law applicable to foreign securities firms.  Smith
          Barney is also a member of the Tokyo Stock Exchange and,
          therefore, its activities in Japan are subject to the rules and
          regulations of that Exchange.  Smith Barney conducts securities
          and commodities businesses in Singapore which are regulated by
          the Monetary Authority of Singapore.  Additionally, certain
          subsidiaries of SB Holdings are registered as a "dealer" and
          "adviser" with the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission,
          as an "international dealer" and as an "investment dealer" with
          the Ontario Securities Commission, as broker-dealers with the
          Securities Board of The Netherlands and as a "B license holder"
          with the Zurich Stock Exchange.

                In connection with the mutual funds business, the Company
          and its subsidiaries must comply with regulations of a number of
          regulatory agencies and organizations, including the Commission
          and the NASD.  The Company is the indirect parent of investment
          advisers registered and regulated under the Investment Advisers
          Act of 1940, and of companies that distribute shares of mutual
          funds pursuant to distribution agreements subject to regulation
          under the Investment Company Act of 1940.  Under those Acts, the
          advisory contracts between the Company's investment adviser
          subsidiaries and the mutual funds they serve, as well as the
          mutual fund distribution agreements, would automatically
          terminate upon an assignment of such contracts by the investment
          adviser or the fund distribution company, as the case may be. 
          Such an assignment would be presumed to have occurred if any
          party were to acquire more than 25% of the Company's voting
          securities.  Continuation of advisory and distribution
          relationships under these circumstances could be achieved only by
          obtaining consent to the assignment from the shareholders of the
          mutual funds involved.

                SBI and R-H are members of the Securities Investor
          Protection Corporation ("SIPC"), which, in the event of
          liquidation of a broker-dealer, provides protection for
          customers' securities accounts held by the firm of up to $500,000
          for each eligible customer, subject to a limitation of $100,000
          for claims for cash balances.  In addition, Smith Barney has
          purchased additional coverage from a subsidiary of the Company,
          Gulf Insurance Company, for eligible customers.

                As registered broker-dealers, SBI and R-H are subject to
          the Commission's net capital rule (Rule 15c3-1, the "Net Capital
          Rule") promulgated under the Exchange Act.  SBI and R-H compute
          net capital under the alternative method of the Net Capital Rule
          which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital, as
          defined.  A member of the NYSE may be required to reduce its
          business if its net capital is less than 4% of aggregate debit
          balances (as defined) and may also be prohibited from expanding
          its business or paying cash dividends if resulting net capital
          would be less than 5% of aggregate debit balances.  Furthermore,
          the Net Capital Rule does not permit withdrawal of equity or
          subordinated capital if the resulting net capital would be less
          than 5% of such debit balances.

























                The Net Capital Rule also limits the ability of broker-
          dealers to transfer large amounts of capital to parent companies
          and other affiliates.  Under the Net Capital Rule, equity capital
          cannot be withdrawn from a broker-dealer without the prior
          approval of the Commission when net capital after the withdrawal
          would be less than 25% of its securities position "haircuts," or
          deductions from capital of certain specified percentages of the
          market value of securities to reflect the possibility of a market
          decline prior to disposition.  In addition, the Net Capital Rule
          requires broker-dealers to notify the Commission and the
          appropriate self-regulatory organization two business days before
          a withdrawal of excess net capital if the withdrawal would exceed
          the greater of $500,000 or 30% of the broker-dealer's excess net
          capital, and two business days after a withdrawal that exceeds
          the greater of $500,000 or 20% of excess net capital.  Finally,
          the Net Capital Rule authorizes the Commission to order a freeze
          on the transfer of capital if a broker-dealer plans a withdrawal
          of more than 30% of its excess net capital and the Commission
          believes that such a withdrawal would be detrimental to the
          financial integrity of the firm or would jeopardize the broker-
          dealer's ability to pay its customers.


                              CONSUMER FINANCE SERVICES


                The Company's Consumer Finance Services segment includes
          consumer lending services conducted primarily under the name
          "Commercial Credit," as well as credit-related insurance and
          credit card services.  CCC's predecessor was founded in 1912.

          Consumer Finance

                As of December 31, 1994, CCC maintained 828 loan offices
          in 42 states, and it plans to open approximately 50 additional
          offices in 1995.  The Company owns two state-chartered banks
          headquartered in Newark, Delaware, which generally limit their
          activities to offering credit card services nationwide.

                Loans to consumers by the Consumer Finance Services unit
          include secured and unsecured personal loans, both fixed and
          variable rate real estate-secured loans and loans to finance
          consumer goods purchases.  Credit card loans are discussed below. 
          CCC's loan offices are generally located in small to medium-sized
          communities in suburban or rural areas, and are managed by
          individuals who generally have considerable consumer lending
          experience.  The primary market for CCC's consumer loans consists
          of households with an annual income of $20,000 to $50,000.  The
          number of loan customers (excluding credit card customers) was
          approximately 1,250,000 at December 31, 1994, as compared to
          approximately 1,142,000 at December 31, 1993, and approximately
          1,058,000 at December 31, 1992.  A CCC loan program solicits
          applications for loans through the Primerica Financial Services
          sales force.  At December 31, 1994, the total loans outstanding
          generated from this program was approximately $1.1 billion, as
          compared to approximately $765 




























          million at December 31, 1993 and approximately $487 million at
          December 31, 1992.  See "Life Insurance Services -- Primerica
          Financial Services."

                The average amount of cash advanced per personal loan made
          was approximately $4,200 in 1994 and $3,800 in each of 1993 and
          1992.  The average amount of cash advanced per real estate-
          secured loan made was approximately $28,400 in 1994,
          approximately $28,800 in 1993 and approximately $26,000 in 1992. 
          The average annual yield for loans in 1994 was 15.41%, as
          compared to 15.83% in 1993 and 16.31% in 1992.  The average
          annual yield for personal loans in 1994 was 20.20%, as compared
          to 20.11% in 1993 and 19.99% in 1992, and for real estate-secured
          loans it was 12.20% in 1994, as compared to 13.14% in 1993 and
          14.05% in 1992.  The average yield for real estate-secured loans
          has been affected by the introduction in 1993 of a variable rate
          product and by decreases generally in prevailing market interest
          rates.  The Company's average net interest margin for loans was
          8.76% in 1994, 8.44% in 1993 and 8.66% in 1992.  

                In the late 1980's, both delinquencies and charge-offs had
          increased, reflecting the recessionary economic environment.  CCC
          took steps to combat this trend, by tightening the credit
          criteria used for making new loans and placing a greater emphasis
          on collection policies and practices.  As a result of these
          measures and recent economic trends, delinquency rates and
          charge-offs have improved from 1992 through 1994.  See
          "Delinquent Receivables and Loss Experience," below.

             Analysis of Consumer Finance Receivables

                For an analysis of consumer finance receivables, net of
          unearned finance charges ("Consumer Finance Receivables"), see
          Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

             Delinquent Receivables and Loss Experience

                Due to the nature of the finance business, some customer
          delinquency and loss is unavoidable.  The management of the
          consumer finance business attempts to control customer
          delinquencies through careful evaluation of each borrower's
          application and credit history at the time the loan is made or
          acquired, and appropriate collection activity.  An account is
          considered delinquent for financial reporting purposes when a
          payment is more than 60 days past due, based on the original or
          extended terms of the contract.  The delinquency and loss
          experience on real estate-secured loans is generally more
          favorable than on personal loans.

                The table on the next page shows the ratio of receivables
          delinquent for 60 days or more on a contractual basis (i.e., more
          than 60 days past due) to gross receivables outstanding:

          monthly benefits during periods of covered disability. Credit
          property insurance covers the loss of property given as security
          for loans. Other insurance products offered or arranged for by
          AHL include accidental death and dismemberment, auto single
          interest and involuntary unemployment insurance.  Most of AHL's
          products are single premium, which premiums are earned over the
          related contract period.  See "Life Insurance Services" for
          information concerning life and accident and health insurance
          other than credit-related insurance. 

                The following table sets forth gross written insurance
          premiums, net of refunds, for consumer finance customers:

                The increase in 1994 written premiums is primarily the
          result of the increase in receivables and expanded availability
          of certain products in additional states.

          Credit Card Services

                The Travelers Bank (formerly Primerica Bank), a subsidiary
          of CCC, is a state-chartered bank located in Newark, Delaware,
          which provides credit card services, including upper market gold
          credit card services, to individuals and to affinity groups (such
          as nationwide professional associations and fraternal
          organizations).  The Travelers Bank USA, another state-chartered
          bank subsidiary of CCC, was formed in September 1989.  The
          Travelers Bank USA is not subject to certain regulatory
          restrictions relating to growth and cross-marketing activities to
          which The Travelers Bank is subject.  See "Regulation" below. 
          These banks generally limit their activities to credit card
          operations.

                The table on the next page sets forth aggregate
          information regarding credit cards issued by The Travelers Bank
          and The Travelers Bank USA:

                                  (outstandings in millions)

                                      As of and for the year ended December 31,
                                     -----------------------------------------
                                             1994         1993        1992
                                             ----         ----        ----
Approximate total credit cardholders       621,000       534,000    423,000
Approximate gold credit cardholders        519,000       478,000    371,000
Total outstandings                         $712.5        $697.1     $538.2
Average annual yield                       11.88%        11.66%     12.12%


      The primary market for the banks' credit cards consists of
households with annual incomes of $40,000 and above.  

      The banks offer deposit-taking services (which as to The
Travelers Bank USA are limited to deposits of at least $100,000
per account).  At December 31, 1994, deposits of unaffiliated entities
were $73.3 million, as compared to $56.5 million at December 31, 1993
and $22.3 million at December 31, 1992.  The increase in deposits in
1993 primarily resulted from a balance transfer promotion conducted by 
The Travelers Bank.

Competition

      The consumer finance business competes with banks, savings
and loan associations, credit unions, credit card issuers and
other consumer finance companies.  Additionally, substantial
national financial services networks have been formed by major
brokerage firms, insurance companies, retailers and bank holding
companies.  Some competitors have substantial local market
positions; others are part of large, diversified organizations. 
Deregulation of banking institutions has greatly expanded the
consumer lending products permitted to be offered by these
institutions, and because of their long-standing insured deposit
base, many of them are able to offer financial services on very
competitive terms.  The Company believes that it is able to
compete effectively with such institutions.  In particular, the
Company believes that the diversity and features of the products
it offers, personal service and cultivation of repeat and
referral business support and strengthen its competitive position
in its Consumer Finance Services businesses.

Regulation

      Most consumer finance activities are subject to extensive
federal and state regulation.  Personal loan, real estate-secured
loan and sales finance laws generally require licensing of the
lender, limitations on the amount, duration and charges for
various categories of loans, adequate disclosure of certain
contract terms and limitations on certain collection practices
and creditor remedies.  Federal consumer credit statutes
primarily require disclosure of credit terms in consumer finance
transactions.  CCC's banks, which must undergo periodic
examination, are subject to additional regulations relating to
capitalization, 


















          leverage, reporting, dividends and permitted asset and liability
          products.  These banks are also covered by the Competitive
          Equality Banking Act of 1987 (the "Banking Act"), which, among
          other things, prevents the Company from acquiring or forming most
          types of new banks or savings and loan institutions and, with
          respect to The Travelers Bank, restricts cross-marketing of
          products by or of certain affiliates.  CCC's banks are also
          subject to the Community Reinvestment Act, which requires a bank
          to provide equal credit opportunity to all persons in such bank's
          delineated community.  The Company believes that it complies in
          all material respects with applicable regulations.  See
          "Insurance Services - General -- Regulation" at the end of the
          description of the Property & Casualty Insurance segment for a
          discussion of the regulatory factors governing the insurance
          businesses of CCC.

                The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974
          ("RESPA") has been extended to cover real estate-secured loans
          that are subordinated to other mortgage loans.  Generally, RESPA
          requires disclosure of certain information to customers and
          regulates the receipt or payment of fees or charges for services
          performed.

                Proposed legislation has been introduced in Congress that
          would modify certain laws and regulations affecting the financial
          services industry.  The potential impact of such legislation on
          the Company's businesses cannot be predicted at this time.


                               LIFE INSURANCE SERVICES


                The businesses in the Company's Life Insurance Services
          segment write principally individual life insurance, annuities
          and pension programs.  Most of these products are offered on a
          nationwide basis in the United States.  For information
          concerning the Company's credit-related insurance businesses, see
          "Consumer Finance Services."

                This segment includes the operations of The Travelers
          Insurance Company ("TIC") and the Primerica Financial Services
          group of companies (collectively, "PFS"), including Primerica
          Life Insurance Company ("Primerica Life").  TIC was incorporated
          in 1863.  With $40.5 billion of assets at December 31, 1994, the
          Company believes that TIC, Primerica Life and TIC's other
          subsidiaries together constitute one of the largest stock life
          insurance groups in the United States as measured by assets at
          December 31, 1994.

                Because the Company's interest in old Travelers in 1993
          was accounted for on the equity method, the Company's results of
          operations for periods prior to the Merger do not include the
          full results of TIC's business.  See Notes 1 and 4 of Notes to
          Consolidated Financial Statements.  For informational purposes,
          the premium and other operational information provided below
          includes TIC's businesses for all periods presented.
























          Primerica Financial Services

             Principal Markets and Methods of Distribution

                The business operations of the PFS group of companies
          involve the sale of insurance, mutual funds and other financial
          products, and consist of an affiliated group of companies engaged
          in (i) the underwriting and administration of individual term
          life insurance throughout the United States and in Canada and
          (ii) securities brokerage, consisting primarily of mutual fund
          sales.  The PFS sales force, composed of approximately 100,000
          independent agents, primarily markets term life insurance and
          certain other products of subsidiaries of the Company, including
          certain loans offered by the Company's consumer finance
          subsidiaries, and other products approved by the Company.  In
          1994, the PFS sales force began selling, on a test basis, certain
          property-casualty insurance products of The Travelers Indemnity
          Company.  See "Property & Casualty Insurance Services --
          Property-Casualty Personal Lines."  Because the great majority of
          the licensed sales force works on a part-time basis, a
          substantial portion of the sales force is inactive from time to
          time.  

                Primerica Life and its subsidiaries, Primerica Life
          Insurance Company of Canada and National Benefit Life Insurance
          Company ("NBL"), primarily offer individual term life insurance. 
          NBL provides statutory disability benefits in New York, as well
          as direct response student term life insurance nationwide. 
          Primerica Life and its subsidiaries together are licensed to sell
          and market term life insurance in all 50 states, the District of
          Columbia, Canada, Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands and
          Northern Mariana Islands.

                For information concerning PFS Investments Inc. ("PFS
          Investments"), see "Mutual Funds and Asset Management," below.

                Premium revenues, net of reinsurance, for PFS for the
          years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992 were $962.4 million,
          $889.9 million and $862.7 million, respectively.  The increase in
          premium revenues in recent years is primarily attributable to
          growth in production and in the retention of in force business. 
          See "Insurance Services - General -- Reinsurance," at the end of
          the description of the Property & Casualty Insurance Services
          segment, for a discussion of reinsurance.

          current pricing and reserves make adequate provision for AIDS-
          related claim experience.

             Mutual Funds and Asset Management

                PFS Investments is a registered broker-dealer and is the
          exclusive retail distributor of the Common Sense(R) Trust mutual
          funds.2  Since the Company's sale of ACMR, a number of intra-
          Company joint ventures, including companies that are part of PFS,
          continue to provide underwriting, transfer agency and custodial
          services to the Common Sense(R) Trust funds.  For the years ended
          December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, PFS Investments' total mutual
          fund sales were $1,322.2 million, $1,266.4 million and $1,071.2
          million, respectively, with sales of shares of the Common Sense(R)
          Trust funds and the

          American Capital family of mutual funds collectively accounting
          for approximately 74%, 75% and 81%, respectively, of total sales. 
          The overall increase in sales in recent years is primarily
          attributable to the economic environment and expanded marketing
          efforts for mutual funds.  At December 31, 1994, approximately
          24,000 independent agent members of the PFS sales force were also
          independent registered securities representatives of PFS
          Investments.

          Travelers Life and Annuities

                This section includes the businesses identified by old
          Travelers as Financial Services and Asset Management & Pension
          Services, as well as Transport Life Insurance Company and its
          affiliates ("Transport").  Transport specializes in accident and
          health insurance including cancer, heart/stroke and long-term
          care coverage, and became a subsidiary of TIC in connection with
          the Merger.

             Principal Products

                Travelers Life and Annuities offers individual life
          insurance, annuities and accident and health insurance to
          individuals and small businesses.  It also provides group pension
          deposit products, including guaranteed investment contracts, and
          annuities to employer-sponsored retirement and savings plans. 
          TIC views market specialization as a critical component of
          profitability and has updated its individual product portfolio
          with a range of competitively priced life, long-term care and
          fixed and variable annuity products for its customers.

                Individual life and accident and health insurance provide
          protection against financial loss due to death, illness or
          disability.  Life insurance is also used to meet estate, business
          planning and retirement needs.  Individual accumulation fixed and
          variable annuities are used for retirement funding purposes. 
          Variable annuities allow the policyholder to choose to direct
          deposits into a number of separate accounts, each of which has a
          different investment strategy.  Individual immediate annuities
          are used for structuring settlements of certain indemnity claims
          and making other payments to policyholders over a period of time. 
          In recent years, TIC has increased the amount of individual
          variable annuities that it sells.

                The table on the next page sets forth written premiums,
          net of reinsurance, and deposits for the Travelers Life and
          Annuities unit.

          (1)   Represents primarily structured settlement annuities, in
                which payments are currently being made to annuitants.
          (2)   The 1992 amount includes the adverse impact of downgrades
                in TIC's financial strength ratings and general industry
                conditions.  The 1993 increase reflects success in
                attracting guaranteed business in alternative markets. 
                Such business was not expected to, and did not, recur. 
                The 1994 decrease also reflects TIC's more selective
                approach to issuing guaranteed investment contracts.
          (3)   The 1993 increase reflects an increase in deposits to
                guaranteed separate accounts offset by a decrease in
                deposits to indexed separate accounts.  The 1994 decrease
                results from the decision, in the third quarter of 1993,
                to no longer market index funds, offset by the transfer by
                the Company of certain assets of one of its employee
                pension plans, which were previously managed externally.

                For information about reinsurance, see "Insurance Services
          - General -- Reinsurance" at the end of the description of the
          Property & Casualty Insurance Services segment.

             Principal Markets and Methods of Distribution

                TIC is licensed to sell and market its individual products
          in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam,
          the Bahamas and the U.S. and British Virgin Islands.

                Individual products are primarily marketed through three
          distribution channels:  independent agents, H.C. Copeland and
          Associates, Inc. ("Copeland") and the financial consultants of
          SBI.  Both Copeland and SBI are subsidiaries of the Company.  The






















independent agents, including a core group of approximately 450
professional life insurance general agencies, sell the majority
of the individual life and accident and health insurance and, in
1994, sold 39% of individual annuity premiums and deposits. 
Copeland accounted for 49% of 1994's individual annuity premiums
and deposits.  In June 1994, Smith Barney began distributing TIC
individual products, primarily variable annuities.  Smith Barney
accounted for 12% of total 1994 individual annuity premiums and
deposits.  The price of individual products is affected by long-
term assumptions as to interest, expenses and rates of mortality,
morbidity and persistency, as well as competitive and regulatory
considerations.

      TIC has significantly reduced its writing of group pension
contracts by adopting a more selective approach to the issuance
of guaranteed investment contracts.  Group pension products and
annuities are marketed by TIC's salaried staff directly to plan
sponsors and is also placed through independent consultants and
investment advisers.  The major factors affecting the pricing of
these contracts are the economics of the capital markets,
primarily the interest rate environment, the availability of
appropriate investments and surplus required to support this
business due to risk-adjusted capital standards.  The pricing of
products and services also reflects charges for expenses,
mortality, profit and other relevant financial factors such as

             Insurance Reserves and Contractholder Funds

                As life, accident and health insurance and annuity
          premiums are received, TIC establishes policy benefit reserves
          that reflect the present value of expected future obligations,
          net of the present value of expected future net premiums.  These
          reserves generally reflect long-term fixed obligations to
          policyholders and are based on assumptions as to interest rates,
          future mortality, morbidity, persistency and expenses, with
          provision for adverse deviation.  Policy benefit reserves, which
          give appropriate recognition to reinsurance, are established
          based on factors derived from past experience.

                Contractholder funds arise from the issuance of individual
          life contracts that include an investment component, deferred
          annuities and certain individual immediate annuity investment
          contracts. Contractholder funds are equal to deposits received
          and interest credited less withdrawals, mortality charges and
          administrative expenses.  Contractholder funds also include
          receipts from the issuance of pension investment contracts.

                AIDS-related claims paid by Travelers Life and Annuities
          in 1994 and 1993 were 2.1% and 1.2%, respectively, as a
          percentage of total life claims paid, and 1.5% and 0.7%,
          respectively, as a percentage of total health claims paid. 
          Management believes that current pricing and reserves make
          adequate provision for AIDS-related claim experience.

          Competition and Regulation

                For a description of competition and regulation relating
          to the Company's life insurance businesses, see "Insurance
          Services - General" at the end of the description of the Property
          & Casualty Insurance Services segment.


                        PROPERTY & CASUALTY INSURANCE SERVICES


                This segment includes the operations of The Travelers
          Indemnity Company and its subsidiary and affiliated property-
          casualty insurance companies ("Travelers Indemnity"), including
          Gulf Insurance Company and its subsidiaries ("Gulf").

                Because the Company's interest in old Travelers prior to
          the Merger was accounted for on the equity method, the Company's
          results of operations for periods prior to 1994 do not include
          the full results of the businesses of Travelers Indemnity.  See
          Notes 1 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  For
          informational purposes, the premium and other operational
          information provided below includes Travelers Indemnity's
          businesses prior to the Merger.  For additional information with
          respect to the combined property and casualty insurance
          businesses of the Company, see "Combined Property-Casualty
          Product Line Information."






























          Property-Casualty Commercial Lines

             Principal Products

                Property-Casualty Commercial Lines ("Commercial Lines") is
          organized to serve the needs of its customer base by market:
          National Accounts ("National"), Agency Marketing ("Agency"), and
          Specialty Lines ("Specialty").  Each marketing and underwriting
          area targets specific segments of the marketplace based upon size
          of business, nature of risk and specific customer needs. 
          National serves large organizations, as well as employee groups,
          associations and franchises, and includes the Company's residual
          market business.  Agency serves small and medium-sized
          businesses, with a strategic emphasis on the medium-sized
          businesses, and individuals with commercial exposures, through a
          network of independent agents and brokers.  Protection is
          afforded to customers of National and Agency for the risks of
          property loss such as fire and windstorm, financial loss such as
          business interruption, liability claims arising from operations
          and workers' compensation benefits through insurance products
          where risk is transferred from the customer to Commercial Lines. 
          Such coverages include workers' compensation, liability,
          automobile, property and multiple-peril.

                Commercial Lines also provides policy, loss and benefit
          administration through service agreements, and participates in
          state assigned risk pools.  The primary product serviced under
          these agreements is workers' compensation.  The Company
          emphasizes cost containment strategies and customer service in
          this market.  It has introduced managed care coupled with
          services such as toll free telephone numbers for reporting of
          claims and early intervention in the care process.

                Specialty is written through Gulf and Travelers Indemnity. 
          The principal products of Specialty include various forms of
          professional liability insurance, including directors' and
          officers' liability and medical malpractice insurance, product
          liability, fidelity bonds, commercial umbrella and excess
          insurance, excess property insurance, coverages relating to the
          entertainment and transportation industries, and standard
          commercial property and casualty products for specific niche
          markets.  Specialty also assumes various types of reinsurance on
          both a proportional and a non-proportional basis.

                In December 1994, Travelers Indemnity acquired from CCC
          the 50% of Gulf's parent corporation that it did not already own,
          making Gulf a wholly owned subsidiary of Travelers Indemnity.  As
          of January 1, 1995, Gulf discontinued writing regional property
          and casualty commercial lines of insurance and transferred all
          new and renewal business to Travelers Indemnity.  This allows
          Gulf to focus on its specialty lines of business.




























             Premium equivalents, presented in the tables below, represent
          estimates of premiums that customers would have been charged
          under a fully insured arrangement.  The amounts are based on
          expected losses associated with non-risk bearing components of
          each account, as determined in the pricing process.  Premium
          equivalents do not represent actual revenues.

                The following tables set forth written premiums, net of
          reinsurance, and premium equivalents for Commercial Lines.



             Principal Markets and Methods of Distribution

                National markets programs that involve both insurance
          (i.e., risk transfer) and risk service (i.e., claim settlement,
          loss control and risk management).  Customers range in size from
          businesses with sales of approximately $10 million per year to
          Fortune 1000 
































          corporations.  Each customer typically generates annual premiums
          of at least $1 million and generally selects products under
          retrospective rating plans, large self-insured retentions or some
          other loss-responsive arrangement.  National customers continue
          to demand increased levels of risk service programs where the
          ultimate cost is based on their own loss experience.  Based on
          premiums written and premium equivalents, National constituted
          approximately 60% of Commercial Lines' business in 1994.  These
          large customers are usually national in scope and highly complex
          in their operations.

                A significant portion of Commercial Lines business is
          written with retrospectively rated insurance policies in which
          the ultimate cost of insurance for a given policy year is
          dependent on the loss experience of the insured.  This type of
          policy limits the insurance risk to Commercial Lines.  The
          payment terms and long-term nature of the loss development
          reduces insurance risk and introduces some additional credit
          risk.  Receivables from retrospectively rated policies totaled
          approximately $1.0 billion at December 31, 1994.  Collateral,
          primarily letters of credit, is generally required for contracts
          that provide for deferred collection of ultimate premiums.  The
          amount of collateral required is predicated upon the
          creditworthiness of the client and the nature of the insured
          risks.  Commercial Lines continually monitors credit risk of
          individual accounts and the adequacy of collateral.

                The residual market business of Commercial Lines sells
          claim and policy management services to workers' compensation
          assigned risk pools throughout the country.  Since 1993, these
          contracts have been awarded through a formal bid process intended
          to reduce the number of servicing carriers and to measure the
          quality of service being provided.  Contracts are awarded for a
          term of three years and about one-third of the states are bid
          each year.  Travelers Indemnity has thus far been successful in
          winning nine of 14 bids.

                Agency, which made up approximately 35% of Commercial
          Lines' business in 1994, sells a broad range of commercial
          property-casualty products to small and medium-sized customers. 
          Small accounts tend to be more price-sensitive and make up
          approximately 27% of Agency's business.  The core products for
          the small customer are package contracts covering property and
          general liability exposures.  The product choice for the medium-
          sized customer is a retrospectively rated or a large deductible
          contract covering workers' compensation.  Other coverages are
          sold to complement the core products.  Products are distributed
          primarily through independent agents (for small customers) and
          brokers (for medium-sized customers) working with Travelers
          Indemnity's marketing and underwriting specialists in a field
          office network of 42 locations.  Agency continues to selectively
          streamline its distribution force as management focuses on
          selected markets and producers.

                Travelers Indemnity is also a member of, and therefore
          participates in, the underwriting operations of insurance and
          reinsurance pools and associations, several of which make
          independent underwriting decisions on behalf of their members. 
          These pools insure specialized risks such as property exposures
          of large manufacturing plants, nuclear power plants and
          transporters of nuclear materials and other specialty risks.
























             Specialty products are marketed to small, medium, and large
          customers and are distributed primarily through wholesale brokers
          and other specialty producers, including underwriting managers
          for specific industry programs.  The Company's Specialty business
          requires specialized underwriting and generally has better
          combined ratios and lower loss frequencies than traditional
          lines.

                The following table shows the distribution of Commercial
          Lines' 1994 premiums for the states that accounted for the
          majority of the premium volume.

             Pricing levels for property and casualty insurance products
          are generally developed based upon estimated losses, the expenses
          of producing business and administering claims, and a reasonable
          allowance for profit.  In addition, most retrospective rating
          plans contain sufficient flexibility that the subjective
          evaluation of a risk by the underwriter can be incorporated in
          the pricing.  In guaranteed cost products, however, loss cost
          inflation has outpaced marketplace price changes.  In addition,
          current economic conditions have constrained business growth,
          thereby decreasing the size of customers' workforces and
          consequently reducing the insurable market.

                A variety of factors continue to affect the casualty
          market.  The Company attempts to avoid exposure to high hazard
          liability risks through careful underwriting, extensive use of
          retrospective rating and reliance on financially secure
          reinsurers.  The workers' compensation line has improved
          dramatically across the industry over the past few years,
          particularly during the last two years, in part due to loss
          management efforts of the insureds and providers such as
          Travelers Indemnity.  These trends are also reflected in the
          workers' compensation book of business at Commercial Lines, where
          workers' compensation combined ratios after policyholder
          dividends have improved from 105.6% in 1992 to 99.8% in 1994. 
          The improvement is due to a variety of factors including, but not
          limited to, legislative reform, economic conditions, insurer
          investment, employer involvement and lower medical inflation. 
          This business is subject to retrospective rating premium
          adjustments, and 




























          accordingly the net impact on results of operations of the
          premium adjustment and loss reserve development is minimal.  In
          addition, because of the improving trends within workers'
          compensation, insurers have increased their voluntary market
          share, thereby reducing the size of the involuntary market. 
          Travelers Indemnity's service volume from the National Council on
          Compensation Insurance has declined from $638 million in 1993 to
          $431 million in 1994.  However, its direct assignment volume has
          increased from $26 million for the year ended December 31, 1993
          to $217 million for the year ended December 31, 1994.  Under
          direct assignment, Travelers Indemnity acts as a third-party
          administrator for other insurance carriers to fulfill their
          involuntary pool requirement.

                In the commercial property market, 1994 was another
          difficult year for natural catastrophes.  While the industry's
          catastrophe losses were approximately $13 billion on a pre-tax
          basis, Commercial Lines' catastrophe losses for 1994 totalled $33
          million, pre-tax.  The commercial property market capacity
          remained adequate during 1994, keeping downward pressure on
          pricing. 

                In most lines, pricing did not improve during the past
          year.  For Agency, the duration of the current downturn in the
          underwriting cycle continues to pressure the pricing of
          guaranteed cost products.  In the small account market, which
          primarily buys guaranteed cost products, price increases have not
          exceeded loss cost inflation for several years.  The focus is to
          retain existing profitable business and obtain new accounts where
          the Company can maintain its selective underwriting policy.  The
          Company continues to adhere to strict guidelines to maintain high
          quality underwriting, which could affect future premium levels. 
          Because of its large fee-for-service component, National business
          is less affected by pricing; however, the pricing of large
          account business continues to be very competitive.  Customer
          retention levels remained high in 1994 as a result of Travelers
          Indemnity's continued delivery of quality service, primarily
          claims management focused on loss cost reduction.

                See "Insurance Services - General -- Reinsurance" below
          for information regarding reinsurance.

             Hazardous Substances

                The Special Liability Group ("SLG") was established in
          1986 to deal exclusively with environmental exposures and other
          exposures of a cumulative nature.  SLG is essentially a claim
          operation, segregated from other claim areas within the Company. 
          Its objective is to fulfill all of the Company's contractual
          obligations to its policyholders in a manner that most
          effectively preserves corporate assets.

                Environmental Claims

                As a result of various state and federal regulatory
          efforts aimed at environmental remediation (particularly
          "Superfund"), the insurance industry has been, and continues to
          be, involved in extensive litigation involving policy coverage
          and liability issues.  The possible 


























          reauthorization of Superfund in 1995 may have some effect on the
          resolution of these issues, but it is not possible at the present
          time to determine what the potential impact, if any, will be.  In
          addition to the regulatory pressures, certain court decisions
          have expanded insurance coverage beyond the original intent of
          the insurer and insured, frequently involving policies that were
          issued prior to the mid-1970s.  The results of court decisions
          affecting the industry's coverage positions continue to be
          inconsistent.  Accordingly, the ultimate responsibility and
          liability for environmental remediation costs remain uncertain.  

                Certain of the Company's subsidiaries are part of the
          industry segment affected by these issues and continue to receive
          claims alleging liability exposures arising out of insureds'
          alleged disposition of toxic substances.  The review of
          environmental claims includes an assessment of the probable
          liability, available coverage, judicial interpretations and
          historic value of similar claims.  In addition, the unique facts
          presented in each claim are evaluated individually and
          collectively.  Due consideration is given to the many variables
          presented in each claim, such as: the nature of the alleged
          activities of the insured at each site; the allegations of
          environmental damage at each site; the number of sites; the total
          number of potentially responsible parties at each site; the
          nature of environmental harm and the corresponding remedy at a
          site; the nature of government enforcement activities at each
          site; the ownership and general use of each site; the willingness
          and ability of other potentially responsible parties to
          contribute to the cost of the required remediation at each site;
          the contractual relationship between the Company and the insured;
          the identification of other insurers; the potential coverage
          available, if any; the number of years of coverage, if any; the
          obligation to provide a defense to insureds, if any; and the
          applicable law in each jurisdiction.  Analysis of these and other
          factors on a case-by-case basis results in the ultimate reserve
          assessment.

          Company at December 31, 1994 were $471 million, net of
          reinsurance of $11 million.  Approximately 14% of the net
          environmental loss reserve (i.e., approximately $65 million) is
          case reserve for resolved claims.  The Company does not post
          individual case reserves for environmental claims in which there
          is a coverage dispute until the dispute is resolved.  Until then,
          the estimated amounts for disputed coverage claims are carried in
          a bulk reserve, together with unreported environmental losses.

                The industry does not have a standard method of
          calculating claim activity for environmental losses.  Generally,
          for environmental claims, the Company establishes a claim file
          for each insured on a per site, per claimant basis.  If there is
          more than one claimant, e.g., a federal and a state agency.  This
          method will result in two claims being set up for a policyholder
          at that one site.  The Company adheres to its method of
          calculating claim activity on all environmental-related claims,
          whether such claims are tendered on primary, excess or umbrella
          policies.  

                As of December 31, 1994, the Company had approximately
          8,200 pending environmental-related claims and had resolved over
          17,200 such claims since 1986.  
























          Approximately 70% of the pending environmental-related claims in
          inventory represent active federal or state EPA-type claims
          tendered by approximately 640 insureds.  The balance represents
          bodily injury claims alleging injury due to the discharge of
          insureds' waste or pollutants.

                To date, the Company generally has been successful in its
          coverage litigation and continues to reduce its potential
          exposure through favorable settlements with certain insureds. 
          These settlement agreements are based on the variables presented
          in each piece of coverage litigation.  Generally the settlement
          dollars paid in disputed coverage claims are a percentage of the
          total coverage sought by such insureds.  In addition, with
          respect to many of the environmental claims there is a "buy-back"
          of the liability under the policy by the Company, together with
          appropriate indemnities and hold harmless provisions to protect
          the Company.

                Asbestos Claims

                In the area of asbestos claims, the property and casualty
          insurance industry has suffered from judicial interpretations
          that have attempted to maximize insurance availability from both
          a coverage and liability standpoint far beyond the intentions of
          the contracting parties.  These policies generally were issued
          prior to the 1980s.  Originally the cases involved mainly plant
          workers and traditional asbestos manufacturers and distributors. 
          However, in the mid-1980s, a new group of plaintiffs, whose
          exposure to asbestos was less direct and whose injuries were
          often speculative, began to file lawsuits in increasing numbers
          against the traditional defendants as well as peripheral
          defendants who had produced products that may have contained
          small amounts of encapsulated asbestos.  These claims continue to
          arise and on an individual basis generally involve smaller
          companies with smaller limits of potential coverage.  There has
          emerged a group of nonproduct claims by plaintiffs, mostly
          independent labor union workers, mainly against companies,
          alleging exposure to asbestos while working at these companies'
          premises.  In addition, various insurers, including Travelers
          Indemnity, remain defendants in a widely publicized action
          brought in Philadelphia regarding potential consolidation and
          resolution of future asbestos bodily injury claims.  The
          cumulative effect of these claims and the judicial actions on the
          Company and its insureds currently is uncertain.

                Also various classes of asbestos defendants, including
          major product manufacturers, peripheral and regional product
          defendants as well as premises owners, continue to tender
          asbestos-related claims to the industry.  Since each insured
          presents different liability and coverage issues, the Company
          evaluates those issues on an insured-by-insured basis.

                The Company's evaluations have not resulted in any
          meaningful data from which an average asbestos defense or
          indemnity payment may be determined.  The varying defense and
          indemnity payments made by the Company on behalf of its insureds
          has also precluded the Company from deriving any meaningful data
          by which it can predict whether its defense and indemnity
          payments for asbestos claims (on average or in the aggregate)
          will remain the same or change in the future.

























             Asbestos loss and loss expense reserves of the Company at
          December 31, 1994 were $383 million, net of reinsurance of $319
          million.  Approximately 85% of the net asbestos reserves at
          December 31, 1994 represented incurred but not reported losses.


                In relation to these asbestos and environmental-related
          claims, the Company carries on a continuing review of its overall
          position, its reserving techniques and reinsurance recoverable. 
          In each of these areas of exposure, the Company has endeavored to
          litigate individual cases and settle claims on favorable terms. 
          Given the inconsistencies of court coverage decisions,
          plaintiffs' expanded theories of liability, the risks inherent in
          major litigation and other uncertainties, it is not presently
          possible to quantify the ultimate exposure or range of exposure
          represented by these claims to the Company's financial condition,
          results of operations or liquidity.  The Company believes that it
          is reasonably possible that the outcome of the uncertainties
          regarding environmental and asbestos claims could result in a
          liability exceeding the reserves by an amount that would be
          material to operating results in a future period.  However, it is
          not likely these claims will have a material adverse effect on
          the Company's financial condition or liquidity.

                For additional information regarding asbestos and
          environmental-related claims, see the discussion in Item 7 of
          this Form 10-K, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
          Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

          Property-Casualty Personal Lines

             Principal Products

                Property-Casualty Personal Lines ("Personal Lines") writes
          virtually all types of property and casualty insurance covering
          personal risks.  The primary coverages in Personal Lines are
          automobile and homeowners insurance sold to individuals, which
          account for 97% of the premium volume.  Automobile policies
          provide coverage for liability to others for both bodily injury
          and property damage, and for physical damage to an insured's own
          vehicle from collision and various other perils.  In addition,
          many states require policies to provide first-party personal
          injury protection, frequently referred to as no-fault coverage.

                Homeowners policies are available for dwellings,
          condominiums, mobile homes and rental property contents. 
          Protection against losses to dwellings and contents from a wide
          variety of perils is included in these policies, as well as
          coverage for liability arising from ownership or occupancy.

                In October 1994, Travelers Indemnity sold Bankers and
          Shippers Insurance Company to Integon Corporation for
          approximately $142 million.  Bankers and Shippers Insurance
          Company primarily writes nonstandard private passenger automobile
          insurance.

























             The following table sets forth written premiums, net of

             Principal Markets and Methods of Distribution

                Personal Lines business is distributed through
          approximately 3,000 independent agencies, supported by a network
          of 15 field marketing offices and two regional service centers. 
          The principal markets for Personal Lines insurance are in states
          along the east coast, in the south, and in the mid-west.

                Personal Lines has implemented various programs over the
          past five years in order to improve operating and financial
          results, including expense reductions, the termination of
          contracts of underperforming agents and the withdrawal from
          markets where Personal Lines had a small market share or saw
          little potential for long-term, profitable growth.  While these
          actions have reduced the overall size of the Personal Lines
          business, the core automobile and homeowners insurance businesses
          have begun to grow in terms of policy counts and premium volume.

                In 1994, Personal Lines began writing private passenger
          automobile and homeowners insurance that was marketed on a test
          basis by licensed members of the PFS sales force in two states. 
          This program is expected to expand during 1995 to additional
          states.

                For 1994, Personal Lines business was concentrated in the
          states shown in the table on the next page.

          ______________________________
          (1)   No one of these states accounted for as much as 3.0% of
          the total.

                In addition, approximately 49% of Personal Lines'
          homeowners premiums in 1994 was in New York, Florida,
          Massachusetts and New Jersey.

                Pricing for automobile insurance is driven by changes in
          the relative frequency of claims and by inflation in the cost of
          automobile repairs, medical care and litigation of liability
          claims.  As a result, the profitability of the business is
          largely dependent on promptly identifying and rectifying
          disparities between premium levels and expected claim costs, and
          obtaining the indicated rate increases.  Premiums charged for
          physical damage coverages reflect insured car values and,
          accordingly, premium levels are somewhat related to the volume of
          new car sales.

                In addition to the normal risks associated with any
          multiple-peril coverage, the profitability and pricing of
          homeowners insurance is affected by the incidence of natural
          disasters, particularly tornadoes and hurricanes.  Most policies
          offer automatic increases in coverage to reflect growth in
          replacement costs and property values.

                The high level of catastrophe losses in recent periods has
          led to an expansion of the reinsurance market without a
          corresponding decrease in reinsurance costs.  These factors have
          resulted in a reduced availability of homeowners insurance and
          have led to higher prices for homeowners policies in some
          markets.

                Several insurance companies have attempted to limit their
          writings in coastal areas of the country as a result of heavy
          claim losses sustained from Hurricane Andrew.  Travelers
          Indemnity has stopped writing new homeowners policies in certain
          counties in South Florida and in coastal areas of New York and
          Connecticut.  In addition, Travelers Indemnity has reduced
          agents' commissions on homeowners insurance in certain markets
          within those states previously identified, strengthened
          underwriting standards, implemented price increases, and
          purchased additional reinsurance to limit its exposure to future
          catastrophe losses.  Changes to a company's methods of marketing
          and underwriting in coastal areas of Florida and New 



























          York are subject to state-imposed restrictions, the general
          effect of which is to retard an insurer's ability to withdraw
          from such areas.  While homeowners premium volume in Florida for
          1994 was substantially level with 1993, gross exposure to
          catastrophe loss was lower due to a decline in the number of
          policies written, offset by price increases.

          Reinsurance

                Reinsurance is subject to collectibility in all cases and
          to aggregate loss limits in certain cases.  The Company remains
          primarily liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. 
          Reinsurance recoverables are reported after allowances for
          uncollectible amounts.  The Company also holds collateral
          including escrow funds and letters of credit under certain
          reinsurance agreements.  Uncollectible reinsurance recoverables
          have not had, and management does not expect that any amounts
          becoming uncollectible in the future would have, a material
          adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the
          Company.  For additional information concerning reinsurance, see
          Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

                Reinsurers are selected based on their financial position
          and business practices.  The Company monitors the financial
          condition of reinsurers on an ongoing basis, and reviews its
          reinsurance arrangements periodically.

                At December 31, 1994, the Company had $4.3 billion in
          property-casualty reinsurance recoverable.  Of this amount, $2.6
          billion was ceded to pools and associations, which have the
          strength of the participating insurance companies supporting
          these cessions.  




















          The remainder is due from reinsurers.  The two largest
          reinsurers, Lloyd's of London and General Reinsurance
          Corporation, had assumed losses from the Company at December 31,
          1994 of $215 million and $142 million, respectively.  Lloyd's of
          London is currently undergoing restructuring to seek to obtain
          additional capital and to segregate claims for years before 1986. 
          The ultimate effect of this restructuring on the Company's
          reinsurance recoverable is not yet known.  The Company does not
          believe that any uncollectible amounts of reinsurance recoverables
          would be material to its results of operations, financial condition
          or liquidity. See Item 3, "Legal Proceedings," for additional 
          information regarding Lloyd's of London.

             Life Insurance

                The Company's policy is to obtain reinsurance on
          individual life policies for amounts above certain retention
          limits, which limits vary with age and underwriting
          classification.  During 1994, certain subsidiaries of the Company
          increased the level of reinsurance on certain policies. 
          Retention on life insurance risks after reinsurance varies up to
          a maximum of $1.5 million per insured for an ordinary life risk,
          depending on the subsidiary involved, the type of policy, the
          year of issue and the age of the insured.  Other reinsurance
          arrangements are made from time to time to cede or assume
          existing blocks of business.

             Property and Casualty Insurance

                Currently, for third-party liability, including automobile
          no-fault, the reinsurance agreements used by Commercial Lines
          limit its net retention to a maximum of $5 million per insured,
          per occurrence.  For commercial property insurance, there is a $5
          million retention per insured with 100% coverage for risks with
          higher limits.  For large accounts, reinsurance arrangements are
          typically tiered, or layered, such that only levels of risk
          acceptable to the Company are retained.  The reinsurance
          agreements in place for Personal Lines cover 90% of each loss
          between $2 million and $6 million for all third-party liability,
          including automobile no-fault.

                In addition to traditional reinsurance agreements that
          serve to control its exposure to loss, Travelers Indemnity acts
          as a servicing carrier for many pools and associations, such as
          workers' compensation pools.  These transactions are reflected as
          direct business on the Company's books and records.  This
          business is then ceded to the pools and recorded as reinsurance
          ceded.

                Catastrophe Reinsurance


                The Company utilizes reinsurance agreements with nonaffiliated
          reinsurers to control its exposure to losses resulting from one 
          occurrence. For the accumulation of net property losses arising out
          of one occurrence, reinsurance coverage averages 75% of total losses
          between $175 million and $375 million.  For multiple workers' 
          compensation losses arising from a single occurrence, reinsurance
          coverage averages 100% of losses between $10 million and $160 million
          and for losses caused by property perils reinsurance coverage averages
          75% of losses between $175 million and $345 million.


























          For Agency-produced commercial property insurance, 25% of all
          losses were reinsured in 1994, subject to an occurrence limitation
          of 200% of ceded premium or an estimated $225 million.  In 1995,
          the quota share is 20%, with a fixed dollar occurrence limit of $225
          million. For Personal Lines homeowners insurance, in 1994, 30% of
          losses were reinsured up to a maximum recovery of $96 million, and for
          1995, 16.25% of losses will be reinsured up to a maximum recovery
          of $64 million per occurrence.

          Competition and Other Factors Affecting Growth

             Life Insurance

                The Company's life insurance businesses compete with
          national, regional and local insurance companies.  Competition is
          based upon price, product design and services rendered to
          producers and policyholders.  The insurance industry is extremely
          competitive, in both price and services, and no single insurer is
          dominant.  Insurance companies that operate through salaried
          personnel and employee agents may benefit from cost advantages,
          once they have achieved sufficient size, over insurers that
          utilize independent agents and brokers.  The PFS sales force is
          composed of independent commissioned agents, and approximately
          40% of the Travelers Life and Annuities individual annuity
          premiums and deposits were sold through independent agents.  PFS
          competes in its market segment by emphasizing the value of term
          life insurance, and aggressively markets its products which often
          replace existing life insurance policies underwritten by other
          companies, including cash value whole life policies.  In January
          1995, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that national banks may sell
          annuities.  It is not clear at this time whether the decision
          will have a positive or negative impact upon the Company's
          annuity sales.

                Savings banks also compete directly in the sale of life
          insurance in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York. 
          Competition for the savings dollar arises from entities such as
          banks, investment advisers, mutual funds and other financial
          institutions.

                PFS Investments is registered as a broker-dealer with the
          SEC, in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the
          Virgin Islands and Guam, and is a member of the NASD.  It is
          subject to extensive regulation by those agencies and the
          securities administrators of those jurisdictions, primarily for
          the benefits of its customers, including minimum capital and
          licensing requirements.  PFS Investments faces competition not
          only from large financial services firms offering products and
          services that cross traditional business boundaries, but also
          from insurance companies, including other subsidiaries of the
          Company, offering life insurance products with investment
          features.






























             Property and Casualty Insurance

                The insurance industry is represented in the commercial
          lines marketplace by many insurance companies of varying size. 
          Companies may be small local firms, large regional firms or large
          national firms, as well as self-insurance programs or captive
          insurers.  Market competition, regulated by state insurance
          departments, works to set the price charged for insurance
          products and the level of service provided.  Growth is driven by
          a company's ability to provide insurance and services at a price
          that is reasonable and acceptable to the customer.  In addition,
          the marketplace is affected by available capacity of the
          insurance industry as measured by policyholders' surplus. 
          Surplus expands and contracts primarily in conjunction with
          profit levels generated by the industry.  Growth in premium and
          service business is also measured by a company's ability to
          retain existing customers and to attract new customers.

                In addition to traditional insurance services, National
          offers to risk managers of large national accounts programs that
          provide increased flexibility in selecting loss prevention and
          claim services, and premium payment plans.  This business is
          highly competitive on the basis of quality of service provided
          and somewhat sensitive to price competition, and is written
          primarily by Travelers Indemnity and several other very large
          companies.  New business levels remained strong in 1994, and
          retentions remained high in both traditional insurance products
          and risk service programs.

                The bid process for selecting servicing carriers to
          administer the involuntary pools is ongoing and is intended to
          reduce the number of servicing carriers while increasing the
          quality of service being provided.  As the number of servicing
          carriers is significantly reduced, the market share of the
          remaining carriers is likely to grow.  The Company believes that
          a successful bid strategy will allow it to maintain a significant
          market presence in the face of these changes.

                Overhead reductions and improved efficiency through
          automation are key competitive issues for Agency business. 
          During the past several years, Agency management has taken
          significant steps to streamline this operation and establish
          efficiencies to make these products more competitive in the
          marketplace.  In addition, Travelers Indemnity believes that its
          breadth of products, highly qualified field staff and applied
          technology provide for distinct competitive advantages.  The
          highly competitive business for medium-sized accounts has
          historically been written by companies dealing through agents and
          brokers, although some direct writing companies are represented
          in the field.  A competitive advantage resides in local
          representation and underwriting authority.  With emphasis on
          regional locations and resident entrepreneurs marketing the full
          spectrum of Travelers Indemnity's commercial products, Travelers
          Indemnity believes it has created significant opportunity for
          growth in this area.

                The marketplace in which Specialty competes includes small
          to medium-sized niche companies that focus on certain types of
          risk and larger companies or branches/divisions of 


























          multi-line companies that offer numerous products covering
          various risks.  Distribution of products is generally through
          wholesale and/or retail brokers.  Specialty's underwriting
          responsiveness and quality are key to maintaining broker
          relationships.  A competitive advantage resides in the cross-
          selling opportunities of Specialty products through Agency and
          National underwriters, agents and brokers.

                The insurance industry is represented in the personal
          lines marketplace by many hundreds of insurance companies of
          varying size.  Although national companies write the majority of
          the business, local or regional companies are effective
          competitors because of their expense structure or because they
          specialize in providing coverage to particular risk groups.

                Personal automobile and homeowners insurance is marketed
          mainly through one of two distribution systems: independent
          agents or direct writing.  The Company's Personal Lines unit
          operates through 3,000 independent agents who usually represent
          several unrelated property-casualty companies.  Direct writing
          companies operate either by mail or through exclusive agents or
          sales representatives.  Due in part to the expense advantage that
          direct writers typically have relative to agency companies, the
          direct writers have been able to gradually expand their market
          share.  Personal Lines continues to focus on the independent
          agency distribution system, recognizing the service and
          underwriting advantages the agent can deliver.  In addition,
          Personal Lines has taken advantage of complementary distribution
          mechanisms, including affinity groups, mortgage lenders and the
          independent agents of the PFS sales force, and plans to continue
          to pursue other opportunities as they arise.

                In recent years, reductions in the volume of Personal
          Lines voluntary business have caused similar reductions in the
          involuntary business assigned to the Company.  However, this
          trend has been somewhat offset by increases in the size of many
          of the pools themselves.  Intense regulation in the personal
          automobile insurance business has caused some insurance companies
          to withdraw from or reduce their writings in the personal lines
          market, which has forced more individuals to obtain insurance in
          the involuntary market.

          Regulation

                The Company's insurance subsidiaries are subject to
          considerable regulation and supervision by insurance departments
          or other authorities in each state or other jurisdiction in which
          they transact business.  The laws of the various jurisdictions
          establish supervisory and regulatory agencies with broad
          administrative powers.  The purpose of such regulation and
          supervision is primarily to provide safeguards for policyholders,
          rather than to protect the interests of the insurers'
          stockholders.   Typically, state regulation extends to such
          matters as licensing companies, regulating the type, amount and
          quality of permitted investments, licensing agents, regulating
          aspects of a company's relationship with its agents, requiring
          triennial financial examinations, market conduct surveys, reports
          on financial condition, recording complaints, restricting expenses,
          commissions and new business issued, restricting use of some 
          underwriting criteria, regulating rates, forms and advertising, 
























          specifying what might constitute unfair practices, fixing maximum
          interest rates on policy loans and establishing minimum reserve
          requirements and minimum policy surrender values.  Such powers
          also extend to premium rate regulation, which varies from open
          competition to limited review upon implementation, to requirements
          for prior approval for rate changes.  State regulation may also cover
          capital and surplus and actuarial reserve maintenance, setting 
          solvency standards, mandating loss ratios for certain kinds of 
          insurance, limiting the grounds for cancellation or nonrenewal of
          policies and regulating solicitation and replacement practices.
          State laws also regulate transactions and dividends between an
          insurance company and its parent or affiliates, and require prior
          approval or notification of any change in control of an insurance
          subsidiary.  In addition, under insurance holding company legislation,
          most states regulate affiliated groups with respect to intercorporate
          transfers of assets, service arrangements and dividend payments from
          insurance subsidiaries.

                The insurance industry generally is exempt from federal
          antitrust laws because of the application of the McCarran-
          Ferguson Act.  In recent years, legislation has been introduced
          to modify or repeal the McCarran-Ferguson Act.  The effect of any
          such modification or repeal cannot currently be determined.

                Virtually all states mandate participation in insurance
          guaranty associations and/or insolvency funds, which assess
          insurance companies in order to fund claims of policyholders of
          insolvent insurance companies.  Under these arrangements,
          insurers are assessed their proportionate share (based on
          premiums written for the relevant lines of insurance in that
          state each year) of the estimated loss and loss expense of
          insolvent insurers.  Similarly, as a condition to writing a line
          of property and casualty business, many states mandate
          participation in "fair plans" and/or "assigned risk pools" that
          underwrite insurance for individuals and businesses that are
          otherwise unable to obtain insurance.  Participation is based on
          the amount of premiums written in past years by the participating
          company in an individual state for the classes of insurance
          involved.  These plans or pools traditionally have been
          unprofitable, although the effect of their performance has been
          partially mitigated in certain lines of insurance by the states'
          allowance of increases in rates for business voluntarily written
          by plan or pool participants in such states.  For workers'
          compensation plans or pools the effect may be further mitigated
          by the method of participation selected by insurance companies.

                In addition to state insurance laws, the Company's
          insurance subsidiaries are also subject to general business and
          corporation laws, state securities laws, consumer protection
          laws, fair credit reporting acts and other laws.

                Certain variable life insurance and individual variable
          annuities and their related separate accounts are subject to
          regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

                Health care reform has been at the forefront of domestic
          policy issues at the federal level and is a leading issue in many
          state legislatures in 1995.  Various proposals have been
          introduced and a great deal of uncertainty remains regarding what
          the final health reform 
























          package will contain or what effect it will have on the Company's
          businesses, including its investment in MetraHealth.  These
          proposals may also affect workers' compensation and automobile
          insurance.  Furthermore, a number of states have passed, or are
          considering, some form of health care reform.  Such state
          regulation primarily impacts fully insured small employer plans. 
          The overall impact of federal or state legislation on the
          Company's businesses is impossible to predict at this time.  The
          Company continues to monitor political and legislative activity
          that addresses the cost, availability and quality of health care.

                Many jurisdictions require prior regulatory approval of
          rate and rating plan changes and some impose restrictions on the
          cancellation or nonrenewal of risks and the termination of agency
          contracts, or have regulations that preclude immediate withdrawal
          from certain lines of business.  Certain lines of business, such
          as commercial automobile and workers' compensation, experience
          rate inadequacies in many jurisdictions.  Automobile insurance is
          also subject to varying regulatory requirements as to mandated
          coverages and availability, such as no-fault benefits, assigned
          risk pools, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting
          associations.  The added expense associated with involuntary
          pools in this and other areas has adversely affected
          profitability.

                See "Property-Casualty Commercial Lines -- Hazardous
          Substances" on pages 25 through 28 for a discussion of the
          effect on the Company of various state and federal regulatory
          efforts aimed at environmental remediation, including proposed
          amendments to the federal Superfund statute.

                In December 1992, the Florida legislature created the
          Residential Property and Casualty Joint Underwriting Association
          ("RPCJUA") to provide residential property and casualty insurance
          to individuals who cannot obtain coverage in the voluntary
          market.  Property-casualty insurance companies in Florida,
          including Travelers Indemnity, will be required to share the risk
          in the RPCJUA.

                In November 1993, the Florida legislature created a
          Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund to provide reimbursement to
          insurers for a portion of their future catastrophic hurricane
          losses.  This Hurricane Catastrophe Fund will be funded in part
          by assessments on insurance companies.

                Proposed legislation has been introduced in Congress that
          would modify certain laws and regulations affecting the financial
          services industry, including the provisions regarding
          affiliations among insurance companies, investment banks and
          commercial banks.  The potential impact of such legislation on
          the Company's businesses cannot be predicted at this time.

             Recent Developments in Insurance Regulations

                The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the
          "NAIC") adopted risk-based capital ("RBC") requirements for life
          insurance companies in 1992, effective with 




























          reporting for 1993, and for property-casualty companies in
          December 1993, effective with reporting for 1994.  The RBC
          requirements are to be used as early warning tools by the NAIC
          and states to identify companies that merit further regulatory
          action.

                For these purposes, an insurer's surplus is measured in
          relation to its specific asset and liability profiles.  A
          company's risk-based capital is calculated by applying factors to
          various asset, premium and reserve items, where the factor is
          higher for those items with greater underlying risk and lower for
          less risky items.

                The life formula calculates baseline life risk-based
          capital ("LRBC") as a mathematical combination of amounts for the
          following four categories of risk:  asset risk (i.e., the risk of
          asset default), insurance risk (i.e., the risk of adverse
          mortality and morbidity experience), interest rate risk (i.e.,
          the risk of loss due to changes in interest rates) and business
          risk (i.e., normal business and management risk).

                Fifty percent of the baseline LRBC calculation is defined
          as Authorized Control Level RBC.  The insurer's ratio of adjusted
          capital to Authorized Control Level RBC (the "RBC ratio") can
          then be calculated from data contained in the annual statement. 
          Adjusted capital is defined as the sum of statutory capital,
          statutory surplus, asset valuation reserve, voluntary investment
          reserves and one-half the policyholder dividend liability.

                The property-casualty formula calculates baseline
          property-casualty risk-based capital ("PCRBC") as a mathematical
          combination of amounts for the following categories of risk: 
          asset risk, credit risk (i.e., the risk of nonpayment of amounts
          due under reinsurance ceded and other miscellaneous receivables),
          off-balance-sheet risk (i.e., the risk of loss due to adverse
          experience from non-controlled assets, guarantees for affiliates,
          contingent liabilities, and reserve and premium growth) and
          underwriting risk (i.e., the risk associated with loss reserves
          and written premiums).

                Forty percent of the baseline PCRBC calculation is defined
          as Authorized Control Level RBC for 1994 (this percentage will
          increase to 45% for 1995 and to 50% by 1996).  The PCRBC ratio is
          then calculated from data contained in the annual statement.

                Within certain ratio ranges, regulators have increasing
          authority to take action as the RBC ratio decreases.  There are
          four levels of regulatory action.  The first of these levels is
          the "company action level."  The RBC ratio for this level is less
          than 200% but greater than 150%.  Insurers within this level must
          submit a comprehensive plan (an "RBC plan") to the commissioner. 
          The next level is the "regulatory action level."  The RBC ratio
          for this level is less than 150% but greater than 100%.  An
          insurer within this level must submit an RBC plan, is subject to
          an examination of assets, liabilities and operations by the
          commissioner, and is subject to provisions of any corrective
          order subsequently issued by the commissioner.  The third level
          is the "authorized control level."  The RBC ratio for this level
          is less than 100% but greater than 70%.  At this level, the
          commissioner takes action as described under "regulatory action
          level" and may cause the insurer to be placed under regulatory
          control if 























          such action is deemed to be in the best interests of
          policyholders.  The fourth level is the "mandatory control
          level."  The RBC ratio for this level is less than 70%, and the
          commissioner takes actions necessary to place the insurer under
          regulatory control.

                The formulas have not been designed to differentiate among
          adequately capitalized companies which operate with higher levels
          of capital.  Therefore, it is inappropriate and ineffective to
          use the formulas to rate or to rank such companies.  At December
          31, 1994, all of the Company's life and property-casualty
          insurance companies had adjusted capital in excess of amounts
          requiring regulatory action at any of the four levels.

                As part of the process of accreditation by the NAIC, state
          insurance regulators have been recommending the adoption of new
          statutory standards for the payment of dividends by insurance
          companies without prior approval.  As part of this effort, the
          Connecticut General Assembly passed legislation to require prior
          approval by the Connecticut Insurance Commissioner for any
          dividend distributions during a twelve-month period that are in
          excess of the greater of (i) ten percent of an insurer's surplus
          limited by unassigned funds-surplus, or (ii) net gain from
          operations (for life companies) or net income (for non-life
          companies), in each case measured as of the preceding December
          31.

                Under the legislation, statutory surplus would not be
          available in 1995 for dividends from The Travelers Insurance
          Group Inc. (the parent of TIC and Travelers Indemnity) to The
          Travelers Inc. without prior approval.

                The NAIC Insurance Regulatory Information System ("IRIS")
          ratios, discussed under "Combined Property-Casualty Product Line
          Information" on page 49, are part of the NAIC solvency
          surveillance process.  They consist of approximately 12 ratios
          with defined acceptable ranges.  They are used as an initial
          screening process for identifying companies that may be in need
          of special attention.  Companies that have several ratios that
          fall outside of the acceptable range are selected for closer
          review by the NAIC examiner team.  If the examiner determines
          that more attention may be warranted, one of several priority
          designations is assigned, and the insurance department of the
          state of domicile is then responsible for follow-up action.

                Occasionally one or more of the Company's subsidiaries has
          been "flagged" by the  IRIS ratios.  In all such instances, the
          regulators have been satisfied upon follow up that there is no
          solvency problem.  It is possible that similar events could occur
          this year, and management believes that the resolution would be
          the same.

          Reserving Methods

                Reserves are subject to ongoing review as additional
          experience and other data become available.  Increases or
          decreases to reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses may
          be made, which would be reflected in operating results for the
          period in which such adjustments, if any, are made.


























             Property-casualty loss reserves are established to account
          for the estimated ultimate costs of claims and claim adjustment
          expenses that have been reported but not yet settled, reopened
          claims, and claims which have been incurred but not reported. 
          Property-casualty personal and commercial lines actuaries use a
          number of generally accepted actuarial and statistical techniques
          to estimate ultimate liabilities.  These techniques generally
          rely upon analyses of historical development patterns of various
          types of accident year data.  Typically, these techniques utilize
          review of paid and incurred claim data and paid and incurred
          expense data, closed claim data, claim counts, claim costs and
          various types of pricing data.  Subsequent to reviewing a variety
          of tests, management selects what it believes is the best
          estimate of ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense for each
          line of business and market segment.  These estimates are refined
          over time as experience develops and further claims are reported
          and settled.  Any required adjustments to reserves are reflected
          in the results of the periods in which such adjustments are made. 
          Recognition is given to recoveries for reinsurance, salvage and
          subrogation.

                The ultimate incurred losses and the corresponding reserve
          levels carried for all accident years have an implicit provision
          for inflation and other factors that result in differences in
          levels of claim cost by accident year.  Ultimate claim values are
          based in part on analysis of historical trends in average closed
          claim costs and open claim costs.  Average closed claim costs
          reflect actual historic inflation trends while reported losses
          reflect historic trends based upon both paid losses and
          adjusters' estimates.  There is no precise method for evaluating
          the impact of inflation.  Claim settlements are also affected
          by many other factors including judicial decisions, the social
          environment and claims handling procedures.  Frequent reviews are
          therefore performed for the major property-casualty insurance
          coverages, particularly those related to third party claims. 
          Such third party claims often involve lengthy litigation or are
          otherwise settled only after a considerable passage of time and
          are particularly subject to the effects of judicial trends and
          changes in the social environment.

          Investments

                This section discusses the investment portfolios of the
          businesses described in the Company's insurance services
          segments.

                At December 31, 1994, the investment holdings of the
          companies included in the insurance services segments were
          composed primarily of fixed maturities.  At December 31, 1994,
          approximately 94.8% in total dollar amount of the fixed
          maturities portfolios of such companies had investment grade
          ratings.  The remaining investments are principally mortgage
          loans and real estate, discussed below, policy loans and other
          investments.  For additional information regarding these
          investment portfolios, see Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated
          Financial Statements and the discussion of Asset Quality in the
          Insurance Services Segment discussion in Item 7 of this Form 10-
          K, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
          and Results of Operations."  State insurance laws prescribe the
          types, quality and diversity of permissible investments for
          insurance companies.
























             Consistent with the nature of related contract obligations, the
          invested assets attributable to group insurance and individual
          life, accident and health and financial services are primarily
          long-term fixed income investments such as corporate debt
          securities, mortgage and asset-backed securities, and mortgage
          loans.  A small portion of the invested assets related to these
          operations is in preferred and common stocks and real estate
          equity investments.  The Company did not originate a significant
          amount of new real estate business in 1994 and does not plan to
          do so in 1995.  The property-casualty fixed maturities portfolios
          (principally bonds) are shifted from time to time to respond to
          the changing economic outlook, insurance underwriting results and
          the resultant changes in the federal income tax position of the
          Company and its subsidiaries.

                Cash available for investment is principally derived from
          operating activities and investment income.  In addition, cash
          becomes available for investment from prepayment, maturity and
          sale of investments.  The underperforming mortgage loan and real
          estate portfolios have been significantly reduced since 1992. 
          See "Mortgage Loans and Real Estate" below.  Different investment
          policies have been developed for various lines of business based
          on the product requirements, the type and term of the liabilities
          associated with these products, regulatory requirements and tax
          treatment of the businesses in which each company is engaged.

             Mortgage Loans and Real Estate

                The Company is continuing its program to dispose of its
          real estate investments and some of its mortgage loans and to
          reinvest the proceeds to obtain current market yields.  At
          December 31, 1994, the mortgage loan and real estate portfolios
          of the businesses included in the Company's insurance services
          segments consisted of approximately $5.4 billion and $418
          million, respectively.  At December 31, 1993, the mortgage loan
          and real estate portfolios consisted of approximately $7.4
          billion and $1.0 billion, respectively.  See Item 7,
          "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
          Results of Operations," for additional information.

                The Company's accelerated liquidation strategy for
          foreclosed real estate and certain mortgage loans has mitigated the
          negative impact that these underperforming portfolios have had on
          investment income.  Management anticipates that approximately
          half of maturing commercial mortgage loans will be refinanced,
          restructured, sold or foreclosed.  Restructured loans are defined
          as loans the terms of which have been changed from the original
          contract generally by lowering the pay rate of interest in the
          early years after modification.  Loans which have pay rates of
          interest after modification that are equal to or above market
          rates are not included in the underperforming mortgage loan
          inventory.  At December 31, 1994 and 1993, approximately $511
          million and $1.3 billion, or 9% and 17%, respectively, of the
          mortgage loan portfolio was classified as underperforming. 
          Underperforming mortgage loans include delinquent loans, loans in
          the process of foreclosure and loans modified at interest rates
          below market.




























             For information regarding the principal balance of mortgage
          loans at December 31, 1994 by contractual maturity, see Note 5 of
          Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Actual maturities
          will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may
          have the right to prepay loans with or without prepayment
          premiums.  Unscheduled payments and sales of mortgage loans were
          $1.3 billion in 1994 and $1.0 billion in 1993.  The majority of
          these mortgages are seven-year term loans.

                Real estate management evaluates the portfolio on an
          ongoing basis, assessing the probabilities of loss with respect
          to a comprehensive series of future projections, including a host
          of variables relating to the borrower, the property, the term of
          the loan, the tenant composition, rental rates, other supply and
          demand factors, and overall economic conditions.

                The mortgage loan portfolio and real estate assets
          included in the investment portfolios as of December 31, 1994 and
          1993 are summarized by property type as set forth in the table
          below.  For information summarizing the geographic distribution
          of the mortgage loan portfolio and real estate assets, see Note 5
          of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

                 COMBINED PROPERTY-CASUALTY PRODUCT LINE INFORMATION

                The following discussion of the Company's combined
          property-casualty lines displays information for the insurance
          operations of Property-Casualty Commercial Lines and Property-
          Casualty Personal Lines on a combined basis, consolidating Gulf
          and old Travelers.  The operating results of old Travelers prior
          to the December 31, 1993 Merger are not included in the Company's
          Consolidated Financial Statements, other than for the equity in
          earnings relating to the 27% previously owned.




































          Combined Property-Casualty Reserves

                Property-casualty loss reserves are established to account
          for the estimated ultimate costs of claims and claim adjustment
          expenses for claims that have been reported but not yet settled,
          reopened claims and claims which have been incurred but not
          reported.  The process of estimating this liability is an
          imprecise science subject to a number of variables.  These
          variables are impacted by both internal and external events such
          as changes in claim handling procedures, economic inflation,
          judicial trends and legislative changes.  Many of these items are
          not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. 
          Additionally, there may be significant reporting lags between the
          occurrence of the insured event and its actual reporting to the
          insurer.  At December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, $5.9 billion, $5.5
          billion and $5.4 billion, respectively, of unpaid claim and claim
          adjustment expenses were provided for claims which had not yet
          been reported and for future development on reported claims. 
          Reserve estimates are continually refined in a regular ongoing
          process as experience develops and further claims are reported
          and settled.  Adjustments to reserves are reflected in the
          results of the periods in which such adjustments are made.

                Estimates for reported claims are established based on
          judgments by the claim department on a case by case basis.  These
          estimates are reviewed on a regular basis and revised as
          additional facts become known.

                Estimates for unreported claims, future reopened claims
          and development on reported claims are principally derived from
          actuarial analyses of historical patterns of claim development by
          accident year for each line of business and market segment. 
          Similarly, estimates of unpaid claim adjustment expenses are also
          principally derived from actuarial analyses of historical
          development patterns of the relationship of claim adjustment
          expenses to losses by accident year for each line of business and
          market segment.

                Refer to "Insurance Services - General -- Reserving
          Methods" at page 39 for a more complete discussion of reserving
          methodology.

                For a reconciliation of beginning and ending reserve
          liability balances for 1994, 1993 and 1992, see Note 11 of Notes
          to Consolidated Financial Statements.  The table on page 45
          shows the development of the estimated reserves for the 10 years
          prior to 1994, and includes information for old Travelers for
          periods prior to the Merger.

                See "Property & Casualty Insurance Services -- Property-
          Casualty Commercial Lines" for a discussion of environmental and
          asbestos claims and the Special Liability Group that deals with
          such claims.

                The differences between the reserves for losses and LAE
          shown in the table on page 45, which is prepared in accordance
          with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), and those
          reported in the annual statements filed with state insurance
          departments, which are prepared in accordance with statutory
          accounting practices ("SAP"), 

























          were $(24) million, $32 million and $38 million for the years
          1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  Those differences are
          attributable to a certain portion of the discounting of workers'
          compensation reserves impacting all three years.  The 1994 year
          was also affected by the gross-up of assets and liabilities for
          GAAP that were recorded on a net basis for SAP.

          Discounting

                The liability for losses for certain long-term disability
          payments under workers' compensation insurance has been
          discounted by $509 million at December 31, 1994 using a maximum
          interest rate of 5%.  The corresponding amounts of discount for
          calendar years 1993 and 1992 were $610 million and $623 million,
          respectively.  The 1994 decrease was due to more favorable
          experience trends anticipated on certain of these claims.
















































































                The net reserve balance at December 31, 1993 reflected
          above includes a $225 million purchase accounting adjustment
          relating to the acquisition of old Travelers.  See Note 11 of
          Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

             The data in the above table is presented in accordance with
          reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
          Care must be taken to avoid misinterpretation by those unfamiliar
          with such information or familiar with other data commonly
          reported by the insurance industry.  The above data is not
          "accident year" data, but rather a display of 1984-1994 year-end
          reserves and the subsequent changes in those reserves.

                For instance, the "cumulative deficiency or redundancy"
          shown above for each year represents the aggregate amount by
          which original estimates of reserves as of that year end have
          changed in subsequent years.  Accordingly, the cumulative 
          deficiency for a year relates only to reserves at that year end 
          and such amounts are not additive.  Expressed another way, if the 
          original reserves at the end of 1984 included $4 million for a loss 
          which is finally settled in 1994 for $5 million, the $1 million 
          deficiency (excess of actual settlement of $5 million over original 
          estimate of $4 million) would be included in the cumulative 
          deficiencies in each of the years 1984-1993 shown above.

                A substantial portion of the cumulative deficiencies in
          each of the years 1984-1992 arises from claims on policies
          written prior to the mid-1970s involving liability exposures such
          as asbestos.  In the post-1984 period, the Company has developed
          more stringent underwriting standards and policy exclusions and
          significantly contracted or terminated the writing of such risks.

                General conditions and trends that have affected the
          development of these liabilities in the past will not necessarily
          recur in the future; however, deficiencies will occur in the
          future due to the discount on the workers compensation reserves,
          therefore, it would be difficult to develop meaningful
          extrapolation of estimated future redundancies or deficiencies in
          loss reserves from the data in the table on page 45.

                A significant portion of National business is underwritten
          with retrospectively rated insurance policies in which the
          ultimate cost of insurance for a given year is dependent on the
          loss experience of the insured.  This analysis does not reflect
          amounts recoverable from insureds in the retrospective rating
          process.  Such recoverables tend to significantly mitigate the
          impact of the cumulative deficiencies shown above.  Retrospective
          rating is particularly significant for National business for the
          workers' compensation, general liability and commercial
          automobile liability coverages.  This mechanism affords the
          Company a significant measure of financial protection against
          adverse development on a large block ($3.2 billion) of net
          reserves.

          Combined Ratios

                Combined ratios are a measure of property-casualty
          underwriting results.  The combined ratio is the sum of (i) the
          ratio of losses, loss adjustment expenses and policyholder
          dividends to earned premiums, and (ii) the ratio of other
          underwriting expenses to written premiums.  When the combined
          ratio is under 100%, underwriting results are generally
          profitable; when this ratio is over 100%, underwriting results
          are generally unprofitable.  

























          Underwriting results do not include investment income which makes
          a significant contribution to overall property-casualty
          profitability.  In preparing the following table, anticipated
          salvage and subrogation were deducted from losses.

                The following table and related discussions present
          information regarding the combined ratios of Travelers Indemnity,
          including Gulf and the other property-casualty insurance
          operations of old Travelers and its subsidiaries.


                                             



                The improvement in the combined ratio for Personal Lines
          in 1994 compared to 1993 is primarily attributable to improved
          underwriting results due to lower operating expenses and to
          favorable loss reserve development in 1994 on prior years'
          business.  This improvement was partially offset by the increase
          in catastrophe losses, which after taxes and reinsurance
          increased to $26.4 million for 1994 from $13.5 million in 1993,
          due to the severe winter storms in the Northeast during the first
          quarter of 1994.
































             Personal Lines underwriting profitability is driven
          principally by results in the automobile line and is influenced
          by factors such as inflation in medical, legal and auto repair
          costs, accident frequencies and regulatory actions.  Results have
          improved in the automobile line due in part to programs
          implemented by Travelers Indemnity to be more selective in
          marketing and underwriting.

                In 1993 and 1994, Personal Lines purchased additional
          amounts of reinsurance to reduce its exposure to future
          catastrophe losses.  Homeowners results are heavily influenced by
          the cost of reinsurance, as well as the incidence of natural
          catastrophes.  Personal Lines' results in 1992 were adversely
          affected by Hurricane Andrew, which added 22.3 percentage points
          to the total Personal Lines combined ratio.  Excluding Hurricane
          Andrew, the total Personal Lines combined ratio in 1992 would
          have been 109.5%.

                Commercial Lines underwriting profitability has
          historically been cyclical, influenced by factors such as
          inflation levels, changes in the interpretation of the doctrines
          of tort liability, unemployment trends, legislative actions
          affecting workers' compensation benefit levels, crime rates,
          natural catastrophes and general business conditions.  The
          softening of market prices which began in 1988 has continued. 
          The combined ratio has been, and will continue to be, affected by
          the shift to fee-for-service products, which reduces premiums and
          losses while expenses remain in insurance results.

                During 1994, asbestos and environmental claims continued
          to negatively impact other liability lines.  The combined impact
          from these claims added 4.6 percentage points to the total 1994
          Commercial Lines combined ratio.  Asbestos claims incurred
          totaled $51 million in 1994, $229 million in 1993 and $61 million
          in 1992.  Environmental claims incurred were $49 million in 1994,
          $190 million in 1993 and $67 million in 1992.  In addition,
          purchase accounting adjustments amounting to $225 million for
          asbestos and environmental claims were included in incurred
          losses, for statutory purposes only, in 1994.  This adjustment
          increased the 1994 Commercial Lines combined ratio by an
          additional 10.5 percentage points.  In the multiple-peril and
          property lines, the 1992 combined ratios were severely impacted
          by Hurricane Andrew and other natural catastrophes.  Hurricane
          Andrew alone added 4.9 percentage points to the total Commercial
          Lines combined ratio.

                Travelers Indemnity has heavily invested in workers'
          compensation cost containment initiatives since 1989. 
          Investments in early intervention, managed care, systems
          technology and employer education have allowed Travelers
          Indemnity to outperform the industry's workers' compensation
          combined ratio results.  In addition, Travelers Indemnity's
          overall strategy of restricting growth in states with rate
          inadequacy, its strong shift towards large self-insured and loss
          responsive products, and its growth in service of assigned risk
          pools have all contributed to favorable combined ratio trends.

                The table on the next page and the related discussion set
          forth information regarding the premium to surplus ratios of
          Travelers Indemnity, including Gulf and the other property-
          casualty insurance operations of old Travelers and its
          subsidiaries.


























                The ratio of net written premiums to capital and surplus
          is a key financial indicator of the overall strength of a
          property-casualty insurance company.  The usual range for this
          ratio, which is used as a benchmark by the IRIS of the National
          Association of Insurance Commissioners, is 3.00 to 1 or less. 
          The ratio deteriorated slightly in 1994 as a result of the impact
          of reserve increases for environmental claims, litigation and
          ceded reinsurance balances, partially offset by reductions in
          written premium volume.  The ratio improved in 1993 due to a
          modest decline in premium volume from the continuing trend toward
          self-insured service business in Commercial Lines, and due to a
          significant increase in capital and surplus, largely resulting
          from the assumption of old Travelers public debt by the Company.


                            CORPORATE AND OTHER OPERATIONS


                In addition to its four business segments, the Company's
          Corporate and Other segment consists of unallocated expenses and
          earnings primarily related to interest, corporate administration,
          and certain corporate investments.  This segment has also
          included the Company's 27% equity interest in old Travelers
          (1993), lines of business retained from the sale in 1993 of
          Voyager Group, Inc. and its affiliates ("Voyager") (1993 and
          1992), and the Company's interest in Fingerhut Companies, Inc.
          ("Fingerhut") (1992), a direct marketing business.  For
          additional information regarding the inclusion of Fingerhut in
          the Company's consolidated operating results, see Note 3 of Notes
          to Consolidated Financial Statements.

                In May 1993, the stock of Voyager was sold.  Voyager sold
          credit insurance on installment loans through independent
          consumer finance companies and furniture and appliance retailers.

          General Business Factors

                In the judgment of the Company, no material part of the
          business of the Company and its subsidiaries is dependent upon a
          single customer or group of customers, the loss of 























          any one of which would have a materially adverse effect on the
          Company, and no one customer or group of affiliated customers
          accounts for as much as 10% of the Company's consolidated
          revenues.

                At January 5, 1995, the Company had approximately 52,000
          full-time and 2,800 part-time employees.

          MetraHealth

                Upon formation of MetraHealth, the joint venture created
          by the combination of the medical businesses of TIC and MetLife,
          the Company owned 50% of MetraHealth's common stock.  The
          Company's interest in MetraHealth will be accounted for on the
          equity method.  See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
          Statements.

                MetraHealth will provide group health insurance, health
          maintenance organizations, managed care and ancillary services
          throughout the United States, in Puerto Rico and in the U.S.
          Virgin Islands.  The range of services provided by these products
          includes programs to maintain health and wellness, as well as to
          promote patient education and to manage health care through
          networks of providers of medical/surgical, mental health and
          pharmaceutical services.  MetraHealth network products rely on
          contractual arrangements between it and providers of health care
          to deliver services to covered individuals at negotiated
          reimbursement levels as well as to  participate in utilization
          and quality management programs.  

































             As of December 31, 1994, the businesses acquired by
          MetraHealth included health maintenance organizations in 29
          network areas, with approximately 400,000 members; point-of-
          service operations in 72 network areas, with approximately 1.7
          million members; and preferred provider organizations in 90
          network areas, with approximately 2.8 million members.  Covered
          lives using the managed care networks and covered by indemnity
          products, in the aggregate at December 31, 1994, were
          approximately 11.3 million.  MetraHealth expects some decline in
          covered lives during 1995.

                In March 1995, MetraHealth acquired HealthSpring, Inc. for
          common stock of MetraHealth.  HealthSpring builds and manages
          primary care physician practices and serves approximately 32,000
          patients through seven sites in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Illinois. 
          This acquisition resulted in a reduction in the participation of
          the Company and MetLife in the MetraHealth venture to 48.25%
          each.

                             GLOSSARY OF INSURANCE TERMS


                Annuity -- A contract that pays a periodic income benefit
          for the life of a person (the annuitant), the lives of two or
          more persons or for a specified period of time.

                Assumption Reinsurance -- A transaction whereby the ceding
          company transfers its entire obligation under the policy to the
          reinsurer, who becomes directly liable to the policyholder in all
          respects, including collecting premiums and paying benefits.  See
          "Reinsurance."

                Benefits Under Administration, Including Fees -- Estimates
          of amounts that fee-based Managed Care and Employee Benefits
          customers would have been charged if their group health plans had
          been fully insured.

                Catastrophe -- A severe loss, usually involving many risks
          such as conflagration, earthquake, windstorm, explosion and other
          similar events.

                Ceded Reinsurance -- Risks transferred to another company

          applicable, policyholder dividends to earned premiums, and (b)
          Expense Ratio -- the ratio of other underwriting expenses to
          written premiums.  When the combined ratio is under 100%,
          underwriting results are generally profitable; when the ratio is
          over 100%, underwriting results are generally unprofitable.
          Underwriting results do not include investment income, which may
          make a significant contribution to overall profitability.

                Contractholder Funds -- Receipts from the issuance of
          universal life, pension investment and certain individual annuity

          GAAP.

                Defined Contribution Plans -- Type of pension plan in which

          person for that portion of the loss (arising out of a loss
          occurrence) which is in excess of the deductible.

                Experience Rated Contracts -- Insurance contracts in which
          future rates and/or commissions are compiled from past

          rating basis but never on the basis of loss experience in the
          period of coverage.

                Guaranteed Investment Contracts (GICs) -- Group contracts
          sold to pension plans, profit sharing plans and funding
          agreements that guarantee a stated interest rate for a specified
          period of time.

                Guaranty Fund -- State-regulated mechanism which is
          financed by assessing insurers doing business in those states.
          Should insolvencies occur, these funds are available to meet some
          or all of the obligations to policyholders.

                Incurred But Not Reported Losses (IBNR) -- Losses that have
          occurred but have not been reported.

                Indemnity Reinsurance -- A transaction whereby the
          reinsurer agrees to indemnify the ceding company against all or
          part of the loss that the latter may sustain under the 
































          policies it issued that are being reinsured.  The ceding company
          remains primarily liable as the direct insurer on all risks
          ceded.  See "Reinsurance."

                Insurance -- Mechanism for contractually shifting burdens

          not insurable in the voluntary market due to either the level of
          risk or pricing.  Residual markets are largest for lines in which
          state governments or other agencies mandate coverage such as
          workers' compensation. Generally states provide residual market
          plans that are designed to allocate the underwriting experience
          for these coverages in proportion to a given carrier's market
          share.

                Life Contingencies -- Contingencies affecting the duration
          of life of an individual or a group of individuals.

                Long-Term Care -- Coverage for extended stays in a nursing

                Loss Reserves -- Liabilities established by insurers to
          reflect the estimated cost of claims payments that the insurer

                Losses Under Administration -- Projected loss and loss
          adjustment expense payments to be made for the current policy

          reinsurance companies in the competitive marketplace.

          mentally or physically, or physically impaired.

                Mortality -- The rate at which people die.

                Policy Loan -- A loan made by an insurance company to a
          policyholder on the security of the cash value of the policy.

                Pool -- Syndicate or association of insurance companies
          organized to underwrite a particular risk, usually with high
          limits of exposure. Each member shares in premiums, losses and
          expenses, according to a predetermined agreement.

                Reinsurance -- The acceptance by one or more insurers,
          called reinsurers, of all or a portion of the risk underwritten
          by another insurer (the ceding company) who has directly written
          the coverage. However, the legal rights of the insured generally
          are not affected by the reinsurance transaction.

                Reinsurance Pools and Associations -- Mechanisms
          established to aggregate insurance, and then distribute results
          to participants in the mechanism. The pool or association
          performs rating, loss adjustment and engineering services for
          certain exposures. In some cases, they are established to absorb
          business that will not be written voluntarily by insurers.

                Residual Market -- See "Involuntary Business."

                Retention -- The amount of exposure an insurance company
          retains on any one risk or group of risks.

                Retrospective Rating -- A plan or method which permits
          adjustment of the final premium or commission on the basis of the
          actual loss experience, subject to certain minimum and maximum
          limits.

                Salvage -- Amount received by an insurer from the sale of
          property (usually damaged) on which the insurer has paid a total
          loss to the insured. For example, when an insurer has paid the
          insured the actual cash value of an automobile damaged (usually
          extensively) by collision, then the insurer takes title to and
          sells the damaged automobile for its own account. Salvage is
          applied by insurance companies to reduce the amount of loss paid.

                Self-Insured Retentions -- That portion of the risk
          retained by a person for its own account. Generally, that person
          retains an amount of first loss for its own account and purchases
          an excess of loss cover to protect itself for losses above its
          retention.

                Separate Accounts -- Funds for which investment income and
          investment gains and losses accrue directly to, and investment
          risk is borne by, the contractholders. The assets of these
          separate accounts are legally segregated and not subject to
          claims that arise out of any other business of the insurance
          company.

                Servicing Carrier -- An insurance company that provides
          various services including policy issuance, claims adjusting and
          customer service for insureds in a reinsurance pool, for a fee.

































                Statutory Accounting Practices -- Those accounting
          practices prescribed or permitted by the National Association of
          Insurance Commissioners or an insurer's domiciliary state
          insurance regulator for purposes of financial reporting to
          regulators.

                Statutory Capital and Surplus -- The excess of statutory
          admitted assets over statutory liabilities as shown on an
          insurer's statutory financial statements.

                Structured Settlements -- Periodic payments to an injured
          person or survivor for a determined number of years or for life,
          typically in settlement of a claim under a liability policy.

                Subrogation -- The statutory or legal right of an insurer
          to recover from a third party who is wholly or partially
          responsible for a loss paid by the insurer under the terms of a
          policy. For example, when an insurer has paid the insured for
          loss sustained to his or her automobile as a result of a
          collision, the insurer may collect through the process of
          subrogation from the person whose automobile caused the damage.
          Subrogation recoveries are treated as reductions of the losses
          paid.

                Surrender Value -- The amount of money, usually the legal
          reserve under the policy, less sometimes a surrender charge,
          which an insurance company will pay to a policyholder who cancels
          a policy. This value may be used as collateral for a loan.

                Trading Portfolio -- Fixed maturity investments that are
          likely to be sold prior to maturity and are therefore carried at
          current market value. Unrealized gains and losses on these
          investments are reflected in stockholders' equity.

                Underwriting --The assumption of risk for designated loss
          or damage in consideration of receiving a premium. Also includes
          the process of examining, accepting or rejecting insurance risks,
          and determining the proper premium.

          Item 2.   PROPERTIES.

                The Company's executive offices are located in New York
          City.  Offices and other properties used by the Company's
          subsidiaries are located throughout the United States.  A few
          subsidiaries have offices located in foreign countries.  Most
          office locations and other properties are leased on terms and for
          durations which are reflective of commercial standards in the
          communities where such offices and other properties are located.

                At December 31, 1994, leasehold interests of Travelers
          Insurance included a total of approximately 5,700,000 square feet
          of office space at about 285 locations throughout the United
          States under both operating and capital leases.  TIC owns
          buildings containing approximately 1,570,000 square feet of
          office space located in Hartford, Connecticut and vicinity,
          serving as the home office for TIC and Travelers Indemnity.  TIC
          also owns a building in Norcross, Georgia that is occupied by its
          information systems department.



























                SBI owns two office buildings in New York City, which
          total approximately 627,000 square feet.  Most of SBI's other
          offices are located in leased premises, the leases for which
          expire at various times.

                SBI leases two buildings, including an office building
          located at 388 Greenwich Street, with a total of approximately 2.3 
          million square feet, and plans to consolidate its executive offices
          and certain other New York City operations at these locations.  The
          buildings were acquired from Shearson Lehman Brothers by an
          independent third party and are leased by SBI through 1999.  SBI
          has a purchase option with respect to these properties.

                A few other offices and certain warehouse space are owned,
          none of which is material to the Company's financial condition or
          operations.  The Company is the lessee under the lease on old
          Primerica's former headquarters in Greenwich, Connecticut.  The
          lease obligation on half of this property ended in December 1991;
          the remainder of the lease expires in December 1996.  The Company
          believes its properties are adequate and suitable for its
          business as presently conducted and are adequately maintained. 
          For further information concerning leases, see Note 18 of Notes
          to Consolidated Financial Statements.

          Item 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

                This section describes the major pending legal
          proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to
          the business, to which the Company or its subsidiaries is a party
          or of which any of their property is subject.  Certain additional
          matters may be described in the periodic reports filed under the
          Exchange Act by certain subsidiaries of the Company.

             Old Primerica

                For information concerning matters involving the Company
          and certain of its subsidiaries relating to federal, state or

          first full paragraph of page 26 of the Company's filing on Form
          10-K for the year ended December 31, 1992, which description is
          incorporated by reference herein.  A copy of the pertinent
          paragraph of such filing is included as an exhibit to this Form
          10-K.  The Company has entered into a consent decrees with
          respect to both groundwater and soil remediation.  The Company
          believes that insurance maintained by or on behalf of the
          Company, old Primerica or certain affiliates, indemnities in
          favor of the Company or such subsidiaries and contributions from
          other potentially responsible parties will be available to
          mitigate the financial exposure of the Company and its
          subsidiaries in these matters.  The Company is using a variety of
          approaches to recover from each of these sources, including
          pursuing litigation where appropriate relating to such matters. 
          Although there can be no assurance, the Company does 


























          not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will
          have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial
          condition of the Company and its subsidiaries.

          description is incorporated by reference herein.  A copy of the
          pertinent paragraph of such filing is included as an exhibit to
          this Form 10-K.

                Certain of the subsidiaries that the Company acquired in
          the Merger are involved in defending against claims asserting
          alleged injuries and damages from asbestos and other hazardous
          and toxic substances.  For additional information with respect to
          these claims, reference is made to the discussion of asbestos and
          environmental claims contained on pages 25 through 28 of this
          Form 10-K.

             Other

                For information concerning purported class actions and
          other actions relating to service fee charges and premium

          subsidiaries of the Company, see the description that appears in
          the second paragraph of page 29 of the Company's filing on Form
          10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 1994, which description
          is incorporated by reference herein.  A copy of the pertinent
          paragraph of such filing is included as an exhibit to this Form
          10-K.  In one of these cases, North Carolina Steel, Inc. v.
          National Council on Compensation Insurance, Inc., et al, the
          North Carolina trial court granted the Company's motion to
          dismiss in February 1995.

                The Company and various subsidiaries have also been named
          as defendants in various matters incident to and typical of the
          businesses in which they are engaged.  These include numerous
          civil actions, arbitration proceedings and other matters in which
          SBI and R-H have been named, arising in the normal course of
          business out of activities as a broker and dealer in securities,
          as an underwriter, as an investment banker or otherwise.  In the
          opinion of the Company's management, none of these actions is
          expected to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated
          financial condition of the Company and its subsidiaries.

       _______________________________
       *  Through February 28, 1995


                At February 28, 1995, the Company had approximately 61,000
          common stockholders of record.  This figure does not represent
          the actual number of beneficial owners of common stock because
          shares are frequently held in "street name" by securities dealers
          and others for the benefit of individual owners who may vote the
          shares.

          term loan and credit agreements of the Company and its

                             ----------------------------



          The Board of Directors and Stockholders
          The Travelers Inc.:


          Under date of January 17, 1995, we reported on the consolidated
          statements of financial position of The Travelers Inc. and
          subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related
          statements of income, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash
          flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
          December 31, 1994, which are contained in the 1994 annual report
          to stockholders.  These consolidated financial statements and our
          report thereon are incorporated by reference in the annual report
          on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1994.  In connection
          with our audits of the aforementioned consolidated financial
          statements, we also audited the related financial statement
          schedules which are listed on the accompanying index.  These
          financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the
          Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
          opinion on these financial statement schedules based on our
          audits.

          In our opinion, these financial statement schedules, when
          considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
          statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material
          respects, the information set forth therein.

          As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements,
          the Company changed its method of accounting for certain
          investments in debt and equity securities in 1994.  Also, as
          discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the
          Company changed its methods of accounting for postretirement
          benefits other than pensions and accounting for postemployment
          benefits in 1993, and its method of accounting for income taxes
          in 1992.
