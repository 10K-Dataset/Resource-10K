ITEM
        1.

BUSINESS

Raymond
        James Financial, Inc. (“RJF”) is a Florida-based holding company whose
        subsidiaries are engaged in various financial services businesses. Its principal
        subsidiaries include Raymond James & Associates, Inc. (“RJA”), Raymond James
        Financial Services, Inc. (“RJFS”), Raymond James Ltd. ("RJ Ltd."), Eagle Asset
        Management, Inc. (“Eagle”), Heritage Asset Management, Inc. (“Heritage”) and
        Raymond James Bank, FSB (“RJBank”). All of these subsidiaries are wholly-owned
        by RJF. RJF and its subsidiaries are hereinafter collectively referred to
        as the
“Company”.

PRINCIPAL
        SUBSIDIARIES

RJF's
        largest subsidiary, RJA, is the largest full service brokerage and investment
        firm headquartered in the state of Florida and one of the larger retail
        brokerage firms in North America. RJA is a self-clearing broker-dealer engaged
        in most aspects of securities distribution, trading, investment banking and
        asset management. RJA also offers financial planning services for individuals
        and provides clearing services for RJFS, other affiliated entities and several
        unaffiliated broker-dealers. RJA is a member of the New York Stock Exchange
        (“NYSE”), American Stock Exchange, and most regional exchanges in the U.S. It is
        also a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers (“NASD”) and
        Securities Investors Protection Corporation (“SIPC”).

RJFS
        is
        an independent contractor broker-dealer subsidiary, and one of the largest
        independent contractor firms in the United States. Financial Advisors affiliated
        with RJFS may offer their clients all products and services offered by RJA.
        RJFS
        also has four institutional sales offices in Europe. RJFS is a member of
        the
        NASD and SIPC, but not of any exchange, as it clears all of its business
        on a
        fully disclosed basis through RJA.

RJ
        Ltd.
        is the Company's Canadian broker-dealer subsidiary which engages in both
        retail
        and institutional distribution and investment banking. RJ Ltd. is a member
        of
        the Toronto Stock Exchange and the Investment Dealers Association of Canada
        ("IDA"). Its U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary is a member of the NASD.

Eagle
        is
        a registered investment advisor serving as the discretionary manager for
        individual and institutional equity and fixed income portfolios.

Heritage
        acts as the manager of the Company's internally sponsored Heritage Family
        of
        Mutual Funds.

RJBank
        provides traditional banking products and services to the clients of the
        Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries and to the general public.

BUSINESS
        SEGMENTS

The
        Company's business has seven segments: Private Client Group; Capital Markets;
        Asset Management; RJBank; Emerging Markets; Stock Loan/Borrow and certain
        investments combined in the "Other" segment. Financial information concerning
        RJF for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005, September 24,
        and September 26, 2003 is included in the consolidated financial statements
        and
        notes thereto. Such information is hereby incorporated by
        reference.

PRIVATE
        CLIENT GROUP

The
        Company provides securities transaction and financial planning services to
        approximately 1.3 million client accounts through the branch office systems
        of
        RJA, RJFS, RJ Ltd., and Raymond James Investment Services (“RJIS"), an
        independent contractor subsidiary in the United Kingdom. The Company's Financial
        Advisors offer a broad range of investments and services, including both
        third
        party and proprietary products, and a range of financial planning services.
        In
        most cases, the Company charges commissions for sales of investment products
        to
        its Private Client Group clients based on an established commission schedule.
        Varying discounts may be given, generally based upon the client's level of
        business, the trade size, service level provided, and other relevant factors.
        An
        increasing number of clients are electing asset-based fee alternatives instead
        of the traditional commission structure; in fiscal year 2005 asset-based
        fees
        from such accounts represented 27% of the Private Client Group's commission
        and
        fees.

The
        majority of the Company’s U.S. Financial Advisors are also licensed to sell
        insurance and annuity products through its general insurance agency, Planning
        Corporation of America (“PCA”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of RJA. Through the
        Financial Advisors of the Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries, PCA provides
        product and marketing support for a broad range of insurance products,
        principally fixed and variable annuities, life insurance, disability insurance
        and long-term care coverage.


The
        Company's Financial Advisors offer a number of professionally managed load
        mutual funds, as well as a selection of no-load funds. RJA maintains
        dealer-sales agreements with most major distributors of mutual fund shares
        sold
        through broker-dealers, including funds managed by Heritage. Commissions
        on such
        sales generally range from 0% to 5.75% of the dollar value of the transaction.
        Sales compensation structures typically include front-end charges, “back-end” or
        contingent deferred sales charges, and an annual charge in the form of a
        fund
        expense.

No
        single
        client accounts for a material percentage of this segment's total
        business.

        Client Group Securities Commission and Fees

For
        the Fiscal Years Ended:

*
        Fixed
        income products include municipal, corporate, government agency and

Raymond
        James & Associates

RJA
        employs 951 Financial Advisors in 131 retail branch offices concentrated
        in the
        Southern, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. RJA's Financial
        Advisors work in a traditional branch setting supported by local management
        and
        administrative staffs. The number of Financial Advisors per office ranges
        from
        one to 32.

Raymond
        James Financial Services

RJFS
        supports 3,464 independent contractor Financial Advisors in providing products
        and services to their Private Client Group clients in 1,514 offices and 586
        satellite offices throughout all 50 states.

The
        number of Financial Advisors in RJFS offices ranges from one to 30. Independent
        contractors are responsible for all of their direct costs and, accordingly,
        are
        paid a larger percentage of commissions and fees. They are permitted to conduct
        other businesses unrelated to their RJFS activities such as offering fixed
        insurance products, independent registered investment advisory services,
        and
        accounting and tax services, among others.

Through
        its Financial Institutions Division, RJFS offers securities to customers
        of
        financial institutions such as banks, thrifts and credit unions and has 500
        Financial Advisors in 419 locations. RJFS also provides custodial, trading
        and
        other support services to unaffiliated independent investment advisors through
        its Investment Advisor Division.

RJ
        Ltd.
        is a self-clearing broker-dealer with its own operations and information
        processing personnel. RJ Ltd. has 54 private client branches with 175 employee
        Financial Advisors and 104 independent contractor Financial Advisors, all
        located in Canada.

        James Investment Services Limited

The
        Company is a 75% shareholder of RJIS.

This

entity
        operates an independent contractor network in the United Kingdom, and currently
        has 31 branch locations and 65 Financial Advisors.

RJA
        - Operations

RJA's
        operations personnel are responsible for the execution of orders, processing
        of
        securities transactions, custody of client securities, receipt, identification
        and delivery of funds and securities, compliance with certain regulatory
        and
        legal requirements, internal financial accounting and controls and general
        office administration for most of the Company's securities brokerage operations.
        At September 30, 2005, RJA employed 806 persons in its operations areas who
        provide services primarily to the Private Client Group, but also support
        the
        Company's other segments.

The
        Company's businesses are supported by, and are dependent upon, an extensive
        system of electronic data processing. These computer systems are largely
        developed and maintained by the 725 employees in the Company’s information
        technology department, most of whom are located in St. Petersburg.

The
        Company has developed a business continuity plan that is designed to permit
        continued operation of critical business functions in the event of disruptions
        to the St. Petersburg facility; all mission critical business departments
        have
        developed operational plans for such disruptions, and the Company has a staff
        who devote their full time to monitoring and facilitating those plans. In
        that
        connection, the Company maintains redundant computer

capacity
        supporting mission critical functions at its Michigan location, and conducts
        some of its daily operational activities from that site. Systems have been
        designed so that the Company can transfer all mission critical processing
        activities to Michigan, and personnel have been identified who are assigned
        responsibility for this role, including some personnel who will be required
        for
        a limited

period
        of time to relocate to Michigan to carry out these activities if necessary.

The
        Company's operations were not adversely affected by the series of hurricanes
        that Florida experienced during 2005. However, the Company continues to enhance
        certain aspects of its business continuity plan to deal with the possible
        impact
        of future hurricanes by expanding its operational and processing capabilities
        in
        Michigan. Present plans are to complete this process over the next two
        years.

Clients'
        transactions in securities are effected on either a cash or margin basis.
        In
        margin transactions, the client pays a portion of the purchase price, and
        RJA
        makes a loan to the client for the balance, collateralized by the securities
        purchased or by other securities owned by the client. Interest is charged
        to
        clients on the amount borrowed to finance margin transactions. The financing
        of
        margin purchases is an important source of revenue to RJA, since the interest
        rate paid by the client on funds loaned by RJA exceeds RJA's cost of short-term
        funds. The interest rate charged to a client on a margin loan is based on
        current interest rates and on the size of the loan balance in the client's
        account.

Typically,
        broker-dealers utilize bank borrowings and equity capital as the primary
        sources
        of funds to finance clients' margin account borrowings. RJA's primary source
        of
        funds to finance clients' margin account balances has been cash balances
        in
        brokerage clients' accounts (Client Interest Program), which are funds awaiting
        investment. In addition, pursuant to written agreements with clients,
        broker-dealers are permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
        and NYSE rules to lend client securities in margin accounts to other financial
        institutions. SEC regulations, however, restrict the use of clients' funds
        derived from pledging and lending clients' securities, as well as funds awaiting
        investment, to the financing of margin account balances; to the extent not
        so
        used, such funds are required to be deposited in a special segregated account
        for the benefit of clients. The regulations also require broker-dealers,
        within
        designated periods of time, to obtain possession or control of, and to
        segregate, clients' fully paid and excess margin securities.

CAPITAL
        MARKETS

Capital

Markets
        activities primarily consist of equity and fixed income products and services.

No
        single
        client accounts for a material percentage of this segment's total business.


Institutional
        Sales

Institutional
        sales commissions account for a significant portion of this segment's revenue,
        which is fueled by a combination of general market activity and the Capital
        Markets group’s ability to identify attractive investment opportunities and
        promote those opportunities. The Company's institutional clients are serviced
        by
        the RJA and RJ Ltd. Institutional Equity Departments, the RJA Fixed Income
        Department, the European offices of RJFS, and Raymond James Financial
        International Ltd, an institutional UK broker-dealer located in London. In
        providing securities brokerage services to its institutional clients, the
        Company charges its commissions on equity transactions based on trade size
        and
        the amount of business conducted annually with each institution. Fixed income
        commissions are based on trade size and the characteristics of the specific
        security involved.

Capital
        Markets Commissions

For
        the Fiscal Years Ended:

The
        domestic and overseas professionals in RJA's Institutional Equity Sales and
        Sales Trading Departments maintain relationships with over 1,800 institutional
        clients, principally in North America and Europe. In addition to the Company's
        headquarters in St. Petersburg, FL, RJA has institutional equity sales offices
        in New York City, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, London and Geneva. RJ Ltd.
        has
        28 institutional equity sales and trading professionals servicing predominantly
        Canadian institutional investors from offices in Montreal, Toronto and
        Vancouver. RJFS has institutional equity sales offices in Brussels, Dusseldorf,
        Luxembourg and Paris. European offices also provide services to high net
        worth
        clients.

RJA
        distributes to its institutional clients both taxable and tax-exempt fixed
        income products, primarily municipal, corporate, government agency and
        mortgage-backed bonds. RJA carries inventory positions of taxable and tax-exempt
        securities in both the primary and secondary markets to facilitate its
        institutional sales activities. In addition to St. Petersburg, the Fixed
        Income
        Department maintains institutional sales and trading offices in New York
        City,
        Chicago and 17 other cities throughout the United States. To assist
        institutional clients, the Fixed Income Research Group provides portfolio
        strategy analysis and municipal bond research.

Equity
        Research Department

The
        domestic senior analysts in RJA's research department support the Company's
        institutional and retail sales efforts and publish research on approximately
        companies. This research primarily focuses on U.S. companies in specific
        industries including Technology, Telecommunications, Consumer, Financial
        Services, Business Services, Healthcare, Real Estate, Energy and Industrial
        Growth. Proprietary industry studies and company-specific research reports
        are
        made available to both institutional and individual clients. RJ Ltd. has

an

additional
        18 analysts who publish research on approximately


companies
        primarily focused in the Energy, Energy Services, Mining,

Forest
        Products, Biotechnology, Technology, Consumer and Industrial Products, REIT
        and
        Income Trust sectors.

Equity
        Trading

Trading
        equity securities in the over-the-counter ("OTC") market involves the purchase
        of securities from, and the sale of securities to, clients of the Company
        or
        other dealers who may be purchasing or

selling

securities for their own account or acting as agent for their clients. Profits
        and losses are derived from the spreads between bid and asked prices, as
        well as
        market trends for the individual securities during the holding period. RJA
        makes
        markets in approximately 265 common stocks in the OTC market. Similar to
        the
        equity research department, this operation serves to support both the Company's
        institutional and Private Client Group sales efforts.


Equity
        Investment Banking

The
        professionals of RJA's Investment Banking Group, located primarily in St.
        Petersburg with additional offices in Atlanta, New York City, Nashville,
        Chicago, Princeton, Palo Alto, Dallas, and Houston, are involved in a variety
        of
        activities including public and private equity financing for corporate clients,
        and merger and acquisition advisory services. RJ Ltd.'s Investment Banking
        Group
        consists of 20 professionals located in Calgary, Toronto and Vancouver providing
        equity financing and financial advisory services to corporate clients. The
        Company's investment banking activities focus on the same industries as those
        followed by the Equity Research department.

Syndicate
        Department

The
        Syndicate Department coordinates the marketing, distribution, pricing and
        stabilization of

RJA's

lead and
        co-managed equity underwritings. In addition to RJA's managed and co-managed
        offerings, this department coordinates the firm's syndicate and selling group
        activities in transactions managed by other investment banking firms.

Fixed
        Income Trading

RJA
        trades both taxable and tax-exempt fixed income products. The 29 taxable
        and 30
        tax-exempt RJA fixed income traders purchase and sell corporate (including
        high
        yield), municipal, government, government agency, and mortgage-backed bonds,
        asset backed securities, preferred stock and certificates of deposit from/to
        clients of the Company or other dealers who may be purchasing or selling
        securities for their own account or acting as an agent for their clients.
        RJA
        enters into future commitments such as forward contracts and “to be announced”
securities (e.g. securities having a stated coupon and original term to
        maturity, although the issuer and/or the specific pool of mortgage loans
        is not
        known at the time of the transaction). In addition, a subsidiary of RJF
        participates in the interest rate swaps market as a principal, both for
        economically hedging RJA fixed income inventory and in transactions with
        customers.

Fixed
        Income Investment Banking

Fixed
        income investment banking includes debt underwriting and public finance
        activities. The 33 professionals in the RJA Public Finance division operate
        out
        of 6 offices (located in St. Petersburg, Birmingham, New York City, Chicago,
        Atlanta, and San Antonio). The Company acts as a Financial Advisor or
        underwriter to various municipal agencies or political subdivisions, housing
        developers and non-profit health care institutions.

RJA
        acts
        as an underwriter or selling group member for corporate bonds, mortgage-backed
        securities, agency bonds, preferred stock and unit investment trusts. When
        underwriting new issue securities, RJA agrees to purchase the issue through
        a
        negotiated sale or submits a competitive bid.

        James Tax Credit Funds, Inc. (“RJTCF”) is the general partner or managing member
        in a number of limited partnerships and limited liability companies which
        invest
        in multi-family real estate entities that qualify for tax credits under Section
        42 of the Internal Revenue Code.  RJTCF has been an active participant in
        the tax credit program since its inception in 1986, and currently focuses
        on tax
        credit funds for institutional investors that invest in a portfolio of tax
        credit eligible multi-family apartments.  The expected return on investment
        from these funds for investors are primarily derived from tax credits and
        tax
        losses that investors can use to reduce their federal tax liability. During
        fiscal 2005, RJTCF invested over $250 million for large institutional investors
        in 93 real estate transactions for properties located throughout the United
        States. From inception, RJTCF has raised over $1 billion in equity and has
        sponsored 35 tax credit funds, with investments in 985 tax credit apartment
        properties in 42 states.

RJA
        - Asset Management Services

RJA's
        Asset Management Services (“AMS”) Department manages several investment advisory
        programs. The primary advisory services offered are the Raymond James Consulting
        Services, which offers a variety of both affiliated and non-affiliated advisors,
        and the Eagle High Net Worth programs. Both programs maintain an approved
        list
        of investment managers, provide asset allocation model portfolios, establish
        custodial facilities, monitor performance of client accounts, provide clients
        with accounting and other administrative services, and assist investment
        managers with certain trading management activities. AMS earns fees generally
        ranging from 0.40% to 0.85% of asset balances per annum, a portion of which

        the accounts. As of September 30, 2005, these programs had approximately
        $13.8
        billion in assets.

        a federally chartered savings bank, regulated by the Office of Thrift
        Supervision, which provides residential, consumer and commercial loans, as
        well
        as FDIC-insured deposit accounts, to clients of the Company's broker-dealer
        subsidiaries and to the general public. RJBank also purchases residential
        whole
        loan packages and is active in bank participations and corporate loan
        syndications. RJBank generates revenue principally through the interest income
        earned on the transactions noted above, offset by the interest expense it
        incurs
        on client deposits and on its borrowings.

RJBank
        operates from a single branch location adjacent to the Company’s headquarters
        complex in St. Petersburg, Florida. Access to RJBank's products and services
        is

        the
        bank's $1.1 billion in deposits representing cash balances from fee based

        and IRA accounts carried by RJA, most of which are managed by Eagle and RJA
        -

STOCK
        LOAN/BORROW

This
        activity involves the borrowing and lending of securities from and to other
        broker-dealers, financial institutions and other counterparties, generally
        as an
        intermediary. The borrower of the securities puts up a cash deposit, commonly
        102% of the market value of the securities, on which interest is earned.
        Accordingly, the lender receives cash and pays interest. These cash deposits
        are
        adjusted daily to reflect changes in current market value. The net revenues
        of
        this operation are the interest spreads generated.

COMPETITION

The
        Company is engaged in intensely competitive businesses. The Company competes
        with many larger, better capitalized providers of financial services, including
        other securities firms, some of which are affiliated with major financial
        services companies, insurance companies, banking institutions and other
        organizations. The Company also competes with a number of firms offering
        on-line
        financial services and discount brokerage services, usually with lower levels
        of
        service, to individual clients. The Company competes principally on the basis
        of
        quality of its associates, service, product selection, location and reputation
        in local markets.

In
        the
        financial services industry, there is significant competition for qualified
        associates. The Company's ability to compete effectively in its businesses
        is
        substantially dependent on its continuing ability to attract, retain, and
        motivate qualified associates, including successful Financial Advisors,
        investment bankers, trading professionals, portfolio managers and other
        revenue-producing or specialized personnel.

REGULATION

The
        following discussion sets forth some of the material elements of the regulatory
        framework applicable to the financial services industry and provides some
        specific information relevant to the Company. The regulatory framework is
        intended primarily for the protection of customers and the securities markets,
        depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund and not for the protection
        of
        creditors or shareholders. Under certain circumstances, these rules may limit
        the ability of the Company to make capital withdrawals from its broker-dealer
        subsidiaries.

To
        the
        extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory
        provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular
        statutory and regulatory provisions. A change in applicable statutes,
        regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on the Company’s
        business.

The
        financial services industry in the United States is subject to extensive
        regulation under federal and state laws. The SEC is the federal agency charged
        with administration of the federal securities laws. Financial services firms
        are
        also subject to regulation by state securities commissions in those states
        in
        which they conduct business. RJA and RJFS are currently registered as
        broker-dealers in all 50 states. In addition, financial services firms are
        subject to regulation by various foreign governments, securities exchanges,
        central banks and regulatory bodies, particularly in those countries where
        they
        have established offices. Various Company affiliates have offices in France,
        the
        United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Luxemburg, Turkey, Argentina,
        India, British Virgin Islands, Canada and Uruguay.

Much
        of
        the regulation of broker-dealers, however, has been delegated to self-regulatory
        organizations ("SROs"), principally the NASD, the NYSE and other securities
        exchanges. These SROs adopt and amend rules (which are subject to approval
        by
        the SEC) for governing the industry and conduct periodic examinations of
        member
        broker-dealers.

The
        financial services industry in Canada is subject to comprehensive regulation
        under both federal and provincial laws. Securities commissions have been
        established in 13 provinces and territorial jurisdictions and are charged
        with
        the administration of securities laws. RJ Ltd. is currently registered in
        all
        Canadian jurisdictions. Securities dealers in Canada are also subject to
        regulation by SROs which are responsible for the enforcement of and conformity
        with securities legislation for their members and have been granted the powers
        to prescribe their own rules of conduct and financial requirements of members.
        RJ Ltd. is regulated by the Securities Commissions in the jurisdictions of
        registration as well as by the SROs, the IDA and Market Regulation Services
        Inc.

Broker-dealers
        are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business,
        including:

·

sales
                  methods

·

trading
                  practices

·

uses
                  and safekeeping of clients' funds and
                  securities

·

capital
                  structure and financial soundness

·

                  keeping

·

the
                  conduct of directors, officers and
                  employees

·

insurance
                  requirements


The
        SEC,
        SROs and state securities commissions may conduct administrative proceedings
        that can result in censure, fine, suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer,
        its officers or employees. Such administrative proceedings, whether or not
        resulting in adverse findings, can require substantial expenditures and can
        have
        an adverse impact on the reputation of a broker-dealer.

The
        Company's U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are required by federal law to
        belong
        to SIPC. When the SIPC fund falls below a certain amount, members are required
        to pay annual assessments of up to 1% of adjusted gross revenues. As a result
        of
        adequate fund levels, each of the Company's two domestic broker-dealer
        subsidiaries was required to pay only the minimum annual assessment of
        $


in
        fiscal 2005. The SIPC fund provides protection for securities held in customer
        accounts up to $500,000 per customer, with a limitation of $100,000 on claims
        for cash balances. In December 2003, RJA joined with other major U.S. securities
        brokerage firms to form Customer Asset Protection Company (“CAPCO”), a licensed
        Vermont insurance company, to provide excess SIPC coverage. CAPCO provides
        account protection for the total net equity of client accounts of participating
        firms with no aggregate limit. CAPCO has received a financial strength rating
        of
        A+ from Standard and Poor’s. These coverages do not protect against market
        fluctuations.

RJ
        Ltd.
        is required by the IDA to belong to the Canadian Investors Protection Fund
        ("CIPF"), whose primary role is investor protection. The CIPF may charge
        member
        firms assessments based on revenues and risk premiums based on capital
        deficiencies. The CIPF provides protection for securities and cash held in
        client accounts up to CDN$1,000,000 per client with separate coverage of
        CDN$1,000,000 for certain types of accounts. This coverage does not protect
        against market fluctuations.

See
        Note
        18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information
        on
        SEC and IDA regulations pertaining to broker-dealer regulatory minimum net
        capital requirements.

The
        Company's investment advisory operations, including the Company-sponsored
        mutual
        funds, are also subject to extensive regulation. The Company's U.S. asset
        managers are registered as investment advisors with the SEC and are also
        required to make notice filings in certain states. Virtually all aspects
        of the
        asset management business are subject to various federal and state laws and
        regulations. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to benefit
        the
        asset management clients and generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies
        broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict an
        investment advisor from conducting its asset management business in the event
        that it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions
        that
        may be imposed for a failure include the suspension of individual employees,
        limitations on the asset managers engaging in the asset management business
        for
        specified periods of time, the revocation of registrations, and other censures
        and fines. A regulatory proceeding, regardless of whether it results in a
        sanction, can require substantial expenditures and can have an adverse effect
        on
        the reputation of an asset manager.

RJBank
        is
        subject to various regulatory capital requirements established by the federal
        banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate
        certain mandatory - and possibly additional discretionary - actions by
        regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on RJBank's
        financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory
        framework for prompt corrective action, RJBank must meet specific capital
        guidelines that involve quantitative measures of RJBank's assets, liabilities,
        and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting
        practices. RJBank's capital amounts and classification are also subject to
        qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings,
        and
        other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure
        capital
        adequacy require RJBank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and
        Tier
        I capital to risk-weighted assets (as defined in the regulations). See Note
        of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information
        and capital analysis.

The
        Company's two state-chartered trust companies are subject to regulation by
        the
        states in which they are chartered. These regulations focus on, among other
        things, the soundness of internal controls in place at the trust
        companies.

As
        a
        public company, the Company is subject to corporate governance requirements
        established by SEC and New York Stock Exchange, as well as federal and state
        law. Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Company is required to meet certain
        requirements regarding business dealings with members of the Board of Directors,
        the structure of its Audit Committee, and ethical standards for its senior
        financial officers, among other things. Under SEC and New York Stock Exchange
        rules, the Company is required to comply with other standards of corporate
        governance, including having a majority of independent directors serve on
        its
        Board of Directors, and the establishment of independent audit, compensation
        and
        corporate governance committees.


Under
        Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Company is required to complete
        an
        assessment of its internal controls over financial reporting and to obtain
        reports from its independent auditors regarding their opinion of management's
        assessment of internal controls and their independent opinion regarding the
        Company's internal control over financial reporting. This requirement imposes
        additional costs on the Company, reflecting internal staff and management
        time,
        as well as additional audit fees and fees for outside service providers and
        consultants.

On
        September 27, 2005, the State of Utah filed a petition for Order of Censure,
        Suspension of License and Imposition of Fine against the Company related
        to the
        alleged failure to supervise a former Financial Advisor. The Utah Securities
        Division asked the Division Director to enter an order censuring the Company,
        suspending its license in Utah for 30 days, ordering a fine of $100,000 and
        requiring the engagement of an independent consultant to review its supervisory
        structure and procedures. The Company is contesting these
        allegations.

As
        previously reported, on September 30, 2004 the SEC instituted an administrative
        proceeding against RJFS alleging fraud and failure to supervise a former
        Financial Advisor in the RJFS Cranston, Rhode Island office. The Administrative
        Law Judge issued an initial decision in September 2005 finding that RJFS
        failed
        to supervise and that it was liable for the fraud committed by its former
        Financial Advisor, and ordered RJFS to disgorge $5,866 and pay a civil penalty
        of $6.9 million. The Judge denied the SEC’s request for a cease and desist
        order, a consultant review and a finding that RJFS violated e-mail retention
        rules. The decision was confirmed by the SEC on November 21, 2005.

RISK
        FACTORS

Economic
        and Political Developments and Their Impact on Securities Markets Could
        Adversely Affect the Company’s Business

The
        Company is engaged in various financial services businesses. As such, the
        Company is directly affected by general economic and political conditions,
        changes in the rate of inflation and the related impact on securities markets,
        fluctuations in interest and currency rates, investor confidence, and changes
        in
        volume and price levels of the securities markets. Severe market fluctuations
        or
        weak economic conditions could reduce the Company’s trading volume and net
        revenues and adversely affect its profitability.

The
        Company Faces Intense Competition

The
        Company is engaged in intensely competitive businesses. See the section entitled
        “Competition” of Item 1 of this report for additional information about the

        have an adverse affect on its business, results of operations, financial
        condition and liquidity.

        and Legal Developments Could Adversely Affect the Company’s
        Business

The
        securities industry is subject to extensive regulation and broker-dealers
        are
        subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business. See
        the
        section entitled “Regulation” of Item 1 of this report for additional
        information regarding the Company’s regulatory environment and Item 3, “Legal
        Proceedings”, for a discussion of the Company’s legal matters. The Company could
        be subject to civil liability, criminal liability, or sanctions, including
        revocation of its subsidiaries’ registrations as investment advisors or
        broker-dealers, revocation of the licenses of its Financial Advisors, censures,
        fines, or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business,
        if
        it violates such laws or regulations. Any such liability or sanction could
        have
        a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of
        operations, and business prospects. In addition, the regulatory environment
        in
        which the Company operates frequently changes and has seen significant increased
        regulation in recent years. The Company may be adversely affected as a result
        of
        new or revised legislation or regulations, changes in federal, state or foreign
        tax laws, or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing
        laws
        and regulations.

The
        Company’s Business Is Highly Dependent on Technology

The
        Company’s businesses rely extensively on electronic data processing and
        communications systems, and its continued success will depend upon its ability
        to successfully maintain and upgrade the capability of those systems and
        retain
        skilled employees. Failure of those systems, which could result from events
        beyond the Company’s control, could result in financial losses, liability to
        clients and damage to the Company’s reputation.


The
        Company’s Operations Could Be Adversely Affected By Serious
        Weather

Conditions

The
        Company’s principal operations are located in St. Petersburg, Florida. During
        the past two years, there has been a significant increase in hurricane activity
        in the Gulf Coast which has directly affected other parts of Florida. While
        the
        Company has a business continuity plan that permits significant operations
        to be
        conducted from its Southfield, Michigan location (see section entitled “RJA -
        Operations” above), the Company’s operations could be adversely affected by
        hurricanes or other serious weather conditions that could affect processing
        of
        transactions and communications.

The
        Company’s Business is Dependent on Fees Generated from the Distribution of
        Financial Products

A
        large
        portion of the Company’s revenues are derived from fees generated from the
        distribution of financial products such as mutual funds and variable annuities.
        Changes in the structure or amount of the fees paid by the sponsors of these
        products could directly affect the Company’s revenues and profits.

Other
        Risks

        Item
        7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in this report
        regarding the Company’s exposure to, and approaches to managing, market risk,
        interest rate risk, equity price risk, credit risk, operational risk and
        regulatory and legal risk.

Factors
        Affecting “Forward-Looking Statements”

From
        time
        to time, the Company may publish “forward-looking statements” within the meaning
        of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E
        of the
        Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or make oral statements
        that
        constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements may
        relate to such matters as anticipated financial performance, future revenues
        or
        earnings, business prospects, projected ventures, new products, anticipated
        market performance, and similar matters. The Private Securities Litigation
        Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements.
        In
        order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor, the Company cautions readers
        that a variety of factors could cause the Company's actual results to differ
        materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in
        the
        Company's forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties, many
        of
        which are beyond the Company's control, are discussed in the section entitled
        “Risk Factors” of Item 1 of this report. The Company does not undertake any
        obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking
        statements.

PROPERTIES

The
        Company's headquarters is located on approximately 55 acres within the Carillon
        office park in St. Petersburg, Florida. The headquarters complex currently
        includes four main towers which encompass a total of 884,000 square feet
        of
        office space, the Raymond James Bank building, which is a 26,000-square-foot
        two-story building, and two five-story parking garages. At this location,
        the
        Company has the ability to add approximately 490,000 square feet of new office
        space. Raymond James also has 30,000 square feet of leased space near Carillon.
        The Company recently relocated its Detroit, Michigan operations to a newly
        renovated 84,000 square foot building on 14 acres in Southfield, Michigan.
        The
        Company owns that real estate as well as a 45,000 square foot building in
        Detroit that previously housed those operations. The Company intends to sell
        the
        Detroit building.

The
        Company leases offices in various locations throughout the United States
        and in
        certain foreign countries. With the exception of a Company-owned RJA branch
        office building in Crystal River, FL, RJA branches are leased with various
        expiration dates through 2014. RJ Ltd. leases premises for main offices in
        Vancouver, Calgary, and Toronto and for branch offices throughout Canada.
        These
        leases have various expiration dates through 2013. RJ Ltd. does not own any
        land
        or buildings. See Note 13 to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
        information regarding the Company's leases.

Leases
        for branch offices of RJFS and of the independent contractors of RJ Ltd.
        and
        RJIS are the responsibility of the respective independent contractor registered
        representatives.

LEGAL
        PROCEEDINGS

The
        Company is a defendant or co-defendant in various lawsuits and arbitrations
        incidental to its securities business.  Like others in the retail
        securities industry, the Company experienced a significant increase in the
        number of claims seeking recovery due to portfolio losses in the early 2000's.
        During the past two years, the number of claims has declined but are still
        above
        long-term historic levels.

As
        previously reported, the Company and RJFS are defendants in a series of lawsuits
        and arbitrations relating to an alleged mortgage lending program known as
        the
        "Premiere 72" program, that was administered by a company owned in part by
        two
        individuals who were registered as Financial Advisors with RJFS in Houston.
        The
        lawsuits are pending in various courts, and several cases that had been removed
        to federal court were remanded to state court, and the plaintiffs are seeking
        reconsideration of that decision. In July 2005, RJFS paid approximately $24
        million in a settlement with approximately 380 claimants in this litigation,
        representing approximately two-thirds of the outstanding claims. The Company
        estimates that the value of the claims resolved also represents approximately
        two-thirds of the value of the total claims and has made adjustments to its
        litigation reserves to give effect to the estimated impact of the settlement.
        Several of the arbitration claims relating to this matter had been previously
        settled by RJFS for amounts consistent with its evaluation of those
        claims.

See
        "Regulation" above for a description of certain regulatory
        proceedings.

The
        Company is contesting the allegations in these and other cases and believes
        that
        there are meritorious defenses in each of these lawsuits and arbitrations. 
In view of the number and diversity of claims against the Company, the number
        of
        jurisdictions in which litigation is pending and the inherent difficulty
        of
        predicting the outcome of litigation and other claims, the Company cannot
        state
        with certainty what the eventual outcome of pending litigation or other claims
        will be.  In the opinion of the Company's management, based on current
        available information, review with outside legal counsel, and consideration
        of
        amounts provided for in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
        with
        respect to these matters, ultimate resolution of these matters will not have
        a
        material adverse impact on the Company's financial position or results of
        operations.  However, resolution of one or more of these matters may have a
        material effect on the results of operations in any future period, depending
        upon the ultimate resolution of those matters and upon the level of income
        for
        such period.

MANAGEMENT'S
        DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
        OPERATIONS

Overview

The
        following Management’s Discussion and Analysis is intended to help the reader
        understand the results of operations and the financial condition of the Company.
        Management’s Discussion and Analysis is provided as a supplement to, and should
        be read in conjunction with, the Company’s financial statements and accompanying
        notes to the financial statements.

The
        Company’s results continue to be highly correlated to the direction of the
        equity markets and are subject to volatility due to changes in interest rates,
        valuation of financial instruments, economic and political trends and industry
        competition. An environment favorable to the Company’s success is characterized
        by a stable political environment, low inflation, low unemployment,
        upward-trending financial markets, and strong business profitability which
        lead
        to investor confidence. During 2005, long term inflation expectations remained
        low and the Federal Reserve continued its measured and consecutive short-term
        interest rate increases. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and
        NASDAQ indices rose 5%, 11% and 14%, respectively, during the fiscal year.
        The
        average monthly volume of shares traded increased 16% over the prior year
        on
        both the NYSE and NASDAQ. Corporate earnings have also been generally much
        stronger than expected, with earnings growth generally in double digits over
        the
        prior year. These factors had a positive impact on the levels of equity
        underwritings and merger and acquisition activity leading to strong results
        in
        the Capital Markets Segment. The impact of higher trading volumes and improved
        investor confidence is reflected in the increase in both the Private Client
        Group and Capital Markets securities commissions.


Results
        of Operations - Total Company

The
        Company currently operates through the following seven business segments:

Private
        Client Group; Capital Markets; Asset Management; RJBank; Emerging Markets;
        Stock
        Loan/Borrow and various corporate investments and expenses combined in the
        "Other" segment. T

he
        Other
        segment previously consisted of what is now three segments: Emerging Markets,
        Stock Loan/Borrow, and Other. Reclassifications have been made in the segment
        disclosures for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 to conform to the current year
        presentation.

The
        following table presents consolidated and segment financial information for
        the
        Company for the years indicated:


Year
        ended September 30, 2005 Compared with the Year ended September 24, 2004
        - Total
        Company

The
        Company had record results for its fiscal year ended September 30, 2005,
        with
        both total and net revenues surpassing $2 billion for the first time in the
        Company’s history. Net income of over $150 million was up 18% from the prior
        year. Driven by robust increases in investment banking revenues (41%) and
        net
        interest earnings (48% - see table below) combined with solid increases in
        investment advisory fees (17%) and securities commissions and fees (10%),
        all
        three of the Company’s largest segments had significantly higher revenues than
        in the prior year. Capital Markets and Asset Management had even more impressive
        increases in pretax profits (34% and 47%, respectively). Private Client Group
        earnings were negatively impacted by legal expenses and settlements.

Total
        firm net revenues increased 14%, while pre-tax, pre-minority interest profits
        were up 19% over the prior year. Pre-tax profits after consideration of minority
        interest were up 21% over the prior year.

Year
        ended September 24, 2004 Compared with the Year ended September 26, 2003
        - Total
        Company

Total
        revenues increased 22% to a record $1.83 billion, as each of the Company’s three
        largest segments contributed to the growth. Net revenues rose 23%, as interest
        expense grew only 6%. Scattered throughout several segments, net interest
        earnings continue to be an important source of profits to the Company (see
        the
        table below). Significantly, the upward trend of the equity markets during
        most
        of fiscal 2004 led many individual investors to return to the market, which
        in
        turn led to a steady rise in margin debits throughout the year. These balances
        are the Company’s best interest spread product, as the risk is well controlled
        and they are funded by relatively low cost client funds awaiting investment.
        Margin loan growth is largely responsible for the overall 5% improvement
        in net
        interest income.


Net
        Interest Analysis


The
        dramatic increase in net interest earnings was largely rate-driven augmented
        by
        a healthy 21% increase in average margin balances. The Federal Reserve raised
        short-term rates by 25 basis points eight times during fiscal 2005. Rising
        rates
        contribute to the Company's net interest earnings by increasing spreads earned
        on cash balances of brokerage clients, at Raymond James Bank, and in the
        securities lending operation. Further, higher rates were earned on the portion
        of the Company's capital that is invested in interest-bearing
        instruments.

Results
        of Operations - Private Client Group

The
        following table presents consolidated financial information for the Private
        Client Group segment for the years indicated:


Year
        ended September 30, 2005 Compared with the Year ended September 24, 2004
        -
        Private Client Group

The
        Private Client Group's (“PCG”) results reflect an 11% increase in commission and
        fee revenue. Due to the continued process of upgrading the Company’s Financial
        Advisor population, which encompassed the termination of lower producers,
        the
        net increase in the number of Financial Advisors was only 2%. The Company’s
        branding campaign, which has increased the visibility of the firm name, and
        the
        promotion of the AdvisorChoice platform for Financial Advisors has helped
        to
        increase Financial Advisor interest in the Company. In particular, the employee
        firm (RJA) had strong recruiting results in the latter half of the year as
        the
        Company benefited from industry consolidation. Most of the increase in
        commission and fee revenue is attributable to the increased average production
        of Financial Advisors and was close to the Company's goal of a 10% increase
        per
        year. Further productivity gains may be expected, provided the market conditions
        remain favorable, as newly recruited Financial Advisors complete the transition
        of their accounts and existing Financial Advisors grow their
        businesses.

While
        average margin balances increased 21% for the fiscal year, interest revenues
        within PCG increased 97% as a result of rising short-term interest rates,
        which
        also led to higher than normal spreads. Accordingly, PCG net interest earnings
        increased 37%, and represented nearly 80% of this segment's
        earnings.

Commission
        expense grew ratably with commission and fee revenue. Increased administrative
        compensation costs include cost of living raises, a 6% increase in employee
        headcount and increased incentive compensation and benefit plan accruals
        related
        to increased corporate profitability. Communications and Information Processing
        expense increased as the Company continues its efforts to provide state of
        the
        art technology to its Financial Advisors. Business Development expense includes
        the marketing expenditures to promote the AdvisorChoice platform to prospective
        Financial Advisors and the Company's branding efforts - including a new
        television ad and increased air time. These efforts, combined with the stadium
        naming rights for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers football stadium, have increased
        the
        Company’s name recognition nationwide. Business Development expense also
        includes increased travel expenses related to recruiting efforts and increased
        attendance at sales and education conferences. Other expense continues to
        be
        dominated by legal expenses and settlements.

PCG
        margins, which were 7.6% in fiscal 2005, were negatively impacted by the
        losses
        in the early stage, independent contractor joint venture in the UK, relatively
        low margins in the private client group in RJ Ltd (as they grow their
        independent contractor division) and historically high legal costs and
        settlements, which has had an estimated 1.5% to 2% impact on PCG margins
        in each
        of the past two years.

Year
        ended September 24, 2004 Compared with the Year ended September 26, 2003
        -
        Private Client Group

The
        25%
        increase in PCG commission revenues was attributable to the combination of
        several factors. First, there was a modest net increase in Financial Advisor
        headcount of 118, or 2.5%, to 4,929 in the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries.
        More importantly, the process of upgrading the sales force by releasing lower
        producers continued in earnest. Thus, the overall composition of the sales
        force
        was improved from the prior year. Finally, there were 7½ months of strong market
        activity during 2004 as compared to approximately six strong months in 2003.
        The
        aforementioned improved quality of the sales force amplified the effect on
        revenues of the longer duration of good market conditions.

The
        improved interest spread was due to the steady rise in margin debits throughout
        the year. The increase in financial service fees was a result of the increased
        number of transaction fees from trades in fee-based accounts and a higher
        amount
        of IRA fees as the number of such accounts grew. Other revenues increased
        due to
        higher mutual fund networking fees and greater meeting sponsorship
        revenues.

Administrative
        compensation costs reflect increased home office staffing in the domestic
        independent contractor subsidiary and higher incentive compensation accruals
        as
        profits were significantly improved. Business development expenses rose due
        primarily to the cost of promoting the AdvisorChoice platform. Most notably,
        other expenses, including legal expenses and reserves, declined by one third
        from the prior year.

As
        is the
        case in all of the Company’s major businesses, there is significant operating
        leverage in the PCG, particularly with increases in Financial Advisor average
        production. Accordingly, the 24% increase in net revenues led to a surge
        in
        pretax income of 53%.

The
        following table presents consolidated financial information for the Capital
        Markets segment for the years indicated:

Year
        ended September 30, 2005 Compared with the Year ended September 24, 2004
        -
        Capital Markets

Institutional
        commissions were relatively flat, with equity commissions up 11% and fixed
        income commissions down 14%, as trends established in the prior year continued.
        Although the number of managed/co-managed corporate underwritings was nearly
        flat, underwriting fees were up 47% as a result of an increased average deal
        size and a greater number of lead managed deals. Merger and acquisition fees
        nearly doubled from fiscal 2004. Equity Capital Markets has nine strategic
        business units; real estate, energy and healthcare were the strongest performers
        during fiscal 2005. These record investment banking results contribute
        significantly to the firm's profits, as incremental revenues produce a high
        margin.

RJTCF
        revenues were up 30% and contributed $5 million to the segment's pretax profits.
        RJTCF syndicates real estate partnerships that qualify for federal and state
        low
        income housing tax credits. During fiscal 2005, RJTCF invested over $250
        million
        for institutional investors in 93 real estate transactions compared to $206
        million in 80 deals in fiscal 2004.

Interest
        expense, the expense associated

with

carrying
        the fixed income trading inventory, was up due to increased interest rates.
        Non-interest expense was up 11% - with 83% of that increase related to
        compensation. The remaining expenses were relatively flat.

        Capital Markets

Despite
        a
        significant decline in fixed income sales volume, the unprecedented activity
        levels of the Equity Capital Markets operations propelled this segment to
        record
        revenues and profits. Most notably, the Company was lead or co-manager for
        public offerings for the year, nearly double the number in 2003, as market
        conditions were conducive for several of the industries on which these efforts
        are focused. This deal flow was a major contributing factor to the increase
        in
        institutional equity sales commissions. The decline in fixed income commissions
        reflects investors’ hesitancy to commit funds while anticipating a rising
        interest rate environment. The rise in interest expense represents the financing
        costs of the higher average fixed income inventory balances.

Commission
        expense was nearly flat despite the 15% rise in commission revenues as fixed
        income commissions carry a higher payout than equities. The increase in
        administrative expense is primarily attributable to higher profit-based
        incentive compensation in equity capital markets departments. The operating
        leverage in this segment was dramatic as the average production of institutional
        equity salesmen, sales traders and investment bankers rose sharply. As a
        result,
        record profits of $57.9 million were 54% higher than in the prior
        year.

        of Operations - Asset Management

The
        following table presents consolidated financial information for the Asset
        Management segment for the years indicated:


The
        following table presents assets under management at the dates
        indicated:

Year
        ended September 30, 2005 Compared with the Year ended September 24, 2004
        - Asset
        Management

Investment
        advisory fees increased roughly 17%. Due to the billing schedules this increase
        does not correlate directly to the increase in average assets under management.
        Approximately one-half of the Company’s assets under management are billed based
        on beginning-of-quarter balances and slightly less than one-third are billed
        based on average daily balances. The remaining assets under management are
        predominantly billed based on end-of-quarter balances. The overall growth
        of
        managed equity programs was the aggregate result of strong net sales and
        market
        appreciation. Eagle Asset Management has several portfolio managers with
        strong
        performance records and the firm has been successful in winning a growing
        number
        of institutional accounts. Accordingly, assets managed for institutional
        accounts increased 34% over the prior year. Several of the same portfolio
        managers also manage portfolios for the Heritage Asset Management mutual
        fund
        family. Assets in these funds, excluding the money market funds,

increased

28% over
        the prior year.

In
        addition to Eagle portfolio managers, the asset management division of RJA
        offers 30 independent investment advisors to the Company's clients through
        its
        Raymond James Consulting Services program. Assets managed within this program
        have increased 37% over the prior year. The Company has also seen significant
        growth (153%) in its managed mutual fund product (Freedom) as this concept
        is
        extremely popular with Financial Advisors and clients.

Expense
        growth in this segment was a modest 9%, primarily reflecting increased personnel
        costs related to profit-based incentive compensation and increased business
        development expenses related to increased travel and proposal costs. Other
        expense is predominantly fees paid to outside money managers. With the capacity
        to increase assets under management significantly in certain disciplines
        without
        significant additional costs, there is a higher degree of leverage in this
        segment and management has a positive outlook on its prospects, provided
        market
        conditions do not deteriorate and performance results remain strong.

Year
        ended September 24, 2004 Compared with the Year ended September 26, 2003
        - Asset
        Management

Investment
        advisory fees rose at a rate higher than that of assets under management
        primarily because the increase in assets consisted entirely of equity accounts,
        which bear a higher management fee than fixed income and money market assets.
        In
        addition, the Company earned approximately $930,000 more in performance fees
        from managed hedge funds than in the prior year. Money market fund balances
        were
        the only category that declined, as investors gained confidence in the equity
        markets and shifted some of these funds accordingly.

The
        increase in administrative expense relates primarily to performance based
        and
        profit-based incentive compensation accruals. Once again, operating leverage
        was
        evident as a modest increase in revenues led to significant rise in pretax
        income.


Results

The
        following table presents consolidated financial information for RJBank for
        the
        years indicated:

Year

        -
        RJBank

Interest
        revenue and expense increased due to the combination of balance sheet growth
        and
        rising interest rates during the year. As a result, net interest income
        increased 32% to $23 million for fiscal 2005 vs. $17.5 million in fiscal
        2004.
        The increase in loans receivable was predominantly in purchased residential
        mortgage loan pools, and therefore did not require significant increases
        in
        costs, with total non-interest expense actually declining 2%. This decrease
        is
        primarily the net impact of a decline in the provision for loan losses. The
        provision for loan losses is directly correlated to the net increase in loans
        outstanding and the mix of such loans.

RJ
        Bank
        has become, and is expected to grow into, a more significant segment within
        the
        Company during the next several years. RJF contributed an additional $80
        million
        in equity capital to RJ Bank in fiscal 2005 allowing RJ Bank to begin to
        grow
        its asset base in preparation for offering an improved deposit alternative
        for
        certain brokerage accounts. The Company currently offers customers the option
        of
        sweeping their cash awaiting investment to the Heritage Cash Trust (the money
        market fund managed by Heritage Asset Management) or leaving the cash in
        the
        broker-dealer - in the Client Interest Program. RJBank anticipates offering
        customers a competitive option beginning in late fiscal 2006. The clients
        will
        receive an equivalent money market interest rate in the bank account and
        their
        accounts will have FDIC insurance. This program is not expected to have a
        significant impact on the results of operations in fiscal 2006.

        RJBank

The
        improvement in net interest income was a result of further progress in loan
        growth as a percentage of total assets. The decline in other income reflects
        the
        slowdown of refinancing activity, which led to fewer mortgage originations
        and
        lower fees from the subsequent sales of originated fixed rate
        loans.

The
        increase in other expense encompasses a higher provision for loan losses
        due to
        the increased levels of purchased whole loan pools and outstanding commercial
        loan balances.

RJBank’s
        policy is to maintain a substantially duration-matched portfolio of assets
        and
        liabilities. As the vast majority of liabilities are floating rate demand
        deposits, certain asset purchases are hedged through entering into interest
        rate
        swap contracts. Interest spreads have been negatively impacted by the effect
        of
        interest rate swaps which were put in place several years ago to hedge fixed
        rate assets against interest rate increases; substantially all of these
        contracts expire by the end of calendar 2005.


The
        combination of the factors discussed above resulted in a 13% decline in pretax
        income. As mentioned in previous years, current results are negatively impacted
        during periods of significant net loan growth as a provision for loan losses
        is
        recorded in the period of origination or purchase, while the benefit of the
        higher interest earnings is recognized over subsequent periods.

The
        Company’s stock borrow balances averaged $1,129,560 during fiscal year 2005 vs.
        $1,291,636 in fiscal 2004. As the Company’s stock loan business is predominantly
        a matched book business, stock loan balances were similar. Average spreads
        increased from .2% in fiscal 2004 to .5% in 2005 largely due to rising interest
        rates, resulting in a 127% increase in net interest income. The business
        is well
        leveraged, resulting in a 179% increase in pre- tax profits.

        made at
        the corporate level, including 30 partnerships managed independently of Raymond
        James and two managed by Raymond James subsidiaries. Expenses are predominately
        executive incentive compensation expense, which increased due to improved
        corporate earnings.

        Emerging Markets, Stock Loan/Borrow, and Other

Net
        interest income improved as securities lending balances were much higher
        than in
        the prior year and the balance of free cash was also higher, enough so that
        the
        parent company’s term loan ($50 million balance at payoff) was repaid in August
        2004, more than a year ahead of maturity. Other income reflects the improved
        performance of the Company’s consolidated joint ventures in emerging markets,
        particularly in Turkey.

Statement
        of Financial Condition Analysis

The
        Company’s statement of financial condition consists primarily of cash and cash
        equivalents (a large portion of which are segregated for customers), receivables
        and payables. The statement of financial condition is primarily liquid in
        nature, providing the Company with flexibility in financing its business.
        Total
        assets of $8.4 billion at September 30, 2005 were up 10% over September 24,
        2004. This increase is made up of increases in cash, receivables from brokerage
        and bank clients and an increase in the assets held by consolidated variable
        interest entities (“VIEs”) net of a decline in stock borrowed balances. The
        assets of the consolidated VIEs include cash, other receivables and investments
        in real estate partnerships. Total liabilities have increased 8% since the
        prior
        fiscal year end. This increase is made up of increased payables to brokerage
        and
        bank clients, and an increase in the loans payable of the consolidated VIEs
        net
        of the decrease in stock loaned. The gross assets and liabilities of the
        consolidated VIEs are expected to increase as the tax credit fund business
        grows
        and establishes additional multi-investor funds. This growth is expected
        to have
        a minimal net impact on the Company. The broker-dealer gross assets and
        liabilities, including stock loan/stock borrow, receivables and payables
        from/to
        brokers, dealers and clearing organizations and clients fluctuate with the
        Company's business levels and overall market conditions.

Liquidity
        and Capital Resources

Net
        cash
        provided by operating activities during fiscal 2005 was approximately $434
        million. Cash was provided by earnings and increased brokerage client cash
        balances. This increase in cash was offset by increased receivables from
        clients
        arising from normal cash and margin transactions and fees receivable. Cash
        was
        also impacted by investments in real estate partnerships held by variable
        interest entities. Since the Company’s ownership

interest
        in these variable interest entities range from .01% to 1%, the net cash impact
        was offset by the change in minority interest.

The
        remainder of the cash used is attributed to the net fluctuations in various
        other asset and liability accounts.

Investing
        activities used $323 million in cash, which is primarily due to loans originated
        and purchased by RJBank, the purchases of available for sale securities,
        and
        capital expenditures, net of loan repayments and the maturation and repayments
        of available for sale securities.


Financing
        activities provided $354 million, the result of an increase in deposits at
        RJBank and proceeds from borrowed funds related to VIEs, net of the payment
        of
        cash dividends.

The
        Company has loans payable consisting primarily of a $70 million mortgage
        on its
        headquarters office complex, a $1.1 million mortgage on the office of a foreign
        joint venture, and $70 million in Federal Home Loan Bank

("FHLB")

advances
        at RJBank. In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries have the following
        lines of credit: RJF has a committed $100 million line of credit, RJA has
        uncommitted bank lines of credit aggregating $435 million with commercial
        banks,
        Raymond James Credit Corporation has a line of credit for $25 million, and
        RJ
        Ltd. has a CDN$40 uncommitted million line of credit. The committed RJF line
        of
        credit was increased to $200 million from $100 million on October 13, 2005.
        At
        September 30, 2005, the Company had approximately $5.3 million in outstanding
        loans against these lines of credit. Additionally, RJBank had $325 million
        in
        credit available from the

FHLB

at
        September 30, 2005.

The
        Company has committed a total of $34.9 million, in amounts ranging from $200,000
        to $1.5 million, to 36 different independent venture capital or private equity
        partnerships. As of September 30, 2005, the Company has invested $26.8 million
        of that amount.

Additionally,
        the Company is the general partner in two internally sponsored private equity
        limited partnerships to which it has committed $14 million. Of that amount,
        the
        Company has invested $10.7 million as of September 30, 2005.

Management
        has been authorized by the Board of Directors to repurchase its common stock
        at
        their discretion for general corporate purposes. There is no formal stock
        repurchase plan at this time. In May 2004 the Board authorized the repurchase
        of
        up to $75 million of shares. As of September 30, 2005 the unused portion
        of this
        authorization was $73.1 million.

The
        Company has committed to lend to or guarantee obligations of its wholly-owned
        subsidiary, RJ Tax Credit Funds, Inc. (“RJTCF”), of up to $90 million upon
        request, subject to certain limitations as well as annual review and renewal.
        RJTCF borrows in order to invest in partnerships which purchase and develop
        properties qualifying for tax credits.

These
        investments in project partnerships are then sold to various tax credit funds,
        which have third party investors, that RJTCF serves as the managing member
        or
        general partner. RJTCF typically sells these investments within 90-days of
        their
        acquisition, and the proceeds from the sales are used to repay RJTCF borrowings.
        Additionally, RJTCF may make short-term loans or advances to project
        partnerships on behalf of the tax credit funds in which it serves as managing
        member or general partner. At September 30, 2005 guarantees outstanding to
        various tax credit funds totaled $1.1 million and cash funded to invest in
        either loans or investments in project partnerships was $40.9 million. In
        addition, at September 30, 2005 RJTCF is committed to additional future fundings
        of $6.5 million related to project partnerships that have not yet been sold
        to
        various tax credit funds.

The
        Company is the lessor in two leveraged commercial aircraft transactions with
        two
        major domestic airlines (Delta and Continental). The Company's ability to
        realize its expected return is dependent upon the airlines' ability to fulfill
        their lease obligations. In the event that the airlines default on their
        lease
        commitments and the Trustees for the debt holders is unable to re-lease or
        sell
        the planes with adequate terms, the Company would suffer a loss of some or
        all
        of its investment. Delta Airlines filed for bankruptcy protection on September
        14, 2005. Accordingly, the Company recorded a $6.5 million pretax charge
        to
        fully reserve the balance of its investment in the leveraged lease of an
        aircraft to Delta. The Company had taken a $4 million pretax charge in the
        prior
        year to partially reserve for this investment. No amount of these charges
        represents a cash expenditure; however, in the event of a material modification
        to the lease or foreclosure of the aircraft by the debt holders, certain
        tax
        payments of up to approximately $8.7 million could be accelerated. The expected
        tax payments are currently reflected on the statement of financial condition
        as
        a deferred tax liability and are not expected to result in a further charge
        to
        earnings. The Company also has an outstanding leveraged lease with Continental
        valued at $11.8 million as of September 30, 2005. To date, Continental remains
        current on its lease payments to the Company. Given the difficult economic
        environment for the airline industry, the Company is closely monitoring this
        investment for specific events or circumstances that would allow reasonable
        estimation of any potential impairment and accelerated tax liability.

The
        Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to requirements of the SEC
        and
        the IDA relating to liquidity and capital standards. The domestic broker-dealer
        subsidiaries of the Company are subject to the requirements of the Uniform
        Net
        Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. RJA,
        a
        member firm of the NYSE, is also subject to the rules of the NYSE, whose
        requirements are substantially the same. Rule 15c3-1 requires that aggregate
        indebtedness, as defined, not to exceed 15 times net capital, as defined.
        Rule
        15c3-1 also provides for an “alternative net capital requirement”, which both
        RJA and RJFS have elected. It requires that minimum net capital, as defined,
        be
        equal to the greater of $250,000 or two percent of Aggregate Debit Items
        arising
        from client transactions. The NYSE may require a member firm to reduce its
        business if its net capital is less than four percent of Aggregate Debit
        Items
        and may prohibit a member firm from expanding its business and declaring
        cash
        dividends if its net capital is less than five percent of Aggregate Debit
        Items.
        Both RJA and RJFS had excess capital as of September 30, 2005.

        is subject to the Minimum Capital Rule (By-Law No. 17 of the IDA) and the
        Early
        Warning System (By-Law No. 30 of the IDA). The Minimum Capital Rule requires
        that every member shall have and maintain at all times Risk Adjusted Capital
        greater than zero calculated in accordance with Form 1 (Joint Regulatory
        Financial Questionnaire and Report) and with such requirements as the Board
        of
        Directors of the IDA may from time to time prescribe. Insufficient Risk Adjusted
        Capital may result in suspension from membership in the stock exchanges or
        the
        IDA. The Early Warning System is designed to provide advance warning that
        a
        member firm is encountering financial difficulties. This system imposes certain
        sanctions on members who are designated in Early Warning Level 1 or Level
        according to its capital, profitability, liquidity position, frequency of
        designation or at the discretion of the IDA. Restrictions on business activities
        and capital transactions, early filing requirements, and mandated corrective
        measures are sanctions that may be imposed as part of the Early Warning System.
        RJ Ltd. was not in Early Warning Level 1 or Level 2 during fiscal 2005 or
        2004.

RJBank
        is
        subject to various regulatory and capital requirements administered by the
        federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can
        initiate certain mandatory - and possibly additional discretionary - actions
        by
        regulators. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework
        for
        prompt corrective action, RJBank must meet specific capital guidelines that
        involve quantitative measures of RJBank's assets, liabilities, and certain
        off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.
        RJBank's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative
        judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other
        factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital
        adequacy require RJBank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and
        Tier
        I Capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined).
        Management believes, as of September 30, 2005, that the Bank meets all capital
        adequacy requirements to which it is subject.

Critical
        Accounting Policies

The
        Company’s financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance
        with U.S. GAAP. The following is a summary of the Company’s critical accounting
        policies. For a full description of these and other accounting policies,
        see
        Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company
        believes that of its significant accounting policies, those described below
        involve a high degree of judgment and complexity. These critical accounting
        policies require estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets,
        liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the consolidated financial
        statements. Due to their nature, estimates involve judgments based upon
        available information. Actual results or amounts could differ from estimates
        and
        the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial
        statements. Therefore, understanding these policies is important in
        understanding the reported results of operations and the financial position
        of
        the Company.

Valuation
        of Securities and Other Assets

“Trading
        securities” and “Available for sale securities” are reflected in the
        Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition at fair value or amounts that
        approximate fair value. In accordance with SFAS 115, “Accounting for Certain
        Investments in Debt and Equity Securities”, unrealized gains and losses related
        to these financial instruments are reflected in net

earnings

or other
        comprehensive income, depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument.
        The
        following table presents the Company’s trading and available for sale securities
        segregated into cash (i.e., non-derivative) trading instruments, derivative
        contracts, and available for sale securities:


Cash
        Trading Instruments and Available for Sale Securities

When
        available, the Company uses prices from independent sources such as listed
        market prices, or broker or dealer price quotations to derive the fair value
        of
        the instruments. For investments in illiquid, privately held or other securities
        that do not have readily determinable fair values, the Company uses estimated
        fair values as determined by management. The following table presents the
        carrying value of cash trading, available for sale securities, and derivative
        contracts for which fair value is measured based on quoted prices or other
        independent sources versus those for which fair value is determined by
        management:

Derivative
        Contracts

Fair
        value for

derivative

contracts

are
        obtained from pricing models that consider current market and contractual
        prices
        for the underlying financial instruments, as well as time value and yield
        curve
        or volatility factors underlying the positions.

Investment
        in Leveraged Leases

The
        Company is the lessor in two leveraged commercial aircraft transactions with
        two
        major domestic airlines (Delta and Continental). The Company's ability to
        realize its expected return is dependent upon the airlines' ability to fulfill
        its lease obligations. In the event that the airlines default on their lease
        commitments and the Trustees for the debt holders is unable to re-lease or
        sell
        the planes with adequate terms, the Company would suffer a loss of some or
        all
        of its investment. Delta Airlines filed for bankruptcy protection on September
        14, 2005. Accordingly, the Company recorded a $6.5 million pretax charge
        to
        fully reserve the balance of its investment in the leveraged lease of an
        aircraft to Delta. The Company took a $4 million pretax charge in the prior
        year
        to partially reserve for this investment. No amount of these charges represents
        cash expenditure; however, in the event of a material modification to the
        lease
        or foreclosure of the aircraft by the debt holders, certain tax payments
        of up
        to approximately $8.7 million could be accelerated. The expected tax payments
        are currently reflected on the statement of financial condition as a deferred
        tax liability and are not expected to result in a further charge to earnings.

The
        Company also has an outstanding leveraged lease with Continental valued at
        $11.8
        million as of Sept. 30, 2005. The Company's equity investment represented
        20% of
        the aggregate purchase price; the remaining 80% was funded by public debt
        issued
        in the form of equipment trust certificates. The residual value of the aircraft
        at the end of the lease term of approximately 17 years is projected to be
        15% of
        the original cost. This lease expires in September 2013.

Although
        Continental remains current on its lease payments to the Company, the inability
        of Continental to make its lease payments, or the termination of the lease
        through a bankruptcy proceeding, could result in the write-down of the Company's
        investment and the acceleration of certain income tax payments. Given the
        difficult economic environment for the airline industry, the Company is closely
        monitoring this investment for specific events or circumstances that would
        allow
        reasonable estimation of any potential impairment.

Goodwill

Intangible
        assets consist predominantly of goodwill related to the acquisitions of Roney
        & Co. (now part of RJA) and Goepel McDermid, Inc. (now called Raymond James
        Ltd). This goodwill, totaling $63 million, was allocated to the reporting
        units
        within the Private Client

Group

and
        Capital Markets segments pursuant to SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
        Intangible Assets”. Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business
        acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance
        with
        SFAS No. 142, indefinite-life intangible assets and goodwill are not
        amortized.


The
        Company reviews its goodwill in order to determine whether its value is impaired
        on at least an annual basis. Goodwill is impaired when the carrying amount
        of
        the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit.
        When
        available, the Company uses recent, comparable transactions to estimate the
        fair
        value of the respective reporting units. The Company calculates an estimated
        fair value based on multiples of revenues, earnings, and book value of
        comparable transactions. However, when such comparable transactions are not
        available or have become outdated, the Company uses discounted cash flow
        scenarios to estimate the fair value of the reporting units. As of September
        30,
        2005, goodwill had been allocated to the Private Client Group of RJA, and
        both
        the Private Client Group and Capital Markets segments of RJ Ltd. As of the
        most
        recent impairment test, the Company determined that the carrying value of
        the
        goodwill for each reporting unit had not been impaired. However, changes
        in
        current circumstances or business conditions could result in an impairment
        of
        goodwill. As required, the Company will continue to perform impairment testing
        on an annual basis or when an event occurs or circumstances change that would
        more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its
        carrying amount.

Reserves

The
        Company recognizes liabilities for contingencies when there is an exposure
        that,
        when fully analyzed, indicates it is both probable that a liability has been
        incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When a range
        of
        probable loss can be estimated, the Company accrues the most likely amount;
        if
        not determinable, the Company accrues at least the minimum of the range of
        probable loss.

The
        Company records reserves related to legal proceedings in "other payables".
        Such
        reserves are established and maintained in accordance with SFAS No. 5,
        "Accounting for Contingencies", and Financial Interpretation No. 14. The
        determination of these reserve amounts requires significant judgment on the
        part
        of management. Management considers many factors including, but not limited
        to:
        the amount of the claim; the amount of the loss in the client's account;
        the
        basis and validity of the claim; the possibility of wrongdoing on the part
        of an
        employee of the Company; previous results in similar cases; and legal precedents
        and case law. Each legal proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting
        period and the reserve is adjusted as deemed appropriate by management. Lastly,
        each case is reviewed to determine if it is probable that insurance coverage
        will apply, in which case the reserve is reduced accordingly. Any change
        in the
        reserve amount is recorded in the consolidated financial statements and is
        recognized as a charge/credit to earnings in that period.

The
        Company also records reserves or allowances for doubtful accounts related
        to
        client receivables and loans. Client receivables at the broker-dealers are
        generally collateralized by securities owned by the brokerage clients.
        Therefore, when a receivable is considered to be impaired, the amount of
        the
        impairment is generally measured based on the fair value of the securities
        acting as collateral, which is measured based on current prices from independent
        sources such as listed market prices or broker-dealer price quotations.

Client
        loans at RJBank are generally collateralized by real estate or other property.
        RJBank provides for both an allowance for losses in

accordance

with
        SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies”, and a reserve for individually
        impaired loans in accordance with SFAS No. 114, “Accounting by a Creditor for
        Impairment of a Loan”. The calculation of the SFAS No. 5 allowance is subjective
        as management segregates the loan portfolio into different classes and assigns
        each class an allowance percentage based on the perceived risk associated
        with
        that class of loans. The factors taken into consideration when assigning
        the
        reserve percentage to each class include estimates of borrower default
        probabilities and collateral values; trends in delinquencies; volume and
        terms;
        changes in geographic distribution, lending policies, local, regional, and
        national economic conditions; concentrations of credit risk and past loss
        history. In addition, the Company provides for potential losses inherent
        in
        RJBank’s unfunded lending commitments using the criteria above, further adjusted
        for an estimated probability of funding. For individual loans identified
        as
        impaired, RJBank measures impairment based on the present value of expected
        future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's
        observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan
        is
        collateral dependent. At September 30, 2005, the amortized cost of all RJBank
        loans was $1.0 billion and an allowance for loan losses of $7.6 million was
        recorded against that balance. The allowance for loan losses is approximately
        0.76% of the amortized cost of the loan portfolio.

The
        Company also makes loans or pays advances to Financial Advisors, primarily
        for
        recruiting and retention purposes. The Company provides for an allowance
        for
        loan losses on such receivables based on historical collection experience.
        Additionally, the Company provides for a specific reserve on these receivables
        if a Financial Advisor is no longer associated with the Company and it is
        determined that it is probable the amount will not be collected. At September
        30, 2005 the receivable from Financial Advisors was $70.1 million, which
        is net
        of an allowance of $9.2 million for estimated uncollectibility.


Income
        Taxes

SFAS
        No.
        109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”, establishes financial accounting and
        reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting
        for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable
        for
        the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax
        consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company’s financial
        statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax
        consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company’s financial
        statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future
        tax
        consequences could materially impact the Company’s financial position, results
        of operations, or cash flows.

Effects
        of recently issued accounting standards

In
        June
        2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") ratified the consensus
        reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) in Issue 04-5, “Determining
        Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a
        Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain
        Rights” on the guidance on how general partners in a limited partnership should
        determine whether they control a limited partnership. This consensus is
        effective for general partners of all new limited partnerships formed, and
        for
        existing limited partnerships for which the partnership agreements are modified,
        subsequent to the date of the ratification of this consensus (June 29, 2005).
        The guidance in this issue is effective for existing partnerships no later
        than
        the beginning of the first reporting period in fiscal years beginning after
        December 15, 2005. The Company adopted this EITF for partnerships created
        after
        June 29, 2005 and is currently evaluating the potential impact of this EITF
        for
        partnerships created prior to June 29, 2005.

In
        December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
        (“SFAS”) No. 123R (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment". This statement requires
        the recognition in an employer’s financial statements of the cost of employee
        services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on
        the
        grant-date fair value of the award. It also requires the cost to be recognized
        over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in
        exchange for the award (usually the vesting period). SFAS No. 123R replaces
        SFAS
        No. 123 and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, and its related interpretations.

In
        March
        2005, the SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin 107, Share-Based Payment,
        which
        expresses views of the SEC Staff about the application of SFAS No. 123R.
        In
        April 2005 the SEC amended the effective date of SFAS No. 123R to allow an
        SEC
        registrant to implement this statement at the beginning of its next fiscal
        year,
        beginning after June 15, 2005.

The
        adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on the Company's
        consolidated financial statements given that it adopted the fair value
        recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 effective September 28,
        2002.

In
        March
        2004, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the EITF in Issue 03-1,
“The
        Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain
        Investments” on the guidance to be used in determining when an investment is
        considered impaired, whether that impairment is other than temporary, and
        the
        measurement of an impairment loss. This consensus ratified by the FASB in
        March
        2004 was effective for other-than-temporary impairment evaluations made in
        reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004. However, the guidance contained
        in paragraphs 10-20 of EITF 03-1, related to determining whether an impairment
        is other-than-temporary and measuring the related impairment loss, has been
        delayed by FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) EITF Issue 03-1-1, "Effective Date of
        Paragraphs 10-20 of EITF Issue No. 03-1.” The delay of the effective date for
        paragraphs 10-20 will be superseded concurrent with the final issuance of
        proposed FSP EITF Issue 03-1-a, "Implication Guidance for the Application
        of
        Paragraph 16 of EITF Issue No. 03-1, 'The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary
        Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments.” In November 2005, the
        FASB issued FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary
        Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments”. This FSP nullifies
        certain requirements of Issue 03-1 and supersedes EITF Topic No. D-44,
“Recognition of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment upon the Planned Sale of a
        Security Whose Cost Exceeds Fair Value.” The guidance in this FSP is effective
        for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company does
        not
        believe that the impact of adopting the provisions of this EITF will be material
        to its consolidated financial statements.

Off
        Balance Sheet Arrangements

Information
        concerning the Company's off balance sheet arrangements are included in Note
        of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such information is
        hereby incorporated by reference.


Contractual
        Obligations

The
        Company has contractual obligations to make future payments in connection
        with
        its short and long-term debt,

non-cancelable
        lease

agreements, partnership investments, commitments to extend credit, and a
        naming
        rights agreement (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
        further information on the Company's commitments). The following table sets
        forth these contractual obligations by fiscal year (in 000's):

(1)

Loans
                  which are non-recourse to the Company. See Notes 6 and 10 in the
                  Notes to
                  the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
                  information.

(2)

The
                  Company has committed a total of $34.9 million, in amounts ranging
                  from
                  $200,000 to $1.5 million, to 36 different independent venture capital
                  or
                  private equity partnerships. As of September 30, 2005, the Company
                  had
                  invested $26.8 million of that amount. Additionally, the Company
                  is the
                  general partner in two internally sponsored private equity limited
                  partnerships to which it has committed $14 million. Of that amount,
                  the
                  Company has invested $10.7 million as of September 30, 2005. Although
                  the
                  combined remaining balance of $11.4 million has been included in
                  fiscal
                  year 2006 above, the contributions to the partnerships may occur
                  after
                  that time and are dependent upon the timing of the capital calls
                  by the
                  general partners.

(3)

Because
                  many commitments expire without being funded in whole or part,
                  the
                  contract amounts are not estimates of future cash
                  flows.

(4)

RJTCF
        is
        committed to additional future fundings related to real estate
        partnerships.

Effects
        of Inflation

The
        Company's assets are primarily liquid in nature and are not significantly
        affected by inflation. Management believes that the changes in replacement

cost

of
        property and equipment are adequately insured and therefore would not materially
        affect operating results. However, the rate of inflation affects the Company's
        expenses, including employee compensation, communications and occupancy,
        which
        may not be readily recoverable through charges for services provided by the
        Company.

QUANTITATIVE
        AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

RISK
        MANAGEMENT

Risks
        are
        an inherent part of the Company's business and activities. Management of
        these
        risks is critical to the Company's fiscal soundness and profitability. Risk
        management at the Company is a multi-faceted process that requires
        communication, judgment and knowledge of financial products and markets.
        The
        Company's senior management takes an active role in the risk management process
        and requires specific administrative and business functions to assist in
        the
        identification, assessment, monitoring and control of various risks. The
        principal risks involved in the Company's business activities are market,
        credit, operational, and regulatory and legal.

Market
        Risk

Market
        risk is the risk of loss to the Company resulting from changes in interest
        rates
        and equity prices. The Company has exposure to market risk primarily through
        its
        broker-dealer and banking operations. The Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries
        trade tax exempt and taxable debt obligations and act as an active market
        maker
        in approximately 284 over-the-counter equity securities. In connection with
        these activities, the Company maintains inventories in order to ensure
        availability of securities and to facilitate client transactions. Additionally,
        the Company, primarily within its Canadian broker-dealer subsidiary, invests
        for
        its own proprietary equity investment account.

The
        following table represents the fair value of trading inventories associated
        with
        the Company's broker-dealer client facilitation, market-making activities
        and
        proprietary trading activities.

Changes
        in value of the Company's trading inventory may result from fluctuations
        in
        interest rates, credit ratings of the issuer, equity prices and the correlation
        among these factors. The Company manages its trading inventory by product
        type
        and has established trading divisions that have responsibility for each product
        type. The Company's primary method of controlling risk in its trading inventory
        is through the establishment and monitoring of limits on the dollar amount
        of
        securities positions that can be entered into and other risk based limits;
        limits are established both for categories of securities (e.g., OTC equities,
        high yield securities, municipal bonds) and for individual traders. As of
        September 30, 2005, the absolute fixed income and equity inventory limits
        were
        $1,382,000,000 and $76,600,000, respectively. The Company's trading activities
        were well within these limits at September 30, 2005. Position limits in trading
        inventory accounts are monitored on a daily basis. Consolidated position
        and
        exposure reports are prepared and distributed to senior management. Limit
        violations are carefully monitored. Management also monitors inventory levels
        and trading results, as well as inventory aging, pricing, concentration and
        securities ratings. For derivatives, primarily interest rate swaps, the Company
        monitors exposure in its derivatives subsidiary daily based on established
        limits with respect to a number of factors, including interest rate risk,
        spread, ratio and basis risk and volatility. These exposures are monitored
        both
        on a total portfolio basis and separately for selected maturity periods.


Interest
        Rate Risk

RJA
        is
        exposed to interest rate risk as a result of maintaining trading inventories
        of
        fixed income instruments, which are sensitive to changes in interest rates.
        The
        Company monitors, on a daily basis, the Value-at-Risk (“VaR”) in its
        institutional Fixed Income trading portfolios (cash instruments and interest
        rate derivatives). VaR is a technique for estimating the potential loss in
        the
        Company's fixed income portfolio due to adverse market movements over a
        specified time horizon with a specified confidence level.

During
        fiscal 2004 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2005 the Company used
        a
        variance/covariance methodology, for calculating VaR. A standard regulatory-type
        data set was used (one year historical observation period, 0% exponential
        decay)
        and the results were compared daily against those obtained using corresponding
        data with a 6% exponential decay factor. During the fourth quarter, the Company
        adopted a new risk management technology which uses historical simulation
        for
        calculating VaR. Simulated scenarios were derived based on a one-year
        observation period, with equal weighting to overnight change scenarios.

VaR
        is
        reported at a 99% confidence level, based on a one-day holding period; this
        is
        consistent with the Company's high-turnover trading activity, which is based
        on
        supporting client sales activity. This means that there is a one in 100 chance
        that on any given day, the daily trading net revenues could fall below the
        expected daily trading net revenues by an amount at least as large as the
        reported VaR. However, shortfalls on a single day can exceed reported VaR
        by
        significant amounts. Shortfalls can also accumulate over a longer time horizon,
        such as a number of consecutive trading days.

The
        following tables set forth the high, low, and daily average VaR for the
        Company's overall institutional portfolio during the fiscal year ended September
        30, 2005, with the corresponding dollar value of the Company's portfolio.
        Because VaR results based on the two methodologies are not directly comparable,
        results below are reported separately for the first three quarters and for
        the
        fourth quarter of fiscal 2005.

The
        mark
        to market loss in the portfolio exceeded the reported VaR once during 2005
        and
        four times in 2004.

The
        modeling of the risk characteristics of trading positions involves a number
        of
        assumptions and approximations. While management believes that its assumptions
        and approximations are reasonable, there is no uniform industry methodology
        for
        estimating VaR, and different assumptions and/or approximations could produce
        materially different VaR estimates. Given its reliance on historical data,
        VaR
        is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there
        are no
        sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. An inherent
        limitation of VaR is that the distribution of past changes in market risk
        factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk, particularly
        during periods of unusual market events and disruptions, moreover, VaR
        calculated for a one-day time horizon does not fully capture the market risk
        of
        positions that cannot be liquidated or offset with hedges within one day.
        Accordingly, management also monitors the risk in its trading activities
        by
        establishing position limits and daily review of trading results, inventory
        aging, pricing, concentration, and securities ratings.

Additional
        information is discussed under Derivative Financial Instruments in Note 11
        of
        the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

RJBank
        maintains an investment portfolio that is comprised of mortgage-backed
        securities, as well as mortgage, consumer and commercial loans. Those
        investments are funded in part by its client obligations, including demand
        deposits, money market accounts, savings accounts, and certificates of deposit.
        Based on the current investment portfolio of RJBank, market risk for RJBank
        is
        limited primarily to interest rate risk. RJBank reviews interest rate risk
        based
        on net interest income, which is the net amount of interest received and
        interest paid. The following table represents the carrying value of RJBank's
        assets and liabilities that are subject to market risk. This table does not
        include financial instruments with limited market risk exposure due to
        offsetting asset and liability positions, short holding periods or short
        periods
        of time until the interest rate resets.


As
        noted
        above, RJBank reviews interest rate risk based on net interest income and
        impact
        on RJBank's equity. One of the core objectives of RJBank's Asset/Liability
        Management Committee is to manage the sensitivity of net interest income
        to
        changes in market interest rates. The Asset/Liability Management Committee
        uses
        several measures to monitor and limit RJBank's interest rate risk including
        scenario analysis, interest repricing gap analysis and limits, and net portfolio
        value limits. Model-based scenario analysis is used to monitor and report
        the
        interest rate risk positions, and analyze alternative strategies.

Net
        interest income is the net amount of interest received less interest paid.
        This
        involves large volumes of contracts and transactions, and numerous different
        products. Simulation models and estimation techniques are used to assess
        the
        sensitivity of the net interest income stream to movements in interest rates.
        Assumptions about consumer behavior play an important role in these
        calculations; this is particularly relevant for loans such as mortgages where
        the client has the right, but not the obligation, to repay before the scheduled
        maturity. On the liability side, the re-pricing characteristics of deposits
        are
        based on estimates since the rates are not coupled to a specified market
        rate.

The
        sensitivity of net interest income to interest rate conditions is estimated
        for
        a variety of scenarios. Assuming an immediate and lasting shift of 100 basis
        points in the term structure of interest rates, RJBank's sensitivity analysis
        indicates that an upward movement would decrease RJBank's net interest income
        by
        6.90% in the first year after the rate jump, whereas a downward shift of
        the
        same magnitude would decrease RJBank's net interest income by 0.41%. These
        sensitivity figures are based on positions as of September 30, 2005, and
        are
        subject to certain simplifying assumptions, including that management takes
        no
        corrective action. The outcome is affected by higher pre-payment expectations
        if
        rates fall.

Equity
        Price Risk

The
        Company is exposed to equity price risk as a consequence of making markets
        in
        equity securities and the investment activities of RJA and RJ Ltd. The U.S.
        broker-dealer activities are client-driven, with the objective of meeting
        clients' needs while earning a trading profit to compensate for the risk
        associated with carrying inventory. The Company attempts to reduce the risk
        of
        loss inherent in its inventory of equity securities by monitoring those security
        positions constantly throughout each day and establishing position limits.
        The
        Company's Canadian broker-dealer has 24 traders that may hold proprietary
        trading positions in addition to their customer trading positions. The average
        aggregate inventory held for proprietary trading during the year ended September
        30, 2005 was CDN$5,036,653. The Company's equity securities inventories are
        priced on a regular basis and there are no material unrecorded gains or
        losses.

Credit
        Risk

The
        Company is engaged in various trading and brokerage activities whose
        counterparties primarily include broker-dealers, banks and other financial
        institutions. The Company is exposed to risk that counterparties may not
        fulfill
        their obligations. The risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of
        the
        counterparty and/or the issuer of the instrument. The Company manages this
        risk
        by imposing and monitoring individual and aggregate position limits within
        each
        business segment for each counterparty, conducting regular credit reviews
        of
        financial counterparties, reviewing security and loan concentrations, holding
        and marking to market collateral on certain transactions and conducting business
        through clearing organizations, which guarantee performance.


The
        Company's client activities involve the execution, settlement, and financing
        of
        various transactions on behalf of its clients. Client activities are transacted
        on either a cash or margin basis. Credit exposure associated with the Company's
        Private Client Group consists primarily of customer margin accounts, which
        are
        monitored daily and are collateralized. When clients execute a purchase the
        Company is at some risk that the client will renege on the trade. If this
        occurs, the Company may have to liquidate the position at a loss. However,
        for
        over three quarters of the private client group purchase transactions, clients
        have available funds in the account before the trade is executed. The Company
        monitors exposure to industry sectors and individual securities and performs
        analysis on a regular basis in connection with its margin lending activities.
        The Company adjusts its margin requirements if it believes its risk exposure
        is
        not appropriate based on market conditions.

In
        addition, RJBank offers a variety of loan products including mortgage,
        commercial real estate, and consumer loans, which are collateralized, and
        corporate loans for which the borrower is carefully evaluated and monitored.
        RJBank's policy is to require customers to provide collateral prior to the
        disbursement of approved loans. The amount of collateral obtained, if it
        is
        deemed necessary by RJBank upon extension of credit, is based on management's
        credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies but may include
        accounts receivable, inventory, residential real estate, and income-producing
        commercial properties. By using derivative financial instruments to hedge
        exposures to changes in interest rates, RJBank exposes itself to credit risk
        with those counterparties also. RJBank minimizes the credit or repayment
        risk of
        derivative instruments by entering into transactions only with high-quality
        counterparties whose credit rating is investment grade.

The
        Company is subject to concentration risk if it holds large positions, extends
        large loans to, or has large commitments with a single counterparty, borrower,
        or group of similar counterparties or borrowers (e.g. in the same industry).
        Securities purchased under agreements to resell consist entirely of securities
        issued by the U.S. government. Receivables from and payables to clients and
        stock borrow and lending activities are conducted with a large number of
        clients
        and counterparties and potential concentration is carefully monitored. Inventory
        and investment positions taken and commitments made, including underwritings,
        may involve exposure to individual issuers and businesses. The Company seeks
        to
        limit this risk through careful review of the underlying business and the
        use of
        limits established by senior management, taking into consideration factors
        including the financial strength of the counterparty, the size of the position
        or commitment, the expected duration of the position or commitment and other
        positions or commitments outstanding.

The
        Company is the lessor in two leveraged commercial aircraft transactions with
        two
        major domestic airlines (Delta and Continental). The Company's ability to
        realize its expected return is dependent upon the airlines' ability to fulfill
        their lease obligations. In the event that the airlines default on their
        lease
        commitments and the Trustee for the debt holders is unable to re-lease or
        sell
        the planes with adequate terms, the Company would suffer a loss of some or
        all
        of its investment. Delta Airlines filed for bankruptcy protection on September
        14, 2005. Accordingly, the Company recorded a $6.5 million pretax charge
        to
        fully reserve the balance of its investment in the leveraged lease of an
        aircraft to Delta. The Company took a $4 million pretax charge in the prior
        year
        to partially reserve for this investment. In addition, the Company is closely
        monitoring its lease to Continental Airlines. Although Continental has not
        defaulted on its obligations under this lease, Continental's financial condition
        has continued to deteriorate, thus increasing the likelihood of such a
        default.

Operational
        Risk

Operational
        risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from the Company's
        operations, including, but not limited to, business disruptions, improper
        or
        unauthorized execution and processing of transactions, deficiencies in the
        Company's technology or financial operating systems and inadequacies or breaches
        in the Company's control processes. The Company operates different businesses
        in
        diverse markets and is reliant on the ability of its employees and systems
        to
        process a large number of transactions. These risks are less direct than
        credit
        and market risk, but managing them is critical, particularly in a rapidly
        changing environment with increasing transaction volumes. In the event of
        a
        breakdown or improper operation of systems or improper action by employees,
        the
        Company could suffer financial loss, regulatory sanctions and damage to its
        reputation. In order to mitigate and control operational risk, the Company
        has
        developed and continues to enhance specific policies and procedures that
        are
        designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels
        throughout the organization and within such departments as Accounting,
        Operations, Information Technology, Legal, Compliance and Internal Audit.
        These
        control mechanisms attempt to ensure that operational policies and procedures
        are being followed and that the Company's various businesses are operating
        within established corporate policies and limits. Business continuity plans
        exist for critical systems, and redundancies are built into the systems as
        deemed appropriate.

A
        Compliance and Standards Committee comprised of senior executives meets monthly
        to consider policy issues. The Committee reviews material customer complaints
        and litigation, as well as issues in operating departments, for the purpose
        of
        identifying issues that present risk exposure to customers or to the Company.
        The Committee adopts policies to deal with these issues, which are then
        disseminated throughout the Company.


The
        Company has established a Quality of Markets Committee that meets regularly
        to
        review execution of customer orders by the OTC, Option and Listed Trading
        departments. This Committee is comprised of representatives from the OTC,
        Listed
        Trading, Options, Compliance and Legal Departments and is under the direction
        of
        a senior officer of the Company. This Committee reviews reports from OTC,
        Option
        and Listed trading departments and recommends action for improvement when
        necessary.

Regulatory
        and Legal Risk

Legal
        risk includes the risk of Private Client Group customer claims, the possibility
        of sizable adverse legal judgments and non-compliance with applicable legal
        and
        regulatory requirements. The Company is generally subject to extensive
        regulation in the different jurisdictions in which it conducts business.
        Regulatory oversight of the securities industry has become increasingly
        demanding over the past several years and the Company, as well as others
        in the
        industry, has been directly affected by this increased regulatory
        scrutiny.

The
        Company has comprehensive procedures addressing issues such as regulatory
        capital requirements, sales and trading practices, use of and safekeeping
        of
        customer funds, extension of credit, collection activities, money-laundering
        and
        record keeping.

The
        Company a

nd

its
        subsidiaries have designated Anti-money Laundering Compliance Officers who
        monitor compliance with regulations adopted under the U.S.A. Patriot Act.

The
        Company acts as an underwriter or selling group member in both equity and
        fixed
        income product offerings. Particularly when acting as lead or co-lead manager,
        the Company has financial and legal exposure. To manage this exposure,

a
        committee of senior executives review proposed underwriting commitments to
        assess the quality of the offering and the adequacy of due diligence
        investigation.

The
        Company's major business units have compliance departments that are responsible
        for regularly reviewing and revising compliance and supervisory procedures
        to
        conform to changes in applicable regulations.

During
        the past two years, the number of claims declined but it is still above
        long-term historic levels. While these claims may not be the result of any
        wrongdoing, the Company does, at a minimum, incur costs associated with
        investigating and defending against such claims. See further discussion on
        the
        Company's reserve policy under "Critical Accounting Policies"; see also "Legal
        Proceedings" and "Regulation".

        STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

REPORT
        OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The
        Board
        of Directors and Shareholders

Raymond
        James Financial, Inc.:

We
        have
        audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of
        Raymond James Financial, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2005 and
        September 24, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations
        and
        comprehensive income,

changes
        in shareholders’ equity

,
        and
        cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September
        30,
        2005. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
        Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
        consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We
        conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
        Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
        we plan
        and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
        statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
        on a
        test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
        statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
        and
        significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
        financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
        reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
        our
        opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
        fairly,
        in all material respects, the financial position of Raymond James Financial,
        Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2005 and September 24, 2004, and
        the
        results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in
        the
        three-year period ended September 30, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally
        accepted accounting principles.

As
        discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in fiscal year
        2003 the Company changed its method of accounting for stock-based
        compensation.

We
        also
        have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
        Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Raymond James Financial,
        Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2005, based
        on criteria established in

Internal
        Control—Integrated Framework

issued
        by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO),
        and our report dated December 14, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on
        management’s assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control
        over financial reporting.

        internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
        effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
        is to express an opinion on management's assessment and an opinion on the
        effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
        on our audit.

We
        conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
        Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
        we plan
        and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
        internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
        respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
        over
        financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating
        the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
        such
        other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
        that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
        company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
        to
        provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
        and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
        with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control
        over
        financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
        to
        the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
        reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
        provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
        to
        permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
        accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
        are
        being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
        of
        the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
        timely
        detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
        assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
        of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
        not
        prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
        effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
        become
        inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
        with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
        our
        opinion, management's assessment that Raymond James Financial, Inc. maintained
        effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2005,
        is
        fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in

Internal
        Control—Integrated Framework

issued
        by
        the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
        (COSO)

.

Also,
        in
        our opinion, Raymond James Financial, Inc. maintained, in all material respects,
        effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2005,
        based on

criteria
        established in

Internal
        Control—Integrated Framework

issued
        by
        the Committee

of
        Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)

.

We
        also
        have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
        Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statements of financial
        condition of Raymond James Financial, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September
        30,
        2005 and September 24, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of
        operations and comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash
        flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30,
        2005,
        and our report dated December 14, 2005

expressed
        an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements

        TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note
        1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

Description
        of Business

Raymond
        James Financial, Inc. (“RJF”) is a holding company whose subsidiaries are
        engaged in various financial services businesses, including the underwriting,
        distribution, trading and brokerage of equity and debt securities and the
        sale
        of mutual funds and other investment products. In addition, some of these
        subsidiaries provide investment management services for retail and institutional
        clients and banking and trust services. The accounting and reporting policies
        of
        Raymond James Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) conform to
        accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, the more
        significant of which are summarized below:

Basis
        of Presentation

The
        consolidated financial statements include the accounts of RJF and its
        consolidated subsidiaries that are generally controlled through a majority
        voting interest. All material consolidated subsidiaries are 100% owned by
        the
        Company. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
        Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 46R, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities”
(“FIN 46R”), the Company also consolidates any variable interest entities
        (“VIEs”) for which it is the primary beneficiary.

Additional
        information is discussed in Note 6 below

.
        When
        the Company does not have a controlling interest in an entity, but exerts
        significant influence over the entity, the Company applies the equity method
        of
        accounting. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been
        eliminated in consolidation.

Management
        Estimates and Assumptions

The
        preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting
        principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to
        make
        estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
        liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
        of the
        consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
        expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
        estimates and could have a material impact on the consolidated financial
        statements.

Reporting
        Period

Through
        fiscal 2005, the Company's fiscal year ended on the last Friday in September
        of
        each year.

Three
        of
        the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries, Raymond James Bank (“RJBank”), Raymond
        James Limited (“RJ Ltd.”) and Raymond James Tax Credit Funds, Inc. (“RJ Tax
        Credit”)

,
        have
        fiscal years that end on the last day of September. Certain other entities
        also
        have fiscal periods that do not coincide with the Company's fiscal period.
        Any
        individually material transactions are reviewed and recorded in the appropriate
        fiscal year. The Company intends to change its fiscal reporting periods to
        end
        on the last day of each calendar quarter beginning in fiscal year
        2006.

Recognition
        of Revenues

Securities
        transactions and related commission revenues and expenses are recorded on
        a
        trade date basis.

Investment
        banking revenues are recorded at the time a transaction is completed and
        the
        related income is reasonably determinable. Investment banking revenues include
        management fees and underwriting fees, net of reimbursable expenses, earned
        in
        connection with the distribution of the underwritten securities, merger and
        acquisition fees, private placement fees and limited partnership
        distributions.

The
        Company earns investment advisory fees based on the value of clients' portfolios
        managed by its investment advisor subsidiaries. These fees are recorded ratably
        over the period earned.

Financial
        service fees include per account fees such as IRA fees, transaction fees
        on fee
        based accounts, service fees and distributions fees received from mutual
        funds.


Under
        clearing agreements, the Company clears trades for unaffiliated correspondent
        brokers and retains a portion of commissions as a fee for its services.
        Correspondent clearing revenues are recorded net of commissions remitted
        and
        included in other revenue. Total commissions generated by correspondents
        were
        $28,957,000, $24,289,000, and $16,140,000 and commissions remitted totaled
        $24,435,000, $19,719,000, and $12,494,000 for the years ended September 30,
        2005, September 24, 2004, and September 26, 2003, respectively.

Cash
        and Cash Equivalents

Cash
        equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90
        days or
        less, other than those used for trading purposes.

Assets
        Segregated Pursuant to Federal Regulations

In
        accordance with Rule 15c3-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Raymond
        James & Associates (“RJA”), as a broker-dealer carrying client accounts, is
        subject to requirements related to maintaining cash or qualified securities
        in a
        segregated reserve account for the exclusive benefit of its clients. Segregated
        assets at September 30, 2005 and September 24, 2004 consist of cash and cash
        equivalents.

Repurchase
        Agreements

The
        Company invests in short-term securities purchased under agreements to resell
        (“reverse repurchase agreements”), which are included in cash and cash
        equivalents. Additionally, the Company enters into securities sold under
        agreements to repurchase transactions (“repurchase agreements”). Both reverse
        repurchase and repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized
        financings and are carried at contractual amounts plus accrued interest.
        It is
        the Company's policy to obtain possession of collateral with a market value
        equal to or in excess of the principal amount loaned under the reverse
        repurchase agreements. To ensure that the market value of the underlying
        collateral remains sufficient, the collateral is valued daily, and the Company
        may require counterparties to deposit additional collateral (or may return
        collateral to counterparties) when appropriate.

Securities
        Owned

Trading
        securities are comprised primarily of the financial instruments held by the
        Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries. These instruments are recorded at fair
        value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in current period earnings.
        Fair values are generally based on prices from independent sources, such
        as
        listed market prices or broker or dealer price quotations.

For
        investments in illiquid and privately held securities that do not have readily
        determinable fair values through quoted market prices, the determination
        of fair
        value is based upon consideration of available information, including types
        of
        securities, current financial information, restrictions on dispositions,
        market
        values of underlying securities and quotations for similar
        instruments.

Available
        for sale securities are comprised primarily of CMO’s, mortgage related debt, and
        certain equity securities of the Company's non-broker-dealer subsidiaries.
        Debt
        and equity securities classified as available for sale are reported at fair
        value with unrealized gains or losses, net of deferred taxes, reported in
        shareholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
        Fair values of the debt securities are estimated based on bid quotations
        received from securities dealers. All realized gains and losses are determined
        on a specific identification basis and are included in current period earnings.
        Additionally, any unrealized losses deemed to be other than temporary are
        included in current period earnings

and
        a new
        cost basis for the security is established. Many factors are considered to
        determine whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, including whether
        the
        Company has the ability and intent to hold the investment until a market
        price
        recovery and whether evidence indicating the cost of the investment is
        recoverable outweighs evidence to the contrary. Evidence considered in this
        assessment includes the reasons for the impairment, the severity and duration
        of
        the impairment, changes in value subsequent to year-end, and forecasted
        performance of the security.

Brokerage
        Client Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Brokerage
        client receivables include receivables of the Company's asset management
        and
        broker-dealer subsidiaries. The receivables from asset management clients
        are
        primarily for accrued asset management service fees, while the receivables
        from
        broker-dealer clients are principally for amounts due on cash and margin
        transactions and are generally collateralized by securities owned by the
        clients. Both the receivables from the asset management and broker-dealer
        clients are reported at their outstanding principal balance, adjusted for
        any
        allowance for doubtful accounts. When a broker-dealer receivable is considered
        to be impaired, the amount of the impairment is generally measured based
        on the
        fair value of the securities acting as collateral, which is measured based
        on
        current prices from independent sources such as listed market prices or
        broker-dealer price quotations. Securities owned by customers, including
        those
        that collateralize margin or other similar transactions, are not reflected
        in
        the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition.


The
        Company also provides for an allowance for doubtful accounts on its receivables
        from Financial Advisors based on historical collection experience. Additionally,
        when the Financial Advisor is no longer associated with the Company or it
        is
        determined that it is probable that the amount will not be collected, the
        Company provides for a specific allowance on the receivable.

Securities
        Borrowed and Securities Loaned

Securities
        borrowed and securities loaned transactions are reported as collateralized
        financings and recorded at the amount of collateral advanced or received.
        Securities borrowed transactions generally require the Company to deposit
        cash
        with the lender. With respect to securities loaned, the Company generally
        receives collateral in the form of cash in an amount in excess of the market
        value of securities loaned. The Company monitors the market value of securities
        borrowed and loaned on a daily basis, with additional collateral obtained
        or
        refunded, as necessary.

Bank
        Client Loans and Allowances for Losses

Bank
        loans are primarily comprised of loans originated or purchased by RJBank
        and
        include commercial and residential mortgage loans, as well as consumer loans.
        The Company records these loans at amortized cost, adjusted for an allowance
        for
        loan loss. Included in amortized cost are any deferred fees or loan origination
        costs plus the unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans.

Loan
        origination fees, net of related costs, are capitalized and recognized in
        interest income using the interest method over the contractual life of the
        loans, adjusted for prepayments.

The
        Company provides for an allowance for losses inherent in the RJBank loan
        portfolio. The allowance is calculated based upon consideration of historical
        analysis and a supplemental portion based upon inherent risk and losses.
        The
        calculation of an allowance for inherent risk and losses is particularly
        subjective and requires judgments based on qualitative factors that do not
        lend
        themselves to exact mathematical calculations, such as estimates of borrower
        default probabilities and collateral values, trends in delinquencies and
        nonaccruals; migration trends in the portfolio; trends in volume, terms,
        and
        portfolio mix; new credit products and/or changes in the geographic distribution
        of those products; changes in lending policies and procedures; loan review
        reports on the efficacy of the risk identification process; changes in the
        outlook for local, regional, and national economic conditions; concentrations
        of
        credit risk and past loss history. In addition, the Company provides for
        potential losses inherent in RJBank’s unfunded lending commitments using the
        criteria above, further adjusted for an estimated probability of
        funding.

Additionally,
        the Company reviews the individual RJBank loans and considers a loan to be
        impaired when it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all
        amounts due, including principal and interest. When a loan is considered
        to be
        impaired, the amount of the impairment is measured based on the present value
        of
        expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate,
        the
        observable market value of the loan, or the fair value of the collateral
        for
        collateral dependent loans. Regardless of the measurement method originally
        selected, the Company measures impairment based on the fair value of the
        collateral when it is determined that foreclosure is probable.

Once
        RJBank has identified a loan as impaired, the accrual of interest on the
        loan is
        discontinued when either principal or interest becomes 90 days past due or
        when
        the full timely collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain. When
        a
        loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the accrued and unpaid interest receivable
        is written off and accretion of the net deferred loan origination fees ceases.
        The loan is accounted for on the cash or cost recovery method thereafter
        until
        qualifying for return to accrual status.

Residential
        mortgage loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market are
        carried at the lower of cost or estimated market value in the aggregate.
        Net
        unrealized losses are recognized through a valuation allowance by charges
        to
        income.

Investments
        in Real Estate Partnerships- Held by Variable Interest
        Entities

A
        wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company is the managing member or general
        partner
        in several individual tax credit housing funds. Additional information is
        discussed in Note 6 below. These funds invest in limited partnerships which
        purchase and develop affordable housing properties qualifying for federal
        and
        state tax credits. As of September 30, 2005 and September 24, 2004, the
        investments related to these limited partnerships totaled approximately $138.2
        million and $22.6 million, respectively, on the Company’s Consolidated Statement
        of Financial Condition.


Property
        and Equipment

Property,
        equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost less accumulated
        depreciation and amortization. Depreciation of assets is primarily provided
        for
        using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets,
        which range from two to five years for software, furniture and equipment
        and 10
        to 31 years for buildings and land improvements. Leasehold improvements are
        amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term
        or
        the estimated useful lives of the assets.

Additions,
        improvements and expenditures for repairs and maintenance that significantly
        extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. Other expenditures for
        repairs and maintenance are charged to operations in the period incurred.
        Gains
        and losses on disposals of property and equipment are reflected in income
        in the
        period realized.

Goodwill

Intangible
        assets consist predominantly of goodwill related to the acquisitions of Roney
        & Co. (now part of RJA) and Goepel McDermid, Inc. (now called Raymond James
        Ltd). This goodwill, totaling $63 million, was allocated to the reporting
        units
        within the Private Client

Group

and
        Capital Markets segments pursuant to SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
        Intangible Assets”. Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business
        acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance
        with
        SFAS No. 142, indefinite-life intangible assets and goodwill are not
        amortized.

The
        Company reviews its goodwill in order to determine whether its value is impaired
        on at least an annual basis. Goodwill is impaired when the carrying amount
        of
        the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit.
        When
        available, the Company uses recent, comparable transactions to estimate the
        fair
        value of the respective reporting units. The Company calculates an estimated
        fair value based on multiples of revenues, earnings, and book value of
        comparable transactions. However, when such comparable transactions are not
        available or have become outdated, the Company uses discounted cash flow
        scenarios to estimate the fair value of the reporting units. As of September
        30,
        2005, goodwill had been allocated to the Private Client Group of RJA, and
        both
        the Private Client Group and Capital Markets segments of RJ Ltd. As of the
        most
        recent impairment test, the Company determined that the carrying value of
        the
        goodwill for each reporting unit had not been impaired. However, changes
        in
        current circumstances or business conditions could result in an impairment
        of
        goodwill. The Company will continue to perform impairment testing on an annual
        basis or when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely
        than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying
        amount.

Exchange
        Memberships

Exchange
        memberships are carried at cost or, if an “other than temporary” impairment in
        value has occurred, at a value that reflects management's estimate of the
        impairment. The Company’s membership interests, which are included in prepaid
        expenses and other assets at a cost of $2,820,000 and $2,711,000 at September
        30, 2005, and September 24, 2004, respectively, had an aggregate market value
        of
        $10,743,000 and $5,471,000 at September 30, 2005 and September 24, 2004,
        respectively. The market value of the exchange memberships is determined
        based
        on the last reported sale.

Legal
        Reserves

The
        Company recognizes liabilities for contingencies when there is an exposure
        that,
        when fully analyzed, indicates it is both probable that a liability has been
        incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When a range
        of
        probable loss can be estimated, the Company accrues the most likely amount,
        if
        not determinable, the Company accrues at least the minimum of the range of
        probable loss.

The
        Company records reserves related to legal proceedings in "other payables".
        Such
        reserves are established and maintained in accordance with SFAS No. 5,
        "Accounting for Contingencies", and Financial Interpretation No. 14. The
        determination of these reserve amounts requires significant judgment on the
        part
        of management. Management considers many factors including, but not limited
        to:
        the amount of the claim; the amount of the loss in the client's account;
        the
        basis and validity of the claim; the possibility of wrongdoing on the part
        of an
        employee of the Company; previous results in similar cases; and legal precedents
        and case law. Each legal proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting
        period and the reserve is adjusted as deemed appropriate by management. Lastly,
        each case is reviewed to determine if it is probable that insurance coverage
        will apply, in which case the reserve is reduced accordingly. Any change
        in the
        reserve amount is recorded in the consolidated financial statements and is
        recognized as a charge/credit to earnings in that period.


Stock
        Compensation

At
        September 30, 2005, the Company had multiple stock-based employee compensation
        plans, which are described more fully in Note 17 below. Effective September
        28,
        2002, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.
        123.
        Under the modified prospective method of adoption selected by the Company
        within
        the provisions of SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
        -
        Transition and Disclosure", the recognition of compensation cost for all
        periods
        is the same as that which would have been recognized had the recognition
        provisions of SFAS No. 123 been applied since the date of grant for all
        outstanding options.

Compensation
        expense is recognized over the relevant vesting period for restricted stock
        and
        restricted stock units with future service requirements.

Derivative
        Financial Instruments

The
        Company makes limited use of derivative financial instruments in certain
        of its
        businesses. Certain derivative financial instruments are used to manage
        well-defined interest rate risk at RJBank, while others are used in the conduct
        of the Company’s fixed income business. The Company accounts for derivative
        financial instruments and hedging activities in accordance with SFAS No.
        133,
        "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as subsequently
        amended by SFAS No. 137, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
        Activities - Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statements No. 133",
        SFAS
        No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging
        Activities", and SFAS No. 149, "Amendments of Statement 133 on Derivative
        Instruments and Hedging Activities", which establishes accounting and reporting
        standards for derivatives and hedging activities. These statements establish
        standards for designating a derivative as a hedge. Derivatives in a
        broker-dealer or those that do not meet the criteria for designation as a
        hedge
        are accounted for as trading account assets and liabilities, and recorded
        at
        fair value in the statement of financial condition with the realized and
        unrealized gains or losses recorded in the statement of operations for that
        period.

Under
        FASB Interpretation No. 39 (FIN 39), “Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain
        Contracts”, the Company elects to net-by-counterparty the fair value of interest
        rate swap contracts entered into by the Fixed Income Trading group. Certain
        contracts contain a legally enforceable master netting arrangement and
        therefore, the fair value of those swap contracts are netted by counterparty
        in
        the statement of financial condition.

The
        Company uses interest rate swaps as well as futures contracts as part of
        its
        fixed income business. In addition, the Company enters into interest rate
        swaps
        which are substantially economically hedged with counterparties. These positions
        are marked to market with the gain or loss and the related interest recorded
        in
        Net Trading Profits within the statement of operations for the period. Any
        collateral exchanged as part of the swap agreement is recorded in Broker
        Receivables and Payables within the statement of financial condition for
        the
        period.

To
        manage
        interest rate exposures, RJBank uses interest rate swaps. Interest rate swaps
        are agreements to exchange interest rate payment streams based on a notional
        principal amount. RJBank specifically designates interest rate swaps as hedges
        of the variability in interest rates on the deposit base utilized to fund
        the
        purchase of loan pools that initially carry a fixed rate, and recognizes
        interest differentials as adjustments to net interest income in the period
        they
        occur.

All
        derivative instruments are recognized on the statement of financial condition
        at
        their fair value. On the date the derivative contract is entered into, RJBank
        designates the derivative as a hedge of the variability of cash flows to
        be paid
        related to a recognized liability ("cash flow hedge”). RJBank formally documents
        all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as
        its
        risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge
        transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated
        as cash flow hedges to specific liabilities on the statement of financial
        condition. RJBank also formally assesses, both at the hedge's inception and
        on
        an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions
        are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged
        items.


Changes
        in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and that is
        designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded in other
        comprehensive income, until earnings are affected by the variability in cash
        flows of the designated hedged item. Any ineffectiveness resulting from the
        cash
        flow hedge is recorded in RJBank's non-interest income or expense at the
        end of
        each hedging period.

RJBank
        discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that the
        derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows
        of the
        hedged item, the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised,
        or the
        derivative is no longer designated as a hedging instrument, because management
        determines that the designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument
        is no
        longer appropriate.

When
        hedge accounting is discontinued, RJBank continues to carry the derivative
        at
        its fair value in the statement of financial condition, and recognizes any
        changes in its fair value in earnings.

Foreign
        Currency Translation

The
        Company consolidates its foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures. The statement
        of financial condition of the subsidiaries and joint ventures are translated
        at
        exchange rates as of the period end. The statements of operations are translated
        at an average exchange rate for the period. The gains or losses resulting
        from
        translating foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included
        in shareholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
        income.

Income
        Taxes

The
        Company utilizes the asset and liability approach defined in SFAS No. 109,
        “Accounting for Income Taxes”, which requires the recognition of deferred tax
        assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary
        differences between the financial statement amounts and the tax bases of
        assets
        and liabilities.

Earnings
        per Share

Basic
        EPS
        is calculated by dividing earnings available to common stockholders by the
        weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is similar
        to
        basic EPS, but adjusts for the effect of the potential issuance of

common
        shares by application of the treasury stock method.

Reclassifications

Certain
        amounts from prior years have been reclassified, including between segments,
        to
        conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications were not
        material to the consolidated financial statements or segment data.

NOTE
        2 - TRADING SECURITIES AND TRADING SECURITIES SOLD BUT NOT YET
        PURCHASED:

Mortgage
        backed securities of $79.8 million and $31.1 million at September 30, 2005
        and
        September 24, 2004, respectively, are included in the table above. Net
        unrealized gains (losses) related to open trading positions at September
        30,
        2005, September 24, 2004, and September 26, 2003 were $1,257,000, $(7,025,000),
        and $529,000, respectively.


NOTE
        3 - AVAILABLE FOR SALE SECURITIES:

The
        amortized cost and estimated market values of securities available for sale
        at
        September 30, 2005 are as follows:

The
        amortized cost and estimated market values of securities available for sale
        at
        September 24, 2004 are as follows:

There
        were proceeds of $9,250,000 from the sale of securities available for sale
        for
        the year ended September 30, 2005. There were no proceeds for the years ended
        September 24, 2004 and September 26, 2003.

The
        amortized cost and estimated market value of securities available for sale
        at
        September 30, 2005, by contractual maturity are shown below. Actual maturities
        will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right
        to
        call or prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties.

The
        following table shows RJBank’s investments’ gross unrealized losses and fair
        value, aggregated by length of time the individual securities have been in
        a
        continuous unrealized loss position, at September 30, 2005 (in 000’s).


The
        unrealized losses at September 30, 2005, were primarily caused by interest
        rate
        changes. The Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan
        Mortgage Corporation guarantee the principal of the agency collateralized
        mortgage obligation securities, while the non-agency collateralized mortgage
        obligations are rated AAA. It is expected that the securities would not be
        settled at a price less than the amortized cost of the investment. As the
        decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not
        credit quality, and as the Company has the intent to hold these investments
        until a market price recovery or it gains evidence indicating the cost of
        the
        investment is recoverable, these investments are not considered
        "other-than-temporarily" impaired.

        and
        $17,685,000, respectively.


NOTE
        5 - BANK LOANS, NET:

Bank
        client receivables are primarily comprised of loans originated or purchased
        by
        RJBank and include commercial and residential mortgage loans, as well as
        consumer loans. These receivables are

collateralized
        by first or second mortgages on residential property, real property, or the
        general assets of the borrower. T

he
        following table provides a summary of RJBank's loans receivable at September
        30,
        2005 and September 24, 2004:

At
        September 30, 2005 and September 24, 2004, $70,000,000 and $60,000,000 in
        Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances, respectively, were secured by a
        blanket lien on RJ Bank's residential mortgage loan portfolio.

RJBank's
        gain from the sale of originated loans held for sale were $421,000, $258,000,
        and $1,090,000 for the years ended September 30, 2005, September 24, 2004,
        and
        September 26, 2003, respectively.

Certain
        officers, directors and affiliates, and their related interests were indebted
        to
        RJBank for $297,000 and $1,327,000 at September 30, 2005 and September 24,
        2004,

The
        total
        allowance for loan losses includes both the reserve for funded loans shown
        net
        of Bank loans receivable on the statement of financial condition, and the
        reserve for unfunded lending commitments included in Trade and other
        payables.

The
        investment in loans on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2005 and September
        24,
        2004 was immaterial to the financial statements.

The
        investment and the average balance of impaired loans at September 30, 2005
        and
        September 24, 2004, along with the related interest income recognized on
        these
        loans, were immaterial to the financial statements.

NOTE
        6 - VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (“VIE’S”):

Under
        the
        provisions of FASB Interpretation 46R ("FIN 46R") the Company has determined
        that Raymond James Employee Investment Funds I and II (the “EIF Funds”),
        Comprehensive Software Systems, Inc. (“CSS”), certain entities in which Raymond
        James Tax Credit Funds, Inc. owns variable interests, and various partnerships
        involving real estate are variable interest entities (“VIEs”). Of these, the
        Company has determined that the EIF Funds and certain tax credit fund
        partnerships/LLCs should be consolidated in the financial
        statements.


The
        following table summarizes the balance sheets of the variable interest entities
        consolidated by the Company:

The
        EIF
        Funds are limited partnerships, for which the Company is the general partner,
        that invest in the merchant banking and private equity activities of the
        Company
        and other unaffiliated venture capital limited partnerships. Both EIF Funds
        were
        established as compensation and retention measures for certain qualified
        key
        employees of the Company. The Company makes non-recourse loans to these
        employees for two thirds of the purchase price per unit. The loans and
        applicable interest are to be repaid based on the earnings of the EIF Funds.
        The
        Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary, and accordingly, consolidates
        the EIF Funds, which had combined assets of approximately $19.3 million at
        September 30, 2005. None of those assets act as collateral for any obligations
        of the EIF Funds. The Company's exposure to loss is limited to its contributions
        and the loans funded to the employee investors. At September 30, 2005, that
        exposure is approximately $11.3 million.

CSS
        was
        formed by a group of broker-dealer firms, including the Company, to develop
        a
        back-office software system. CSS is currently funded by capital contributions
        and loans from its other owners. CSS had assets of $6.3 million at September
        30,
        2005. The Company's exposure to loss is limited to its capital contributions.
        The Company is not the primary beneficiary of CSS and accounts for its
        investment using the equity method of accounting. The carrying value of the
        Company's investment in CSS is approximately $850,000 at September 30,
        2005.

Raymond
        James Tax Credit Funds, Inc. (“RJTCF”) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of RJF and
        is the managing member or general partner in approximately 35 individual
        tax
        credit housing funds having one or more investor members or limited partners.
        These tax credit housing funds are organized as limited liability companies
        or
        limited partnerships for the purpose of investing in limited partnerships
        which
        purchase and develop low income housing properties qualifying for tax credits.
        As of September 30, 2005, 34 of these tax credit housing funds are VIEs as
        defined by FIN 46R, and RJTCF’s interest in these tax credit housing funds which
        are VIEs range from .01% to 1%. Prior to fiscal 2005, RJTCF’s investments in tax
        credit housing funds were not considered to be VIEs by the Company. However,
        after further guidance and analysis on the application of FIN 46R to the
        tax
        credit industry, the Company has determined that these funds meet the definition
        of a VIE. The determination of whether RJTCF is the primary beneficiary of
        (and
        must consequently consolidate) a given tax credit housing fund depends upon
        a
        number of factors, including the number of investor members or limited partners
        and the rights and obligations of the partners in that fund. RJTCF has concluded
        it is the primary beneficiary in approximately one third of these tax credit
        housing funds, and accordingly, consolidates these funds, which have combined
        assets of approximately $210.8 million at September 30, 2005. None of those
        assets act as collateral for any obligations of these funds. The Company's
        exposure to loss is limited to its advances to these funds. At September
        30,
        2005, that exposure is approximately $5.5 million. RJTCF is not the primary
        beneficiary of the remaining tax credit housing funds it determined to be
        VIEs
        and accordingly the Company does not consolidate its financial interests
        in
        these funds. The Company's exposure to loss is limited to its advances to
        those
        funds. At September 30, 2005, that exposure is approximately $23.9 million.
        The
        sole remaining tax credit housing fund which is determined not to be a VIE
        and
        is wholly-owned by RJTCF and is included in the Company’s consolidated financial
        statements. This wholly-owned tax credit housing fund typically holds interests
        in certain tax credit limited partnerships for less than 90-days and has
        assets
        of approximately $3.6 million at September 30, 2005.


As
        of
        September 30, 2005, the Company has a variable interest in several limited
        partnerships involved in various real estate activities, in which a subsidiary
        is the general partner. Previously, these partnerships were not considered
        VIEs.
        However, after further guidance and analysis on the application of FIN 46R,
        the
        Company has determined that these partnerships meet the definition of a VIE.
        The
        Company is not the primary beneficiary of these partnerships and accordingly
        the
        Company does not consolidate its financial interests in these partnerships.
        These partnerships have assets of approximately $22.2 million at September
        30,
        2005. The Company's exposure to loss is limited to its capital contributions.
        The carrying value of the Company's investment in these partnerships is
        immaterial at September 30, 2005.

NOTE
        7 - LEVERAGED LEASES

:

The
        Company is the lessor in two leveraged commercial aircraft transactions with
        two
        major domestic airlines (Delta and Continental). The Company's ability to
        realize its expected return is dependent upon the airlines' ability to fulfill
        their lease obligations. In the event that the airlines default on their
        lease
        commitments and the Trustee for the debt holders is unable to re-lease or
        sell
        the planes with adequate terms, the Company would suffer a loss of some or
        all
        of its investment. Delta Airlines filed for bankruptcy protection on September
        14, 2005. Accordingly, the Company recorded a $6.5 million pretax charge
        to
        fully reserve the balance of its investment in the leveraged lease of an
        aircraft to Delta. The Company took a $4 million pretax charge in the prior
        year
        to partially reserve for this investment. No amount of these charges represents
        a cash expenditure; however, in the event of a material modification to the
        lease or foreclosure of the aircraft by the debt holders, certain tax payments
        of up to approximately $8.7 million could be accelerated. The expected tax
        payments are currently reflected on the statement of financial condition
        as a
        deferred tax liability and are not expected to result in a further charge
        to
        earnings.

The
        Company also has an outstanding leveraged lease with Continental valued at
        $11.8
        million as of Sept. 30, 2005. The Company's equity investment represented
        20% of
        the aggregate purchase price; the remaining 80% was funded by public debt
        issued
        in the form of equipment trust certificates. The residual value of the aircraft
        at the end of the lease term of approximately 17 years is projected to be
        15% of
        the original cost. This lease expires in September 2013.

To
        date,
        Continental remains current on its lease payments to the Company. Given the
        difficult economic environment for the airline industry, the Company is closely
        monitoring this investment for specific events or circumstances that would
        allow
        reasonable estimation of any potential impairment.

The
                  Company and its subsidiaries maintain one committed and several
                  uncommitted lines of credit denominated in U.S. dollars and one
                  uncommitted line of credit denominated in Canadian dollars. At
                  September
                  30, 2005, the aggregate available balance was $560 million and
                  CDN$40
                  million, respectively. The aggregate balance of the U.S. dollar

NOTE
        11 - DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:

The
        Company makes limited use of derivative financial instruments in certain
        of its
        businesses. Certain derivative financial instruments are used to manage
        well-defined interest rate risk at RJBank, while others are used in the conduct
        of the Company’s fixed income business.

The
        Company uses interest rate swaps as well as futures contracts as part of
        its
        fixed income business. In addition, the Company enters into interest rate
        swaps
        which are substantially economically hedged with counterparties. These positions
        are marked to market with the gain or loss and the related interest recorded
        in
        Net Trading Profits within the statement of operations for the period. Any
        collateral exchanged as part of the swap agreement is recorded in Broker
        Receivables and Payables within the statement of financial condition for
        the
        period. At September 30, 2005 and September 24, 2004, the Company had
        outstanding derivative contracts with notional amounts of $1.9 billion and
        $701
        million, respectively, in interest rate swaps. The notional amount of a
        derivative contract does not change hands; it is simply used as a reference
        to
        calculate payments. Accordingly, the notional amount of the Company’s derivative
        contracts outstanding at September 30, 2005 significantly exceeds the possible
        losses that could arise from such transactions. The net market value of all
        open
        swap positions at September 30, 2005 and September 24, 2004 was $10 million
        and
        $5 million, respectively.

RJBank
        uses variable-rate deposits to finance the purchase of certain loan pools
        that
        are fixed for the first five years of their life. The funding sources expose
        RJBank to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates.
        Management believes it is prudent to limit the variability of its interest
        payments. To meet this objective, management enters into interest rate swap
        agreements to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from interest rate
        risk. These swaps change the variable-rate cash flow exposure on the funding
        sources to fixed cash flows. Under the terms of the interest rate swaps,
        RJBank
        receives variable interest rate payments and makes fixed interest rate payments,
        thereby creating the equivalent of fixed-rate funding. At September 30, 2005
        and
        2004, RJBank was party to $11.5 million

and
        $49.3 million, respectively, in

notional
        amount of interest rate swap agreements, and had securities and cash of $0.9
        million and $3.0 million, respectively, pledged or held as interest-bearing
        collateral for such agreements.


Changes
        in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective, as defined by
        SFAS
        133, and that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded
        in
        other comprehensive income until earnings are affected by the variability
        in
        cash flows of the designated hedged item. Any ineffectiveness resulting from
        the
        cash flow hedge is recorded in income or expense at the end of each reporting
        period. For purposes of the statement of cash flows, any ineffectiveness
        resulting from the cash flow hedge is subtracted or added back in the
        reconciliation of net income to cash provided by operating activities at
        the end
        of each reporting period. When hedge accounting is discontinued, RJBank
        continues to carry the derivative at its fair value in the statement of
        financial condition, and recognizes any changes in its fair value in earnings.
        For the years ended September 30, 2005, September 24, 2004, and September
        26,
        2003, RJBank recorded ($207,767), $391,651, and $524,800, respectively, in
        income (expense) from ineffective cash flow hedges and transition adjustments.
        The net amount of the existing unrealized losses expected to be reclassified
        into pretax earnings within the next 12 months was $100,000 at September
        30,
        2005 and $1.2 million at September 24, 2004.

The
        Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the
        counterparties to its interest rate swap agreements. The Company performs
        a
        credit evaluation of counterparties prior to entering into swap transactions.
        Currently, the Company anticipates that all counterparties will be able to
        fully
        satisfy their obligations under those agreements. The Company may require
        collateral from counterparties to support these obligations as established
        by
        the credit threshold specified by the agreement and/or as a result of monitoring
        the credit standing of the counterparties. However, state laws prohibit certain
        municipalities and other governmental entities from posting collateral in
        these
        transactions. For additional discussion regarding the Company’s objectives and
        strategies relative to derivative instruments in the context of the Company’s
        overall risk management strategy, refer to the Market Risk section in Item
        7A,
“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk”.

NOTE
        12 - INCOME TAXES:

The
        provision (benefit) for income taxes consists of the following:

The
        Company's income tax expense differs from the amount computed by applying
        the
        statutory federal income tax rate due to the following:


The
        major
        deferred tax asset (liability) items, as computed under SFAS 109, are as
        follows:

The
        Company has recorded a deferred tax asset at September 30, 2005 and September
        24, 2004. No valuation allowance as defined by SFAS 109 is required for the
        years then ended as Management believes that it is more likely than not the
        deferred tax asset is realizable.

NOTE
        13 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:

Long-term
        lease agreements expire at various times through 2014. Minimum annual rentals
        under such agreements for the succeeding five fiscal years are approximately:
        $20,493,000 in 2006, $18,389,000 in 2007, $13,327,000 in 2008, $9,241,000
        in
        2009, $7,468,000 in 2010 and $9,757,000 thereafter. Rental expense incurred
        under all leases, including equipment under short-term agreements, aggregated
        $31,949,000, $31,396,000, and $30,657,000 in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
        respectively.

See
        Note
        7 above with respect to the Company's interest in certain commercial aircraft
        leveraged leases.

RJBank
        has outstanding at any time a significant number of commitments to extend
        credit. These arrangements are subject to strict credit control assessments
        and
        each client's credit worthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. A summary
        of commitments to extend credit and letters of credit outstanding are as
        follows:

Because
        many commitments expire without being funded in whole or part, the contract
        amounts are not estimates of future cash flows.

In
        the
        normal course of business, RJBank issues, or participates in the issuance
        of,
        financial standby letters of credit whereby it provides an irrevocable guarantee
        of payment in the event the letter of credit is drawn down by the beneficiary.
        As of September 30, 2005, $15.9 million of such letters of credit were
        outstanding. Of the letters of credit outstanding, $14.5 million are
        underwritten as part of a larger corporate credit relationship, and the
        remaining $1.4 million are fully secured by cash or securities. In the event
        that a letter of credit is drawn down, RJBank would pursue repayment from
        the
        account party under the existing borrowing relationship, or would liquidate
        collateral, or both. The proceeds from repayment or liquidation of collateral
        are expected to cover the maximum potential amount of any future payments
        of
        amounts drawn down under the existing letters of credit.


At
        September 30, 2005 and September 24, 2004, no securities were pledged by
        RJBank
        as collateral with the FHLB for advances. In lieu of pledging securities
        as
        collateral for advances, RJBank provided the FHLB with a lien against RJBank's
        portfolio of residential mortgages.

As
        part
        of an effort to increase brand awareness, the Company entered into a stadium
        naming rights contract in July 1998. The contract has a 13 year term with
        a
        five-year renewal option and a 4% annual escalator. Expenses of $2,802,000,

$2,694,000

,
        and
        $2,590,000 were recognized in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003,
        respectively.

In
        the
        normal course of business, the Company enters into underwriting commitments.
        Transactions relating to such commitments

of
        Raymond James & Associates, Inc. ("RJA")

that
        were
        open at September 30, 2005 and were subsequently settled had no material
        effect
        on the consolidated financial statements as of that date. Transactions relating
        to such commitments

of

Raymond
        James Ltd. ("RJ Ltd.") that were open at September 30, 2005 were approximately
        $68.2 million, which were substantially settled shortly after year end.

The
        Company utilizes client marginable securities to satisfy deposits with clearing
        organizations. At September 30, 2005 and September 24, 2004, the Company
        had
        client margin securities valued at $93.4 million and $90.2 million,
        respectively, on deposit with a clearing organization.

The
        Company has guaranteed lines of credit for various foreign joint ventures
        as
        follows: two lines of credit totaling $11.0 million in Turkey and one line
        of
        credit totaling $1.25 million in Argentina. At September 30, 2005, there
        were no
        outstanding balances on these lines of credit. The Company has also from
        time to
        time authorized guarantees for the completion of trades with counterparties
        in
        Argentina and Turkey: at September 30, 2005 there were outstanding guarantees
        for a maximum of $5 million in Turkey and no guarantees were outstanding
        for
        Argentina.

The
        Company has also committed to invest $425,000 in two foreign asset management
        entities.

The
        Company has committed a total of $34.9 million, in amounts ranging from $200,000
        to $1.5 million, to 36 different independent venture capital or private equity
        partnerships. As of September 30, 2005, the Company had invested $26.8 million
        of that amount.

Additionally,
        the Company is the general partner in two internally sponsored private equity
        limited partnerships to which it has committed $14 million. Of that amount,
        the
        Company has invested $10.7 million as of September 30, 2005.

At
        September 30, 2005, the approximate market values of collateral received
        that
        can be repledged by the Company, were:

During
        the year certain collateral was repledged. At September 30, 2005, the
        approximate market values of this portion of collateral and financial
        instruments owned that were repledged by the Company, were:

In
        the
        normal course of business, certain subsidiaries of the Company act as general
        partner and may be contingently liable for activities of various limited
        partnerships. These partnerships engaged primarily in real estate activities.
        In
        the opinion of the Company, such liabilities, if any, for the obligations
        of the
        partnerships will not in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on
        the
        Company's consolidated financial position.


The
        Company guarantees the existing mortgage debt of Raymond James & Associates,
        Inc. ("RJA") of approximately $70 million.

The
        Company may guarantee interest rate swap obligations of RJ Capital Services,
        Inc. The Company has also committed to lend to or guarantee obligations of
        Raymond James Tax Credit Funds, Inc. (“RJTCF”) of up to $90 million upon
        request, subject to certain limitations as well as annual review and renewal.
        RJTCF borrows in order to invest in partnerships which purchase and develop
        properties qualifying for tax credits.

These
        investments in project partnerships are then sold to various tax credit funds,
        which have third party investors, and for which RJTCF serves as the managing
        member or general partner. RJTCF typically sells these investments within
        days of their acquisition, and the proceeds from the sales are used to repay
        RJTCF’s borrowings. Additionally, RJTCF may make short-term loans or advances to
        project partnerships on behalf of the tax credit funds in which it serves
        as
        managing member or general partner. At September 30, 2005, guarantees
        outstanding to various tax credit funds totaled $1.1 million and cash funded
        to
        invest in either loans or investments in project partnerships was $40.9 million.
        In addition, at Sept 30, 2005, RJTCF is committed to additional future fundings
        of $6.5 million related to project partnerships that have not yet been sold
        to
        various tax credit funds.

NOTE
        14 - LEGAL AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS:

As
        a
        result of the extensive regulation of the securities industry, the Company's
        broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to regular reviews and inspections
        by
        regulatory authorities and self-regulatory organizations, which can result
        in
        the imposition of sanctions for regulatory violations, ranging from non-monetary
        censure to fines and, in serious cases, temporary or permanent suspension
        from
        business. In addition, from time to time regulatory agencies and self-regulatory
        organizations institute investigations into industry practices, which can
        also
        result in the imposition of such sanctions.

The
        Company is a defendant or co-defendant in various lawsuits and arbitrations
        incidental to its securities business.  Like others in the retail
        securities industry, the Company experienced a significant increase in the
        number of claims seeking recovery due to portfolio losses in the early 2000's.
        During the past two years, the number of claims declined but are still above
        long-term historic levels.

As
        previously reported, the Company and RJFS are defendants in a series of lawsuits
        and arbitrations relating to an alleged mortgage lending program known as
        the
        "Premiere 72" program, that was administered by a company owned in part by
        two
        individuals who were registered as Financial Advisors with RJFS in Houston.
        The
        lawsuits are pending in various courts, and several cases that had been removed
        to federal court were remanded to state court, and the plaintiffs are seeking
        reconsideration of that decision. In July 2005, RJFS paid approximately $24
        million in a settlement with approximately 380 claimants in this litigation,
        representing approximately two-thirds of the outstanding claims. The Company
        estimates that the value of the claims resolved also represents approximately
        two-thirds of the value of the total claims and has made adjustments to its
        litigation reserves to give effect to the estimated impact of the
        settlement.

S

everal
        of
        the arbitration claims relating to this matter had been previously settled
        by
        RJFS for amounts consistent with its evaluation of those claims.

As
        previously reported, on September 30, 2004 the SEC instituted an administrative
        proceeding against Raymond James Financial Services, Inc. (“RJFS”) alleging
        fraud and failure to supervise a former Financial Advisor in the RJFS Cranston,
        Rhode Island office. The Administrative Law Judge issued an initial decision
        in
        September 2005 finding that RJFS failed to supervise and that is was liable
        for
        the fraud committed by its former Financial Advisor, and ordered RJFS to
        disgorge $5,866 and pay a civil penalty of $6.9 million. The Judge denied
        the
        SEC’s request for a cease and desist order, a consultant review and a finding
        that RJFS violated e-mail retention rules. The decision was confirmed by
        the SEC
        on November 21, 2005.

The
        Company is contesting the allegations in these and other matters and believes
        that there are meritorious defenses in each of these matters. In view of
        the
        number and diversity of claims against the Company, the number of jurisdictions
        in which litigation is pending and the inherent difficulty of predicting
        the
        outcome of litigation and other claims, the Company cannot state with certainty
        what the eventual outcome of pending litigation or other claims will be.
        In the
        opinion of the Company's management, based on current available information,
        review with outside legal counsel, and consideration of amounts provided
        for in
        the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these
        matters, ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse
        impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. However,
        resolution of one or more of these matters may have a material effect on
        the
        results of operations in any future period, depending upon the ultimate
        resolution of those matters and upon the level of income for such
        period.


NOTE
        15 - CAPITAL TRANSACTIONS:

At
        their
        meeting on February 12, 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a
        3-for-2 stock split. The additional shares were distributed on March 24,
        2004,
        to shareholders of record on March 4, 2004. All references in the consolidated
        financial statements to amounts per share and to the number of shares
        outstanding have been restated to give retroactive effect to the stock
        split.

The
        following table presents information on a monthly basis for purchases of
        the
        Company’s stock for the quarter ended September 30, 2005:

(1)

The
        Company does not have a formal stock repurchase plan. Shares are repurchased
        at
        the discretion of management pursuant to prior authorization from the Board
        of
        Directors. On May 20, 2004, the Board of Directors authorized purchases of
        up to
        $75 million. Since that date, 80,740 shares have been repurchased for a total
        of
        $1.9 million, leaving $73.1 million available to repurchase shares. Historically
        the Company has considered such purchases when the price of its stock reaches
        or
        approaches 1.5 times book value or when employees surrender shares as payment
        for option exercises. The decision to repurchase shares is subject to cash
        availability and other factors. During 2005 and 2004, 5,740 and 86,057 shares
        were repurchased at an average price of $30.81 and $22.72, respectively.
        During
        the year ended, September 30, 2005, the Company only purchased shares that
        were
        surrendered by employees as payment for option exercises.

NOTE
        16 - OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME:


NOTE
        17 - EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS:

The
        Company's profit sharing plan and employee stock ownership plan provide certain
        death, disability or retirement benefits for all employees who meet certain
        service requirements. Such benefits become fully vested after seven years
        of
        qualified service. The Company also offers a plan pursuant to section 401(k)
        of
        the Internal Revenue Code, which provides for the Company to match 100% of
        the
        first $500 and 50% of the next $500 of compensation deferred by each participant
        annually. The Company's Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) is a non-qualified
        deferred compensation plan that provides benefits to employees who meet certain
        compensation or production requirements. The Company has purchased and holds
        life insurance on the lives of most of those employees participating in the
        LTIP, to earn a competitive rate of return for participants and to provide
        a
        source of funds available to satisfy its obligations under this plan.
        Contributions to the qualified plans and the LTIP contribution for management
        are made in amounts approved annually by the Board of Directors. Compensation
        expense includes aggregate contributions to these plans of $24,069,000,
        $22,265,000, and $14,431,000 for fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003,
        respectively.

Stock-based
        Compensation Plans

At
        September 30, 2005, the Company had multiple stock-based employee compensation
        plans, which are described below. Effective September 28, 2002, the Company
        adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123. Under the
        modified prospective method of adoption selected by the Company within the
        provisions of SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation -
        Transition and Disclosure", the recognition of compensation cost in fiscal
        2005,
        2004 and 2003 is the same as that which would have been recognized had the
        recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 been applied since the date of grant
        for
        all outstanding options.

Fixed
        Stock Option Plans

The
        Company has two qualified and three non-qualified fixed stock option plans.
        Under the 2002 Incentive Stock Option Plan, the Company may grant options
        to its
        management personnel for up to 6,000,000 shares of common stock. The 2002
        Plan
        was established to replace, on substantially the same terms and conditions,
        the
        1992 Plan. Options are granted to key administrative employees and Financial
        Advisors of Raymond James & Associates, Inc. who achieve certain gross
        commission levels. Options are exercisable in the 36th to 72nd months following
        the date of grant and only in the event that the grantee is an employee of
        the
        Company at that time, disabled or recently retired.

As
        noted
        above, the Company has three non-qualified fixed stock option plans. Under
        the
        first of those plans, the Company may grant up to 3,417,188 shares of common
        stock to independent contractor Financial Advisors. Options are exercisable
        five
        years after grant date provided that the Financial Advisors are still associated
        with the Company. Under the Company's second non-qualified stock option plan,
        the Company may grant up to 569,532 shares of common stock to the Company's
        outside directors. Options vest over a five-year period from grant date provided
        that the director is still serving on the Board of the Company. Under the
        Company's third non-qualified stock option plan, the Company may grant up
        to
        1,687,500 shares of common stock to key management personnel. Option terms
        are
        specified in individual agreements and expire on a date no later than the
        tenth
        anniversary of the grant date. Under all plans, the exercise price of each
        option equals the market price of the Company's stock on the date of grant
        and
        an option's maximum term is 10 years.

Expense
        for the five fixed stock option plans was $8.3 million, $9.1 million, and
        $8.0
        million for the years ended September 30, 2005, September 24, 2004, and
        September 26, 2003, respectively.

These
        amounts may not be representative of future stock-based compensation expense
        since the estimated fair value of stock options is amortized to expense over
        the
        vesting period and additional options may be granted in future years. The
        fair
        value of each fixed option grant is estimated on the date of grant using
        the
        Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average
        assumptions used for stock option grants in fiscal 2005, 2004 and
        2003:


A
        summary
        of the status of the Company's five fixed stock option plans as of September
        30,
        2005, September 24, 2004, and September 26, 2003 and changes during the years
        ended on those dates is presented below:

The
        following table summarizes information about fixed stock options outstanding
        at
        September 30, 2005:


Restricted
        Stock Plan

Under
        the
        2005 Restricted Stock Plan the Company is authorized to issue up to 1,500,000
        restricted shares of common stock to employees and independent contractors.
        The
        2005 Plan was established to replace, on substantially the same terms and
        conditions, the 1999 Plan. Awards under this plan may be granted by various
        departments of the Company in connection with initial employment or under
        various retention plans for individuals who are responsible for a contribution
        to the management growth, and/or profitability of the Company. These shares
        are
        forfeitable in the event of termination other than for death, disability
        or
        retirement. The compensation cost is recognized over the vesting period of
        the
        shares and is calculated as the market value of the shares on the date of
        grant.
        Expense of $3.7 million, $3.0 million, and $2.0 million was recorded in the
        years ended September 30, 2005, September 24, 2004 and September 26, 2003,
        respectively, related to this plan. The following activity occurred during
        fiscal 2005:

Employee
        Stock Purchase Plan

Under
        the
        2003 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the Company is authorized to issue up
        to
        2,250,000 shares of common stock to its full-time employees, nearly all of
        whom
        are eligible to participate. Under the terms of the Plan, employees can choose
        each year to have up to 20% of their annual compensation specified to purchase
        the Company's common stock. Share purchases in any calendar year are limited
        to
        the lesser of 1,000 shares or shares with a market value of $25,000. The
        purchase price of the stock is 85% of the market price on the day prior to
        the
        purchase date. Under the Plan, and its expired predecessor plan, the Company
        sold 328,686, 332,098, and 314,394 shares to employees in fiscal years 2005,
        2004, and 2003, respectively. The compensation cost is calculated as the
        value
        of the 15% discount from market value and was $1.4 million, $1.3 million
        and
        $0.9 million for the years ended September 30, 2005, September 24, 2004,
        and
        September 26, 2003, respectively.

Stock
        Bonus Plan

The
        Company's 1999 Stock Bonus Plan authorizes the Company to issue up to 1,500,000
        restricted shares to officers and certain other employees in lieu of cash
        for
        10% to 20% of annual bonus amounts in excess of $250,000. The determination
        of
        the number of shares to be granted may encompass a discount from market value
        at
        the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Under
        the plan the shares are generally restricted for a three year period, during
        which time the shares are forfeitable in the event of voluntary termination.
        The
        compensation cost is recognized over the three-year vesting period based
        on the
        market value of the shares on the date of grant. Expense of $3.5 million,
        $2.7
        million, and $3.5 million was recorded in the years ended September 30, 2005,
        September 24, 2004, and September 26, 2003, respectively, related to this
        plan.
        The following activity occurred during 2005:

Employee
        Investment Funds

Certain
        key employees of the Company participate in the Raymond James Employee
        Investment Funds I and II, which are limited partnerships that invest in
        the
        merchant banking and venture capital activities of the Company and other
        unaffiliated venture capital limited partnerships. The Company makes
        non-recourse loans to these employees for two thirds of the purchase price
        per
        unit. The loans and applicable interest are to be repaid based solely on
        the
        distributions from the funds.


NOTE
        18 - REGULATIONS AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS:

Certain
        broker-dealer subsidiaries of the Company are subject to the requirements
        of the
        Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1) under the Securities Exchange Act
        of
        1934. Raymond James & Associates, Inc. (“RJA”), a member firm of the NYSE,
        is also subject to the rules of the NYSE, whose requirements are substantially
        the same. Rule 15c3-1 requires that aggregate indebtedness, as defined, not
        to
        exceed fifteen times net capital, as defined. Rule 15c3-1 also provides for
        an
“alternative net capital requirement”, which both RJA and RJFS have elected. It
        requires that minimum net capital, as defined, be equal to the greater of
        $250,000 or two percent of Aggregate Debit Items arising from client
        transactions. The NYSE may require a member firm to reduce its business if
        its
        net capital is less than four percent of Aggregate Debit Items and may prohibit
        a member firm from expanding its business and declaring cash dividends if
        its
        net capital is less than five percent of Aggregate Debit Items. The net capital
        position of RJA at September 30, 2005 and September 24, 2004 was as
        follows:

At
        September 30, 2005 and September 24, 2004, RJFS had no Aggregate Debit Items
        and
        therefore the minimum net capital of $250,000 was applicable. The net capital
        position of RJFS at September 30, 2005 and September 24, 2004 was as
        follows:

Raymond
        James Ltd. is subject to the Minimum Capital Rule (By-Law No. 17 of the
        Investment Dealers Association ("IDA")) and the Early Warning System (By-Law
        No.
        30 of the IDA). The Minimum Capital Rule requires that every member shall
        have
        and maintain at all times Risk Adjusted Capital greater than zero calculated
        in
        accordance with Form 1 (Joint Regulatory Financial Questionnaire and Report)
        and
        with such requirements as the Board of Directors of the IDA may from time
        to
        time prescribe. Insufficient Risk Adjusted Capital may result in suspension
        from
        membership in the stock exchanges or the IDA.

The
        Early
        Warning System is designed to provide advance warning that a member firm
        is
        encountering financial difficulties. This system imposes certain sanctions
        on
        members who are designated in Early Warning Level 1 or Level 2 according
        to its
        capital, profitability, liquidity position, frequency of designation or at
        the
        discretion of the IDA. Restrictions on business activities and capital
        transactions, early filing requirements, and mandated corrective measures
        are
        sanctions that may be imposed as part of the Early Warning System. The Company
        was not in Early Warning Level 1 or Level 2 at September 30, 2005 or 2004.

The
        Risk
        Adjusted Capital of RJ Ltd. was CDN $25,482,000 and CDN $20,422,261 at September
        30, 2005 and 2004, respectively.


RJBank
        is
        subject to various regulatory and capital requirements administered by the
        federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can
        initiate certain mandatory - and possibly additional discretionary - actions
        by
        regulators. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework
        for
        prompt corrective action, RJBank must meet specific capital guidelines that
        involve quantitative measures of RJBank's assets, liabilities, and certain
        off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.
        RJBank's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative
        judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other
        factors.

Quantitative
        measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require RJBank
        to
        maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total
        and
        Tier I Capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as
        defined). Management believes that, as of September 30, 2005 and September
        30,
        2004, the Bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is
        subject.

As
        of
        September 30, 2005, the most recent notification from the Office of Thrift
        Supervision categorized RJBank as “well capitalized” under the regulatory
        framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as “well capitalized”,
        RJBank must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier I risk-based, and Tier
        I leverage ratios as set forth in the table below. There are no conditions
        or
        events since that notification that management believes have changed RJBank's
        category.

NOTE
        19 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET
        RISK:

In
        the
        normal course of business, the Company purchases and sells securities as
        either
        principal or agent on behalf of its clients. If either the client or a
        counterparty fails to perform, the Company may be required to discharge the
        obligations of the nonperforming party. In such circumstances, the Company
        may
        sustain a loss if the market value of the security or futures contract is
        different from the contract value of the transaction.

The
        Company also acts as an intermediary between broker-dealers and other financial
        institutions whereby the Company borrows securities from one broker-dealer
        and
        then lends them to another. Securities borrowed and securities loaned are
        carried at the amounts of cash collateral advanced and received in connection
        with the transactions. The Company measures the market value of the securities
        borrowed and loaned against the cash collateral on a daily basis. The market
        value of securities borrowed and securities loaned was $1,049,897,000 and
        $1,081,328,000, respectively, at September 30, 2005 and $1,493,810,000 and
        $1,542,953,000, respectively, at September 24, 2004. Additional cash is obtained
        as necessary to ensure such transactions are adequately collateralized. If
        another party to the transaction fails to perform as agreed (for example
        failure
        to deliver a security or failure to pay for a security), the Company may
        incur a
        loss if the market value of the security is different from the contract amount
        of the transaction.


The
        Company has also loaned, to brokers-dealers and other financial institutions,
        securities owned by clients and others for which it has received cash or
        other
        collateral. If a borrowing institution or broker-dealer does not return a
        security, the Company may be obligated to purchase the security in order
        to
        return it to the owner. In such circumstances, the Company may incur a loss
        equal to the amount by which the market value of the security on the date
        of
        nonperformance exceeds the value of the collateral received from the financial
        institution or the broker or dealer.

The
        Company has sold securities that it does not currently own, and will therefore,
        be obligated to purchase such securities at a future date. The Company has
        recorded $135 million and $111 million at September 30, 2005 and September
        24,
        2004, respectively, which represents the market value of the related securities
        at such dates. The Company is subject to loss if the market price of those
        securities not covered by a hedged position increases subsequent to fiscal
        year
        end. The Company utilizes short government obligations and equity securities
        to
        economically hedge long proprietary inventory positions. At September 30,
        2005,
        the Company had $99,549,000 in short government obligations and $27,839,000
        in
        short equity securities, which represented hedge positions. At September
        24,
        2004, the Company had $66,073,000 in short government obligations and
        $19,788,000 in short equity securities which represented hedge positions.

The
        Company enters into security transactions involving forward settlement. The
        Company has recorded transactions with contract values of $1,623,208,000
        and
        $2,062,855,000 and market values of $1,612,514,000 and $2,405,369,000 as
        of
        September 30, 2005 and September 24, 2004, respectively. Transactions involving
        future settlement give rise to market risk, which represents the potential
        loss
        that can be caused by a change in the market value of a particular financial
        instrument. The Company's exposure to market risk is determined by a number
        of
        factors, including the duration, size, composition and diversification of
        positions held, the absolute and relative levels of interest rates, and market
        volatility.

The
        majority of the Company's transactions, and consequently, the concentration
        of
        its credit exposure is with clients, broker-dealers and other financial
        institutions in the United States. These activities primarily involve
        collateralized arrangements and may result in credit exposure in the event
        that
        the counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations. The Company's
        exposure to credit risk can be directly impacted by volatile securities markets,
        which may impair the ability of counterparties to satisfy their contractual
        obligations. The Company seeks to control its credit risk through a variety
        of
        reporting and control procedures, including establishing credit limits based
        upon a review of the counterparties' financial condition and credit ratings.
        The
        Company monitors collateral levels on a daily basis for compliance with
        regulatory and internal guidelines and requests changes in collateral levels
        as
        appropriate.

        20 - EARNINGS PER SHARE:

The
        following table presents the computation of basic and diluted earnings per
        share
        (in 000’s, except per share amounts):


(1)

Diluted
                  earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average
                  number
                  of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential
                  common
                  shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.
                  Dilutive potential common shares include stock options and
                  awards.

SFAS
        No.
        131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,
        establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments.
        Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which
        separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by
        the
        chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how
        to
        allocate resources and in assessing

performance.
        Reclassifications have been made in the segment disclosures for fiscal years
        2004 and 2003 to conform to the current year presentation and EITF No. 04-10,
        “Determining Whether to Aggregate Operating Segments that do not meet the
        Quantitative Thresholds”. EITF 04-10 requires that operating segments that do
        not meet the quantitative thresholds established by SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures
        about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,” can be aggregated only
        if aggregation is consistent with the objective and basic principles of SFAS
        No.
        131, the segments have similar economic characteristics, and the segments
        share
        a majority of the aggregation criteria listed in SFAS No. 131. As a result
        of
        the adoption of this EITF, the previously reported Other segment currently
        consists of three segments: Emerging Markets, Stock Loan/Borrow, and Other.

The
        Company currently operates through the following seven business segments:

Private
        Client Group; Capital Markets; Asset Management; RJBank; Emerging Markets;
        Stock
        Loan/Borrow and various corporate investments combined in the "Other" segment.

The
        business segments are based upon factors such as the services provided and
        the
        distribution channels served and are consistent with how the Company assesses
        performance and determines how to allocate resources throughout the Company
        and
        its subsidiaries. The financial results of the Company's segments are presented
        using the same policies as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant
        Accounting Policies”. Segment data includes charges allocating corporate
        overhead and benefits to each segment. Intersegment revenues, charges,
        receivables and payables are eliminated between segments upon consolidation.

The
        Private Client Group segment includes the retail branches of the Company's
        broker-dealer subsidiaries located throughout the United States, Canada and
        the
        United Kingdom. These branches provide securities brokerage services including
        the sale of equities, mutual funds, fixed income products and insurance products
        to their individual clients. The segment includes net interest earnings on
        client margin loans and cash balances. Additionally, this segment includes
        the
        correspondent clearing services that the Company provides to other broker-dealer
        firms.

The
        Capital Markets segment includes institutional sales and trading in the United
        States, Canada and Europe. It provides securities brokerage, trading, and
        research services to institutions with an emphasis on the sale of U.S. and
        Canadian equities and fixed income products. This segment also includes the
        Company's management of and participation in underwritings, merger and
        acquisition services, public finance activities, and the operations of Raymond
        James Tax Credit Funds.

The
        Asset
        Management segment includes investment portfolio management services of Eagle
        Asset Management, Inc., Awad Asset Management, Inc., and the Raymond James
&
Associates asset management services division, mutual fund management by
        Heritage Asset Management, Inc., private equity management by Raymond James
        Capital, Inc. and RJ Ventures, LLC, and trust services of Raymond James Trust
        Company and Raymond James Trust Company West. In addition to the asset
        management services noted above, this segment also offers fee-based programs
        to
        clients who have contracted for portfolio management services from outside
        money
        managers.

Raymond
        James Bank is a separate segment, which provides consumer, residential, and
        commercial loans, as well as FDIC-insured deposit accounts to clients of
        the
        Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries and to the general public.

The
        Emerging Markets segment includes various joint ventures in Argentina, India,
        Turkey, and Uruguay. These joint ventures operate in securities brokerage,
        investment banking and asset management.

The
        Stock
        Loan/Borrow segment involves the borrowing and lending of securities from
        and to
        other broker-dealers, financial institutions and other counterparties, generally
        as an intermediary.

The
        Other
        segment includes various investments of Raymond James Financial,
        Inc.

In
        fiscal
        year 2004 the Company modified the method used to allocate certain corporate
        compensation costs to the segments consistent with the approach used internally
        by management in evaluating the segments. Fiscal year 2003 results were adjusted
        to reflect the current management allocation methodology.


Information
        concerning operations in these segments of business is as follows (in 000's):

The
        following table presents the Company's total assets on a segment
        basis:

*

Includes
                  $46 million of goodwill allocated pursuant to SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill
                  and
                  Other Intangible Assets".

**

Includes
                  $17 million of goodwill allocated pursuant to SFAS No.
                  142.

The
        Company has operations in the United States, Canada, Europe and joint ventures
        in India, Turkey, and

Argentina

.
        Substantially all long-lived assets are located in the United States. The
        following table represents revenue by country for the years indicated (in
        000’s).


While
        the
        dollar amount invested in emerging market joint ventures is only $5.8 million,
        these investments carry greater risk than amounts invested in developed
        markets.

CONTROLS
        AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure
        Controls are procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
        disclosed in the Company's reports

filed

under
        the Exchange Act, such as this report, is recorded, processed, summarized,
        and
        reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms.
        Disclosure controls are also designed to ensure that such information is
        accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive
        Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
        regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure
        controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures,
        no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
        absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as the
        Company's are designed to do, and management necessarily was required to
        apply
        its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls
        and procedures.

Under
        the
        supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including
        the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company has
        evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures pursuant
        to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this
        report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
        Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures
        are effective. There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over
        financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2005 that have
        materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
        Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT
        OF
        MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The
        Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
        internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal control
        over
        financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding
        the
        reliability of the Company’s financial reporting for external purposes in
        accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
        Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that
        in
        reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the Company’s transactions;
        providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
        for
        preparation of its financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that
        receipts and expenditures of Company assets are made in accordance with
        management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized
        acquisition, use or disposition of Company assets that could have a material
        effect on the Company’s financial statements would be prevented or detected on a
        timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
        financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a
        misstatement of the Company’s financial statements would be prevented or
        detected.

Management
        conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
        over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal
        Control - Integrated Framework

issued
        by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
        Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal
        control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2005.
        KPMG
        LLP has audited this assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial
        reporting; their report, which expresses unqualified opinions on management's
        assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over
        financial reporting as of September 30, 2005, is included in Item
