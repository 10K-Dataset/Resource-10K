ITEM 1.   BUSINESS
          --------
     (a)  General Description of Business
          -------------------------------
     Raymond James Financial, Inc. ("RJF") is a Florida-based holding company
that  was  incorporated  in 1974 as a successor to the  original  corporation
founded  in  1962.  Its  principal  subsidiaries  include  Raymond  James   &
Associates,  Inc. ("RJA"), Investment Management & Research,  Inc.  ("IM&R"),
Robert  Thomas  Securities,  Inc.  ("RTS"),  Eagle  Asset  Management,   Inc.
("Eagle"),  Heritage Asset Management, Inc. ("Heritage")  and  Raymond  James
Bank,  FSB.  All of these subsidiaries are wholly-owned by RJF.  RJF and  its
subsidiaries are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Company".

      RJF's principal subsidiary, RJA, was organized in Florida in 1962.  RJA
is  a  full  service  broker-dealer engaged in  most  aspects  of  securities
distribution  and  investment banking.  RJA also  offers  financial  planning
services  for individuals and provides clearing services for IM&R,  RTS,  and
several unaffiliated broker-dealers. The Company is the largest brokerage and
investment  firm headquartered in the state of Florida.  RJA is a  member  of
the  New  York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), American Stock Exchange, Philadelphia
Stock  Exchange, Boston Stock Exchange, Chicago Board Options  Exchange,  New
York  Futures Exchange, Pacific Exchange and Chicago Stock Exchange.   It  is
also a member of the Securities Industry Association, National Association of
Securities  Dealers  (NASD), and Securities Investors Protection  Corporation
(SIPC).  SIPC provides insurance protection for clients' accounts  of  up  to
$500,000 each (limited to $100,000 for claims for cash) in the event of RJA's
liquidation.   In  addition, RJA carries $49,500,000 per  account  of  excess
client insurance.  For the year ended September 25, 1998 the revenues of  RJA
accounted for 59% of the consolidated revenues of the Company.

      IM&R was formed in 1973 as an independent contractor financial planning
organization  and  participates  in  the distribution  of  all  products  and
services offered by RJA to its retail clients.  IM&R is a member of the  NASD
and  SIPC,  but  not  of any exchange, as it clears its trades  on  a  fully-
disclosed basis through RJA.

     RTS was organized in 1981, and serves independent contractor brokers who
do a majority of their business in individual securities.  RTS, like IM&R, is
a member of the NASD and SIPC, but not of any exchange, as it also clears all
of its business on a fully-disclosed basis through RJA.

      Eagle was formed in 1984 as a registered investment advisor to serve as
the  discretionary manager for individual equity portfolios.   Prior  to  the
inception  of  Eagle, the asset management operation had been a  division  of
RJA.

      Heritage  was organized in 1985 to act as the manager of the  Company's
internally sponsored Heritage family of mutual funds.

      Raymond  James Bank was formed in 1994 in conjunction with the purchase
from the Resolution Trust Corporation of certain branches of a failed thrift.
Its  primary purpose is to provide traditional banking products and  services
to the
clients of the Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries.

(c)  Narrative Description of Business
     ---------------------------------

      At  September  25,  1998 the Company employed 3,790  individuals.   RJA
employed  3,300  of  these  individuals, 578 of whom  were  full-time  retail
Financial  Advisors.   In addition, 2,540 full-time Financial  Advisors  were
affiliated with the Company as independent contractors.  Through its  broker-
dealer   subsidiaries,   the   Company  provides   securities   services   to
approximately  800,000  client  accounts. No single  client  accounts  for  a
material percentage of the Company's total business.

      The Company currently divides its business into five segments based  on
the  products  and services offered. These segments are retail  distribution,
institutional distribution, investment banking, asset management, and other.
                                      
                             RETAIL DISTRIBUTION
                             -------------------

      The  Company  provides securities transaction and  financial  planning
services to its retail clients through the RJA retail branch system, its two
independent contractor firms (IM&R and RTS), and a general insurance agency.

                             RJA - Retail Sales

        RJA's  57  retail branches are located primarily in the southeastern
U.S.,  with  a majority in Florida.  Branches are also located in  Colorado,
Delaware,  Georgia,  Illinois,  Iowa, North  Carolina,  Pennsylvania,  South
Carolina,  Tennessee,  Texas and Washington D.C.  Its 578  retail  Financial
Advisors  provide a broad range of financial products and services to  their
clients.   In most cases, RJA charges commissions to its retail clients,  on
both  exchange and over-the-counter equity transactions, in accordance  with
its   established  commission  schedule.   In  certain  instances,   varying
discounts  from  the schedule are given, generally based upon  the  client's
level  of  business, the trade size and other relevant  factors.   RJA  also
distributes both taxable and tax-exempt fixed income products to its  retail
clients,  including  municipal, corporate, government agency  and  mortgage-
backed  bonds, preferred stock and unit investment trusts.  In  addition,  a
growing number of clients are electing asset-based fee alternatives  to  the
traditional commission structure.

      The retail Financial Advisors sell a number of professionally managed,
load mutual funds and offer, in addition, a selection of no-load funds.  RJA
maintains  dealer-sales  agreements with most major distributors  of  mutual
fund   shares  sold  through  broker-dealers.   Commissions  on  such  sales
generally  range  from  1%  to 5% of the dollar value  of  the  transaction.
Alternative  sales  compensation  structures  typically  include   front-end
charges,  "back-end"  or contingent deferred sales charges,  and  an  annual
charge in the form of a fund expense.

      At  September 25, 1998, the Company had 14 internally sponsored mutual
funds  for  which RJA acts as distributor.  (See Heritage Asset  Management,
Inc. description on page 8.)  As the distributor of these funds, RJA has the
right to enter into dealer agreements with other broker-dealers for the sale
of Heritage funds to their clients.

                   Investment Management & Research, Inc.

      IM&R participates in the distribution of all the products and services
offered  by  RJA to its retail clients through 1,336 independent  contractor
Financial Advisors in 561 offices and 91 satellite offices throughout all 50
states.  The number of Financial Advisors in these offices ranges from 1  to
18.   Such Financial Advisors devote all or substantially all of their  time
to  the  sale  of  securities and, while these independent contractors  must
conduct all securities business through IM&R, their contracts permit them to
conduct  insurance,  real  estate brokerage, accounting  services  or  other
business  for others or for their own account. Many IM&R Financial  Advisors
are  better  characterized  as financial planners  than  as  stock  brokers,
although  they  are  not  required to conduct their  business  as  financial
planners.   Independent contractors are responsible for all of their  direct
costs and are paid a larger percentage of commissions to compensate them for
their added expenses.


                       Robert Thomas Securities, Inc.

      RTS has 1,204 full-time independent contractor Financial Advisors in a
network  of 434 branch offices and 164 satellite offices in 48 states.   RTS
Financial  Advisors  primarily offer individual  securities  and  investment
advice  to  individual investors and institutions.  Of the branch locations,
there  are  223  that compose the RTS Financial Institutions Division  which
offers   securities  on  a  third-party  basis  to  customers  of  financial
institutions  such  as  banks, thrifts, and credit  unions.   RTS  Financial
Advisors  offer the full range of securities products and services  of  RJA.
RTS  offices  have the independence to set their own commissions  on  agency
business  within  the regulatory guidelines.  Like IM&R,  RTS  branches  and
their  registered  Financial Advisors may offer non-securities  products  or
services to clients outside of their relationship with RTS.

      During  fiscal 1999, IM&R and RTS will be merged into a single entity,
Raymond  James  Financial Services, Inc. ("RJFS")and will  conduct  business
under that name.  The firms will initially operate as separate divisions  of
RJFS.

                                      

      Clients' transactions in securities are effected on either a  cash  or
margin  basis.   In margin transactions, the client pays a  portion  of  the
purchase  price,  and  RJA  makes a loan to  the  client  for  the  balance,
collateralized by the securities purchased or by other securities  owned  by
the  client.   Interest  is charged to clients on  the  amount  borrowed  to
finance  margin  transactions.  The financing  of  margin  purchases  is  an
important  source  of revenue to RJA, since the interest rate  paid  by  the
client  on  funds loaned by RJA exceeds RJA's cost of short-term funds.  The
interest  rate charged to a client on a margin loan depends on  the  average
loan  balance in the client's account and ranges from prime plus 1% to prime
minus .75%.

      Typically, broker-dealers utilize secured bank borrowings  and  equity
capital  as the primary sources of funds to finance clients' margin  account
borrowings.   Since the inception of the Client Interest  Program  in  1981,
however,  the  Company's primary source of funds to finance clients'  margin
account  balances  has  been cash balances in clients'  accounts  which  are
awaiting  investment.   In  addition, pursuant to  written  agreements  with
clients,  broker-dealers are permitted by Securities and Exchange Commission
("SEC") and NYSE rules to lend client securities in margin accounts to other
brokers.   SEC  regulations, however, restrict the  use  of  clients'  funds
derived  from  pledging and lending clients' securities, as  well  as  funds
awaiting investment, to the financing of margin account balances, and to the
extent  not  so used, such funds are required to be deposited in  a  special
account   for  the  benefit  of  clients.   The  regulations  also   require
broker-dealers, within designated periods of time, to obtain  possession  or
control  of,  and  to  segregate, clients'  fully  paid  and  excess  margin
securities.
                                      
                                      
                       Planning Corporation of America

      Planning Corporation of America ("PCA"), a wholly-owned subsidiary  of
RJA,  is  a  general insurance agency and represents a number  of  insurance
companies.   Through  the Financial Advisors of the Company's  broker-dealer
subsidiaries, PCA provides product and marketing support for a  broad  range
of  insurance  products, principally fixed and variable annuities,  numerous
forms of life insurance, disability insurance and long-term care coverage.

                         INSTITUTIONAL DISTRIBUTION
                         --------------------------

       The   Company's   institutional  clients  are  serviced   by   RJA's
Institutional Equity and Fixed Income departments.

      The  53  professionals  in the Institutional Equity  Sales  and  Sales
Trading  Departments  maintain relationships  with  over  800  institutional
clients.  In  addition to the Company's headquarters in St. Petersburg,  FL,
institutional  equity  offices are located in  New  York,  Houston,  Dallas,
Princeton,  San  Diego,  Toronto,  Calgary,  Brussels,  Dusseldorf,  Geneva,
London,  Luxembourg, and Paris.  A large percentage of their trades  involve
stocks under coverage by the RJA Research Department.

      In addition, RJA distributes to its institutional clients both taxable
and  tax-exempt  fixed  income  products,  primarily  municipal,  corporate,
government   agency  and  mortgage-backed  bonds.   RJA  carries   inventory
positions  of  taxable  and municipal securities in  both  the  primary  and
secondary market. In addition to St. Petersburg, the Fixed Income Department
maintains  institutional sales and trading offices  in  New  York,  Chicago,
Houston,  Boston,  Atlanta, Boca Raton, and Dublin,  Ohio.   To  assist  our
institutional clients, the department's Fixed Income Research Group provides
value-added  analytical services and publishes research  reports  containing
both specific product information and information on topics of interest such
as market and regulatory developments.

       In providing these securities brokerage services to its institutional
clients,  RJA  discounts  its  commissions  substantially  on  institutional
transactions  based  on  trade  size and the amount  of  business  conducted
annually with each institution.

                                      

     The revenues and costs of RJA's back office operations are attributable
primarily  to  the  two  distribution  segments  above.   RJA's  operations/
administrative  personnel  are  responsible for  the  execution  of  orders,
processing   of  securities  transactions,  custody  of  client  securities,
receipt,  identification  and delivery of funds and  securities,  compliance
with  regulatory and legal requirements, internal financial  accounting  and

operations.

                     INVESTMENT BANKING/CAPITAL MARKETS
                     ----------------------------------

      Investment  Banking activities include both equity and  fixed  income
products. This segment consists of the departments described below:

      Investment  Banking Group.  The 60 professionals of  RJA's  Investment
Banking Group, located primarily in St. Petersburg with satellite offices in
New  York,  Dallas,  Houston, and Calgary, are  involved  in  a  variety  of
activities  including  public  and private equity  financing  for  corporate
clients,  merger  and acquisition advisory services, fairness  opinions  and
evaluations.  The Company focuses on specific industry groups  or  strategic
business units ("SBUs") including Consumer, Financial and Business Services,
Healthcare, Information Technology,  Environmental Real Estate, and Energy.

      In  addition, RJA acts as an underwriter or selling group member  for
corporate bonds, agency bonds, preferred stock and unit investment  trusts.
When  underwriting new issue securities, RJA agrees to purchase  the  issue
through a negotiated sale or submits a competitive bid.

      Research  Department.   The  38 analysts in  this  department  publish
research on over 360 companies, primarily focused on emerging growth and mid-
cap  companies in a broad range of industries. Proprietary research  reports
are  provided to both retail and institutional clients, and are supplemented
by  research purchased from outside services to accommodate retail  clients.
This  department  has distinguished itself through its extremely  successful
long-term comparative results as reported by Zacks Investment Research  each
quarter in the Wall Street Journal.

      Over-the-Counter Equity Trading. Trading securities in  the  over-the-
counter  ("OTC") market involves the purchase of securities  from,  and  the
sale  of securities to, clients of the Company or other dealers who  may  be
purchasing  or selling securities for their own account or acting  as  agent
for  their clients.  Profits and losses are derived from the spreads between
bid and asked prices, as well as market trends for the individual securities
during  the holding period. At September 25, 1998, RJA made markets in  over
250  common  stocks in the OTC market. RJA frequently acts as agent  in  the
execution  of OTC orders for its clients and as such transacts these  trades
with other dealers.  When RJA receives a client order in a security in which
it makes a market, it may act as principal as long as it matches or improves
upon  the  best  price  in the dealer market, plus or  minus  a  mark-up  or
mark-down  not exceeding the equivalent agency commission charge.   Recently
adopted  regulations require that client limit orders be satisfied prior  to
the  brokerage firm buying securities into or selling securities from  their
own inventory at the same price.

       Syndicate  Department.   The  Syndicate  Department  coordinates  the
marketing,  distribution, pricing and stabilization of Raymond James'  lead-
and  co-managed equity underwritings. In addition to Raymond James'  managed
and  co-managed offerings, this department coordinates the firm's  syndicate
and  selling  group activities in transactions managed by  other  investment
banking  firms.  Marketing and distribution activities are  focused  on  the
firm's  institutional and retail clients. The Syndicate department  is  also
responsible for the Corporate Client Services group which serves the  firm's
Investment  Banking and Research clients by providing specialized  brokerage
services for corporations and their executives.

      Public  Finance.  The 21 professionals in the Public Finance  division
operate out of 7 offices (4 located throughout the State of Florida, one  in
Birmingham,  AL, one in New York, NY, and one in Pittsburg, PA),  acting  as
Financial  Advisor or underwriter to various municipal agencies or political
subdivisions.
                                      
     Partnership Investment Banking.  The Company acts as the general
partner in equipment leasing and real estate limited partnerships.  Most 
significantly, Raymond James Tax Credit Funds, Inc. is the general partner
in funds that have invested nationwide in properties that qualify for low
income housing tax credits.



                              ASSET MANAGEMENT
                              ----------------

      The  Company's  asset management segment includes  proprietary  asset
management  operations, internally sponsored mutual  funds,  outside  money
management alternatives, and other asset-based fee programs.

                        Eagle Asset Management, Inc.

      Eagle  is  a  registered  investment advisor with  approximately  $4.8
billion  under  management at September 25, 1998.  Eagle's  clients  include
pension and profit sharing plans, retirement funds, foundations, endowments,
trusts  and individuals.  Accounts are managed on a discretionary  basis  in
accordance with the investment objective(s) specified by the client.   Eagle
manages  approximately $1 billion for institutional clients and $3.8 billion
for retail accounts.

      Eagle's  investment management fee generally ranges from .25%-1.0%  of
asset balances per year depending upon the size and investment objective  of
the account. In addition to the management fees, clients are required to pay
brokerage  commissions  (or  more commonly,  a  fee  in  lieu  thereof)  for
transactions in their account.

                       Heritage Asset Management, Inc.
                                      
      Heritage  Asset  Management, Inc. ("Heritage")  serves  as  investment
advisor  to  the Heritage Family of Mutual Funds.  Heritage also  serves  as
transfer  agent or sub-transfer agent for all of the open-end funds  and  as
fund  accountant  or sub-fund accountant for all Heritage funds  except  the
Eagle  International Equity Portfolio. Portfolio management for the  Income-
Growth  Trust,  Aggressive Growth Fund, Growth Equity Fund, Mid  Cap  Growth
Fund,  Value  Equity Fund, and the First Puerto Rico Growth and Income  Fund
are  subcontracted.  Portfolio management for the Small Cap  Stock  Fund  is
subcontracted  to Eagle and the Company's Awad Asset Management  subsidiary.
Unaffiliated  advisors  are employed for the Municipal  Money  Market  Fund,
Capital Appreciation Trust, High Yield Bond Fund and the Eagle International
Equity Portfolio.

      Heritage  also  serves as an advisor to Raymond James  Bank  to  make
recommendations  and monitor the Bank's investment portfolio  of  mortgage-
backed securities.

                                                      ==========

                         Awad Asset Management, Inc.

      Awad  Asset Management, Inc. ("Awad") is primarily a small and mid-cap
equity portfolio management subsidiary.  Clients pay fees and/or commissions
for  management of their accounts.  Present fees range from .5% to  1.0%  of
asset balances annually.  In addition to private accounts, Awad also manages
a  portion  of  the Heritage Small Cap Stock Fund Portfolio and  other  non-
affiliated mutual fund portfolios. Exclusive of the Heritage Small Cap Fund,
Awad had approximately $656 million under management at September 25, 1998.

                       RJA - Asset Management Services

      RJA's  Asset  Management Services ("AMS") department manages  programs
which offer investment advisory services to clients, as well as certain non-
advisory   programs  which  offer  fee-based  alternatives  to   traditional
commission  charges for transactions.  The primary advisory service  offered
by  AMS is the Investment Advisory Services ("IAS") program.  IAS  maintains
an approved list of investment managers, most of which are unaffiliated with
the  Company,  establishes  custodial facilities,  monitors  performance  of
client  accounts, provides clients with accounting and other  administrative
services  and  assists investment managers with certain  trading  management
activities.   IAS  earns  fees  generally ranging  from  .5%-1.0%  of  asset
balances  per  annum, a portion of which is paid to investment managers  who
direct the investment of the clients' accounts. At September 25, 1998,  this
program  had  approximately $1.8 billion in assets under management  through
agreements with 24 independent investment advisors and Awad, which  is  also
offered through this program.

      Passport and a similar program offered by IM&R, known as IMPAC,  offer
both  a  discretionary and  non-discretionary advisory fee alternative  that
allows  clients to pay a quarterly fee plus low transaction charges in  lieu
of  commissions.  Fees are based on the individual account size and are also
dependent  on  the  type of securities in the accounts.   In  addition,  AMS
collects  an  administrative fee of up to .175% of asset balances  annually,
for   which  clients  receive  quarterly  performance  reporting  and  other
services.   As  of September 25, 1998, Passport and IMPAC had  approximately
$3.55  billion  and  $592  million  in  assets,  respectively,  serviced  by
Financial Advisors.

      In  addition  to  the foregoing programs, AMS also  offers  fee  based
programs  to  clients who have contracted for portfolio management  services
from  outside  money  managers that are not  a  part  of  the  IAS  program.
Further, AMS administers other less significant asset-based fee programs.

                     Raymond James Realty Advisors, Inc.

      The  Company's Raymond James Realty Advisors subsidiary had  become  a
recognized  manager  of  real estate portfolios for  institutional  clients.
During  1998 this portfolio management operation was sold, and its employees
were transferred to the new owner.

                                    OTHER
                                    -----

      Aside  from  the  retail  and institutional distribution,  investment
banking  and  asset  management businesses, the Company  operates  a  stock
borrow/stock loan program, offers bank and trust services, and has  several
international joint ventures.  These operations are grouped in the  "other"
segment.

                        RJA - Stock Borrow/Stock Loan

      RJA  commenced this program in July 1987, involving the borrowing  and
lending of securities from and to other broker-dealers.  RJA generally  acts
as  an intermediary between broker-dealers and other financial institutions,
where  it borrows from one party and lends to another.  The borrower of  the
securities puts up a cash deposit, commonly 102% of the market value of  the
securities.   This  deposit, which is adjusted daily to reflect  changes  in
current market value, earns interest at a negotiated rate.

                           Raymond James Bank, FSB

      Raymond James Bank, FSB, ("RJBank") received its federal savings  bank
charter on May 6, 1994. RJBank provides residential and commercial loans and
FDIC-insured deposit accounts to clients of RJF's broker-dealer subsidiaries
and to the general public.

      Access  to  RJBank's  products and services  is  available  nationwide
through  the offices of its affiliated investment firms as well  as  through
convenient telephonic and electronic banking services, including ATM, point-
of-sale,  24-hour  TeleDirect  automated  telephone  banking,  checkwriting,
direct deposit and ACH payments.  As of September 30, 1998, RJBank had total
assets in excess of $500 million.

                         Raymond James Trust Company
                             Sound Trust Company

      Raymond  James  Trust Company was chartered in  1992  and  opened  for
business in September 1992.  This wholly-owned subsidiary of RJF was  formed
primarily  to  provide personal trust services to existing  clients  of  the
broker-dealer subsidiaries.  Portfolio management of trust assets  is  often
subcontracted to the asset management operations of the Company.  In October
1993,  the Company acquired a second trust company, Sound Trust Company,  in
Tacoma,  Washington.   This  subsidiary  provides  personal  trust  services
primarily to broker-dealer clients outside the State of Florida.  These  two
subsidiaries  had  a  combined total of $501 million  in  client  assets  at
September 25, 1998.

                      Raymond James Credit Corporation

      Raymond  James Credit Corporation ("RJCC") was formed  in  1996  as  a
regulated  finance company. To date, this subsidiary has primarily  provided
loans  collateralized by control or restricted securities.  RJCC  is  funded
with  internal capital and by a $50 million line of credit with a commercial
bank. At September 25, 1998, RJCC had $45 million in outstanding loans.

                 Raymond James International Holdings, Inc.

      Raymond  James  International Holdings,  Inc.("RJIH")  is  a  Delaware
corporation  formed  in 1994 to house the Company's foreign  operations.  To
date, such operations have consisted of brokerage and asset management joint
venture investments in India, South Africa, and France.  Raymond James Latin
American Holdings, Inc. ("RJLAH") has been formed as a subsidiary of RJIH to
act  as  a  holding  company for investments and  joint  ventures  in  South
America.   In October 1998, RJLAH became a joint venture partner in  Raymond
James Argentina Sociedad de Bolsa SA, which will provide brokerage services,
investment banking, investment advisory and private banking services.

      In  addition, the "other" segment includes earnings on corporate  cash
and several immaterial operations.

                                 COMPETITION

     The Company's subsidiaries compete with many larger, better capitalized
providers of financial services, including other securities firms,  some  of
which  are  affiliated  with major financial services  companies,  insurance
companies, banking institutions and other organizations.  They also  compete
with  a  number of firms offering discount brokerage services, usually  with
lower  levels of service, to individual clients.  The Company's subsidiaries
compete principally on the basis of service, product selection, location and
reputation in local markets.

                                 REGULATION

     Most of the Company's operations are subject to regulatory oversight by
governmental agencies and/or self regulatory organizations.

      The  securities industry in the United States is subject to  extensive
regulation  under  federal and state laws.  The SEC is  the  federal  agency
charged  with administration of the federal securities laws.   Much  of  the
regulation of broker-dealers, however, has been delegated to self-regulatory
organizations,  principally  the NASD and the NYSE.   These  self-regulatory
organizations  adopt rules (which are subject to approval by  the  SEC)  for
governing  the industry and conduct periodic examinations of member  broker-
dealers.   Securities  firms  are  also  subject  to  regulation  by   state
securities  commissions in the states in which they  are  registered.   RJA,
IM&R and RTS are currently registered in all 50 states.

      See  Notes 12 and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for  further  description of certain SEC regulations pertaining to,  broker-
dealer Net Capital and Reserve Requirements.

      The  Company's investment advisory operations, including  the  Company-
sponsored mutual funds, are also subject to extensive regulation by the SEC.

      Raymond  James  Bank, FSB, is subject to regulation by various  federal
banking  agencies, including the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation.

      The  Company's  two trust companies are subject to  regulation  by  the
states in which they are chartered.

ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES
          ----------

      The Company owns a 610,000 square foot headquarters complex (three home
office  buildings, a bank and trust headquarters building, and  a  five  deck
parking  garage). The complex covers approximately forty-five acres, and  the
Company  has the ability to build up to another 260,000 square feet  on  this
site.   In addition, the Company leases 70,000 square feet in a nearby office
building.   With the exception of a Company-owned RJA branch office  building
in  Crystal River, FL, RJA branches are leased with various expiration  dates
through  2008.   The  IM&R  headquarters office in Atlanta  and  Sound  Trust
Company facility in Seattle are also under lease.  See Note 9 to Consolidated
Financial Statements for further information regarding the Company's leases.

      Leases for branch offices of IM&R and RTS are the responsibility of the
respective independent contractor registered representatives.


ITEM 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
          -----------------

      The  Company  is  a  defendant  or  co-defendant  in  various  lawsuits
incidental  to  its  securities  business.  The  Company  is  contesting  the
allegations  of  the complaints in these cases and believes  that  there  are
meritorious  defenses in each of these lawsuits.  In view of the  number  and
diversity of claims against the Company, the number of jurisdictions in which
litigation  is pending and the inherent difficulty of predicting the  outcome
of  litigation and other claims, the Company cannot state with certainty what
the eventual outcome of pending litigation or other claims will be.

     As  a result of the extensive regulation of the securities industry, the
Company's  broker-dealer  subsidiaries are subject  to  regular  reviews  and
inspections by regulatory authorities and self regulatory organizations which
can result in imposition of sanctions for regulatory violations, ranging from
non-monetary  censure to fines and, in serious cases, temporary or  permanent
suspension from business.  In addition, from time to time regulatory agencies
and  self  regulatory  organizations institute investigations  into  industry
practices  which can result in the imposition of such sanctions.  During  the
course   of  the  past  fiscal  year,  the  Company's  primary  broker-dealer
subsidiary resolved a number of regulatory and self regulatory investigations
by payment of fines that were immaterial in amount.
     
     The Securities and Exchange Commission has initiated an investigation of
certain  trading practices in the over-the-counter securities  market  during
1994  and  1995.   Along  with  many other market  makers,  the  Company  has
submitted documents and cooperated with the S.E.C. in this investigation. The
Company does not anticipate that the resolution of this proceeding will  have
a material effect on its business or operations.  The Securities and Exchange
Commission,  the  Internal Revenue Service, and the National  Association  of
Securities Dealers, Inc., have been conducting reviews of investment  banking
practices   in   connection   with   advance   refunding   transactions   for
municipalities.   The  investigation has focused on the mark-ups  charged  by
investment  banking  firms  for  securities purchased  by  municipalities  in
connection  with  these  refundings.  Along with other  participants  in  the
municipal  bond  market,  the  Company  has  been  providing  documents   and
furnishing  information to regulators in connection with this  investigation,
which is ongoing.
     
      In  the  opinion of management, based on discussions with counsel,  the
outcome of these matters will not result in a material adverse effect on  the
financial position or results of operations of the Company.

           Since  the Company initiated payment of a cash dividend  in  1985,
there  have  been 16 increases in the dividend rate, 7 of which were  in  the
form  of  stock splits and stock dividends.  The dividend rate following  the
April 2, 1998 stock split was $.06 per quarter.

     The payment of dividends on the Company's common stock is subject to the
availability of funds from the Company's subsidiaries, including the  broker-
dealer  subsidiaries  which  may be subject to  restrictions  under  the  net
capital  rules of the SEC and the NYSE.  Such restrictions have never  become
applicable with respect to the Company's dividend payments.  (See Note 12  of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

      At  December  10, 1998 there were approximately 10,000 holders  of  the
Company's common stock.

     ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
              -------------------------------------------------------------
              AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
              -----------------------


Results of Operations - Three Years Ended September 25, 1998
- ------------------------------------------------------------

      Fiscal  1998  was the Company's fourteenth consecutive year  of  record
revenues,  surpassing the $1 billion mark for the first time. Total  revenues
of  $1,083,000,000 represented an increase of 17% over the prior year, and an
even  more  impressive  21% increase when the 1997 results  are  adjusted  to
exclude  the one-time gain from the sale of the Company's interest in Liberty
Investment  Management,  Inc. ("Liberty") as described  in  Note  16  to  the
Consolidated   Financial   Statements.  Similarly,   reported   earnings   of
$92,700,000 indicate a decline of 6% from the prior year.  However, excluding
the  prior  year gain from the Liberty sale, earnings established  a  record,
rising 16%.

      The  first nine months of fiscal 1998 continued the extremely favorable
market  trends  of  the prior two fiscal years. A slowdown  occurred  in  the
fourth  quarter,  however, as equity markets suffered a  steep  decline.  The
Company's continued focus on non-transaction dependent fee revenues, such  as
investment  advisory fees, interest and asset-based commission  alternatives,
helped the Company achieve relatively consistent results in a volatile market
environment.   For   fiscal   1998,  such  fee-based   revenues   represented
approximately 40% of total revenues.

      The  record  transaction volumes in fiscal years 1998,  1997  and  1996
resulted  in  increased securities commissions from the sales of all  product
lines during the period, with the largest absolute increase occuring in sales
of  mutual  funds. While the retail sales force has experienced  double-digit
annual  growth  in  headcount since fiscal 1996, as  illustrated  below,  the
increased  productivity  of  existing Financial Advisors  has  been  an  even
greater factor in the growth of commission revenues.

       Investment  banking  revenues,  including  new  issue  sales  credits,
decreased  nominally to $108 million in 1998 from the record $109 million  in
the  prior  year.  Fiscal years 1997 and 1996 were record  years  for  equity
underwriting  activity,  both in number of new issues  and  average  offering
size.  This  pace  continued only through the first half of fiscal  1998,  at
which  time small and mid-cap stocks began to weaken, particularly in certain
industry  sectors, which slowed and eventually curtailed the new  issue  deal
flow.   The number of managed and co-managed underwritings, the vast majority
of  which  were  equity-related offerings, and the  dollar  volume  of  these
transactions were as follows: 1998 - 57 new issues for $6.0 billion;  1997  -
65  new  issues for $7.8 billion; and 1996 - 38 new issues for $2.7  billion.
Merger and acquisition fees, although a less significant component, have been
a  consistent revenue source during the past few years, reaching a record $20
million in 1998.

      Investment  advisory fees have risen commensurate  with  the  generally
strong  growth in assets under management.  Exclusive of the Liberty effects,
financial  assets under management suffered their first quarterly decline  in
nearly four years during the September 1998 quarter, but still showed  a  22%
increase  for the fiscal year. Fee revenues increased at a much greater  rate
as  the  asset  decline occurred near the end of the year.  Asset  management
growth  has  benefited from both overall asset appreciation  and  record  net
sales  during  the  past  two years.  For fiscal 1997  and  1996,  investment
advisory fees included $2.6 million and $9.7 million, respectively,  in  fees
from  Liberty, which was sold in January 1997. Since 1995, real estate assets
under  management had been increasing significantly as the Company's  Raymond
James  Realty  Advisors  subsidiary  had  become  a  recognized  manager   of
institutional  real estate portfolios. During 1998 this portfolio  management
operation  was  sold, and its employees were transferred to  the  new  owner.
This  transaction  generated   $3.7 million of  performance  fees  which  are
included in investment advisory fees.

      Net  trading profits declined 51% from the prior year, primarily  as  a
result of the changes in the over-the-counter equity trading regulations  and
practices.  These changes have virtually eliminated the gross equity  trading
profits and the Company expects that flat or negative over-the-counter equity
trading  results  will  be the norm, not the exception.   In  the  past,  the
Company's  trading  profits  had  remained  relatively  consistent,   derived
primarily  from client order flow in both over-the-counter equity  and  fixed
income securities.

      The  growth  in the Company's retail client base during  the  past  two
fiscal  years has led to increased financial service fees. There has been  an
80%  increase  in the number of IRA accounts, a 53% increase in money  market
processing  fees,  a  40%  increase  in  postage  and  service  charges   for
transactions  processed and a 135% increase in transaction fees arising  from
the  Company's  retail  asset-based  fee account  programs,  an  increasingly
popular alternative to the traditional commission-based pricing structure.

      Fiscal 1998's other income includes $1.7 million related to the sale of
the  real  estate  portfolio and property management  subsidiaries  and  $2.4
million  from the sale of the Company's specialist operations on the  Chicago
Exchange.  Other income in fiscal 1997 includes a gain of $2.5  million  from
the Company's sale of its former headquarters building. For the first half of
1998  and  in previous years, other income includes property management  fees
from  the operations which were sold by the Company in March 1998. These fees
had  been  increasing  substantially through  the  years  as  the  number  of
apartment units under management increased.

     Sales commission expense increased at a rate approximately proportionate
to  the related revenues, with the slight variance being attributable to  the
mix of independent contractor and employee Financial Advisors and the bracket
creep associated with higher average production.

      Administrative and benefit compensation costs have been increasing at a
rate  consistent  with  the growth in total revenues.  The  total  number  of
employees  has  increased over 40% in the past three  years,  with  the  most
significant increase occurring in the information systems area.

      Incentive  compensation expenses are based on departmental,  subsidiary
and  firm-wide profitability.  Record underwriting activity in 1997  resulted
in  a dramatic increase in investment banking departmental profits, having  a
significant impact on incentive compensation.  These revenues and the related
incentive compensation were basically flat from 1997 to 1998.

      The  continuing increases in communications and information  processing
expense in fiscal 1998 and 1997 reflect the costs of further enhancement  and
expansion  of the Company's systems of internal communication and information
dissemination, as well as higher general business volume which gave  rise  to
increased costs for telephone, printing and supplies.

      The completion and occupancy of the third headquarters building in  the
spring  of  1998 gave rise to much of the increased occupancy  and  equipment
expenses for that year.  The increase in occupancy and equipment expense from
fiscal 1996 to 1997 is predominantly the increased depreciation on additional
information  processing  equipment,  as  well  as  expenses  associated  with
upgraded retail office space and Financial Advisor workstations over the past
two years.

      Clearing and floor brokerage expense has not increased in proportion to
related revenues due to the increased productivity of floor brokers and other
cost saving measures implemented over the period.

     Business development expenses rose dramatically in 1998 due to increased
advertising,  both  to  recruit Financial Advisors and  increase  brand  name
recognition;  increased  travel  and related expenses,  particularly  by  the
larger  staff  of investment bankers and research analysts; the inception  of
the  stadium  naming  rights  contract;  and  costs  associated  with  larger
conferences  throughout the Company's operations. The increase  in  1997  was
proportionate  to the increase in total revenues and reflects the  growth  of
most of the same items.

     While the Company was able to hold other expenses relatively constant in
1998,  these  expenses increased from 1996 to 1997 at a  pace  equal  to  the
growth  in revenues. These expenses include fees paid to outside managers  in
the  Company's  investment advisory services program, bank  service  charges,
legal expenses and provisions, and various state taxes.

Year 2000
- ---------

      The  widespread  use of computer programs that rely on  two-digit  date
programs  to  perform  computations and decision-making functions  may  cause
computer  systems  to  malfunction in the year 2000 and lead  to  significant
business delays and disruptions in the U.S. and internationally.

      The  Company  has  revised  all critical  information  technology  (IT)
internal  computer code that it has identified as requiring modification  for
Year  2000 compliance, and will begin full integration testing of the revised
code during the first quarter of fiscal 1999. All of the Company's securities
transactions  are  processed  on  software provided  by  Securities  Industry
Software  (SIS),  a subsidiary of Automatic Data Processing,  Inc.,  and  the
Company  is closely monitoring the progress of SIS in revising its  software.
Based  on  information received to date, the Company believes that  SIS  will
complete revision and testing of its software on a timely basis.  The Company
is  also  monitoring information received from third-party vendors  regarding
their progress in modification of other software used by the Company, as well
as the progress of other industry suppliers, in addressing this issue.

      With  respect  to  non-IT  systems,  primarily  those  located  at  its
headquarters  campus  and  those  provided  by  its  telecommunications   and
satellite service providers, the Company has completed the inventory  of  all
systems and has begun the process of confirming the compliance status of  its
vendors.  Most of these vendors are major national or international companies
which  have  been addressing the Year 2000 issue for some time.  The  Company
expects to complete this process of third-party review by August of 1999.

      With  the  exception  of those discussed below, all  of  the  Company's
subsidiaries  are  substantially  dependent  upon  the  Company's  Year  2000
compliance  program.   Raymond James Bank, Raymond James  Trust  Company  and
Heritage Asset Management, Inc. have received revised computer software  from
the third-party vendors on whom they are dependent and have begun the testing
process,  which  they anticipate will be completed by June of  1999.    Eagle
Asset Management, Inc. has completed assessment and inventory of its critical
IT requirements and is presently installing a new portfolio management system
which  has been designed to be Year 2000 compliant.  Installation is expected
to  be  completed by April of 1999 and system testing completed  by  July  of
1999.

      The  Company  will  begin the process of developing  contingency  plans
during the second fiscal quarter.

      The securities industry is scheduled to begin industry-wide testing for
Year  2000  compliance during the spring of 1999 and the Company  anticipates
that  it  will  be  ready to participate in that testing program  as  it  has
completed  virtually all of its internal programming.  To date, the Company's
costs  in making system modifications have not been material and the  Company
does  not  believe that remaining costs will have a material  impact  on  the
Company's operations in fiscal 1999.

      The impact of this problem on the securities industry will be material,
however,  since  virtually every aspect of the sale  of  securities  and  the
processing of transactions will be affected.  Due to the enormous task facing
the   securities  industry,  and  the  interdependent  nature  of  securities
transactions,  the Company may be adversely affected by this problem  in  the
Year 2000 depending on whether it and the entities with whom it does business
address this issue successfully.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
- -------------------------------

      Net  cash  from operating activities during the current year  was  $448
million.   Cash  was  generated by increased client balances  in  the  client
interest  program  net  of  increased  customer  margin  balances   and   the
fluctuations in various asset and liability accounts.

     Investing activities required $118 million during the year. Additions to
fixed  assets  consumed  $46  million, of which $27.8  million  was  for  the
construction  of  new  buildings at the headquarters complex,  the  remainder
being  for  the  purchase of computers, office furniture and equipment.   Net
purchases, sales and maturations of investments consumed $72 million.   These
investments  were primarily mortgage-backed securities purchased  by  Raymond
James Bank, FSB ("RJ Bank").

      Financing  activities  provided $25 million, the  result  of  increased
mortgage  financing  and  the exercise of stock options  and  employee  stock
purchases, net of cash dividends paid and repurchases of the Company's common
stock.

      The  Company has loans payable consisting of debt in the amount of  $40
million in the form of a mortgage on its headquarters office complex and a $5
million Federal Home Loan Bank advance at RJ Bank.  The Company refinanced an
existing  mortgage and obtained additional financing after the completion  of
the third headquarters building for a total mortgage amount of $40 million.

      The  parent  company  has a commitment from  a  national  bank  for  an
unsecured  $50  million  line of credit for general  corporate  purposes.  In
addition,  Raymond  James & Associates, Inc. has uncommitted  bank  lines  of
credit aggregating $310 million.

      The Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to requirements of
the   SEC  relating  to  liquidity  and  capital  standards  (see  Notes   to
Consolidated Financial Statements).

Effects of Recently Issued Accounting Standards
- -----------------------------------------------

      During  June  1997  the Financial Accounting Standards  Board  ("FASB")
issued Statement No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income," ("FAS 130") which
requires  entities to report changes in equity that result from  transactions
and economic events other than those with shareholders.  The standard divides
comprehensive  income  into  "net income" and "other  comprehensive  income."
Other  comprehensive income includes available-for-sale items.   The  Company
will  be  required to present comprehensive income beginning in fiscal  1999.
Disclosure requirements will include showing aggregate net income plus  other
comprehensive income adjustments in either a separate statement or below  net
income in the statement of operations. The impact of adopting FAS 130 is  not
anticipated to have a material effect on the Company's financial position  or
results of operations.

      Also  during fiscal 1998, the FASB issued statement No. 133 "Accounting
for  Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."  This standard  requires
that   derivatives  be  recognized  in  the  balance  sheet  at  fair  value.
Designation as hedges of specific assets or liabilities is permitted only  if
certain  conditions are met.  Effective in fiscal 2000, the Company  will  be
required  to  record and mark to market any derivative financial  instruments
and  related  underlying assets, liabilities and firm commitments.  Based  on
current operations, there should be minimal impact on the Company's financial
statements.

Market Risk
- -----------

      During fiscal 1997 the Securities and Exchange Commission issued market
risk  disclosure  requirements to enhance disclosures of accounting  policies
for  derivatives and other financial instruments and to provide  quantitative
and  qualitative  disclosures about market risk inherent in  derivatives  and
other  financial  instruments. The Company manages  risk  exposure  involving
various  levels  of  management.   Position limits in trading  and  inventory
accounts  are  established and monitored on an ongoing  basis.   Current  and
proposed  underwriting,  corporate development, merchant  banking  and  other
commitments  are  subject to due diligence reviews by senior  management,  as
well as professionals in the appropriate business and support units involved.
Credit  risk  related  to  various financing activities  is  reduced  by  the
industry  practice  of  obtaining and maintaining  collateral.   The  Company
monitors its exposure to counterparty risk through the use of credit exposure
information,  the  monitoring of collateral values and the  establishment  of
credit limits.

      The  Company  maintains  inventories as  detailed  in  Note  2  to  the
Consolidated  Financial Statements.  The fair value of  these  securities  at
September  25, 1998, was $106 million in long positions and $31  million   in
short  positions.   The  Company performed an  entity-wide  analysis  of  the
Company's financial instruments and assessed the related risk and materiality
in  accordance  with the rules.  Based on this analysis, in  the  opinion  of
management,   the  market  risk  associated  with  the  Company's   financial
instruments at September 25, 1998 will not have a material adverse effect  on
the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the Company.

Effects of Inflation
- --------------------

      The  Company's  assets  are primarily liquid  in  nature  and  are  not
significantly   affected  by  inflation.   Management   believes   that   the
replacement  cost  of  property and equipment  would  not  materially  affect
operating  results.  However,  the rate of inflation  affects  the  Company's
expenses,  including  employee  compensation, communications  and  occupancy,
which may not be readily recoverable through charges for services provided by
the Company.

Factors Affecting "Forward-Looking Statements"
- ----------------------------------------------

      From time to time, the Company may publish "forward-looking statements"
within  the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
and  Section  21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,  or
make  oral  statements  that  constitute forward-looking  statements.   These
forward-looking  statements  may  relate  to  such  matters  as   anticipated
financial  performance  future  revenues  or  earnings,  business  prospects,
projected ventures, new products, anticipated market performance, and similar
matters.   The  Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995  provides  a
safe  harbor  for  forward-looking statements.  In order to comply  with  the
terms  of  the  safe harbor, the Company cautions readers that a  variety  of
factors  could  cause the Company's actual results to differ materially  from
the  anticipated  results or other expectations expressed  in  the  Company's
forward-looking statements.  These risks and uncertainties, many of which are
beyond  the  Company's  control,  include,  but  are  not  limited  to:   (i)
transaction  volume  in the securities markets, (ii) the  volatility  of  the
securities  markets, (iii) fluctuations in interest rates,  (iv)  changes  in
regulatory  requirements which could affect the cost of doing  business,  (v)
fluctuations  in  currency  rates,  (vi) general  economic  conditions,  both
domestic  and  international, (vii) changes in  the  rate  of  inflation  and
related  impact  on  securities  markets, (viii)  competition  from  existing
financial institutions and other new participants in the securities  markets,
(ix) legal developments affecting the litigation experience of the securities
industry,  and (x) changes in federal and state tax laws which  could  affect
the  popularity  of  products  sold by the Company.   The  Company  does  not
undertake  any  obligation to publicly update or revise  any  forward-looking
statements.

               REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
               --------------------------------------------------

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Raymond James Financial, Inc.

In our opinion, based upon our audits and the report of other auditors, the
accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  listed  in   the   index
appearing  on  page  F-1  present fairly, in  all  material  respects,  the
financial position of Raymond James Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries at
September  25,  1998  and  September 26, 1997, and  the  results  of  their
operations  and their cash flows for each of the three years in the  period
ended  September 25, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.  These  financial  statements are  the  responsibility  of  the
Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on  these
financial  statements based on our audits.  We did not audit the  financial
statements  of  Raymond James Bank, FSB, a wholly-owned  subsidiary,  which
statements  reflect  total  assets  of  $510,580,000  and  $328,519,000  at
September 25, 1998 and September 26, 1997, respectively, and total revenues
of  $23,199,000, $17,712,000 and $12,121,000 for each of the three years in
the  period  ended September 25, 1998.  Those statements  were  audited  by
other  auditors  whose report thereon has been furnished  to  us,  and  our
opinion expressed herein, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for
Raymond  James  Bank,  FSB, is based solely on  the  report  of  the  other
auditors.  We conducted our audits of the consolidated financial statements
in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which require that
we  plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the  financial  statements  are free of material  misstatement.   An  audit
includes  examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the  amounts  and
disclosures   in   the  financial  statements,  assessing  the   accounting
principles   used  and  significant  estimates  made  by  management,   and
evaluating  the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe  that
our  audits and the report of other auditors provide a reasonable basis for
the opinion expressed above.

               RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
               ----------------------------------------------
                 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
                 ------------------------------------------

      Raymond  James Financial, Inc. is a holding company which, through  its
subsidiaries,  is  engaged principally in the securities brokerage  business,
including the underwriting, distribution, trading and brokerage of equity and
debt  securities and the sale of mutual funds and other investment  products.
In  addition,  it  provides investment management  services  for  retail  and
institutional clients and banking and trust services for retail clients.  The
accounting  and reporting policies of Raymond James Financial, Inc.  and  its
subsidiaries  (the  "Company")  conform  to  generally  accepted   accounting
principles, the more significant of which are summarized below:

Basis of consolidation
- ----------------------

      The  consolidated financial statements include the accounts of  Raymond
James  Financial,  Inc.  and  its subsidiaries.   All  material  intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

      All consolidated subsidiaries are 100% owned by the Company except  for
RJ Properties, Inc., which is 85% owned.

Reporting period
- ----------------

      The  Company's fiscal year ends on the last Friday in September of each
year.

Recognition of revenues
- -----------------------

     Securities transactions and related commission revenues and expenses are
recorded on a trade date basis.

       Revenues  from  investment  banking  are  recorded  at  the  time  the
transaction  is completed and the related income is reasonably  determinable.
Investment  banking revenues include sales credits earned in connection  with
the  distribution  of the underwritten securities. Any warrants  received  in
connection  with  investment banking transactions are carried  at  a  nominal
value  until  such  time as the warrants are exercisable and  the  underlying
shares are salable.

     The Company earns an advisory fee based on a client's portfolio value on
portfolios  managed by its investment advisor subsidiaries.  These  fees  are
recorded under the accrual method.

Management estimates and assumptions
- ------------------------------------

      The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally  accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management   to   make
estimates  and  assumptions that affect the reported amounts  of  assets  and
liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the  date  of
the  consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts  of  revenues
and  expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ  from
those estimates.

Segment reporting
- -----------------

      In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998, the Company adopted Statement  of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 131,  "Disclosures  about  Segments  of
Enterprise and Related Information" ("FAS 131").  FAS 131 supersedes FAS  14,
"Financial  Reporting for Segments of a Business Enterprise",  replacing  the
"industry  segment" approach with the "management" approach.  The  management
approach designates the internal organization that is used by management  for
making  operating decisions and assessing performance as the  source  of  the
Company's  reportable  segments.   FAS 131 also  requires  disclosures  about
products  and services, geographic areas, and major customers.  The  adoption
of  FAS  131  did not affect the Company's financial position or  results  of
operations  but  did affect the disclosure of segment information  (see  Note
15).

Cash and cash equivalents
- -------------------------

      The  Company  considers all highly liquid investments with  an  initial
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents for purposes  of  the
consolidated statement of cash flows.  These consist primarily of  shares  of
money market funds and of U.S. Treasury Securities purchased under agreements
to resell, some of which are held in special reserve accounts, and are stated
at cost, which approximates market at fiscal yearend.

      It  is  the  Company's  policy  to obtain  possession  and  control  of
securities  purchased  under  resale  agreements.   The  net  fair  value  of
securities  purchased  under  resale agreements approximates  their  carrying
value,  as such financial instruments are predominantly short-term in nature.
The  Company monitors the risk of loss by assessing the market value  of  the
underlying  securities  as  compared to the related  receivable  or  payable,
including  accrued interest, and requests additional collateral where  deemed
appropriate.   At September 25, 1998, and September 26, 1997, there  were  no
agreements with any individual counterparties where the risk of loss exceeded
10% of shareholders' equity.

Securities owned
- ----------------

      The  trading  and investment account securities held by  the  brokerage
subsidiaries  are classified as trading.  Investment account  securities  not
readily  marketable  are  carried at estimated fair value  as  determined  by
management  with  unrealized gains and losses included in earnings.   Trading
securities are carried at market value with realized and unrealized gains and
losses included in earnings. The Company accounts for other securities  owned
in  accordance  with  Statement of Financial Accounting  Standards  No.  115,
"Accounting  for  Certain  Investments in Debt and Equity  Securities"  ("FAS
115").   FAS  115  requires investments in debt and equity securities  to  be
classified as either "held to maturity,"  "trading," or "available for sale."
The  accounting treatment for unrealized gains and losses on those securities
is  then  determined by the classification chosen. Securities  available  for
sale  are carried at estimated market value, with unrealized gains and losses
reported  as  a separate component of shareholders' equity, net  of  deferred
taxes, and realized gains and losses, determined on a specific identification
basis, included in earnings.

Property and equipment
- ----------------------

      Property, equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost  less
accumulated  depreciation.  Depreciation of assets  is  provided  principally
using  the  straight-line method for financial reporting  purposes  over  the
estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from two to seven years for
furniture  and  equipment and fifteen to thirty-one years for  buildings  and
land  improvements.  Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-
line  method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives
of the assets.  For income tax purposes,
assets are depreciated using accelerated methods.

      Additions,  improvements and expenditures for repairs  and  maintenance
that significantly extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized.  Other
expenditures  for  repairs and maintenance are charged to operations  in  the
period   incurred.   Gains  and  losses on  disposals  of  fixed  assets  are
reflected in income in the period realized.

Goodwill
- --------

      Goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated amortization.  Amortization
of  goodwill  is  provided  using  the  straight-line  method  for  financial
reporting  purposes  over  three years.  Goodwill  is  reflected  in  prepaid
expenses and other assets.

Correspondent clearing
- ----------------------

      Under  clearing agreements, the Company clears trades for  unaffiliated
correspondent brokers and retains a portion of commissions as a fee  for  its
services.   The Company records clearing charges net of commissions remitted.
Total  commissions generated by correspondents were $22,244,000,  $21,334,000
and  $18,742,000,  and commissions remitted totaled $17,815,000,  $16,832,000
and  $14,757,000 for the years ended September 25, 1998, September  26,  1997
and September 27, 1996, respectively.

Income taxes
- ------------

      The  Company  utilizes  the  asset and liability  approach  defined  in
Statement  of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for  Income
Taxes"  ("FAS 109").  FAS 109 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets
and  liabilities  for  the  expected future  tax  consequences  of  temporary
differences  between the financial statement amounts and  the  tax  bases  of
assets and liabilities.

Net income per share
- --------------------

     Net income per share is computed using weighted average common stock and
common  stock  equivalents  outstanding.  Common  stock  equivalents  include
shares  issuable  under stock options and are determined under  the  treasury
stock  method.  All per share amounts have been restated to give  retroactive
effect to the common stock dividends paid on April 2, 1998 and April 3,  1997
(see  Note  10),  as  well  as the implementation of Statement  of  Financial
Accounting Standards No. 128, "Earnings per Share" ("FAS 128").

Reclassifications

      Certain amounts from prior years have been reclassified for consistency
with current year presentation.  These reclassifications were not material to

NOTE 6 - BORROWINGS:
- --------------------

      The  Company has a mortgage note payable related to the refinancing  of
two  existing buildings at the headquarters complex and additional  financing
for a third building and adjacent parking garage completed during fiscal year
1998.   The  mortgage  requires monthly principal and  interest  payments  of
approximately  $291,000  with a balloon payment due  January  1,  2008.   The
mortgage  bears  interest  at 7.37% and is secured  by  land,  buildings  and
improvements  with  a  net book value of $50,366,000 at September  25,  1998.
Principal maturities under this mortgage note payable for the succeeding five
years  are as follows: $579,420 in 1999, $623,595 in 2000, $671,139 in  2001,
$722,307 in 2002, $777,377 in 2003 and $36,437,942 thereafter.

     The Company has a $50 million committed, unsecured line of credit with a
commercial  bank.  Borrowings under the line bear interest at the  lesser  of
prime  rate  or Fed Funds plus .5%, or LIBOR plus .375%. The line  of  credit
requires  that  the Company maintain certain net worth levels,  limits  other
leases  and  debt  and  requires the Company to follow certain  other   sound
business practices.  The Company paid $63,000, $63,000, and $64,000  in  loan
commitment  fees  on  this  line during fiscal years  1998,  1997  and  1996,
respectively.  There were no outstanding borrowings on this line at September
25,  1998 or September 26, 1997.  The Company had a separate $50 million line
of  credit  under which borrowings were collateralized by customer securities
with  a  maximum loan to value of fifty percent at an interest  rate  of  one
month  LIBOR  plus  .75%.   There were borrowings of  $1,500,000  under  this
facility at September 26, 1997. The interest rate on these borrowings  ranged
from 6.1% to 6.4% during 1997.

      The  Company  also  maintains uncommitted lines of  credit  aggregating
$310,000,000  with  commercial banks ($235,000,000  secured  and  $75,000,000
unsecured).  Borrowings  under  the lines of credit  bear  interest,  at  the
Company's option, at the bank's prime rate, Fed Funds rate plus .5%, or LIBOR
plus .75%.  There were no short-term borrowings outstanding under these lines
at  September  25, 1998 or September 26, 1997.  The interest  rate  on  these
borrowings  ranged from 5.58% to 6.84% in 1998, and 5.87% to 7.25%  in  1997.
Loans on the secured, uncommitted lines of credit are collateralized by  firm
or client margin securities.

NOTE 7 - BANK OPERATIONS AND DEPOSITS:
- --------------------------------------

      On  May  6, 1994, the Company chartered Raymond James Bank,  FSB,  ("RJ
Bank")  in conjunction with the purchase of the deposits of certain  branches
of a federal savings bank from the Resolution Trust Corporation ("RTC") for a
nominal  purchase price.  The Company contributed $25 million in  capital  to
fund RJ Bank's start-up.

      Activity  in  the allowance for loan losses for 1998 and 1997  consists
solely of the provision for loan losses.  There were no actual loan losses in
1998, 1997 or 1996.
      There  was  no  recorded investment or interest  income  recognized  on
impaired  loans  during 1998, 1997 and 1996, as there were no impaired  loans
during these periods.

      Generally,  mortgage  loans  are secured  by  either  first  or  second
mortgages  on  residential property, and consumer loans are secured  by  time
deposit accounts.  As of September 25, 1998 and September 26, 1997, all of RJ
Bank's loan portfolio was secured.

      RJ  Bank is subject to various regulatory and capital requirements  and
was in compliance with all requirements throughout the fiscal years.

     Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of
1991  ("FDICIA"), RJ Bank is subject to rules limiting brokered deposits  and
related  interest  rates.  Under these rules, banks that  are  deemed  "well-
capitalized"  may  accept brokered deposits without  restriction,  and  banks
deemed  "adequately capitalized" may do so with a waiver from the  FDIC.   An
"undercapitalized"  bank  is not eligible for a waiver  and  may  not  accept
brokered  deposits.   As of September 30, 1998, the most recent  notification
from   the  Office  of  Thrift  Supervision  categorized  RJ  Bank  as  "well
capitalized" under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.

      At  September  25,  1998 and September 26, 1997, RJ Bank  exceeded  the
tangible  capital,  core  capital, core/leverage capital,  Tier  I/risk-based
capital  and  total  risk-based  capital levels  mandated  by  the  Financial
Institutions  Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of  1989  and  FDICIA.  At
September  25,  1998  and September 26, 1997, RJ Bank's  Tier  I  capital  to
average assets ratio was 8.2% and 9.3%, respectively.

NOTE 9 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:
- ---------------------------------------
     Long-term lease agreements expire at various times through 2003. Minimum
annual rentals under such agreements for the succeeding five fiscal years are
approximately: $10,714,000 in 1999, $9,699,000 in 2000, $9,026,000  in  2001,
$8,199,000 in 2002 and $5,135,000 in 2003.  Rental expense incurred under all
leases,   including   equipment  under  short-term   agreements,   aggregated
$11,085,000, $8,802,000, and $7,589,000 in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

      The  Company  has committed to lend to, or guarantee  other  debt  for,
Raymond James Tax Credit Funds, Inc. ("RJ Tax Credit") up to $15 million upon
request.  Any borrowings bear interest at broker call plus 1% per  annum.  RJ
Tax  Credit is charged 1% for amounts guaranteed.  The borrowings are secured
by   properties  under  development.   At  September  25,  1998  balances  of
$5,267,137  were loaned to RJ Tax Credit and $2,419,956 were guaranteed.   At
September 26, 1997, balances of $4,530,000 were loaned to RJ Tax Credit.  The
commitment  expired  in November 1998 at which time any outstanding  balances
were  due  and payable. On November 19, 1998, the Board of Directors  renewed
the  commitment and increased the amount to $25 million expiring in  November
1999.

      As  part  of  an  effort to increase brand awareness, the  Company  has
entered  into a stadium naming rights contract.  The contract has a thirteen-
year term with a five-year renewal option.  The cost for the initial year  is
$2,150,000 with an annual escalator of 4% in subsequent years.

      In  the normal course of business, the Company enters into underwriting
commitments.   Transactions relating to such commitments that  were  open  at
September  25, 1998 and were subsequently settled had no material  effect  on
the consolidated financial statements as of that date.

      The  Company  utilizes  a letter of credit and deposits  with  clearing
organizations to satisfy margin deposit requirements. At September 25,  1998,
and  September  26,  1997 the Company had a letter of credit  outstanding  of
$100,000  and client margin securities valued at $62,912,000 and $54,448,000,
respectively, on deposit with a clearing organization.

      In  the normal course of business, the Company, as general partner,  is
contingently  liable  for  the  obligations of various  limited  partnerships
engaged  primarily in securities investments and real estate activities.   In
the opinion of the Company, such liabilities, if any, for the obligations  of
the  partnerships willnot in the aggregate have a material adverse effect  on
the Company's consolidated financial position.

      As a result of the extensive regulation of the securities industry, the
Company's  broker-dealer  subsidiaries are subject  to  regular  reviews  and
inspections by regulatory authorities and self-regulatory organizations which
can result in imposition of sanctions for regulatory violations, ranging from
non-monetary  censure to fines and, in serious cases, temporary or  permanent
suspension from business.  In addition, from time to time regulatory agencies
and  self-regulatory  organizations institute  investigations  into  industry
practices  which  can  result in the imposition of such  sanctions.   Current
proceedings  in which the Company is one of the named defendants include  the
Securities  and Exchange Commission ("SEC") investigation of certain  trading
practices in the over-the-counter securities market during 1994 and 1995, and
the  SEC,  the  Internal  Revenue Service, and the  National  Association  of
Securities Dealers, Inc. review of investment banking practices in connection
with advance refunding transactions for municipalities.


      The  Company  is  also a defendant or co-defendant in various  lawsuits
incidental  to  its  securities  business.  The  Company  is  contesting  the
allegations  of  the complaints in these cases and believes  that  there  are
meritorious  defenses in each of these lawsuits.  In view of the  number  and
diversity of claims against the Company, the number of jurisdictions in which
litigation  is pending and the inherent difficulty of predicting the  outcome
of  litigation and other claims, the Company cannot state with certainty what
the  eventual outcome of pending litigation or other claims will be.  In  the
opinion  of  management, based on discussions with counsel,  the  outcome  of
these  matters  will  not  result  in  a  material  adverse  effect  on   the
consolidated financial position or results of operations of the Company.

NOTE 10 - CAPITAL TRANSACTIONS:
- -------------------------------

      The  Company's  Board  of Directors has, from  time  to  time,  adopted
resolutions  authorizing the Company to repurchase its common stock  for  the
funding  of  its  incentive stock option and stock purchase plans  and  other
corporate  purposes.  At September 25, 1998, pursuant to prior authorizations
from  the  Board  of  Directors,  1,207,900  shares  were  available  to   be
repurchased.   At  their  November 19, 1998 meeting the  Company's  Board  of
Directors  increased  the  number  of shares  authorized  for  repurchase  to
2,500,000.

     In February 1998 and 1997, the Company's Board of Directors declared a 3-
for-2  stock  split  in  the form of a dividend. The additional  shares  were
distributed on April 2, 1998 and April 3, 1997, respectively, to shareholders
of  record  on March 10, 1998 and March 7, 1997, respectively. All references
(unless  otherwise  noted)  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and
accompanying  notes to amounts per share and to the number of  common  shares
have been restated to give retroactive effect to the stock dividend.

      The Company sold equity put options in September 1998 that entitle  the
holder, at the expiration date, to sell 161,000 shares of common stock to the
Company  at an exercise price of $17.87 per share.  The $335,000 in  premiums
has been accounted for as additional paid-in capital.  At September 25, 1998,
these  put  options, with an aggregate exercise price of  $2,877,000  and  an
expiration  date  of  March 15, 1999, were outstanding.   In  the  event  the
options  are exercised, the Company may elect to pay the holder in  cash  the
difference  between the exercise price and the market price of the  Company's
shares,  in  lieu  of  repurchasing the stock.  The Company  sold  additional
options for 239,000 shares in October 1998 which expire April 7, 1999  at  an
exercise price of $18.31 per share.


NOTE 11 - EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS:
- ---------------------------------

      The  Company's  profit sharing plan and employee stock  ownership  plan
provide  certain death, disability or retirement benefits for  all  employees
who  meet  certain service requirements.  Such benefits become  fully  vested
after  seven  years  of qualified service.  The Company also  offers  a  plan
pursuant  to section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, which provides  for
the  Company  to  match 100% of the first $500 and 50% of the  next  $500  of
compensation  deferred by each participant annually. The  Company's  deferred
management  bonus  plan  is  a non-qualified plan  that  provides  retirement
benefits  for  employees who meet certain length of service and  compensation
requirements.   Contributions to these plans are  made  in  amounts  approved
annually  by the Board of Directors.  Compensation expense includes aggregate
contributions to these plans of $17,299,000, $15,462,000 and $12,527,000,
for 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
Stock Compensation Plans
      At  September  25,  1998  the Company has six stock-based  compensation
plans,  which  are  described below. In accordance  with  the  provisions  of
Statement  of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for  Stock-
Based   Compensation"  ("FAS  123"),the  Company  applies  APB  Opinion   25,
"Accounting  for  Stock Issued to Employees" and related  interpretations  in
accounting for these plans.

If  the  Company had elected to recognize compensation expense based  on  the
fair  value  at the grant dates for awards under these plans consistent  with
the  methodology  prescribed by FAS 123, the Company's  net  income  and  net
income  per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts  indicated
below:

      These pro forma amounts may not be representative of future disclosures
since the estimated fair value of stock options is amortized to expense  over
the  vesting  period and additional options may be granted in  future  years.
For  disclosure  purposes,  the fair value of  each  fixed  option  grant  is
estimated  on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing  model
with  the following weighted average assumptions used for stock option grants
in  1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively: dividend yields of 1.1% for all  three
years;  expected  volatility of 44.1%, 32.2% and  31.5%,  risk-free  interest
rates  of  5.85%, 6.28%, and 5.89% and expected lives of 5.32, 5.99,and  4.89
years.

Fixed Stock Option Plans
      The Company has five fixed stock option plans. Under the 1982 Incentive
Stock Option Plan, the Company was able to grant options to its employees for
up  to  4,275,281  shares of common stock. Under the  1992  Incentive   Stock
Option Plan, the Company may grant options to its management personnel for up
to  4,612,500  shares  of  common stock. The 1992  Plan  was  established  to
replace,  on  substantially  the same terms and conditions,  the  1982  Plan.
Options   are   granted  to  key  administrative  employees  and   registered
representatives of Raymond James & Associates, Inc. who achieve certain gross
commission  levels.   Options are exercisable in  the  36th  to  72nd  months
following  the  date of grant and only in the event that the  grantee  is  an
employee of the Company at that time.

Company's third non-qualified stock option plan, the Company may grant up  to
1,125,000  shares of common stock to key management personnel.  Option  terms
are specified in individual agreements and expire on a date no later than the
tenth  anniversary of the grant date. Under all plans, the exercise price  of
each
option  equals the market price of the Company's stock on the date  of  grant
and an option's maximum term is 10 years.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
      Under  the 1994 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the Company is authorized
to  issue  up to 1,125,000 shares of common stock to its full-time employees,
nearly all of whom are eligible to participate. Under the terms of the  Plan,
employees can choose each year to have up to 20% of their annual compensation
specified  to  purchase the Company's common stock. Share  purchases  in  any
calendar  year  are limited to the lesser of 1,000 shares or  shares  with  a
market value of $25,000. The purchase price of the stock is 85% of the market
price on the day prior to the purchase date. Under the Plan, the Company sold
314,114, 268,607, and 238,944 shares to employees in fiscal years 1998, 1997,
and   1996,  respectively.  The  compensation  cost  which  would  have  been
recognized  for  the  fair  value  of  the  employees'  purchase  rights  was
calculated  as  the  value of the 15% discount from  market  value.   At  the
November 19, 1998 meeting, the Board of Directors voted in favor of,  subject
to


shareholder  approval, the adoption of the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase  Plan
which is intended to replace, on substantially the same terms, the 1994  Plan
and authorizes the issuance of 1,500,000 shares of common stock.

Employee Investment Fund
       Certain  key  employees  of  the  Company  participate  in  a  limited
partnership  arrangement in which the Company makes a  non-recourse  loan  to
these  employees for two thirds of the purchase price per unit of the Raymond
James Employee Investment Fund I, L.P. The loan plus interest is intended  to
be  paid  back  from the earnings of the fund.  The fund is invested  in  the
merchant banking activities of the Company and other venture capital  limited
partnerships.

NOTE 12 - NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS:
- -----------------------------------

      The  broker-dealer  subsidiaries of the  Company  are  subject  to  the
requirements  of  the  Uniform  Net Capital  Rule  (Rule  15c3-1)  under  the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules of the securities exchanges  of
which   Raymond  James  &  Associates,  Inc.  ("RJA")  is  a  member,   whose
requirements  are substantially the same.  This Rule requires that  aggregate
indebtedness, as defined, not exceed fifteen times net capital,  as  defined.
Rule 15c3-1 also provides for an "alternative net capital requirement" which,
if  elected, requires that net capital be equal to the greater of $250,000 or
two  percent  of aggregate debit items computed in applying the  formula  for
determination  of  reserve requirements (see Note 13).  The  New  York  Stock
Exchange,  Inc. may require a member organization to reduce its  business  if
its  net  capital is less than four percent of aggregate debit items and  may
prohibit  a  member  firm  from  expanding its business  and  declaring  cash
dividends  if  its net capital is less than five percent of  aggregate  debit
items.   Net  capital  positions of the Company's broker-dealer  subsidiaries
were as follows:

NOTE 13 - RESERVE REQUIREMENTS:
- -------------------------------

      Rule  15c3-3  of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 specifies  certain
conditions  under  which  brokers and dealers carrying  client  accounts  are
required  to  maintain  cash or qualified securities  in  a  special  reserve
account  for the exclusive benefit of clients.  Amounts to be maintained,  if
required, are computed in accordance with a formula defined in the  Rule.  At
September  25,  1998,  Raymond James & Associates, Inc. had  $946,724,000  in
special  reserve  accounts  which consisted  of  $946,723,000  of  securities
purchased  under agreements to resell and $1,000 in cash, as  compared  to  a
reserve  requirement  of $925,396,000 at that date.  At September  26,  1997,
this  subsidiary had $692,429,000 in special reserve accounts which consisted
of  $692,054,000  of U.S. Treasury Securities purchased under  agreements  to
resell  and  $375,000  in  cash, as compared  to  a  reserve  requirement  of
$608,298,000 at that date. At September 25, 1998, such repurchase  agreements
were  on an overnight basis with Deutsche Bank AG, BT Alex Brown, Inc., First
Union Capital Markets Corp., and ABN Amro, Inc.  At September 26, 1997,  such
repurchase  agreements  were on an overnight basis  with  Deutsche  Bank,  BT
Securities Corporation, First Union Capital Markets Corp., and Morgan Stanley
and  Company.   The  Company  monitors the market  value  of  the  underlying
securities as compared to the related receivable, including accrued interest,
and requires additional collateral where deemed appropriate.

      Investment  Management & Research, Inc. and Robert  Thomas  Securities,
Inc.  are  exempt from the provisions of Rule 15c3-3, since  they  clear  all
transactions  with  and for clients on a fully disclosed basis  with  Raymond
James & Associates, Inc.

NOTE 14 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK:
- ------------------------------------------------------------

      In  the  normal  course of business, the Company  purchases  and  sells
securities as either principal or agent on behalf of its clients.  If  either
the client or a counterparty fails to perform, the Company may be required to
discharge the obligations of the nonperforming party.  In such circumstances,
the Company may sustain a loss if the market value of the security or futures
contract is different from the contract value of the transaction.

      The  Company  also  acts as an intermediary between broker-dealers  and
other financial institutions whereby the Company borrows securities from  one
broker-dealer  and  then  lends  them to another.   Securities  borrowed  and
securities loaned are carried at the amounts of cash collateral advanced  and
received  in  connection  with the transactions.  The  Company  measures  the
market  value  of  the  securities  borrowed  and  loaned  against  the  cash
collateral  on  a daily basis.  The market value of securities  borrowed  and
securities   loaned  was  $824,726,000  and  $796,504,000  respectively,   at
September  25,  1998  and $1,032,342,000 and $998,698,000,  respectively,  at
September  26, 1997. Additional cash is obtained as necessary to ensure  such
transactions  are  adequately  collateralized.   If  another  party  to   the
transaction fails to perform as agreed (such as failure to deliver a security
or failure to pay for a security), the Company may incur a loss if the market
value  of  the  security  is  different  from  the  contract  amount  of  the
transaction.

     The Company has also loaned, to brokers and dealers, securities owned by
clients and others for which it has received cash or other collateral.  If  a
borrowing  institution  or  broker-dealer does not  return  a  security,  the
Company  may be obligated to purchase the security in order to return  it  to
the  owner. In such circumstances, the Company may incur a loss equal to  the
amount   by  which  the  market  value  of  the  security  on  the  date   of
nonperformance  exceeds  the value of the loan from the  institution  or  the
collateral from the broker or dealer.

     The Company has sold securities that it does not currently own and will,
therefore,  be  obligated to purchase such securities at a future  date.  The
Company  has recorded $30,841,000 and $55,298,000 at September 25,  1998  and
September  26, 1997, respectively, which represents the market value  of  the
related  securities at such dates.  The Company is subject  to  loss  if  the
market  price of those securities not covered by a hedged position  increases
subsequent  to  fiscal  year  end.   The Company  utilizes  short  government
obligations  and  equity  securities  to  hedge  long  proprietary  inventory
positions.  At  September  25, 1998, the Company  had  $24,245,000  in  short
government  obligations  and  $571,000  in  short  equity  securities   which
represented  hedge  positions.  At  September  26,  1997,  the  Company   had
$21,123,000  in short government obligations and $1,925,000 in  short  equity
securities which represented hedge positions.

       The  Company  enters  into  security  transactions  involving  forward
settlement.  The Company has recorded transactions with a contract  value  of
$311,252,000  and  $196,156,000  and  a  market  value  of  $315,104,000  and
$195,063,000  as of September 25, 1998 and September 26, 1997,  respectively.
Transactions  involving future settlement give rise  to  market  risk,  which
represents  the potential loss that can be caused by a change in  the  market
value of a particular financial instrument.  The Company's exposure to market
risk  is  determined by a number of factors, including the size,  composition
and  diversification of positions held, the absolute and relative  levels  of
interest rates, and market volatility.

      The  majority  of  the  Company's transactions and,  consequently,  the
concentration  of  its  credit exposure is with clients,  broker-dealers  and
other   financial  institutions  in  the  United  States.   These  activities
primarily  involve  collateralized arrangements  and  may  result  in  credit
exposure  in  the  event that the counterparty fails to meet its  contractual
obligations.  The Company's exposure to credit risk can be directly  impacted
by volatile securities markets which may impair the ability of counterparties
to  satisfy their contractual obligations.  The Company seeks to control  its
credit  risk through a variety of reporting and control procedures, including
establishing  credit  limits  based upon  a  review  of  the  counterparties'
financial  condition  and  credit ratings.  The Company  monitors  collateral
levels  on  a  daily  basis  for  compliance  with  regulatory  and  internal
guidelines and requests changes in collateral levels as appropriate.

NOTE 15 - SEGMENT ANALYSIS:
- ---------------------------

  The  Company's reportable segments are:  retail distribution, institutional
distribution,  investment banking, asset management and  other.   The  retail
distribution  segment  includes the 1,052 retail branches  of  the  Company's
three  broker-dealer subsidiaries located throughout the U.S. These  branches
provide securities brokerage services including the sale of equities,  mutual
funds,  fixed  income products, and insurance to their retail  clients.   The
institutional  distribution  segment includes  fourteen  institutional  sales
offices in the U.S. and six in Europe providing securities brokerage services
emphasizing  the sale of equities and fixed income products to  institutions.
The  investment  banking  segment includes management  and  participation  in
underwritings  (exclusive  of  sales  credits,  which  are  included  in  the
distribution  segments), mergers and acquisitions, public  finance,  trading,
research and market making.  The asset management segment includes investment
portfolio  management services of  Eagle Asset Management, Inc.,  Awad  Asset
Management  and  RJA's  Asset Management Services division  and  mutual  fund
management  by  Heritage  Asset Management, Inc.   In  the  various  programs
offered  by  these  entities  the clients' funds are  professionally  managed
either  in  individual accounts or in funds. RJ Bank and the trust companies,
the  results of operations of international joint ventures, stock  loan/stock
borrow  and  earnings  on firm capital are included in the  segment  entitled
"other."
     
     The  financial results of the Company's segments are the same  as  those
described in the "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies".  Segment  data
includes charges allocating corporate overhead to each segment.  Intersegment
revenues  and charges are eliminated between segments.  The Company evaluates
the  performance  of its segments and allocates resources to  them  based  on
return on investment.
     
     The  Company  has  not disclosed asset information  by  segment  as  the
information is not produced internally.  All long-lived assets are located in
the U.S.
     
     The Company's business is predominantly in the U.S., with only 3% of
revenues and 2% of net income coming from international operations.

NOTE 16 - RELATED PARTIES:
- --------------------------

      On  October  27,  1994, the Company and the then  President  and  Chief
Investment  Officer of its Eagle Asset Management, Inc. ("Eagle") subsidiary,
Herbert  E. Ehlers ("Ehlers"), entered into a Separation Agreement  by  which
Ehlers  (a director of the Company) and certain other Eagle personnel  became
employees  of  a  new firm, Liberty Investment Management, Inc.  ("Liberty"),
effective  December  31,  1994. As of January 1, 1995,  Liberty  assumed  the
responsibility  for providing portfolio management services to  institutional
growth equity accounts totaling $4.3 billion formerly managed by Eagle.

      In  accordance with Ehlers' employment agreement, Eagle was to  receive
50%  of  the  revenues from these accounts through December 31,  1999,  while
bearing none of the expenses.  In addition, the Company was granted an option
to purchase 20% of Liberty in the year 2000 at a predetermined price. For the
years  ended  September  26, 1997 and September 27,  1996,  Eagle  recognized
$2,569,000  and  $9,813,000, respectively, in fees from  Liberty,  which  are
included in investment advisory fees in the consolidated statement of income.

      On  January  2, 1997, Liberty sold substantially all of its  assets  to
Goldman Sachs Asset Management, Inc. Accordingly, the Company received a lump
sum  settlement of $30.6 million for its remaining three years'  interest  in
Liberty's revenue stream and the Company's option to purchase 20% of  Liberty
at a future date.

NOTE 17 - SUBSEQUENT EVENT:
- ---------------------------

      Subsequent to yearend, the Company announced its intention to merge its
two  wholly-owned  independent  contractor  subsidiaries,  into  one  entity,
Raymond  James  Financial Services, Inc. ("RJFS").  The  two  companies  will
initially operate independently as divisions of RJFS.  The merger is expected
to  be  effective in the first calendar quarter of 1999 and will be accounted
for at book value in a manner similar to a pooling of interests.
