ITEM 1.   BUSINESS

     (a)  General Description of Business

      Raymond James Financial, Inc. ("RJF") is a Florida-based holding company
that  was  incorporated in 1974 as a successor to its predecessor  corporation
founded  in  1962.   Its  principal  subsidiaries  include  Raymond  James   &
Associates,  Inc.  ("RJA"), Investment Management & Research,  Inc.  ("IM&R"),
Robert   Thomas  Securities,  Inc.  ("RTS"),  Eagle  Asset  Management,   Inc.
("Eagle"),  Heritage  Asset Management, Inc. ("Heritage")  and  Raymond  James
Bank,  FSB.  All of these subsidiaries are wholly-owned by RJF.  RJF  and  its
subsidiaries are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Company".

      RJF's principal subsidiary, RJA, was organized in Florida in 1962.   RJA
is  a  regional  securities brokerage firm engaged  in  most  aspects  of  the
securities business.  All but 15 of RJA's 47 retail branch offices are located
in  Florida,  and  the  Company is the largest brokerage and  investment  firm
headquartered in that state.  RJA also has 21 institutional sales  offices,  6
of  which  are  located  in Europe.  RJA is a member of  the  New  York  Stock
Exchange ("NYSE") and other principal stock and option exchanges.

      IM&R  was formed in 1973 as an independent contractor financial planning
organization and participates in the distribution of all products and services
offered  by RJA to its retail clients through its 499 offices and 82 satellite
offices  in  all  50 states.  IM&R is a member of the National Association  of
Securities  Dealers  ("NASD") and Securities Investor  Protection  Corporation
("SIPC"),  but  not  of  any exchange, as it clears its  trades  on  a  fully-
disclosed basis through RJA.

      RTS was organized in 1981.  It serves independent contractor brokers who
do  a  majority  of  their  business in individual  securities  and  currently
operates 405 branch offices and 136 satellite offices in all 50 states.   RTS,
like  IM&R, is a member of the NASD and SIPC, but not of any exchange,  as  it
also clears all of its business on a fully-disclosed basis through RJA.

      Eagle  was  formed  in 1984 as a registered investment  advisor  and  at
September  26,  1997  had approximately $3.7 billion of  client  assets  under
management.   Prior to the inception of Eagle, the asset management  operation
had been a division of RJA.

      Heritage  was  organized in 1985 to act as the manager of the  Company's
internally sponsored Heritage family of mutual funds.  At September  26,  1997
the 11 funds managed by Heritage had a total of nearly $3.2 billion in assets.

      Raymond  James Bank was formed in 1994 in conjunction with the  purchase
from  the RTC of certain branches of a failed thrift.  Its primary purpose  is
to  provide  traditional banking products and services to the clients  of  the
Company's  broker-dealer subsidiaries.  At September 26, 1997,  Raymond  James
Bank had $329 million in assets.

(c)  Narrative Description of Business

     At  September  26,  1997  the Company employed  3,244  individuals.   RJA
employed  2,666  of  these  individuals, 510 of  whom  were  full-time  retail
financial  advisors.   In  addition, 2,315 full-time financial  advisors  were
affiliated  with the Company as independent contractors.  Through its  broker-
dealer subsidiaries, the Company provides securities services to approximately
600,000  client accounts. No single client accounts for a material  percentage
of the Company's total business.


                     Raymond James & Associates, Inc.

       RJA's  activities  in  the  securities  business  include  retail   and
institutional  securities brokerage, origination and distribution  of  limited
partnership  interests, management of and participation  in  underwritings  of
equity  and fixed income securities, market making in corporate and  municipal
securities, origination, distribution  of mutual funds and  unit
trusts,  and  research  and  investment advisory services.   RJA  also  offers
financial planning services for individuals and provides clearing services for
IM&R, RTS and other unaffiliated broker-dealers.  For the year ended September
26, 1997 the revenues of RJA accounted for 62% of the consolidated revenues of
the Company.

      RJA is a member of the NYSE, American Stock Exchange, Philadelphia Stock
Exchange,  Chicago Board Options Exchange, New York Futures Exchange,  Pacific
Exchange  and  Chicago Stock Exchange.  It is also a member of the  Securities
Industry  Association, NASD and SIPC.  SIPC provides insurance protection  for
clients'  accounts of up to $500,000 each (limited to $100,000 for claims  for
cash)  in  the event of the Company's liquidation.  In addition,  RJA  carries
$49,500,000 per account of excess client insurance.

      Brokerage  Transactions.  RJA provides securities brokerage services  to
both retail and institutional clients.  In most cases, RJA charges commissions
to  its retail clients, on both exchange and over-the-counter transactions, in
accordance  with  its established commission schedule.  In certain  instances,
varying  discounts  from  the schedule are given,  generally  based  upon  the
client's  level  of business, the trade size and other relevant  factors.  RJA
discounts its commissions substantially on institutional transactions based on
trade   size  and  the  amount  of  business  conducted  annually  with   each
institution.  For  certain fee-based accounts, a fee is  charged  in  lieu  of
standard commissions.

      Clients'  transactions in securities are effected on either  a  cash  or
margin  basis.   In  margin transactions, the client pays  a  portion  of  the
purchase  price,  and  RJA  makes  a loan  to  the  client  for  the  balance,
collateralized by the securities purchased or by other securities owned by the
client.   Interest  is  charged to clients on the amount borrowed  to  finance
margin transactions.  The financing of margin purchases is an important source
of  revenue to RJA, since the interest rate paid by the client on funds loaned
by RJA exceeds RJA's cost of short-term funds. The interest rate charged to  a
client  on  a margin loan depends on the average loan balance in the  client's
account and ranges from prime plus 1% to prime minus .75%.

      Typically, broker-dealers utilize secured bank borrowings and equity
capital as  the  primary
sources  of  funds to finance clients' margin account borrowings.   Since  the
inception  of  the  Client Interest Program in 1981,  however,  the  Company's
primary  source of funds to finance clients' margin account balances has  been
cash  balances  in  clients'  accounts  which  are  awaiting  investment.   In
addition,  pursuant  to  written agreements with clients,  broker-dealers  are
permitted by Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and NYSE rules to lend
client  securities  in  margin accounts to other  brokers.   SEC  regulations,
however, restrict the use of clients' funds derived from pledging and  lending
clients'  securities, as well as funds awaiting investments, to the  financing
of  margin  account balances, and to the extent not so used,  such  funds  are
required to be deposited in a special account for the benefit of clients.  The
regulations also require broker-dealers, within designated periods of time, to
obtain  possession or control of, and to segregate, clients'  fully  paid  and
excess margin securities.


      Stock  Borrow/Stock Loan Program.  RJA commenced this  program  in  July
1987,  involving  the borrowing and lending of securities from  and  to  other
broker-dealers.  RJA generally acts as an intermediary between  broker-dealers
and other financial institutions, where it borrows from one party and lends to
another.  The borrower of the securities puts up a cash deposit, commonly 102%
of  the market value of the securities.  This deposit, which is adjusted daily
to  reflect  changes in current market value, earns interest at  a  negotiated
rate, typically .2% to .5% below what the lender of the securities can earn on
the funds.

      Mutual Funds.  RJA sells a number of professionally managed, load mutual
funds  and  offers, in addition, a selection of no-load funds.  RJA  maintains
dealer-sales  agreements with most major distributors of  mutual  fund  shares
sold  through broker-dealers.  Commissions on such sales generally range  from
1%   to  5%  of  the  dollar  value  of  the  transaction.  Alternative  sales
compensation  structures typically include front-end  charges,  "back-end"  or
contingent deferred sales charges, and an annual charge in the form of a  fund
expense.

      At  September  26, 1997, the Company had 11 internally sponsored  mutual
funds for which RJA acts as distributor.  (See Heritage Asset Management, Inc.
description on page 9.)  As the distributor of these funds, RJA has the  right
to  enter  into dealer agreements with other broker-dealers for  the  sale  of
Heritage funds to their clients.

      Asset  Management  Services ("AMS").  This department  manages  programs
which  offer  investment advisory services to clients as well as certain  non-
advisory programs which offer fee based alternatives to traditional commission
charges  for  transactions.  Advisory programs include:   Investment  Advisory
Services  ("IAS"),  the Passport Program ("Passport"), the Managed  Investment
Program  ("MIP") and the Preferred Portfolio Account ("PPA").  IAS   maintains
an  approved list of investment managers, most of which are unaffiliated  with
the  Company, establishes custodial facilities, monitors performance of client
accounts,  provides clients with accounting and other administrative  services
and  assists  investment managers with certain trading management  activities.
IAS earns fees generally ranging from .5%-1.0% of asset balances per annum,  a
portion  of which is paid to investment managers who direct the investment  of
the  clients'  accounts. At September 26, 1997, this program had approximately
$1.4 billion in assets under management through agreements with 22 independent
investment  advisors.  Two  proprietary asset managers,  Awad  and  Associates
("Awad") and Carillon Asset Management ("Carillon"), are also offered  through
this program.

      Passport  and a similar program offered by IM&R, known as  IMPAC,  offer
both  a  discretionary  and  non-discretionary advisory fee  alternative  that
allows clients to pay a quarterly fee plus low transaction charges in lieu  of
commissions.   Fees  are based on the individual account  size  and  are  also
dependent  on  the  type  of  securities in the accounts.   In  addition,  AMS
collects  an  administrative fee of up to .2% of asset balances annually,  for
which  clients receive a quarterly performance report and other services.   As
of  September 26, 1997, Passport and IMPAC had approximately $2.7 billion  and
$493 million in assets, respectively, serviced by financial advisors.

     MIP is a program that allows selected financial advisors to manage client
portfolios  on  a discretionary, wrap fee basis.  The financial advisors  must
satisfy  certain criteria and complete educational courses to be selected  for
this  program.  Fees are dependent on the size of the account and the type  of
securities  in  the  account.  AMS establishes custodial facilities,  monitors
performance of client portfolios, provides clients with accounting  and  other
administrative  services  and  assists the  financial  advisors  with  certain
trading  management activities.  AMS collects an administrative fee of  up  to
 .2%  of  asset balances.  As of September 26, 1997, MIP had approximately  $68
million in assets.

      PPA  is  a  non-discretionary wrap fee pricing alternative  that  allows
clients  to  pay a quarterly fee in lieu of commissions.  Unlike Passport,  no
transaction charge is imposed.  The fee structure and services provided by AMS
are  similar  to  Passport  and  MIP.  As  of  September  26,  1997,  PPA  had
approximately $61 million in assets.

      Awad  is  primarily  a  small  and mid-cap equity  portfolio  management
division  of  RJA which was formed in March of 1992. Clients pay  fees  and/or
commissions for management of their accounts.  Present fees range from .5%  to
1.0%  of asset balances annually.  In addition to private accounts, Awad  also
manages a portion of the Heritage Small Cap Stock Fund Portfolio and other non-
affiliated fund portfolios. Exclusive of the Heritage Small Cap Fund, Awad had
approximately $814 million under management at September 26, 1997.

      Carillon,  another  division  of  RJA  offered  through  IAS,  commenced
operations  in 1993.  Carillon manages approximately $54 million  for  private
accounts investing exclusively in closed-end mutual funds.  Fees are currently
approximately .4% of assets annually.

     In addition to the foregoing programs, AMS also offers fee based programs
to  clients who have contracted for portfolio management services from outside
money managers that are not a part of the IAS program.

      Equity  Capital  Markets  Group.  This division  consists  of  the  five
following  departments,  which were brought together under  common  management
pursuant to a 1997 reorganization:

      1)  Investment Banking Group.  The 51 professionals of RJA's  Investment
Banking  Group, located primarily in St. Petersburg with satellite offices  in
Atlanta,  Boston, Dallas, and Houston, are involved in a variety of activities
including public and private debt and equity financing for corporate  clients,
merger  and  acquisition advisory services, fairness opinions and evaluations.
The  Company  focuses on specific industry groups or strategic business  units
("SBUs")   including   consumer  products,  financial  services,   healthcare,
information  technology and telecom, environmental and  industrial,  and  real
estate.

      2)  Research  Department.  The 33 analysts in  this  department  publish
research on over 290 companies, primarily focused on emerging growth and  mid-
cap companies in SBU industries. Proprietary research reports are provided  to
both  retail  and  institutional clients, and  are  supplemented  by  research
purchased  from outside services to accomodate retail clients. This department
has  distinguished itself through its extremely successful short and long-term
comparative results as reported by Zacks Investment Research each  quarter  in
the Wall Street Journal.

      3)  The  Domestic  Institutional Equity  Sales  Department.   The  32
salespersons  of  the Domestic Institutional Equity Sales Department  maintain
relationships with over 840 institutional clients. A large percentage of  their
trades  involve  managed/co-managed underwritings and stocks followed  by  the
Research Department.

      4)  Over-the-Counter Equity Trading. Trading securities in the over-the-
counter ("OTC") market involves the purchase of securities from, and the  sale
of  securities  to,  clients  of the Company  or  other  dealers  who  may  be
purchasing or selling securities for their own account or acting as agent  for
their  clients.  Profits and losses are derived from the spreads  between  bid
and  asked  prices,  as  well as market trends for the  individual  securities
during  the  holding period. At September 26, 1997, RJA made  markets  in  210
common stocks in the OTC market. RJA frequently acts as agent in the execution
of  OTC  orders for its clients and as such transacts these trades with  other
dealers.  When RJA receives a client order in a security in which it  makes  a
market,  it  may act as principal as long as it matches or improves  upon  the
best  price  in  the dealer market, plus or minus a mark-up or  mark-down  not
exceeding   the   equivalent  agency  commission  charge.   Recently   adopted
regulations  require  that  client limit orders  be  satisfied  prior  to  the
brokerage firm buying securities into or selling securities from their
own inventory at the same price.

      5)  Syndicate  Department.   The Syndicate  Department  coordinates  the
marketing,  distribution, pricing and stabilization of  Raymond  James'  lead-
managed  equity underwritings. In addition to Raymond James' managed  and  co-
managed  offerings,  this  department coordinates  the  firm's  syndicate  and
selling  group activities in transactions managed by other investment  banking
firms.  Marketing  and  distribution activities  are  focused  on  the  firm's
institutional  and  retail clients. Brokered certificate of deposit  offerings
are also handled in this department.

      Fixed  Income  Department.   Through the Fixed  Income  Department,  RJA
distributes  both  taxable  and  tax-exempt  fixed  income  products  to   its
institutional   and   retail  clients.   These  products  include   municipal,
corporate,  government agency and mortgage-backed bonds, preferred stock,  and
unit  investment  trusts.   RJA carries inventory  positions  of  taxable  and
municipal   securities  in  both  the  primary  and  secondary  market.    The
department's  Public Finance division, operating out of 6 offices  (5  located
throughout  the  State of Florida and one in Birmingham,  Alabama),   acts  as
financial  advisor or underwriter to various municipal agencies  or  political
subdivisions.   RJA also acts as an underwriter or selling  group  member  for
corporate  bonds,  agency bonds, preferred stock and unit  investment  trusts.
When  underwriting  new  issue securities, RJA agrees to  purchase  the  issue
through  a negotiated sale or submits a competitive bid.  In addition  to  St.
Petersburg,  the  Fixed  Income Department maintains institutional  sales  and
trading  offices in New York, Chicago, Houston, Boston, and Dublin, Ohio.   To
assist our institutional clients, the department's Fixed Income Research Group
provides  value-added  analytical  services  and  publishes  research  reports
containing  both  specific product information and information  on  topics  of
interest such as market and regulatory developments.

     Operations and Administration.  RJA's operations/administrative personnel
are  responsible  for  the  execution  of  orders,  processing  of  securities
transactions,  custody  of  client  securities,  receipt,  identification  and
delivery  of  funds  and  securities, compliance  with  regulatory  and  legal
requirements,  internal financial accounting and controls and  general  office
administration for most of the Company's operations.


                  Investment Management & Research, Inc.

      IM&R  participates in the distribution of all the products and  services
offered  by  RJA  to  its retail clients through 1,205 independent  contractor
registered representatives in 581 offices and satellite offices throughout all
50  states.  The number of registered representatives in these offices  ranges
from  1 to 20.  Such representatives devote all or substantially all of  their
time  to the sale of securities and, while these independent contractors  must
conduct  all securities business through IM&R, their contracts permit them  to
conduct  insurance,  real  estate  brokerage,  accounting  services  or  other
business   for  others  or  for  their  own  account.  Many  IM&R   registered
representatives are better characterized as financial planners than  as  stock
brokers, although they are not required to conduct their business as financial
planners.   Independent contractors are responsible for all  of  their  direct
costs and are paid higher than normal commission rates to compensate them  for
their added expenses.


                      Robert Thomas Securities, Inc.

     RTS has 1,110 full-time independent contractor registered representatives
in  48  states  who offer securities and investment advice to individuals  and
institutions  through a network of 508 branch offices and  satellite  offices.
Of  these  offices,  147  are located within depository  institutions  (banks,
savings  and  loans and credit unions).  RTS representatives  offer  the  full
range  of  securities  products and services of RJA.  RTS  branches  have  the
independence to set their own commissions on agency business within regulatory
guidelines. Like IM&R, RTS branches and their registered personnel  may  offer
non-securities  products or services to clients outside of their  relationship
with RTS.

                       Eagle Asset Management, Inc.

profit  sharing plans, retirement funds, foundations, endowments,  trusts  and
individuals.  Accounts are managed on a discretionary basis in accordance with
the   investment  objective(s)  specified  by  the  client.    Eagle   manages
approximately  $700  million for institutional clients and  $3.0  billion  for
retail accounts.

      Eagle's  investment management fee generally ranges  from  .25%-1.0%  of
asset  balances per year depending upon the size and investment  objective  of
the  account.  In addition to the management fees, clients are required to pay
brokerage  commissions  (or a fee in lieu thereof) for transactions  in  their
account.

     RJ Partners, Inc.                  Various


      The Company has several other subsidiaries, but their activities are not
material to the Company's operations.

                               Competition

      The  Company's subsidiaries compete with many larger, better capitalized
providers  of  financial services, including other securities firms,  some  of
which  are  affiliated  with  major financial  services  companies,  insurance
companies,  banking institutions and other organizations.  They  also  compete
with  a  number  of firms offering discount brokerage services,  usually  with
lower  levels  of service, to individual clients.  The Company's  subsidiaries
compete  principally on the basis of service, product selection, location  and
reputation in local markets.

                                Regulation

      The  securities  industry in the United States is subject  to  extensive
regulation  under  federal  and state laws.  The SEC  is  the  federal  agency
charged  with  administration of the federal securities  laws.   Much  of  the
regulation  of  broker-dealers, however, has been delegated to self-regulatory
organizations,  principally  the  NASD and the  NYSE.   These  self-regulatory
organizations  adopt  rules (which are subject to approval  by  the  SEC)  for
governing  the  industry and conduct periodic examinations of  member  broker-
dealers.   Securities firms are also subject to regulation by state securities
commissions in the states in which they are registered.  RJA, IM&R and RTS are
currently registered in all 50 states.

      The regulations to which broker-dealers are subject cover all aspects of
the  securities  business,  including sales  methods,  trade  practices  among
broker-dealers, capital structure of securities firms, record keeping and  the
conduct of directors, officers and employees.  Additional legislation, changes
in  rules  promulgated  by  the  SEC and by self-regulatory  organizations  or
changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules  often
directly  affect  the method of operation and profitability of broker-dealers.
The  SEC  and  the  self-regulatory organizations may  conduct  administrative
proceedings  which can result in censure, fine, suspension or expulsion  of  a
broker-dealer, its officers or employees.  The principal purpose of regulation
and  discipline  of  broker-dealers  is the  protection  of  clients  and  the
securities  markets  rather than protection of creditors and  shareholders  of
broker-dealers.

     See Notes 12 and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
further description of certain SEC regulations.


ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES

      The  Company  owns  a  310,000  square foot  headquarters  complex  (two
buildings)  located  in  St. Petersburg, Florida. The  Company  also  owns  29
adjacent acres for future growth, where a third headquarters building (276,000
square  feet) and a bank and trust company building (24,000 square  feet)  are
presently  under construction. In addition, the Company leases  84,000  square
feet  in nearby office buildings. With the exception of the Company-owned  RJA
branch office building in Crystal River, Florida, RJA branches are leased with
various  expiration dates through 2002. The IM&R and RJP headquarters  offices
in  Atlanta, Georgia are also under leases. See Notes 4 and 9 of the Notes  to
Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  further  information  regarding  the
Company's leases.

      Leases for branch offices of IM&R and RTS are the responsibility of  the
respective independent contractor registered representatives.


ITEM 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     The Company is a defendant or co-defendant in various lawsuits incidental
to  its securities business.  The Company is contesting the allegations of the
complaints in these cases and believes that there are meritorious defenses  in
each of these lawsuits.  In view of the number and diversity of claims against
the  Company, the number of jurisdictions in which litigation is  pending  and
the  inherent  difficulty of predicting the outcome of  litigation  and  other
claims,  the Company cannot state with certainty what the eventual outcome  of
pending  litigation  or other claims will be.  In the opinion  of  management,
based  on  discussions  with counsel, the outcome of these  matters  will  not
result  in  a material adverse effect on the financial position or results  of
operations of the Company.

ITEM 4.   SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

     None.

     Fourth Quarter           37-1/8  25-3/4     24-3/8    19-3/4

      Since  the  Company initiated payment of a cash dividend in 1985,  there
have  been 15 increases in the dividend rate, 6 of which were in the  form  of
stock  splits and stock dividends.  The dividend rate following the  April  3,
1997 stock split was $.08 per quarter.

      The payment of dividends on the Company's common stock is subject to the
availability of funds from the Company's subsidiaries, including  the  broker-
dealer subsidiaries which may be subject to restrictions under the net capital
rules of the SEC and the NYSE.  Such restrictions have never become applicable
with respect to the Company's dividend payments.  (See Note 12 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.)

      At  December  17, 1997 there were approximately 10,000  holders  of  the
Company's common stock.

 ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
          AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Results of Operations - Three Years Ended September 26, 1997


      Fiscal  1997 was the Company's thirteenth consecutive year of  record
revenues, even exclusive of the gain on the sale of the Company's  interest
in  Liberty Investment Management, Inc. ("Liberty") as described in Note 15
of  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements. For the past  two  years,  the
equity  markets  have  experienced an unprecedented rise,  spurring  record
levels of transaction volume and capital markets activity. These conditions
have  led  to  record  results in many sectors of  the  financial  services
industry,  including  most  of the Company's  primary  lines  of  business.
Accordingly,  the  last  two  fiscal years have each  established  earnings
records for the Company by a wide margin.

     Fiscal 1995 was a mixed year, with the first six months a continuation
of  1994's   subdued  market  conditions in a  period  of  rising  interest
rates.   The  second half of fiscal 1995 was a dramatic  contrast,  with  a
return to declining interest rates and a rising stock market.

      Over  time,  the  Company's  emphasis  on  non-transaction  dependent
revenues  has created a consistently growing revenue stream. For  the  past
three  years,  revenues which are of a recurring fee or  time-based  nature
have represented nearly one third of total revenues.

      Continued  strength of the securities markets and record  transaction
volume in fiscal 1997 and 1996 resulted in increased securities commissions
for the sales of all product lines, with the largest absolute increases  in
mutual  funds,  over-the-counter stocks and annuities  during  the  period.
While  the  retail sales force has experienced double-digit  annual  growth
since  fiscal  1995,  as illustrated below, the increased  productivity  of
existing  Financial Advisors has been an even greater factor in the  growth
of commission revenues.

      Investment  banking  revenues, including  new  issue  sales  credits,
increased 50% in 1997 to a record $109.1 million following a 69%  surge  in
the  prior  year. Fiscal years 1997 and 1996 were record years  for  equity
underwriting  activity, both in number of new issues and  average  offering
size.  In contrast, fiscal 1995 revenues reflected a partial year  of  much
slower activity.  The number of managed or co-managed underwritings and the
dollar  volume of these transactions were as follows: 1997 - 65 new  issues
for  $7.8 billion; 1996 - 38 new issues for $2.7 billion; and 1995 - 24 new
issues  for  $1.4  billion. Merger and acquisition fees,  although  a  less
significant  component, have been a consistent revenue  source  during  the
past few years.

      Investment advisory fees have risen with the generally strong  growth
in  assets  under management as shown in the table below. Asset  management
growth  has  benefitted both from asset appreciation and from positive  net
sales during this period. For 1997, investment advisory fees included  only
three  months of fees from Liberty, which was sold in January  1997.  Since
1995,  real estate assets under management have increased significantly  as
the  Company's  Raymond  James  Realty Advisors  subsidiary  has  become  a
recognized manager of institutional real estate portfolios.

Net   interest  income   continues  to be  a   stable,  growing  source  of
earnings. A large portion of the increase has been a result of the dramatic
growth in retail brokerage account balances, including resultant segregated
account assets.  The components of interest earnings are as follows:

     Net trading profits have remained consistent in total from fiscal 1995
through 1997. These profits are primarily from over-the-counter equity  and
fixed  income  inventory activity. Despite a significant  increase  in  the
number  of  stocks  for which the Company acts as a market  maker,  various
industry changes (order execution rules, introduction of sixteenths,  etc.)
have  limited  the ability to realize a proportionate increase  in  trading
profits.

      The  increase in financial service fees in fiscal 1997 and 1996 is  a
combined  result of the general growth of the Company's retail client  base
and recent dramatic growth in transaction fees arising from our retail wrap
fee  account  programs,  which  have  become  increasingly  popular  as  an
alternative to the traditional commission-based pricing structure.

Other income in fiscal 1997 includes a gain of $2.5 million from the Compan
y's sale of its former headquarters building. Recurring factors include the
continuing  growth  in floor brokerage revenues during this  active  market
period  and  a  rise  in  property management  fees  as  the  Company's  RJ
Properties  subsidiary has increased substantially the number of  apartment
units which it manages.

      Since  several  of  the  expense line  items  are  explained  by  the
fluctuation  in corresponding revenues and others were relatively  constant
or  experienced  a  general corporate growth rate during this  period,  the
following  discussion  will focus on the expense  items  not  falling  into
either of these two categories.

      Incentive compensation expenses are based on departmental, subsidiary
and  firm-wide profitability and reflect the record earnings in fiscal 1997
and  1996. Record underwriting activity has resulted in a dramatic increase
in  investment banking departmental profits, having a significant impact on
incentive compensation.

      The increases in communications and information processing expense in
fiscal 1997 and 1996 reflect the costs of further enhancement and expansion
of   the  Company's  systems  of  internal  communication  and  information
dissemination, as well as higher general business volume which gave rise to
increased costs for telephone, printing and supplies.

      The  increase in occupancy and equipment expense between fiscal  1996
and   1997  is  predominantly  the  increased  depreciation  on  additional
information  processing  equipment. The  increase  also  includes  expenses
associated  with  upgraded  retail  office  space  and  account   executive
workstations,  which  have been a primary factor in  the  past  two  years'
increases.

      The  rise  in other expenses is primarily the result of higher  legal
expenses   and  settlements,  and  increased  subadvisory  fees   paid   to
unaffiliated  portfolio  managers  in  our  Investment  Advisory   Services
program.

      The  widespread use of computer programs that rely on two-digit  date
programs  to perform computations and decision-making functions  may  cause
computer  systems to malfunction in the year 2000 and lead  to  significant
business  delays  and  disruptions in the U. S.  and  internationally.  The
Company  has begun the process of identifying internal computer code  which
will  require  modification  to become Year  2000  compliant,  as  well  as
identifying  software provided by third party vendors  which  will  require
modification. The Company is also monitoring the progress of  the  supplier
of  its  securities  processing software and other  industry  suppliers  in
addressing this issue.

     While management has not finalized an estimate of the cost of internal
system  modifications, it does not believe that these  costs  will  have  a
material impact on the Company's operations in fiscal 1998.

      The  impact  of  this  problem  on the securities  industry  will  be
material,  however, since virtually every aspect of the sale of  securities
and  processing of transactions will be affected. Due to the enormous  task
facing the securities industry, and the interdependent nature of securities
transactions, the Company may be adversely affected by this problem in  the
Year  2000  depending  on whether it and the entities  with  whom  it  does
business address this issue successfully.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

      Net  cash  from  operating activities during  the  current  year  was
$300,011,000.   Cash  was  generated by increased client  balances  in  the
credit  interest program and by fluctuations in various asset and liability
accounts.

      Investing activities required $132,415,000 during the year. Additions
to  fixed assets consumed $25,456,000, of which $7.2 million was toward the
construction of a third headquarters building, the remainder  was  for  the
purchase  of  computers,  office furniture and equipment.   Net  purchases,
sales   and  maturations  of  investments  consumed  $106,959,000.    These
investments were primarily mortgage-backed securities purchased by  Raymond
James Bank, FSB.

      Financing  activities required $14,086,000, the result  of  dividends
paid  on the Company's common stock and repayments on a subsidiary's credit
line.

      The  Company  has notes payable consisting of debt in the  amount  of
$12.7 million in the form of a mortgage on its headquarters office building
with  a balloon payment due on December 1, 1997. The Company has refinanced
the existing mortgage, as well as added additional financing for a total of
$20  million. The Company has also committed to an additional borrowing  of
$20 million to be executed on or before July 31, 1998, upon completion of a
third office building currently under construction.

      The  Company  has  two committed lines of credit.  During  1995,  the
parent company obtained an unsecured $50 million line for general corporate
purposes.  In  1996, a $50 million line was established to finance  Raymond
James  Credit Corporation, a Regulation G subsidiary organized  to  provide
loans  collateralized by restricted or control shares of public  companies.
In  addition,  Raymond  James & Associates, Inc. has uncommitted  lines  of
credit aggregating $285,000,000.

      The  Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to requirements
of  the  SEC  relating  to liquidity and capital standards  (see  Notes  to
Consolidated Financial Statements).



Effects of Recently Issued Accounting Standards

      During  fiscal 1996, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")
issued Statement No. 125 "Accounting for Transfers and Security of Financial
Assets  and Extingushment of Liabilites" (FAS 125). During fiscal 1997,  the
FASB  issued statement No. 127, which defers certain provisions of  FAS  125
until January 1, 1998. The impact of adopting FAS 125 is not anticipated  to
have  a  material effect on the Company's financial position or  results  of
operations.

      Also  during fiscal 1997 the FASB issued statements No. 128  "Earnings
per Share" (FAS 128), No. 130 "Reporting Comprehensive Income" (FAS 130) and
No.   131   "Disclosures  about  Segments  of  an  Enterprise  and   Related
Information"  (FAS  131). These statements are not  anticipated  to  have  a
material   effect  on  the  Company's  financial  position  or  results   of
operations.  However, FAS 128 requires a change in the  earnings  per  share
disclosures  and  FAS  130  requires additional  disclosures  of  the  items
included  in  comprehensive  income. FAS 131 requires  extensive  additional
disclosures  regarding the Company's reportable operating segments  used  by
management  to  evaluate  segment performance and  decide  how  to  allocate
resources.  The  Company  plans to adopt all three of  these  statements  in
fiscal 1998.

     During fiscal 1997 the Securities and Exchange Commission issued market
risk  disclosure requirements to enhance disclosures of accounting  policies
for  derivatives and other financial instruments and to provide quantitative
and  qualitative  disclosures about market risk inherent in derivatives  and
other  financial instruments. The Company performed an entity-wide  analysis
of  the  Company's financial instruments and assessed the related  risk  and
materiality  in  accordance with the rules. Based on this analysis,  in  the
opinion  of  management,  the  market risk  associated  with  the  Company's
financial instruments at September 26, 1997 will not have a material adverse
effect  on  the consolidated financial position or results of operations  of
the Company.

Effects of Inflation

      The  Company's  assets  are primarily liquid in  nature  and  are  not
significantly   affected  by  inflation.   Management  believes   that   the
replacement  cost  of  property and equipment would  not  materially  affect
operating  results.  However, the rate of inflation  affects  the  Company's
expenses,  including  employee compensation, communications  and  occupancy,
which  may not be readily recoverable through charges for services  provided
by the Company.


Factors Affecting "Forward-Looking Statements"

     From time to time, the Company may publish "forward-looking statements"
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
and  Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,  or
make  oral  statements  that constitute forward-looking  statements.   These
forward-looking  statements  may  relate  to  such  matters  as  anticipated
financial  performance,  future  revenues or earnings,  business  prospects,
projected  ventures,  new  products,  anticipated  market  performance,  and
similar  matters.   The Private Securities Litigation  Reform  Act  of  1995
provides  a safe harbor for forward-looking statements.  In order to  comply
with  the  terms  of the safe harbor, the Company cautions  readers  that  a
variety  of  factors  could  cause the Company's actual  results  to  differ
materially  from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed  in
the  Company's  forward-looking statements.  These risks and  uncertainties,
many of which are beyond the Company's control, include, but are not limited
to:   (i)  transaction volume in the securities markets, (ii) the volatility
of  the  securities  markets, (iii) fluctuations  in  interest  rates,  (iv)
changes  in  regulatory requirements which could affect the  cost  of  doing
business,  (v)  fluctuations  in  currency  rates,  (vi)  general   economic
conditions,  both domestic and international, (vii) changes in the  rate  of
inflation and related impact on securities markets, (viii) competition  from
existing financial institutions and other new participants in the securities
markets, (ix) legal developments affecting the litigation experience of  the
securities  industry, and (x) changes in federal and state  tax  laws  which
could  affect the popularity of products sold by the Company.   The  Company
does  not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-
looking statements.

          REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Raymond James Financial, Inc.

In our opinion, based upon our audits and the report of other auditors, the
accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  listed  in   the   index
appearing  on  page  F-1  present fairly, in  all  material  respects,  the
financial position of Raymond James Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries at
September  26,  1997  and  September 27, 1996, and  the  results  of  their
operations  and their cash flows for each of the three years in the  period
ended  September 26, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.  These  financial  statements are  the  responsibility  of  the
Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on  these
financial  statements based on our audits.  We did not audit the  financial
statements  of  Raymond James Bank, FSB, a wholly-owned  subsidiary,  which
statements  reflect  total  assets  of  $328,519,000  and  $227,176,000  at
September 26, 1997 and September 27, 1996, respectively, and total revenues
of  $17,712,000, $12,121,000 and $7,304,000 for each of the three years  in
the  period  ended September 26, 1997.  Those statements  were  audited  by
other  auditors  whose report thereon has been furnished  to  us,  and  our
opinion expressed herein, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for
Raymond  James  Bank,  FSB, is based solely on  the  report  of  the  other
auditors.   We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance  with
generally  accepted  auditing standards which  require  that  we  plan  and
perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the
financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit  includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in  the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used  and
significant  estimates  made  by management,  and  evaluating  the  overall
financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that  our  audits  and  the
report  of  other  auditors  provide a reasonable  basis  for  the  opinion
expressed above.

   The accompanying Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements are integral parts of these financial statem
ents.


                RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

      Raymond James Financial, Inc. is a holding company which, through its
subsidiaries, is engaged principally in the securities brokerage  business,
including  the underwriting, distribution, trading and brokerage of  equity
and  debt  securities  and the sale of mutual funds  and  other  investment
products.  In  addition,  it provides investment  management  services  for
retail  and  institutional customers and banking  and  trust  services  for
retail  customers. The accounting and reporting policies of  Raymond  James
Financial,  Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") conform to  generally
accepted   accounting  principles,  the  more  significant  of  which   are
summarized below:

Basis of consolidation

      The  consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Raymond
James  Financial,  Inc.  and  its subsidiaries.  All  material  intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

     All consolidated subsidiaries are 100% owned by the Company except for
RJ Properties, Inc., which is 85% owned.

Reporting period

     The Company's fiscal year ends on the last Friday in September of each
year.

Recognition of revenues

      Securities transactions and related commission revenues and  expenses
are recorded on a trade date basis.

      Revenues  from  investment  banking are  recorded  at  the  time  the
transaction is completed and the related income is reasonably determinable.
Investment banking revenues include sales credits earned in connection with
the  distribution of the underwritten securities. Any warrants received  in
connection  with investment banking transactions are carried at  a  nominal
value  until  such time as the warrants are exercisable and the  underlying
shares are salable.

      The  Company  earns  an advisory fee based on a client's  portfolio
value  on portfolios managed by its investment advisor subsidiaries.  These
fees are recorded under the accrual method.

Management estimates and assumptions

      The  preparation of consolidated financial statements  in  conformity
with  generally accepted accounting principles requires management to  make
estimates  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of  assets  and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of  the  consolidated  financial statements and  the  reported  amounts  of
revenues  and  expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results  could
differ from those estimates.
Cash and cash equivalents

      The  Company considers all highly liquid investments with an  initial
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents for purposes of the
consolidated statement of cash flows.  These consist primarily of shares of
money  market  funds  and  of  U.S.  Treasury  Securities  purchased  under
agreements  to resell, some of which are held in special reserve  accounts,
and are stated at cost, which approximates market at fiscal yearend.

      It  is  the  Company's  policy to obtain possession  and  control  of
securities  purchased  under resale agreements.   The  net  fair  value  of
securities  purchased under resale agreements approximates  their  carrying
value,  as  such  financial  instruments are  predominantly  short-term  in
nature. The Company monitors the risk of loss by assessing the market value
of  the  underlying  securities as compared to the  related  receivable  or
payable,  including  accrued interest, and requests  additional  collateral
where  deemed appropriate.  At September 26, 1997, and September 27,  1996,
there were no agreements with any individual counterparties where the  risk
of loss exceeded 10% of shareholders' equity.

Securities owned

     The Company accounts for securities owned in accordance with Statement
of   Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  115,  "Accounting  for  Certain
Investments  in Debt and Equity Securities" ("FAS 115").  FAS 115  requires
investments in debt and equity securities to be classified as either  "held
to   maturity,"   "trading,"  or  "available  for  sale."   The  accounting
treatment  for  unrealized  gains and losses on those  securities  is  then
determined by the classification chosen. The trading and investment account
securities  held by the brokerage subsidiaries are classified  as  trading.
Investment  account  securities  not  readily  marketable  are  carried  at
estimated fair value as determined by management with unrealized gains  and
losses  included  in earnings.  Trading securities are  carried  at  market
value  with realized and unrealized gains and losses included in  earnings.
Securities  available for sale are carried at estimated market value,  with
unrealized   gains  and  losses  reported  as  a  separate   component   of
shareholders' equity, net of deferred taxes, and realized gains and losses,
determined on a specific identification basis, included in earnings.

Property and equipment

     Property, equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost less
accumulated  depreciation.  Depreciation of assets is provided  principally
using  the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes  over  the
estimated  useful lives of the assets, which range from two to seven  years
for  furniture and equipment and fifteen to thirty-one years for  buildings
and  land  improvements.  Leasehold improvements are  amortized  using  the
straight-line  method over the shorter of the lease term or  the  estimated
useful  lives  of  the  assets.   For  income  tax  purposes,  assets   are
depreciated using accelerated methods.


      Additions,  improvements and expenditures for repairs and maintenance
that  significantly  extend the useful life of an  asset  are  capitalized.
Other expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to operations in
  the period  incurred.  Gains and losses on disposals of fixed assets  are
reflected in income in the period realized.

Goodwill

       Goodwill   is   stated   at  cost  less  accumulated   amortization.
Amortization  of  goodwill is provided using the straight-line  method  for
financial  reporting purposes over three years.  Goodwill is  reflected  in
prepaid expenses and other assets.

Correspondent clearing

      Under clearing agreements, the Company clears trades for unaffiliated
correspondent brokers and retains a portion of commissions as a fee for its
services.    The  Company  records  clearing  charges  net  of  commissions
remitted.  Total commissions generated by correspondents were  $21,334,000,
$18,742,000  and $16,155,000, and commissions remitted totaled $16,832,000,
$14,757,000  and  $12,434,000  for  the years  ended  September  26,  1997,
September 27, 1996 and September 29, 1995, respectively.

Income taxes

      The  Company  utilizes the asset and liability  approach  defined  in
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes"  ("FAS  109").   FAS 109 requires the recognition  of  deferred  tax
assets  and  liabilities  for  the  expected  future  tax  consequences  of
temporary differences between the financial statement amounts and  the  tax
bases of assets and liabilities.

Net income per share

      Net  income per share is computed using weighted average common stock
and common stock equivalents outstanding.  Common stock equivalents include
shares  issuable under stock options and are determined under the  treasury
stock method.  All per share amounts have been restated to give retroactive
effect to the common stock dividend paid on April 3, 1997.

Reclassifications

       Certain  amounts  from  prior  years  have  been  reclassified   for
consistency  with current year presentation.  These reclassifications  were
not material to the consolidated financial statements.

                RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 - RECEIVABLES FROM AND PAYABLES TO CUSTOMERS:

      Receivables  from and payables to customers include  amounts  arising
from  normal  cash and margin transactions.  Securities owned by  brokerage
customers are held as collateral for receivables.  Such collateral  is  not
reflected  in  the  accompanying consolidated  financial  statements.   The
amount  receivable from customers is shown net of an allowance for doubtful
accounts of approximately $824,000 and $1,204,000 as of September 26,  1997
and September 27, 1996, respectively.  The Company pays interest at varying
rates for qualifying customer funds on deposit awaiting reinvestment.  Such
funds  on  deposit totaled $961,857,000 and $755,281,000 at  September  26,
1997 and September 27, 1996, respectively.  Other funds on deposit on which
the Company does not pay interest totaled $224,814,000 and $130,547,000  at
September  26,  1997  and  September  27,  1996,  respectively.   Unsecured
receivables, other than affiliated company amounts which are eliminated  in
consolidation, are not significant.

NOTE 4 - LEVERAGED LEASES (in thousands):

      On  September 24, 1993, the Company became the lessor in their  first
leveraged  commercial aircraft transaction with a major  domestic  airline.
On  June  27, 1996, the Company entered into their second such transaction.
The  Company's combined equity investments represented 21% of the aggregate
purchase prices; the remaining 79% was funded by public debt issues in  the
form of equipment trust certificates.  The residual values of the aircrafts
at  the  end of an average lease term of 20 years are projected  to  be  an
average of 10% of the original cost.

NOTE 6 - BORROWINGS:

      The  mortgage  note payable requires monthly principal  and  interest
payments  of approximately $120,000 with a balloon payment due December  1,
1997.   The  mortgage  bears interest at 9.75%  and  is  secured  by  land,
buildings and improvements with a net book value of $9,585,000 at September
26,  1997.  In December 1997, the Company refinanced the existing  mortgage
note,  as  well as added additional financing for a total of  $20  million.
Principal  maturities under this mortgage note payable for  the  succeeding
five years are as follows: $190,275 in 1998, $303,474 in 1999, $326,610  in
2000,  $351,511  in  2001,  and $378,311 in  2002.  The  Company  has  also
committed  to an additional borrowing of $20 million to be executed  on  or
before  July  31,  1998,  upon the completion of a  third  office  building
currently  under  construction. The total  cost  of  the  new  building  is
estimated  to  be $30 million, of which $7.2 million had been  incurred  at
fiscal yearend. Both mortgages will bear interest at 7.37% for a term of 10
years  from  the  date  of funding the first $20 million,  with  a  balloon
payment  due  on December 1, 2007. The mortgages will be secured  by  land,
three office buildings, and improvements.

      The  Company  has  two  $50 million committed lines  of  credit  with
commercial  banks.  Borrowings under the lines of credit bear  interest  at
various  rates  (the lesser of prime rate or Fed Funds plus .5%,  or  LIBOR
plus  .75%). The lines of credit require that the Company, or  one  of  its
subsidiaries,  maintain certain net worth levels, limit  other  leases  and
debt  and   require  the  Company to follow certain other   sound  business
practices.   The  Company  paid  $63,000,  $64,000  and  $42,000  in   loan
commitment  fees on these lines during fiscal years 1997,  1996  and  1995,
respectively.   There  were  borrowings of $1,500,000  and  $11,989,000  at
September  26,  1997  and  September 27, 1996, collateralized  by  customer
securities with a maximum loan to value of fifty percent. The interest rate
on  these borrowings was the one-month LIBOR rate plus .75% and ranged from
6.1% to 6.4% in 1997 and from 6.1% to 6.8% during 1996.

      The  Company  also maintains uncommitted lines of credit  aggregating
$285,000,000  with commercial banks ($200,000,000 secured  and  $85,000,000
unsecured).   Borrowings under the lines of credit bear  interest,  at  the
Company's  option, at the bank's prime rate, Fed Funds rate plus 1.25%,  or
LIBOR  plus  .75%.   There were no short-term borrowings outstanding  under
these lines at September 26, 1997 or September 27, 1996.  The interest rate
on  these borrowings ranged from 5.87% to 7.25% in 1997 and 5.64% to  6.50%
in   1996.   Loans  on  the  secured,  uncommitted  lines  of  credit   are
collateralized by firm or customer margin securities.

NOTE 7 - BANK OPERATIONS AND DEPOSITS:

      On  May 6, 1994, the Company chartered Raymond James Bank, FSB,  ("RJ
Bank") in conjunction with the purchase of the deposits of certain branches
of a federal savings bank from the Resolution Trust Corporation ("RTC") for
a  nominal purchase price.  The Company contributed $25 million in  capital
to fund RJ Bank's start-up.

September   27,  1996  were  approximately  $80,942,000  and   $43,834,000,
respectively

      A  summary of loan distribution (in thousands) at September 26,  1997
and September 27, 1996 is as follows:

                                   ==========================
  
      Activity in the allowance for loan losses for 1997 and 1996  consists
solely  of the provision for loan losses.  There were no actual loan losses
in 1997 or 1996.

      There  was  no  recorded investment or interest income recognized  on
impaired loans during 1997 and 1996, as there were no impaired loans during
these periods.

      Generally,  mortgage  loans are secured by  either  first  or  second
mortgages on residential property, and consumer loans are secured  by  time
deposit accounts.  As of September 26, 1997 and September 27, 1996, all  of
RJ Bank's loan portfolio was secured.

      RJ Bank is subject to various regulatory and capital requirements and
was in compliance with all requirements throughout the fiscal year.

      Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act
of  1991 ("FDICIA"), RJ Bank is subject to rules limiting brokered deposits
and related interest rates.  Under these rules, banks that are deemed "well-
capitalized"  may accept brokered deposits without restriction,  and  banks
deemed "adequately capitalized" may do so with a waiver from the FDIC.   An
"undercapitalized"  bank is not eligible for a waiver and  may  not  accept
brokered  deposits.   At  September  26,  1997  and  September  27,   1996,
management  believes  RJ  Bank met the definition of  the  well-capitalized
category.

      At  September 26, 1997 and September 27, 1996, RJ Bank  exceeded  the
tangible  capital,  core capital, core/leverage capital, Tier  I/risk-based
capital  and  total  risk-based capital levels mandated  by  the  Financial
Institutions  Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 and  FDICIA.  At
September  26,  1997 and September 27, 1996, RJ Bank's Tier  I  capital  to
average assets ratio was 9.3% and 13.8%, respectively.

NOTE 9 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:
      Long-term lease agreements expire at various times from 1998  through
2002. Minimum annual rentals under such agreements for the succeeding  five
fiscal  years  are approximately: $7,640,000 in 1998, $6,520,000  in  1999,
$5,793,000  in  2000, $5,039,000 in 2001, and $3,877,000 in  2002.   Rental
expense  incurred  under all leases, including equipment  under  short-term
agreements, aggregated $8,802,000, $7,589,000, and $5,481,000 in 1997, 1996
and 1995, respectively.

      The  Company has committed to lend to, or guarantee other  debt  for,
Raymond  James Tax Credit Funds VI Ltd. ("RJ Tax Credit") up to $10 million
upon  request.  Any borrowings bear interest at broker  call  plus  1%  per
annum.  RJ Tax Credit is charged 1% for amounts guaranteed.  The borrowings
are  secured  by  properties under development.   At  September  26,  1997,
balances of $4,530,000 were loaned to RJ Tax Credit. At September 27,  1996
balances of $1,892,000 were guaranteed.  The commitment expired in November
1997  at  which  time  any outstanding balances were due  and  payable.  On
November  18,  1997,  the  Board of Directors renewed  the  commitment  and
increased the amount to $15 million expiring in November 1998.

     In the normal course of business, the Company enters into underwriting
commitments.  Transactions relating to such commitments that were  open  at
September 26, 1997 and were subsequently settled had no material effect  on
the consolidated financial statements as of that date.

      The  Company  utilizes a letter of credit and deposits with  clearing
organizations  to  satisfy margin deposit requirements.  At  September  26,
1997, and September 27, 1996 the Company had a letter of credit outstanding
of  $100,000  and  customer  margin securities valued  at  $54,448,000  and
$20,599,000, respectively, on deposit with a clearing organization.

      In the normal course of business, the Company, as general partner, is
contingently  liable  for the obligations of various  limited  partnerships
engaged primarily in securities investments and real estate activities.  In
the  opinion  of the Company, such liabilities, if any, for the obligations
of  the  partnerships  will not in the aggregate have  a  material  adverse
effect on the Company's consolidated financial position.

      The  Company  is  a  defendant or co-defendant  in  various  lawsuits
incidental  to  its  securities business.  The Company  is  contesting  the
allegations  of the complaints in these cases and believes that  there  are
meritorious defenses in each of these lawsuits.  In view of the number  and
diversity  of  claims against the Company, the number of  jurisdictions  in
which  litigation is pending and the inherent difficulty of predicting  the
outcome  of  litigation  and other claims, the Company  cannot  state  with
certainty  what the eventual outcome of pending litigation or other  claims
will  be.  In the opinion of management, based on discussions with counsel,
the outcome of the matters will not result in a material adverse effect  on
the  consolidated  financial  position or  results  of  operations  of  the
Company.

NOTE 10 - CAPITAL TRANSACTIONS:

      The  Company's  Board of Directors has, from time  to  time,  adopted
resolutions authorizing the Company to repurchase its common stock for  the
funding  of its incentive stock option and stock purchase plans  and  other
corporate purposes.  Through September 26, 1997, the Board of Directors has
authorized  the  repurchase of a cumulative total of  8,617,500  shares  of
common  stock, of which 7,120,000 shares have been purchased  through  that
date.

      In February 1997, the Company's Board of Directors declared a 3-for-2
stock  split  in  the  form  of  a dividend.  The  additional  shares  were
distributed  on April 3, 1997 to shareholders of record on March  7,  1997.
All  references  (unless  otherwise noted) in  the  consolidated  financial
statements and accompanying notes to amounts per share and to the number of
common  shares have been restated to give retroactive effect to  the  stock
dividend.

NOTE 11 - EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS:

      The  Company's profit sharing plan and employee stock ownership  plan
provide  certain death, disability or retirement benefits for all employees
who  meet certain service requirements.  Such benefits become fully  vested
after  seven  years of qualified service.  The Company also offers  a  plan
pursuant to section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, which provides for
the  Company  to match 100% of the first $500 and 50% of the next  $500  of
compensation deferred by each participant annually.  The Company's deferred
management  bonus  plan  is a non-qualified plan that  provides  retirement
benefits  for employees who meet certain length of service and compensation
requirements.   Contributions to these plans are made in  amounts  approved
annually   by  the  Board  of  Directors.   Compensation  expense  includes
aggregate  contributions  to these plans of $15,462,000,  $12,527,000,  and
$8,530,000 for 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.


Stock Compensation Plans

      At  September  26, 1997 the Company has six stock-based  compensation
plans,  which  are  described below. In accordance with the  provisions  of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-
Based  Compensation"  ("FAS  123"),the  Company  applies  APB  Opinion  25,
"Accounting  for Stock Issued to Employees" and related interpretations  in
accounting  for  these  plans.  If the Company  had  elected  to  recognize
compensation expense based on the fair value at the grant dates for  awards
under   these   plans  consistent  with  the  methodology   prescribed   by
FAS 123, the Company's net income and net income per share would have been
reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:


                                             1997      1996        1995
                                           -----------------------------
Net income (in thousands)     As reported  $98,915   $65,978     $46,141
                              Pro forma    $95,936   $64,902     $45,755

Net income per share          As reported  $  3.06   $  2.09     $  1.49
                              Pro forma    $  2.97   $  2.06     $  1.47

     These proforma amounts may not be representative of future disclosures
since  the  estimated fair value of stock options is amortized  to  expense
over  the  vesting period and additional options may be granted  in  future
years.  For disclosure purposes, the fair value of each fixed option  grant
is  estimated  on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes  option-pricing
model with the following weighted average assumptions used for stock option
grants  in 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively: dividend yields of 1.1%  for
all  3  years;  expected volatility of 32.2%, 31.5%  and  33.0%,  risk-free
interest rates of 6.28%, 5.89%, and 7.17% and expected lives of 5.99,  4.89
and 4.91 years.


Fixed Stock Option Plans

      The  Company  has  five  fixed stock option  plans.  Under  the  1982
Incentive Stock Option Plan, the Company may grant options to its employees
for up to 2,850,188 shares of common stock. Under the 1992 Incentive  Stock
Option Plan, the Company may grant options to its management personnel  for
up  to  1,575,000 shares of common stock. The 1992 Plan was established  to
replace, on substantially the same terms and conditions, the 1982 Plan.  On
November 18, 1997 the Board of Directors approved, subject to shareholders'
approval,  an  amendment to add 1,500,000 shares of  common  stock  to  the
number  of shares authorized for option grants under the 1992 Plan. Options
are  granted to key administrative employees and registered representatives
of  Raymond  James & Associates, Inc. who achieve certain gross  commission
levels.  Options are exercisable in the 36th to 72nd months  following  the
date of grant and only in the event that the grantee is an employee of  the
Company at that time.

      Under  one  of  the Company's non-qualified stock option  plans,  the
Company  may  grant up to 1,519,500 shares of common stock  to  independent
contractor  registered representatives. Options are exercisable five  years
after grant date provided that the representative is still associated  with
the  Company.  Under the Company's second non-qualified stock option  plan,
the  Company may grant up to 99,840 shares of common stock to the Company's
outside  directors. Options vest over a five year period  from  grant  date
provided  that the director is still serving on the Board of  the  Company.
Under the Company's third non-qualified stock option plan, the Company  may
grant  up  to  750,000 shares of common stock to key management  personnel.
Option terms are specified in individual agreements and expire on a date no
later  than  the tenth anniversary of the grant date. Under all plans,  the
exercise  price  of each option equals the market price  of  the  Company's
stock on the date of grant and an option's maximum term is 10 years.


A summary of the status of the Company's five fixed stock option plans as
of September 26, 1997, September 27, 1996 and September 29, 1995 and
changes during the years ending on those dates is presented below:

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
                                     
      Under  the  1994  Employee  Stock Purchase  Plan,  the  Company  is
authorized to issue up to 750,000 shares of common stock to its full-time
employees,  nearly  all  of whom are eligible to participate.  Under  the
terms  of  the  Plan, employees can choose each year to  have  up  to  20
percent  of their annual compensation specified to purchase the Company's
common  stock.  Share purchases in any calendar year are limited  to  the
lesser  of  1,000  shares or shares with a market value of  $25,000.  The
purchase price of the stock is 85 percent of the market price on the  day
prior  to  the  purchase date. Under the Plan, the Company  sold  179,071
shares,  159,296 shares and 159,228 shares to employees in  fiscal  years
1997,  1996,  and 1995, respectively. The compensation cost  which  would
have been recognized for the fair value of the employees' purchase rights
was calculated as the value of the 15% discount from market value.

NOTE 12 - NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS:

      The  broker-dealer subsidiaries of the Company are subject  to  the
requirements  of  the Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule  15c3-1)  under  the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules of the securities exchanges
of  which Raymond James & Associates, Inc. is a member whose requirements
are   substantially  the  same.   This  Rule  requires   that   aggregate
indebtedness,  as  defined,  not exceed fifteen  times  net  capital,  as
defined.  Rule  15c3-1  also  provides for an  "alternative  net  capital
requirement" which, if elected, requires that net capital be equal to the
greater  of $250,000 or two percent of aggregate debit items computed  in
applying the formula for determination of reserve requirements (see  Note
13).  The New York Stock Exchange, Inc. may require a member organization
to  reduce  its business if its net capital is less than four percent  of
aggregate  debit items and may prohibit a member firm from expanding  its
business  and  declaring cash dividends if its net capital is  less  than
five  percent  of  aggregate debit items.  Net capital positions  of  the
Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries were as follows:

NOTE 13 - RESERVE REQUIREMENTS:

     Rule 15c3-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 specifies certain
conditions under which brokers and dealers carrying customer accounts are
required  to  maintain cash or qualified securities in a special  reserve
account  for  the  exclusive  benefit  of  customers.   Amounts   to   be
maintained,  if  required,  are computed in  accordance  with  a  formula
defined  in the Rule.  At September 26, 1997, Raymond James & Associates,
Inc.  had  $692,429,000 in special reserve accounts  which  consisted  of
$692,054,000  of U.S. Treasury Securities purchased under  agreements  to
resell  and  $375,000  in cash, as compared to a reserve  requirement  of
$608,298,000  at that date.  At September 27, 1996, this  subsidiary  had
$477,064,000  in special reserve accounts which consisted of $476,945,000
of  U.S.  Treasury Securities purchased under agreements  to  resell  and
$119,000 in cash, as compared to a reserve requirement of $474,430,000 at
that date.  At September 26, 1997, such repurchase agreements were on  an
overnight  basis  with  Deutsche Bank, BT Securities  Corporation,  First
Union  Capital  Markets Corp., and Morgan Stanley and  Company,  Inc.  At
September 27, 1996, such repurchase agreements were on an overnight basis
with Cantor Fitzgerald Partners and Eastbridge Capital, Inc.  The Company
monitors the market value of the underlying securities as compared to the
related  receivable, including accrued interest, and requires  additional
collateral where deemed appropriate.

     Investment Management & Research, Inc. and Robert Thomas Securities,
Inc. are exempt from the provisions of Rule 15c3-3, since they clear  all
transactions  with  and  for customers on a fully  disclosed  basis  with
Raymond James & Associates, Inc.


NOTE 14 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK:

      In  the normal course of business, the Company purchases and  sells
securities  as either principal or agent on behalf of its customers.   If
either  the customer or a counterparty fails to perform, the Company  may
be  required to discharge the obligations of the nonperforming party.  In
such circumstances, the Company may sustain a loss if the market value of
the security or futures contract is different from the contract value  of
the transaction.

      The Company also acts as an intermediary between broker-dealers and
other financial institutions whereby the Company borrows securities  from
one  broker-dealer  and then lends them to another.  Securities  borrowed
and  securities  loaned  are carried at the amounts  of  cash  collateral
advanced  and received in connection with the transactions.  The  Company
measures  the market value of the securities borrowed and loaned  against
the  cash  collateral on a daily basis.  The market value  of  securities
borrowed  and  securities  loaned  was $1,034,408,000  and  $998,698,000,
respectively,  at  September 26, 1997 and $816,362,000 and  $798,968,000,
respectively,  at  September 27, 1996. Additional  cash  is  obtained  as
necessary to ensure such transactions are adequately collateralized.   If
another  party  to the transaction fails to perform as  agreed  (such  as
failure  to  deliver a security or failure to pay for  a  security),  the
Company may incur a loss if the market value of the security is different
from the contract amount of the transaction.

      The  Company  has  also loaned, to brokers and dealers,  securities
owned  by  customers and others for which it has received cash  or  other
collateral.  If a borrowing institution or broker-dealer does not  return
a  security,  the  Company may be obligated to purchase the  security  in
order  to return it to the owner. In such circumstances, the Company  may
incur  a  loss  equal  to the amount by which the  market  value  of  the
security on the date of nonperformance exceeds the value of the loan from
the institution or the collateral from the broker or dealer.

      The Company has sold securities that it does not currently own  and
will,  therefore, be obligated to purchase such securities  at  a  future
date.   The Company has recorded $52,596,000 and $57,210,000 at September
26,  1997  and  September 27, 1996, respectively,  which  represents  the
market  value  of the related securities at such dates.  The  Company  is
subject to loss if the market price of those securities not covered by  a
hedged  position  increases subsequent to fiscal year end.   The  Company
utilizes short government obligations and equity securities to hedge long
proprietary  inventory positions. At September 26, 1997, the Company  had
$21,123,000  in  short  government obligations and  $1,925,000  in  short
equity  securities which represented hedge positions.  At  September  27,
1996,  the  Company had $31,203,000 in short government  obligations  and
$512,000 in short equity securities which represented hedge positions.

      The  Company  enters into security transactions  involving  forward
settlement.  The Company has recorded transactions with a contract  value
of  $196,156,000  and $18,258,000 and a market value of $195,063,000  and
$18,033,000   as   of  September  26,  1997  and  September   27,   1996,
respectively.   Transactions involving future  settlement  give  rise  to
market risk, which represents the potential loss that can be caused by  a
change  in  the  market value of a particular financial instrument.   The
Company's  exposure to market risk is determined by a number of  factors,
including  the  size, composition and diversification of positions  held,
the   absolute  and  relative  levels  of  interest  rates,  and   market
volatility.

      The  majority of the Company's transactions and, consequently,  the
concentration  of  its credit exposure is with customers,  broker-dealers
and  other financial institutions in the United States.  These activities
primarily  involve collateralized arrangements and may result  in  credit
exposure in the event that the counterparty fails to meet its contractual
obligations.   The  Company's exposure to credit  risk  can  be  directly
impacted  by volatile securities markets which may impair the ability  of
counterparties  to  satisfy their contractual obligations.   The  Company
seeks  to  control  its credit risk through a variety  of  reporting  and
control  procedures, including establishing credit limits  based  upon  a
review  of  the  counterparties' financial condition and credit  ratings.
The  Company  monitors collateral levels on a daily basis for  compliance
with   regulatory  and  internal  guidelines  and  requests  changes   in
collateral levels as appropriate.


NOTE 15 - RELATED PARTIES:

      On  October  27, 1994, the Company and the then President  and  Chief
Investment   Officer  of  its  Eagle  Asset  Management,   Inc.   ("Eagle")
subsidiary,  Herbert  E.  Ehlers  ("Ehlers"),  entered  into  a  Separation
Agreement  by  which Ehlers (a director of the Company) and  certain  other
Eagle  personnel  became  employees  of  a  new  firm,  Liberty  Investment
Management,  Inc. ("Liberty"), effective December 31, 1994.   Ehlers  began
operating Liberty as of January 1, 1995, and he remained a dual employee of
Eagle  and  Liberty through June 1995, continuing as investment manager  on
certain  retail  accounts  until  they were  assigned  to  other  portfolio
managers.   As  of January 1, 1995, Liberty assumed the responsibility  for
providing  investment  management services to institutional  growth  equity
accounts totaling $4.3 billion formerly managed by Eagle.

      In accordance with Ehlers' employment agreement, Eagle was to receive
50%  of  the revenues from these accounts through December 31, 1999,  while
bearing  none  of the expenses.  In addition, the Company  was  granted  an
option  to  purchase  20% of Liberty in the year 2000  at  a  predetermined
price.  For  the  years ended September 26, 1997, September  27,  1996  and
September 29, 1995, Eagle recognized $2,569,000, $9,813,000 and $7,233,000,
respectively,  in  fees  from  Liberty, which are  included  in  investment
advisory  fees  in the consolidated statement of income. At  September  29,
1996,  $5,004,000 due from Liberty is included in other receivables on  the
consolidated statement of financial condition.

      On  January 2, 1997, Liberty sold substantially all of its assets  to
Goldman  Sachs Asset Management, Inc. Accordingly, the Company  received  a
lump  sum  settlement  of  $30.6 million for  its  remaining  three  years'
interest  in Liberty's revenue stream and the Company's option to  purchase
20% of Liberty at a future date.

but shall never be less than three (3) nor more than thirteen (13).



     B.   Interested Directors

          No contract or other transaction between this corporation and any
other  corporation, whether or not a majority of the shares of the  capital
stock of such other corporation is owned by this corporation, and no act of
this  corporation, shall in any way be affected or invalidated by the  fact

Any  director  individually, or any firm of which such director  may  be  a
member,  may  be a party to, or may be pecuniarily or otherwise  interested

known  to  the Board of Directors, or a majority thereof.  Any director  of
this  corporation  who  is  also  a  director  or  officer  of  such  other
corporation,  or  who is so interested, may be counted in  determining  the
existence  of  a  quorum at any meeting of the Board of Directors  of  this
corporation that shall authorize such contract or transaction, and may vote
thereat  to  authorize such contract or transaction, with  like  force  and
effect as if he were not such director or officer of such other corporation
or not so interested.

the  Board of Directors shall, in the performance of his duties,  be  fully
protected  in  relying in good faith upon the books of account  or  reports
made  to  the  company by any of its officials or by an independent  public
accountant or by an appraiser selected with reasonable care by the Board of
Directors  or by any such committee or in relying in good faith upon  other
records of the company.

                               ARTICLE VIII
                                     
                                 Amendment

by  law.   Every  amendment shall be approved by the  Board  of  Directors,
proposed  by  them  to the stockholders, and approved  at  a  stockholders'
meeting  by  a  majority of the stock entitled to vote  thereon;  provided,
however,  that  the provisions set forth in Article V may not  be  altered,
amended or repealed unless such alteration, amendment or repeal is approved
by  the  affirmative  vote  of  two-thirds  (2/3)  of  all  of  the  shares

options ("Options"). These Options are not intended to qualify as Incentive
Stock Options as described in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. The
term "Subsidiaries" means any corporations in which stock possessing 50% or
more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock is owned
directly or indirectly by the Company.

SECTION 2. OPTIONS TO BE GRANTED AND ADMINISTRATION

     2.1    Options to be Granted.   Options granted under the Plan will be
non-qualified Options.

     2.2    Administrative by the Board.   This Plan shall be administered
by the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board"). The Board shall
have full and final authority to operate, manage and administer the Plan on
behalf of the Company. This authority includes, but is not limited to (i)
the power to grant options conditionally or unconditionally; (ii) the power
to prescribe the form or forms of the instruments evidencing options
granted under this Plan; (iii) the power to interpret the Plan; (iv) the
power to provide regulations for the operation of the features of the Plan,
and otherwise to prescribe regulations for interpretation, management and
administration of the Plan; (v) the power to delegate responsibility for
Plan operation, management and administration on such terms, consistent
with the Plan, as the Board may establish; (vi) the power to delegate to
other persons the responsibility for performing ministerial acts in
furtherance of the Plan's purpose and (vii) the power to engage the
services of persons or organizations in furtherance of the Plan's purpose,
including but not limited to, banks, insurance companies, brokerage firms
and consultants.

     In addition, as to each option, the Board shall have full and final
authority in its discretion; (i) to determine the number of shares subject
to each option; (ii) to determine the time or times at which options will
be granted; (iii) to determine the option price for the shares subject to
each option, which price shall be subject to the applicable requirements,
if any, of Section 5.1(c) hereof; and (iv) to determine the time or times
when each option shall become exercisable and the duration of the exercise
period, which shall not exceed the limitations specified in Section 5.1(a).

     2.3    Appointment and Proceedings of Committee.   The Board may
appoint a Stock Option Committee (the "Committee") which shall consist of
the members of the Compensation Committee of the Board. The Board may from
time to time appoint members of the Committee in substitution for, or in
addition to, members previously appointed, remove members (with or without
cause) and fill vacancies, however caused, in the Committee. The Committee
shall select one of its members as its chairman and shall hold its meetings
at such times and places as it shall deem advisable. A majority of its
members shall constitute a quorum, and all actions of the Committee shall
be taken by a majority of its members. Any action may be taken by a written
instrument signed by all of the members, and any action so taken shall be
as fully effective as it had been taken by a vote of a majority of the
members at a meeting duly called and held.

     2.4    Powers of Committee.   Subject to the provisions of this Plan
and the approval of the Board, the Committee shall have the power to make
recommendations to the Board as to whom options should be granted, the
number of shares to be covered by each option, the time or times of option
grants, and the terms and condition of each option. In addition, the
Committee shall have authority to interpret the Plan, to prescribe, amend
and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, and to exercise the
administrative and ministerial powers of the Board with regard to aspects
of the Plan other than the granting of options. The interpretation and
construction by the Committee of any provisions of the Plan, or of any
option granted hereunder, and the exercise of any power delegated to it
hereunder shall be final, unless otherwise determined by the Board. No
member of the Board or the Committee shall be liable for any action or
determination made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any option
granted hereunder.

SECTION 3. STOCK

     3.1    Shares Subject to Plans.   The stock subject to the options
granted under the Plan shall be shares of the Company's authorized but
unissued common stock, par value $.01 per share or treasury shares held by
the Company ("Common Stock"). The total number of shares that may be issued
pursuant to options granted under the Plan shall not exceed an aggregate of
500,000 shares of Common Stock.

     3.2    Lapsed or Unexercised Options.   Whenever any outstanding
option under the Plan expires, is canceled or is otherwise terminated
(other than by exercise), the shares of Common Stock allocable to the
unexercised portion of such option shall be restored to the Plan and be
available for the grant of other options under the Plan.

SECTION 4. ELIGIBILITY

     4.1    Eligible Optionees.   Options may be granted only to officers
and other employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries, including members
of the Board who are also employees of the Company or a Subsidiary.

SECTION 5. TERMS OF THE OPTION AGREEMENTS

     5.1    Mandatory Terms.   Each option agreement shall contain such
provisions as the Board or the Committee shall from time to time deem
appropriate, and shall include provisions relating to the method of
exercise, payment of exercise price, adjustments or changes in the
Company's capitalization and the effect of a merger, consolidation,
liquidation, sale or other disposition of or involving the Company. Option
agreements need not be identical, but each option agreement by appropriate
language shall include the substance of all of the following provisions:

            (a)   Expiration.   Notwithstanding any other provision of the
Plan or of any option agreement, each option shall expire on the date
specified in the option agreement, which date shall not be later than the
tenth anniversary of the date on which the option was granted.

            (b)   Exercise.   Each option shall be deemed exercised when
(i) the Company has received written notice of such exercise in accordance
with the terms of the option, (ii) full payment of the aggregate option
price of the shares of Common Stock as to which the option is exercised has
been made, and (iii) arrangements that are satisfactory to the Board or the
Committee in its sole discretion have been made for the optionee's payment
to the Company of the amount, if any, that is necessary for the Company or
Subsidiary employing the optionee to withhold in accordance with applicable
Federal or state tax withholding requirements. Unless further limited by
the Board or the Committee in any  option, the option price of any shares
of Common Stock purchased shall be paid in cash, by certified or official
bank check, by money order, with shares of Common Stock of the Company or
by a combination of the above; provided further, however, that the Board or
the Committee in its sole discretion may accept a personal check in full or
partial payment of any shares of Common Stock. If the exercise price is
paid in whole or in part with shares, the value of the shares surrendered
shall be their fair market value on the date the option is exercised as
determined in accordance with Section 5.1 (c) hereof. The Company in its
sole discretion may, on an individual basis or pursuant to a general
program established in connection with this Plan, lend money to an
optionee, guarantee an loan to an optionee, or otherwise assist an optionee
to obtain the cash necessary to exercise all or a portion of an option
granted hereunder. No optionee shall be deemed to be a holder of any shares
of Common Stock subject to an option unless and until a stock certificate
or certificates for such shares of Common Stock are issued to such
person(s) under the terms of the Plan. No adjustment shall be made for
dividends (ordinary or extraordinary, whether in cash, securities or other
property) or distributions or other rights for which the record date is
prior to the date such stock certificate is issued, except as expressly
provided in Section 6 hereof. Unless otherwise provided in the terms of an
option, an option must be exercised by the Optionee while he is an Employee
and has maintained since the date of the grant of the option the continuous
status as an Employee.

     Except, as may be otherwise expressly provided in the terms and
conditions of the option granted to an Optionee, options granted hereunder
shall terminate on the earlier to occur of the date of expiration thereof
or:

            (i)   Exercise Upon Disability.   Unless otherwise provided in
the terms of an option, if an Optionee's employment terminates by reason of
a permanent disability, all unexpired options held by the Optionee shall
immediately vest and become fully exercisable. The Optionee shall then be
entitled to exercise the option in whole or in part; provided, however,
such option must be exercised within 12 months following the date that the
Optionee became permanently disabled or by the expiration date of such
option, whichever first occurs. An Optionee is permanently disabled if the
Board determines he is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity
by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which
can be expected to result in death or which has lasted, or can be expected
to last, for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.

            (ii)  Exercise Upon Death.   Except as may otherwise be
expressly provided in the terms and conditions of the option granted to an
Optionee, in the event of the death of an Optionee while in the employment
of the Company and before the date of expiration of such option, all
options held by the Optionee shall immediately vest and become fully
exercisable. Such option shall terminate on the earlier of such date of
expiration or 90 days following the date of such death. After the death of
the Optionee, his executors, administrators or any person or persons to
whom his option may be transferred by will or by laws of descent and
distribution, shall have the right, at any time prior to such termination,
to exercise the option.

          (iii)     Exercise Upon Termination of Employment After Age 60.
Unless otherwise provided in the terms of an option, if an Optionee's
Employment terminates after attainment of age 60, all options held by the
Optionee shall immediately vest and become fully exercisable if: (a)
termination occurs on or after the optionee has attained age 65, the
optionee shall have the right to exercise any or all outstanding options,
in whole or in part, at any time from the date of termination through 90
days thereafter or the expiration date of such option, whichever first
occurs: or, (b)termination occurs prior to the Optionee's attainment of age
65 but after the Optionees attainment of age 60, the Optionee shall have
the right to exercise any or all outstanding Options, in whole or in
part, at any time from the date of termination through 90 days thereafter
or the expiration date of such option, whichever first occurs, provided
that the sum of his years of service with the Company plus his
age at termination from the Company equals at least 75.

            (c)  Purchase Price.   The purchase price per share of the
Common Stock under each option shall be established by the committee on the
date the option is granted.

     For the purpose of the Plan, the "fair market value" per share of
Common Stock on any date of reference shall be the closing Price of the
Common Stock of the Company which is referred to in either clause (i), (ii)
or (iii) below, on such date, or if not referred to in either clause (i),
(ii) or (iii) below, "fair market value" per share of Common Stock shall be
such value as shall be determined by the Board or the Committee.  For this
purpose, the Closing Price of the Common Stock on any business day shall be
(i) if the  Common Stock is listed or admitted for trading on any United
States national securities exchange, or if actual transactions are
otherwise reported on a consolidated transaction reporting system, the last
reported sale price of Common Stock on such exchange or reporting system,
as reported in any newspaper of general circulation, (ii) if the Common
Stock is quoted on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated
Quotations Systems ("NASDAQ"), or any similar system of automated
dissemination of quotations of security prices in common use, the mean
between the closing high bid and low asked quotations of Common Stock for
such day on such system, or (iii) if neither clause (i) or (ii) is
applicable, the mean between the high bid and low asked quotations for the
common Stock as reported by the National Quotation Bureau, Incorporated if
at least two securities dealers have inserted both bid and asked quotations
for Common Stock on at least five of ten preceding days.


     (d)  Transferability of Options.   Unless otherwise specified in the
Option Agreement, options  granted  under the Plan and the rights and
privileges conferred thereby may not be transferred, assigned, pledged or
hypothecated in any manner (whether by operation of law or otherwise) other
than by will or by applicable laws of descent and distribution, and shall
not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process.  Upon any
attempt to transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of
any option under the Plan or any right or privilege conferred hereby,
contrary to the provisions of the Plan, or upon the sale or levy or any
attachment or similar process upon the rights and privileges conferred
hereby, such option shall thereupon terminate and become null and void.

     (e)  Rights of Optionees.   No Optionee shall be deemed for any
purpose to be the owner of any share of Common Stock subject to any option
unless and until (i) the option shall have been exercised pursuant to the
terms thereof, (ii) the Company shall have issued and delivered
certificates evidencing the shares of the Optionee, and (iii) the
Optionee's name shall have been entered as a stockholder of record on the
books of the Company.  Thereupon, the Optionee shall have full voting,
dividend and other ownership rights with respect to such shares of Common
Stock.

SECTION 6.  ADJUSTMENT OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

     6.1  Stock Dividend or Recapitalization.   If at any time while the
Plan is in effect or unexercised options are outstanding, there shall be an
increase or decrease in the number of issued and outstanding shares of
Common Stock through the declaration of a stock dividend or through any
recapitalization resulting in a stock split-up, combination or exchange of
shares of Common Stock, then and in such event (i) appropriate adjustment
shall be made in the maximum number of shares of Common Stock available for
grant under the Plan, so that the same percentage of the Company's issued
and outstanding shares of Common Stock shall continue to be subject to
being so optioned, and (ii) appropriate adjustment shall be made in the
number of shares and the exercise price per share of Common Stock hereof
then subject to any outstanding option, so that the same percentage of the
Company's issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock shall remain
subject to purchase at the same aggregate exercise price.


     6.2  Sale or Conversion of  Shares.   Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, the issuance by the Company of shares of its capital stock
of any class, or securities convertible into shares of capital stock of any
class, either in connection with direct sale or upon the exercise of rights
or warrants to subscribe therefor, or upon conversion of shares or
obligations of the Company convertible into such shares or other
securities, shall not affect and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be
made with respect to the number of or exercise price of shares of Common
Stock then subject to outstanding options granted under the Plan.

     6.3  General.   Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
existence of outstanding options granted under the Plan shall not affect in
any manner the right or power of the Company to make, authorize or
consummate (i) any or all adjustments, recapitalizations, reorganizations
or other changes in the Company's capital structure or its business; (ii)
any merger or consolidation of the Company; (iii) any issue by the Company
of debt securities, or preferred or preference stock that would rank above
the shares subject to outstanding option; (iv) the  dissolution or
liquidation of the Company; (v) any sale, transfer or assignment of all or
any part of the assets or business of the Company; or (vi) any other
corporate act or proceeding , whether of a similar character or otherwise.

Rights and obligations under any option granted before any amendment of the
Plan shall not be altered or impaired by such amendment, except with the
consent of the Optionee.

SECTION 8. NON-EXCLUSIVITY OF THE PLAN

       Neither the adoption of the Plan by the Board nor the approval of
the Plan by the stockholders of the Company shall be construed as creating
any limitations on the power of the Board to adopt such other arrangements
as it may deem desirable, including without limitation the granting of
stock options otherwise than under the Plan, and such arrangements may be
either applicable generally or only in specific cases.

SECTION 9.  CONDITIONS UPON ISSUANCE

     9.1  Conditions Upon Issuance.   The obligation of the Company to sell
and deliver shares of Common Stock with respect to options granted under
the Plan shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules and regulations,

necessary or appropriate by the Board or the Committee.

     9.2  Representation Required.   As a condition to the exercise of an
option, the Company may require the person exercising such option to
represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the Shares are

Company, such a representation is required by any of the aforementioned
relevant provisions of law.
