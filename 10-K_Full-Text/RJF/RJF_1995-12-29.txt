ITEM 1.   BUSINESS

     (a)  General Description of Business

      Raymond  James  Financial, Inc. ("RJF") is  a  Florida-based  holding
company  that  was incorporated in 1974 as a successor to  its  predecessor
corporation  founded in 1962.  Its principal subsidiaries  include  Raymond
James  &  Associates, Inc. ("RJA"), Investment Management & Research,  Inc.
("IM&R"),  Robert Thomas Securities, Inc. ("RTS"), Eagle Asset  Management,
Inc.  ("Eagle"), Heritage Asset Management, Inc. ("Heritage")  and  Raymond
James  Bank, FSB.  All of these subsidiaries are wholly-owned by RJF.   RJF
and  its  subsidiaries  are hereinafter collectively  referred  to  as  the
"Company".

      RJF's  principal subsidiary, RJA, was organized in Florida  in  1962.
RJA  is a regional securities brokerage firm engaged in most aspects of the
securities  business.   All but 11 of RJA's 40 retail  branch  offices  are
located in Florida, and the Company is the largest brokerage and investment
firm  headquartered  in  that state.  RJA also has 13  institutional  sales
offices, 6 of which are located in Europe.  RJA is a member of the New York
Stock Exchange ("NYSE") and other principal stock and option exchanges.

      IM&R  was  formed  in  1973  as an independent  contractor  financial
planning  organization and participates in the distribution of all products
and services offered by RJA to its retail customers through its 417 offices
and  74  satellite  offices in all 50 states.  IM&R  is  a  member  of  the
National Association of Securities Dealers ("NASD") and Securities Investor
Protection Corporation ("SIPC"), but not of any exchange, as it clears  its
trades on a fully-disclosed basis through RJA.

      RTS  was organized in 1981.  It serves independent contractor brokers
who  do a majority of their business in individual securities and currently
operates  272  branch offices and 81 satellite offices in 47 states.   RTS,
like IM&R, is a member of the NASD and SIPC, but not of any exchange, as it
also clears all of its business on a fully-disclosed basis through RJA.

      Eagle  was formed in 1984 as a registered investment advisor  and  at
September  29, 1995 had approximately $1.9 billion of client  assets  under
management.   Prior  to  the  inception  of  Eagle,  the  asset  management
operation had been a division of RJA.

      Heritage was organized in 1985 to act as the manager of the Company's
internally  sponsored Heritage family of mutual funds.   At  September  29,
1995 the six funds managed by Heritage had a total of over $1.9 billion  in
assets.

     Raymond James Bank was formed in 1994 in conjunction with the purchase
from the RTC of the deposits of a failed thrift.  Its primary purpose is to
provide  traditional banking products and services to the  clients  of  the
Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries.  At September 29, 1995, Raymond James
Bank had $128 million in assets.
     (b)  Financial Information about Industry Segments

     The Company's operations consist of various financial services provided to
its clients.  The following table shows revenues by source for the last three
years:

     (c)  Narrative Description of Business

     At  September  29,  1995  the  Company employed  2,639  individuals.   RJA
employed  2,166  of  these  individuals, 485 of  whom  were  full-time  account
executives.   In  addition, 1,803 full-time account executives were  affiliated
with  the  Company  as  independent  contractors.   Through  its  broker-dealer
subsidiaries, the Company provides securities services to approximately 470,000
client  accounts.  No single client accounts for a material percentage  of  the
Company's total business.
                     Raymond James & Associates, Inc.

      RJA's  activities  in  the  securities business  include  retail  and
institutional securities brokerage, origination and distribution of limited
partnership interests, management of and participation in underwritings  of
equity  and  fixed  income  securities,  market  making  in  corporate  and
municipal  securities, origination, distribution and management  of  mutual
funds  and unit trusts and research and investment advisory services.   RJA
also  offers  financial  planning services  for  individuals  and  provides
clearing services for IM&R, RTS and other unaffiliated broker-dealers.  For
the year ended September 29, 1995 the revenues of RJA accounted for 62%  of
the consolidated revenues of the Company.

      RJA  is  a  member of the NYSE, American Stock Exchange, Philadelphia
Stock  Exchange,  Chicago  Board Options Exchange,  the  New  York  Futures
Exchange,  Pacific Exchange and Chicago Exchange.  It is also a  member  of
the   Securities  Industry  Association,  NASD  and  SIPC.   SIPC  provides
insurance  protection  for  customers' accounts  of  up  to  $500,000  each
(limited to $100,000 for claims for cash).  In addition, RJA carries up  to
$24,500,000 per account of excess customer insurance.

     Brokerage Transactions.  RJA provides securities brokerage services to
both  retail and institutional customers.  RJA charges commissions  to  its
retail  customers, on both exchange and over-the-counter  transactions,  in
accordance with its established commission schedule.  In certain instances,
varying  discounts from the schedule are given, generally  based  upon  the
customer's  level  of business, the trade size and other relevant  factors.
RJA  discounts its commissions substantially on institutional  transactions
based on trade size and the amount of business conducted annually with each
institution.

     Customers' transactions in securities are effected on either a cash or
margin  basis.  In margin transactions, the customer pays a portion of  the
purchase  price,  and  RJA makes a loan to the customer  for  the  balance,
collateralized by the securities purchased or by other securities owned  by
the  customer.  Interest is charged to customers on the amount borrowed  to
finance  margin  transactions.  The financing of  margin  purchases  is  an
important  source of revenue to RJA, since the interest rate  paid  by  the
customer on funds loaned by RJA exceeds RJA's cost of short-term funds. The
interest  rates  charged to customers on such loans depend on  the  average
margin loan balance in the customer's account and range from prime plus  1%
to prime minus .75%.

      Typically, secured bank borrowings and equity capital are the primary
sources  of  funds to finance customers' margin account borrowings.   Since
the  inception  of  the  Credit  Interest Program  in  1981,  however,  the
Company's  primary  source  of funds to finance customers'  margin  account
balances  has  been  cash  balances in customers' accounts  which  are  not
required  to  be  segregated.  In addition, pursuant to written  agreements
with  customers,  broker-dealers are permitted by Securities  and  Exchange
Commission  ("SEC")  and NYSE rules to lend customer securities  in  margin
accounts to other brokers.  SEC regulations, however, restrict the  use  of
customers' funds derived from pledging and lending customers' securities to
the  financing of margin account balances, and to the extent not  so  used,
such  funds  are  required  to be deposited in a special  account  for  the
benefit of customers.  The regulations also require broker-dealers,  within
designated  periods  of time, to obtain possession or control  of,  and  to
segregate, customers' fully paid and excess margin securities.
      Over-the-Counter and Other Trading.  Trading securities in the  over-
the-counter  ("OTC") market involves the purchase of securities  from,  and
the  sale of securities to, clients of the Company or other dealers who may
be  purchasing  or selling securities for their own account  or  acting  as
agent  for their clients.  Profits and losses are derived from the  spreads
between  bid and asked prices, as well as market trends for the  individual
securities  during  the  holding period.  RJA makes  markets  in  corporate
stocks  and  bonds, municipal bonds and various government securities.   At
September 29, 1995 RJA made markets in 204 common stocks traded in the  OTC
market.

      RJA  frequently acts as agent in the execution of OTC orders for  its
customers and as such transacts these trades with other dealers.  When  RJA
receives a customer order in a security in which it makes a market, it  may
act  as principal as long as it matches or improves upon the best price  in
the  dealer market, plus or minus a mark-up or mark-down not exceeding  the
equivalent agency commission charge.  Recently adopted regulations  require
that  customer limit orders be satisfied prior to the brokerage firm buying
securities into their own inventory at the same price.

      Stock Borrow/Stock Loan Program.  RJA commenced this program in  July
1987,  involving the borrowing and lending of securities from and to  other
broker-dealers.   RJA  generally acts as an  intermediary  between  broker-
dealers  and other financial institutions, where it borrows from one  party
and  lends  to  another.  The borrower of the securities  puts  up  a  cash
deposit,  commonly  102%  of  the market value  of  the  securities.   This
deposit,  which  is  adjusted daily to reflect changes  in  current  market
value, earns interest at a negotiated rate, typically .2% to .5% below what
the lender of the securities can earn on the funds.

      Mutual  Funds.   RJA sells a number of professionally  managed,  load
mutual  funds and offers, in addition, a selection of no-load  funds.   RJA
maintains  dealer-sales agreements with most major distributors  of  mutual
fund  shares  sold  through  broker-dealers.   Commissions  on  such  sales
generally  range  from  1% to 5% of the dollar value  of  the  transaction.
Alternative  sales  compensation  structures  typically  include  front-end
charges,  "back-end" or deferral charges, and an annual charge in the  form
of a higher annual fund expense.

      At  September 29, 1995, the Company had 6 internally sponsored mutual
funds  for  which RJA acts as distributor.  (See Heritage Asset Management,
Inc.  description on page 7.)  As the distributor of these funds,  RJA  has
the right to enter into dealer agreements with other broker-dealers for the
sale of Heritage funds to their clients.

      Asset  Management  Services ("AMS").  RJA formed this  department  in
April  1990  to encompass several programs involving portfolio  management,
primarily  Investment  Advisory  Services  ("IAS"),  the  Passport  Program
("Passport"),  the  Managed Investment Program ("MIP")  and  the  Preferred
Portfolio Account ("PPA").  IAS, which commenced operations in August 1987,
assists  clients  in  selecting portfolio managers,  establishes  custodial
facilities, monitors performance of client accounts, provides clients  with
accounting and other administrative services and assists portfolio managers
with  certain  trading  management activities.  IAS  earns  fees  generally
ranging from .5%-1.0% of asset balances per annum, a substantial portion of
which  is  paid  to  portfolio managers who direct the  investment  of  the
client's  account.   At September 29, 1995, this program had  approximately
$960  million  in  assets  under  management  through  agreements  with  20
independent  investment  advisors.   In  addition,  two  proprietary  asset
managers, Awad and Associates Asset Management ("AWAD") and Carillon  Asset
Management ("Carillon"), are offered through this program.

      Passport is a non-discretionary advisory fee alternative that  allows
clients  to  pay a quarterly fee plus low transaction charges  in  lieu  of
commissions.   Fees are based on the individual accounts and are  dependent
on  the  type of securities in the accounts.  In addition, AMS collects  an
administrative  fee  of  up to .2% of asset balances  annually,  for  which
clients receive a quarterly performance report and other services.   As  of
September  29,  1995,  Passport had approximately $420  million  in  assets
serviced by account executives.

      MIP  is  a program that allows selected account executives to  manage
customer portfolios on a discretionary, wrap fee basis.  The account  execu
tives must satisfy certain criteria and complete educational courses to  be
selected  for this program.  Fees are based on the individual accounts  and
are  dependent on the size of the account and the type of securities in the
account.   AMS  establishes custodial facilities, monitors  performance  of
client   portfolios,   provides   clients   with   accounting   and   other
administrative  services  and assists the account executives  with  certain
trading  management activities.  AMS collects a fixed fee plus a percentage
of the assets.  As of September 29, 1995, MIP had approximately $90 million
in assets serviced by fourteen account executives.

      PPA  is  another non-discretionary wrap fee pricing alternative  that
allows  clients  to  pay  a quarterly fee in lieu of  commissions.   Unlike
Pasport,  no  transaction  charge  is  imposed.   Fees  are  based  on  the
individual  accounts  and are dependent on the type of  securities  in  the
accounts.  In addition, AMS collects an annual administrative fee of .2% of
asset balances, for which clients are provided with a quarterly performance
report and other services.  As of September 29, 1995, PPA had approximately
$53 million in assets.

     AWAD is primarily an equity portfolio management division of RJA which
was  formed  in  March  of  1992. Clients pay fees and/or  commissions  for
management of their accounts.  Present fees range from .5% to 1.0% of asset
balances  annually.  In addition to private accounts, AWAD also  manages  a
portion  of  the  Heritage Small Cap Stock Fund Portfolio. AWAD,  which  is
offered  through  the  IAS program, had approximately  $360  million  under
management at September 29, 1995.

      Carillon, a division of RJA offered through IAS, commenced operations
in  1993.   Carillon manages approximately $72 million for private accounts
investing  in  closed-end  funds.   Fees  are  currently  .375%  of  assets
annually.

      In  addition  to  the foregoing programs, AMS also  monitors  various
outside money managers that are not a part of the IAS program.

      Institutional Sales, Trading and Research.  RJA has a domestic  staff
of  134 professionals who provide research, sales and execution services to
RJA's institutional clients.  In addition, RJA has 36 account executives in
6 institutional sales offices located in Europe.  RJA's research is focused
on  the  identification of industries and companies which its staff believe
are  undervalued.   These  professionals also attempt  to  provide  general
coverage  on  public  companies  located  in  Florida  and  throughout  the
southeastern United States.  Proprietary research reports, supplemented  by
research  purchased  from  outside services, are also  provided  to  retail
customers.

      Investment  Banking Group.  The 55 professionals of RJA's  Investment
Banking  Group located primarily in St. Petersburg, Florida, with satellite
offices in Atlanta, Boston and Dallas, operate in two distinct areas.   The
Corporate  Finance  Department  is involved  in  a  variety  of  activities
including  public  and  private  debt and equity  financing  for  corporate
clients, merger and acquisition consulting services, fairness opinions  and
evaluations.   The  Real  Estate Investment Banking Department  originates,
syndicates,  markets  and monitors the performance of  public  and  private
limited  partnerships, primarily in the real estate and  equipment  leasing
industries.  An active secondary trading market is also maintained for  the
purchase and resale of public limited partnership units.

     RJA's affiliates frequently act as a general or co-general partner for
the  limited partnerships the Company syndicates and/or manages.   See  the
description of the Company's other subsidiaries on page 9.

      Syndicate  Department.   The  Syndicate  Department  coordinates  the
distribution  of  newly  issued  securities  to  institutional  and  retail
investors.  They handle public offerings that are managed or co-managed  by
RJA  as well as selling group and syndicate participations managed by other
firms.   This department primarily deals with equity and closed-end  mutual
fund underwritings and brokered certificate of deposit offerings.

      Fixed  Income  Department.  Through its Fixed Income Department,  RJA
distributes  both  taxable and tax-exempt fixed income  products  (such  as
corporate, government and mortgage-backed bonds as well as municipal  bonds
and  unit investment trusts) to its customers.  RJA positions taxable fixed
income  securities  and  municipal  securities  in  both  the  primary  and
secondary  markets as principal.  The department's Public Finance  Division
acts  as financial advisor or underwriter to various municipal agencies  or
political  subdivisions.  When underwriting municipal bonds, RJA agrees  to
purchase bonds either through a negotiated sale or based upon a competitive
bid.  RJA also acts as an underwriter, dealer and selling group member  for
both  taxable and non-taxable unit trusts.  The Institutional Fixed  Income
Research Group provides institutional clients with value-added services and
research  bulletins on topics ranging from specific product information  to
regulatory developments.

       Administration  and  Operations.   RJA's  operations  personnel  are
responsible   for  the  execution  of  orders,  processing  of   securities
transactions,  custody of customer securities, receipt, identification  and
delivery  of  funds  and securities, compliance with regulatory  and  legal
requirements, internal financial accounting and controls and general office
administration for all of the financial services group.


                  Investment Management & Research, Inc.

     IM&R participates in the distribution of all the products and services
offered by RJA to its retail customers through 1,041 independent contractor
registered  representatives in 491 offices and satellite offices throughout
all  50  states.  The number of registered representatives in these offices
ranges from 1 to 21.  Such representatives devote all or substantially  all
of  their  time  to  the  sale of securities and, while  these  independent
contractors  must  conduct  all  securities business  through  IM&R,  their
contracts   permit  them  to  conduct  insurance,  real  estate  brokerage,
accounting services or other business for others or for their own  account.
Many  IM&R registered representatives are better characterized as financial
planners  than as stock brokers, although they are not required to  conduct
their   business  as  financial  planners.   Independent  contractors   are
responsible  for all of their direct costs and are paid higher than  normal
commission rates to compensate them for their added expenses.


                      Robert Thomas Securities, Inc.

        RTS   has   762   full-time   independent   contractor   registered
representatives in 47 states who offer securities and investment advice  to
individuals  and institutions through a network of 353 branch  offices  and
satellite   offices.    Of  these,  111  are  located   within   depository
institutions   (banks,  savings  and  loans  and   credit   unions).    RTS
representatives offer the full range of securities products and services of
RJA.   RTS  branches have the independence to set their own commissions  on
agency  business  within  regulatory guidelines.  RTS  branches  and  their
registered  personnel  may offer non-securities financial  products  (i.e.,
life insurance) to customers outside of their relationship with RTS.


                       Eagle Asset Management, Inc.

      Eagle  is  a  registered investment advisor with  approximately  $1.9
billion  under  management at September 29, 1995.  Eagle's clients  include
pension   and   profit   sharing  plans,  retirement  funds,   foundations,
endowments,   trusts  and  individuals.   Accounts   are   managed   on   a
discretionary   basis  in  accordance  with  the  investment   objective(s)
specified by the client.  Eagle manages approximately $300 million  for  92
institutional clients and $1.6 billion for 6,450 retail accounts.

      Eagle's investment management fee generally ranges from .25%-1.0%  of
asset balances per year depending upon the size and investment objective of
the  account.  In addition to the management fees, clients are required  to
pay  brokerage  commissions (or a fee in lieu thereof) for transactions  in
their account.

      Eagle's former president and chief investment officer entered into  a
Separation  Agreement with the Company effective December 31, 1994.   Under
this  agreement the institutional growth equity accounts previously managed
by  Eagle  were  transferred to a new firm, Liberty Investment  Management,
Inc.  ("Liberty"),  headed  by the former president  and  chief  investment
officer.   For  the five years ending December 31, 1999, the  Company  will
receive 50% of the management fees earned by the new firm on the assets  in
these  transferred accounts, while bearing none of the expenses.   Further,
the  Company  has the option of purchasing 20% of Liberty at  December  31,
1999 at a predetermined price.

generally subcontracted to the existing asset management operations of  the
Company.   In  October  1993 the Company acquired a second  trust  company,

     RJ Partners, Inc.                  Various

      The Company has several other subsidiaries, but their activities  are
not material to the Company's operations.


                               Competition

       The   Company's  subsidiaries  compete  with  many  larger,   better
capitalized  providers  of financial services, including  other  securities
firms,   some  of  which  are  affiliated  with  major  financial  services
companies,   insurance   companies,   banking   institutions   and    other
organizations.  They also compete with a number of firms offering  discount
brokerage  services,  usually with lower levels of service,  to  individual
customers.  The Company's subsidiaries compete principally on the basis  of
service, product selection, location and reputation in local markets.


                                Regulation

      The  securities industry in the United States is subject to extensive
regulation  under  federal and state laws.  The SEC is the  federal  agency
charged  with administration of the federal securities laws.  Much  of  the
regulation  of  broker-dealers,  however,  has  been  delegated  to   self-
regulatory  organizations, principally the NASD and the NYSE.  These  self-
regulatory organizations adopt rules (which are subject to approval by  the
SEC) for governing the industry and conduct periodic examinations of member
broker-dealers.  Securities firms are also subject to regulation  by  state
securities  commissions in the states in which they are  registered.   RJA,
IM&R and RTS are currently registered in all 50 states.

      The regulations to which broker-dealers are subject cover all aspects
of  the securities business, including sales methods, trade practices among
broker-dealers, capital structure of securities firms, record  keeping  and
the  conduct of directors, officers and employees.  Additional legislation,
changes   in   rules   promulgated  by  the  SEC  and  by   self-regulatory
organizations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement  of  existing
laws  and  rules  often  directly  affect  the  method  of  operation   and
profitability   of   broker-dealers.   The  SEC  and  the   self-regulatory
organizations  may conduct administrative proceedings which can  result  in
censure, fine, suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer, its officers  or
employees.   The principal purpose of regulation and discipline of  broker-
dealers  is  the protection of customers and the securities markets  rather
than protection of creditors and shareholders of broker-dealers.

      See Notes 12 and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for further description of certain SEC regulations.


ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES

      Properties  owned  by the Company at September  29,  1995  include  a
310,000  square  foot headquarters complex (two buildings) and  the  86,000
square  foot  former headquarters building, both located in St. Petersburg,
Florida.   The  former  headquarters building is presently  unoccupied  and
available for sale or lease.  In addition, the Company leases 60,000 square
feet  in  a nearby office building.  The Company owns 13.87 acres near  the
current headquarters for long-term growth purposes and owns the RJA  branch
office  building  in  Crystal River, Florida.   The  remaining  RJA  branch
offices  are leased with various expiration dates through 2002.  The  IM&R,
RJMC  and  RJP  headquarters offices in Atlanta,  Georgia  are  also  under
leases.   See  Notes  4  and  9  of  the Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial
Statements for further information regarding the Company's leases.

      Leases  for branch offices of IM&R and RTS are the responsibility  of
the respective independent contractor registered representatives.


ITEM 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

      The  Company  is  a  defendant or co-defendant  in  various  lawsuits
incidental  to  its  securities business.  The Company  is  contesting  the
allegations  of the complaints in these cases and believes that  there  are
meritorious defenses in each of these lawsuits.  In view of the number  and
diversity  of  claims against the Company, the number of  jurisdictions  in
which  litigation is pending and the inherent difficulty of predicting  the
outcome  of  litigation  and other claims, the Company  cannot  state  with
certainty  what the eventual outcome of pending litigation or other  claims
will  be.  In the opinion of management, based on discussions with counsel,
the  outcome of these matters will not result in a material adverse  effect
on the financial position or results of operations of the Company.


ITEM 4.   SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

     None.

ITEM 5.   MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT'S COMMON STOCK
          AND RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS

      The  Company's  common stock is traded on the NYSE under  the  symbol

     Fourth Quarter           22-5/8   18-1/2   16-1/8   13-1/8

      Since the Company initiated payment of a cash dividend in 1985, there
have  been thirteen increases in the dividend rate, five of which  were  in
the  form of stock splits and stock dividends.  The dividend rate in fiscal
1995 was $.09 per quarter.

      The payment of dividends on the Company's common stock is subject  to
the  availability of funds from the Company's subsidiaries,  including  the
broker-dealer subsidiaries which may be subject to restrictions  under  the
net  capital rules of the SEC and the NYSE.  Such restrictions  have  never
become  applicable with respect to the Company's dividend  payments.   (See
Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

      At  December 11, 1995 there were approximately 7,500 holders  of  the
Company's common stock.

ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
          AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Results of Operations - Three Years Ended September 29, 1995

      Fiscal  1995 represented the Company's eleventh consecutive year  of
record  revenues.   Net  income for 1995 was the  second  highest  in  the
Company's history, trailing only 1993's results.  Fiscal 1995 began  as  a
continuation of 1994, with a subdued market in a period of rising interest
rates.   The  second  half of the year saw a dramatic turnaround,  with  a
return  to  declining interest rates and a vibrant, rapidly  rising  stock
market.

      Fiscal  1994 was also a schizophrenic year.  The first  half  was  a
continuation  of  the record-setting pace experienced in 1993,  while  the
second  half  was  much weaker as the Federal Reserve  commenced  a  rapid
series of interest rate increases.

     Despite the volatility of the markets, the Company managed to realize
a  relatively  consistent,  albeit  below  target,  rate  of  increase  in
securities  commission  revenues. From a  product  line  perspective,  the
largest volume increase, by a wide margin, has been in equities.

      Investment banking activity has been on a roller coaster ride during
this  three  year  period.  Fiscal 1993 and the first half  of  1994  were
exceptionally strong.  Mid-1994 to mid-1995 was a relatively slow  period,
and  then  1995 closed with a flurry.  The number of managed or co-managed
underwritings and the dollar volume of these transactions were as follows:
1995  -  24 deals for $1.4 billion; 1994 - 35 deals for $2.2 billion;  and
1993  -  35  deals for $1.4 billion.  In addition, merger and  acquisition
fees have increased each year during this period.

      Assets  under  management,  including those  assets  transferred  to
Liberty  Investment Management ("Liberty"), increased as a result  of  net
new  account sales and/or appreciation of existing accounts.  The  decline
in  investment  advisory fees from 1994 to 1995 reflects the  transfer  of
$4.3  billion to Liberty on January 1, 1995.  As described in Note  15  of
the  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company receives  50%
of  the  fees from these accounts through December 31, 1999, while bearing
none  of the expenses.  As shown in the table below, the Company's various
asset management operations have had disparate growth rates:

       During   1995,  real  estate  assets  under  management   increased
significantly  as  the  Company's RJ Properties subsidiary  has  become  a
recognized  manager  of institutional portfolios.  Including  partnerships
for  which the Company's various subsidiaries act as general or co-general
partner, total tangible assets under management at yearend for 1995,  1994
and 1993 were $937 million, $650 million, and $550 million, respectively.

     Net interest income is a stable, growing source of earnings.  Most of
the  increase has been a result of the dramatic growth in retail brokerage
account balances.  Going forward, it is anticipated that interest earnings
will  be  enhanced by the growth of the Company's Raymond James Bank,  FSB
subsidiary.  The major components of interest earnings are as follows:

     Net trading and investment profits have risen and fallen generally as
a  result  of  the  prevailing interest rate  environment,  as  the  great
majority  of  the  firm's holdings are fixed income  securities.   Trading
profits  from over-the-counter equity market making activities  have  been
relatively  consistent during the period.  In fiscal 1993 and  the  latter
half  of  1995,  both periods of declining interest rates, positive  fixed
income  trading  results were realized, while the rising rate  environment
present  during most of fiscal 1994 was an extremely difficult period  for
fixed income securities.

      The increase in financial service fees is a result of the growth  of
the  Company's retail client base.  Examples of items in this category are
IRA   account  fees,  transfer  and  postage  charges,  and  money  market
distribution and processing fees.

      The  jump  in  other income from 1993 to 1994 was primarily  due  to
increased floor brokerage revenues as the Company increased its number  of
floor  traders during the active market period through mid-1994.   In  the
latter  half  of 1994, the Company's internal order flow slowed  somewhat,
allowing more time to execute trades on behalf of other firms.

                              ==============================================
      Since  several  of  the  expense line items  are  explained  by  the
fluctuation  in  related revenues and others were relatively  constant  or
experienced a general corporate growth rate during this three year period,
the  following discussion will focus on the expense items not falling into
either of these two categories.

      The significant increase in administrative compensation and benefits
from  1993  to  1994  represents the impact of a  full  year  of  expenses
relating  to  the increased number of support personnel added  during  the
very  active market period through 1993.  Incentive compensation  expenses
are based on departmental, subsidiary and firm-wide profitability.

      The sharp rise in communications expense from 1993 to 1994 primarily
reflects  the  costs associated with the introduction of a satellite-based
communication system.

      Occupancy  and  equipment has risen at a  rate  which  has  outpaced
general firm growth.  The increase from 1993 to 1994 was due primarily  to
the  mid-1993  completion of the Company's second  headquarters  building,
generating a full year of associated costs in 1994.  Throughout the  three
year  period,  numerous retail branch office spaces were increased  and/or
upgraded  and  many account executive workstations, which are  depreciated
over very short periods for financial reporting purposes, were added.
Liquidity and Capital Resources

      Net  cash  from  operating activities during the  current  year  was
$258,539,000.   Cash was generated by increased customer balances  in  the
credit interest program and by fluctuations in various asset and liability
accounts.

      Investing  activities required $57,653,000  during  the  year.   Net
additions  to fixed assets consumed $8,656,000, the majority of which  was
for  the  purchase of computers and office furniture and  equipment.   Net
purchases,  sales  and  maturations of investments  consumed  $48,997,000.
These  investments were primarily mortgage-backed securities purchased  by
Raymond James Bank, FSB.

      Financing  activities required $7,705,000, primarily the  result  of
dividends paid on the Company's common stock and treasury stock purchases.

      The  Company has long-term debt in the amount of $13,084,000 in  the
form  of  a  mortgage  on its headquarters office building.   The  Company
completed  construction of a second building, occupied in  the  spring  of
1993, adjacent to its existing headquarters building.  The Company has not
obtained long-term financing for the second building.

      The  Company has three committed lines of credit.  During 1995,  the
parent  company  obtained  an  unsecured  $50  million  line  for  general
corporate   purposes.   In  conjunction  with  the  residential   mortgage
securitization  effort, a $50 million warehousing  line  was  established.
Finally,  a  $50  million line was established to  finance  Raymond  James
Credit  Corporation, a Regulation G subsidiary organized to provide  loans
collateralized  by  restricted  or control  shares  of  public  companies.
Subsequent   to   yearend,  the  Company  has  terminated   its   mortgage
securitization  efforts  and will, therefore, be terminating  the  related
line  of  credit.   In  addition, Raymond James  &  Associates,  Inc.  has
uncommitted lines of credit aggregating $255,000,000.

      The Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to requirements
of  the  SEC  relating to liquidity and capital standards  (see  Notes  to
Consolidated Financial Statements).


Effects of Recently Issued Accounting Standards

       During  the  year,  the  Company  adopted  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115 "Accounting for Certain Investments  in  Debt
and  Equity  Securities" ("FAS 115") and Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards  No. 119 "Disclosure about Derivative Financial Instruments  and
Fair Value of Financial Instruments" ("FAS 119").

      FAS  115  requires that certain securities, held by other  than  the
broker-dealer subsidiaries, formerly classified as short-term  investments
or  trading and investment account securities, be classified as  available
for  sale.   The unrealized gains/losses, net of tax, on these  securities
are reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity.  FAS 119 did
not have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of
operations  or  financial  disclosures as the  Company  trades  derivative
financial  instruments primarily for customers and held no firm derivative
positions at yearend.

      The  Company will adopt Statement of Financial Accounting  Standards
No.  123  "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("FAS 123") in  fiscal
year  1997.   FAS  123 is not expected to have a material  impact  on  the
Company's  financial position or results of operations  but  will  require
extensive  disclosures regarding the Company's stock option  and  employee
stock purchase plans.


Effects of Inflation

      The  Company's  assets are primarily liquid in nature  and  are  not
significantly  affected  by  inflation.   Management  believes  that   the
replacement  cost  of property and equipment would not  materially  affect
operating  results.  However, the rate of inflation affects the  Company's
expenses,  including employee compensation, communications and  occupancy,
which may not be readily recoverable through charges for services provided
by the Company.

          REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Raymond James Financial, Inc.

In  our  opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed  in  the
index  appearing on page F-1 present fairly, in all material  respects,
the  financial  position  of  Raymond James  Financial,  Inc.  and  its
subsidiaries  at  September 29, 1995 and September 30,  1994,  and  the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the  three
years  in  the  period  ended September 29, 1995,  in  conformity  with
generally  accepted accounting principles.  These financial  statements
are  the responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility
is  to  express an opinion on these financial statements based  on  our
audits.  We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
generally  accepted auditing standards which require that we  plan  and
perform  the  audit  to obtain reasonable assurance about  whether  the
financial  statements  are  free of material  misstatement.   An  audit
includes  examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting  the  amounts
and  disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the  accounting
principles  used  and  significant estimates made  by  management,  and
evaluating  the  overall financial statement presentation.  We  believe
that  our  audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion  expressed
above.

   The accompanying Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Notes to
           Consolidated Financial Statements are integral parts of
                         these financial statements.

                RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

                                         Value Partners, Inc.

    All consolidated subsidiaries are 100% owned by the Company except  for
RJ Properties, Inc., which is 85% owned.

Reporting period

    The  Company's fiscal year ends on the last Friday in September of each
year.

Recognition of revenues

      Securities transactions and related commission revenues and  expenses
are recorded on a trade date basis for fiscal year 1995 and on a settlement
date  basis  for  fiscal  years  1994 and 1993,  which  is  not  materially
different from trade date.

     Revenues from limited partnerships and investment banking are recorded
at  the  time  the  transaction is completed  and  the  related  income  is
reasonably determinable.  Investment banking revenues include sales credits
earned in connection with the distribution of the underwritten securities.

      The Company earns an advisory fee based on a client's portfolio value
on  portfolios managed by its investment advisor subsidiaries.  These  fees
are recorded under the accrual method.  In addition, on certain portfolios,
the Company earns performance fees which are recorded when earned.

Cash and cash equivalents

      The  Company considers all highly liquid investments with an  initial
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents for purposes of the
consolidated  statement  of cash flows.  These consist  primarily  of  U.S.
Treasury  Securities and are stated at cost, which approximates  market  at
fiscal yearend.

      It  is  the  Company's  policy to obtain possession  and  control  of
securities  purchased  under resale agreements.   The  net  fair  value  of
securities  purchased under resale agreements approximates  their  carrying
value,  as  such  financial  instruments are  predominantly  short-term  in
nature. The Company monitors the risk of loss by assessing the market value
of  the  underlying  securities as compared to the  related  receivable  or
payable,  including  accrued interest, and requests  additional  collateral
where  deemed appropriate.  At September 29, 1995, there were no agreements
with  any individual counterparties where the risk of loss exceeded 10%  of
shareholders' equity.

Short-term and other investments

      Short-term  and  other  investments segregated  pursuant  to  Federal
Regulations are stated at market.  Other short-term investments are  stated
at amortized cost, which approximates market value at fiscal yearend.

Securities owned

      The  Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards  No.
115,  "Accounting  for Certain Investments in Debt and  Equity  Securities"
("FAS  115"), as of October 1, 1994.  FAS 115 requires investments in  debt
and  equity  securities  to  be classified as either  "held  to  maturity,"
"trading,"   or  "available  for  sale."   The  accounting  treatment   for
unrealized gains and losses on those securities is then determined  by  the
classification  chosen. The trading and investment account securities  held
by  the  brokerage  subsidiaries  are classified  as  trading.   Investment
account  securities not readily marketable are carried  at  estimated  fair
value  as  determined  by management.  Trading securities  are  carried  at
market  value  with  realized and unrealized gains and losses  included  in
earnings.   Securities available for sale are carried at fair  value,  with
unrealized   gains  and  losses  reported  as  a  separate   component   of
shareholders' equity, net of deferred taxes, and realized gains and losses,
determined on a specific identification basis, included in earnings.

      Securities  classified as held to maturity are carried  at  amortized
cost  and are adjusted for premium amortization or discount accretion  with
realized  gains  and losses included in earnings.  At September  29,  1995,
Raymond  James Bank, FSB, holds one FHLMC mortgage-backed security  in  its
held  to  maturity  portfolio with an amortized cost of $2,800,000  and  an
estimated  market  value of $2,865,000, and the parent company  holds  U.S.
Treasury Notes and municipal bonds with an amortized cost of $8,410,000 and
an  estimated  market  value of $8,475,000. U.S.  Treasury  Notes  with  an
amortized cost of $3,003,000 mature within one year.  The remainder of  the
securities mature in one to five years.

      For  fiscal  years  1994  and 1993, trading  and  investment  account
securities  are  recorded at market value with unrealized  appreciation  or
depreciation  reflected in income currently.  Other short-term  investments
are  stated  at amortized cost, which approximates market value  at  fiscal
year end.

Property and equipment

     Property, equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost less
accumulated  depreciation.  Depreciation of assets is provided  principally
using  the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes  over  the
estimated  useful lives of the assets, which range from two to seven  years
for  furniture and equipment and fifteen to thirty-one years for  buildings
and  land  improvements.  Leasehold improvements are  amortized  using  the
straight-line  method over the shorter of the lease term or  the  estimated
useful  lives  of  the  assets.   For  income  tax  purposes,  assets   are
depreciated using accelerated methods.

      Additions,  improvements and expenditures for repairs and maintenance
that  significantly  extend the useful life of an  asset  are  capitalized.
Other expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to operations in
the  period   incurred.  Gains and losses on disposals of fixed assets  are
reflected in income in the period incurred.

Clearing charges to correspondents

      Under clearing agreements, the Company clears trades for unaffiliated
correspondent brokers and retains a portion of commissions as a fee for its
services.    The  Company  records  clearing  charges  net  of  commissions
remitted.  Total commissions generated by correspondents were  $16,155,000,
$17,232,000  and $23,044,000, and commissions remitted totaled $12,434,000,
$13,366,000  and  $18,880,000  for  the years  ended  September  29,  1995,
September 30, 1994 and September 24, 1993, respectively.

Income taxes

      The  Company  utilizes the asset and liability  approach  defined  in
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes"  ("FAS  109").   FAS 109 requires the recognition  of  deferred  tax
assets  and  liabilities  for  the  expected  future  tax  consequences  of
temporary differences between the financial statement amounts and  the  tax
bases of assets and liabilities.

Net income per share

      Earnings  per share are computed using weighted average common  stock
and common stock equivalents outstanding.  Common stock equivalents include
shares  issuable under stock options and are determined under the  treasury
stock method.  All per share amounts have been restated to give retroactive
effect to the common stock dividend on November 15, 1993.

Reclassifications

       Certain  amounts  from  prior  years  have  been  reclassified   for
consistency  with current year presentation.  These reclassifications  were
not material to the consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 6 - BORROWINGS:

      The  mortgage  note payable requires monthly principal  and  interest
payments  of approximately $120,000 with a balloon payment due December  1,
1997.   The  mortgage  bears interest at 9.75%  and  is  secured  by  land,
buildings  and  improvements  with  a net  book  value  of  $10,783,000  at
September  29, 1995. Principal maturities under this mortgage note  payable
for  the succeeding five fiscal years are as follows: 1996 - $175,000; 1997
- - $193,000; 1998 - $12,716,000; 1999 and beyond - $0.

      During  fiscal year 1995, the Company established three  $50  million
committed  lines  of  credit with commercial banks.  Borrowings  under  the
lines  of  credit bear interest at various rates (Fed Funds  plus  2%,  the
lesser  of  prime  rate or Fed Funds plus 1/2%, or LIBOR plus  3/4%).   The
lines  of  credit  require that the Company, or one  of  its  subsidiaries,
maintain certain net worth levels, limit other leases and debt and  require
the  Company to follow certain other sound business practices.  The Company
paid  $100,000 in loan commitment fees during fiscal year 1995.  There were
borrowings of $2,510,000 at 8.2%, collateralized by mortgage loans  with  a
fair  value of $7,376,000, outstanding at September 29, 1995.  The interest
rate  on  these borrowings was Fed Funds plus 2%, and ranged from  7.5%  to
8.2% during the year.

      The  Company  also maintains uncommitted lines of credit  aggregating
$255,000,000  with commercial banks ($200,000,000 secured  and  $55,000,000
unsecured).   Borrowings under the lines of credit bear  interest,  at  the
Company's option, at the bank's prime rate, Fed Funds rate plus 1 1/4%,  or
LIBOR  plus  3/4%.   There  were no short-term  borrowings  outstanding  at
September  29,  1995  or September 30, 1994.  The interest  rate  on  these
borrowings ranged from 5.08% to 7.00% in 1995 and 4.88% to 5.46%  in  1994.
Loans  on  the  secured, uncommitted lines of credit are collateralized  by
firm or customer margin securities.


NOTE 7 - BANK OPERATIONS AND DEPOSITS:

      On  May 6, 1994, the Company organized Raymond James Bank, FSB,  ("RJ
Bank") in conjunction with the purchase of the deposits of certain branches
of a federal savings bank from the Resolution Trust Corporation ("RTC") for
a  nominal purchase price.  The Company contributed $25 million in  capital
to fund the bank's start-up and investments.

                           =================================================

      The  certificates of deposit mature as follows:  $8,059,000 in  1996,
$1,890,000 in 1997, $45,000 in 1998, $231,000 in 1999 and $649,000 in 2000.
Certificates of deposit and savings accounts in amounts of $100,000 or more
at September 29, 1995 and September 30, 1994 were approximately $22,558,000
and $4,738,000, respectively.

      RJ  Bank has not yet begun making loans to customers, thus its assets
consist primarily of investments in mortgage-backed securities.

     Certificates of deposit and savings accounts in amounts of $100,000 or
more  at  September  29,  1995 and September 30,  1994  were  approximately
$22,558,000 and $4,738,000, respectively.

      RJ Bank is subject to various regulatory and capital requirements and
was in compliance with all requirements throughout the fiscal year.

      Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act
of  1991 ("FDICIA"), RJ Bank is subject to rules limiting brokered deposits
and related interest rates.  Under these rules, banks that are deemed "well-
capitalized"  may accept brokered deposits without restriction,  and  banks
deemed "adequately capitalized" may do so with a waiver from the FDIC.   An
"undercapitalized"  bank is not eligible for a waiver and  may  not  accept
brokered deposits.  At September 29, 1995, management believes RJ Bank  met
the definition of the well-capitalized category.

      At  September  29, 1995, RJ Bank exceeded the tangible capital,  core
capital,  core/leverage capital, tier/risk-based capital  and  total  risk-
based  capital  levels  mandated  by  the  Financial  Institutions  Reform,
Recovery  and Enforcement Act of 1989 and FDICIA.  As part of the  purchase
of  deposits  from the RTC, RJ Bank is required to maintain a  total  risk-
based  capital  ratio  of  at  least 10%  for  its  first  three  years  of
operations.   At  September  29, 1995, RJ Bank's total  risk-based  capital
ratio was 113.9%.

NOTE 9 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:

      Long-term lease agreements expire at various times from 1996  through
2002. Minimum annual rentals under such agreements for the succeeding  five
fiscal  years  are approximately: $5,988,000 in 1996, $5,487,000  in  1997,
$4,153,000  in  1998, $3,047,000 in 1999 and $2,879,000  in  2000.   Rental
expense  incurred  under all leases, including equipment  under  short-term
agreements, aggregated $5,481,000, $5,435,000 and $4,482,000 in 1995,  1994
and 1993, respectively.

      In  connection with a real estate limited partnership  syndicated  by
Raymond  James & Associates, Inc., the Company was contingently liable  for
$385,000  at  September  29, 1995 in the form of  a  loan  guarantee.   The
Company has no reserves on its books attributable to this guarantee  since,
in  the  opinion  of  management,  the likelihood  of  payment  under  this
guarantee is remote.

      In  connection  with  the early payoff of its $5.8  million  loan  to
Cumberland  Healthcare  Fund, L.P. I-A, the Company  has  a  commitment  to
relend up to $5 million upon request.  Although no use of this facility  is
currently  anticipated,  any borrowings under  this  agreement  would  bear
interest  at  15.5%  per annum and would be secured  by  approximately  $10
million  of nursing home properties.  The commitment expires on October  1,
1996, at which time any outstanding balances would be due and payable.

      The  Company has committed to lend to, or guarantee other  debt  for,
Gateway Tax Credit Funds ("Gateway") up to $6 million upon request.  It  is
anticipated  that  Gateway will begin requesting  funds  or  guarantees  in
December, 1995.  Any borrowings will bear interest at broker call  plus  1%
per  annum.   Gateway  will  be  charged 1% for  amounts  guaranteed.   The
borrowings   would  be  secured  by  properties  under  development.    The
commitment expires in November 1997 at which time any outstanding  balances
would be due and payable.

     In the normal course of business, the Company enters into underwriting
commitments.  Transactions relating to such commitments that were  open  at
September 29, 1995 and were subsequently settled had no material effect  on
the consolidated financial statements as of that date.

      At September 29, 1995, the Company had a letter of credit outstanding
of  $200,000 and excess customer margin securities valued at $13,211,000 on
deposit  with  a  clearing organization, which are used to  satisfy  margin
deposit requirements.

      In the normal course of business, the Company, as general partner, is
contingently  liable  for the obligations of various  limited  partnerships
engaged primarily in securities investments and real estate activities.  In
the  opinion  of the Company, such liabilities, if any, for the obligations
of  the  partnerships  will not in the aggregate have  a  material  adverse
effect on the Company's consolidated financial position.

      The  Company  is  a  defendant or co-defendant  in  various  lawsuits
incidental  to  its  securities business.  The Company  is  contesting  the
allegations  of the complaints in these cases and believes that  there  are
meritorious defenses in each of these lawsuits.  In view of the number  and
diversity  of  claims against the Company, the number of  jurisdictions  in
which  litigation is pending and the inherent difficulty of predicting  the
outcome  of  litigation  and other claims, the Company  cannot  state  with
certainty  what the eventual outcome of pending litigation or other  claims
will  be.  In the opinion of management, based on discussions with counsel,
the outcome of the matters will not result in a material adverse effect  on
the financial position or results of operations of the Company.


NOTE 10 - CAPITAL TRANSACTIONS:

      The  Company's  Board of Directors has, from time  to  time,  adopted
resolutions authorizing the Company to repurchase its common stock for  the
funding  of its incentive stock option and stock purchase plans  and  other
corporate purposes.  On May 12, 1994, the Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase  of  an  additional 1,000,000 shares of  common  stock,  and  on
February  17,  1995, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase  of  an
additional 386,000 shares of common stock, bringing the total authorized to
3,125,000. Of these, 2,127,000 shares have been purchased through September
29, 1995.

      On September 23, 1993, the Company's Board of Directors declared a 3-
for-2 stock split in the form of a dividend payable on November 15, 1993 to
shareholders of record on October 25, 1993.  The Company's capital accounts
at  September  24, 1993 were adjusted retroactively to give effect  to  the
dividend  in  the same manner as would have been done if the dividend  were
paid before September 24, 1993.


NOTE 11 - EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS:

      The  Company's profit sharing plan and employee stock ownership  plan
provide  certain death, disability or retirement benefits for all employees
who  meet certain service requirements.  Such benefits become fully  vested
after  seven  years of qualified service.  The Company also offers  a  plan
pursuant  to  section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code which,  effective
January  1, 1994, provides for the Company to match 100% of the first  $500
and  50%  of  the  next $500 of compensation deferred by  each  participant
annually.   The Company's deferred management bonus plan is a non-qualified
plan  that  provides  retirement benefits for employees  who  meet  certain
length  of service and compensation requirements.  Contributions  to  these
plans  are  made  in amounts approved annually by the Board  of  Directors.
Compensation  expense includes aggregate contributions to  these  plans  of
$8,530,000,   $7,257,000  and  $8,696,000  for   1995,   1994   and   1993,
respectively.   The  employee  stock  purchase  plan  allows  employees  to
purchase  shares  of  the Company's common stock on  four  specified  dates
throughout the year at a 15% discount from market value, subject to certain
limitations.

      On  September 30, 1982, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted
an Incentive Stock Option Plan ("1982 Plan"), which covered an aggregate of
1,900,125  shares  of  common stock.  Options were  granted  to  registered
representatives  of Raymond James & Associates, Inc. who  achieved  certain
gross commission levels and to key administrative employees of the Company.
The options were granted at fair market value.  No compensation expense was
recognized with respect to these options.  Options are exercisable  in  the
36th  to 72nd months following the date of grant and only in the event that
the grantee is an employee of the Company at that time.

      On August 20, 1992, the Board of Directors adopted the 1992 Incentive
Stock  Option Plan which covers an aggregate of 1,050,000 shares of  common
stock.   The  Plan  was established to replace, on substantially  the  same
terms and conditions, the 1982 Plan.

      On December 13, 1985, the Company's Board of Directors adopted a non-
qualified  stock  option plan which currently covers  1,013,000  shares  of
common   stock  for  the  benefit  of  independent  contractor   registered
representatives of the Company.  Options are exercisable five  years  after
grant  date provided that the representative is still associated  with  the
Company.

    The  directors  who are also employees of the Company  adopted  a  non-
qualified  stock option plan on December 13, 1990 under which the Company's
outside directors have been granted options covering 66,560 shares  of  the
Company's  common stock.  Options vest over a five year period  from  grant
date provided that the director is still associated with the Company.

      The  following  table  summarizes the  option  activity  under  these
programs for the three years ended September 29, 1995:

NOTE 12 - NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS:

      The  broker-dealer  subsidiaries of the Company  are  subject  to  the
requirements of Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  This
rule  requires  that aggregate indebtedness, as defined, not exceed  fifteen
times   net  capital,  as  defined.   Rule  15c3-1  also  provides  for   an
"alternative net capital requirement" which, if elected, requires  that  net
capital  be  equal  to the greater of $250,000 or two percent  of  aggregate
debit  items computed in applying the formula for determination  of  reserve
requirements (see Note 13). The New York Stock Exchange may require a member
organization  to reduce its business if its net capital is  less  than  four
percent  of  aggregate  debit  items and may prohibit  a  member  firm  from
expanding  its business and declaring cash dividends if its net  capital  is
less  than five percent of aggregate debit items.  Net capital positions  of
the Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries were as follows:

NOTE 13 - RESERVE REQUIREMENTS:

     Rule 15c3-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the requirements
of the Commodity Exchange Act specify certain conditions under which brokers
and  dealers  carrying customer accounts are required to  maintain  cash  or
qualified securities in a special reserve account for the exclusive  benefit
of  customers.   Amounts  to  be maintained, if required,  are  computed  in
accordance  with  a  formula defined in the rule.  At  September  29,  1995,
Raymond   James   &  Associates,  Inc.  had  $367,979,000   (consisting   of
$330,804,000 of securities purchased under agreements to resell, $34,017,000
in  U.S.  Treasury Notes and $3,158,000 in cash) in special reserve accounts
as  compared  to  a reserve requirement of $321,377,000 at  that  date.   At
September  30,  1994,  this  subsidiary  had  $194,234,000  (consisting   of
$140,000,000 of securities purchased under agreements to resell, $48,836,000
in  U.S.  Treasury Notes and $5,398,000 in cash) in special reserve accounts
as  compared  to  a  reserve requirement of $176,969,000 at  that  date.  At
September  29,  1995, all such repurchase agreements were  on  an  overnight
basis  with  Cantor  Fitzgerald Partners and Eastbridge Capital,  Inc.   The
Company  monitors the market value of the underlying securities as  compared
to   the  related  receivable,  including  accrued  interest,  and  requires
additional collateral where deemed appropriate.

      Investment  Management & Research, Inc. and Robert Thomas  Securities,
Inc.  are  exempt from the provisions of Rule 15c3-3, since they  clear  all
transactions with and for customers on a fully-disclosed basis with  Raymond
James & Associates, Inc.


NOTE 14 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK:

      In  the  normal  course of business, the Company purchases  and  sells
securities  and commodities as either principal or agent on  behalf  of  its
customers.   If either the customer or a counterparty fails to perform,  the
Company  may  be required to discharge the obligations of the  nonperforming
party.   In such circumstances, the Company may sustain a loss if the market
value  of  the  security or futures contract is different from the  contract
value of the transaction.

      The  Company  also acts as an intermediary between broker-dealers  and
other financial institutions whereby the Company borrows securities from one
broker-dealer  and  then  lends them to another.   Securities  borrowed  and
securities loaned are carried at the amount of cash collateral advanced  and
received  in  connection with the transactions.  The  Company  measures  the
market  value  of  the  securities borrowed  and  loaned  against  the  cash
collateral  on a daily basis.  The market value of securities  borrowed  and
securities  loaned  was  $772,101,000  and  $784,767,000,  respectively,  at
September  29,  1995  and  $687,658,000 and $705,042,000,  respectively,  at
September 30, 1994. Additional cash is obtained as necessary to ensure  such
transactions  are  adequately  collateralized.   If  another  party  to  the
transaction  fails  to  perform as agreed (such  as  failure  to  deliver  a
security or failure to pay for a security), the Company may incur a loss  if
the  market value of the security is different from the contract  amount  of
the transaction.

      The  Company has also loaned, to brokers and dealers, securities owned
by  customers and others for which it has received cash or other collateral.
If  a borrowing institution or broker-dealer does not return a security, the
Company may be obligated to purchase the security in order to return  it  to
the  owner. In such circumstances, the Company may incur a loss equal to the
amount  by  which  the  market  value  of  the  security  on  the  date   of
nonperformance  exceeds the value of the loan from the  institution  or  the
collateral from the broker or dealer.

     The Company has sold securities that it does not currently own and will
therefore  be obligated to purchase such securities at a future  date.   The
Company  has recorded $17,377,000 and $33,032,000 at September 29, 1995  and
September 30, 1994, respectively, which represents the market value  of  the
related  securities at such dates.  The Company is subject to  loss  if  the
market  price of those securities not covered by a hedged position increases
subsequent  to  September 29, 1995.  The Company utilizes  short  government
obligations  and  equity  securities to  hedge  long  proprietary  inventory
positions.   At  September  29, 1995, the Company had  $7,712,000  in  short
government  obligations  and  $3,844,000 in short  equity  securities  which
represented  hedge  positions.   At September  30,  1994,  the  Company  had
$26,046,000  in short government obligations and $2,412,000 in short  equity
securities which represented hedge positions.

      The  Company  enters  into  security  transactions  involving  forward
settlement.  Transactions involving future settlement give  rise  to  market
risk, which represents the potential loss that can be caused by a change  in
the  market  value  of  a  particular financial instrument.   The  Company's
exposure to market risk is determined by a number of factors, including  the
size,  composition and diversification of positions held, the  absolute  and
relative levels of interest rates, and market volatility.
      The  majority  of  the Company's transactions and,  consequently,  the
concentration  of its credit exposure is with customers, broker-dealers  and
other  financial  institutions  in  the  United  States.   These  activities
primarily  involve  collateralized arrangements and  may  result  in  credit
exposure  in  the event that the counterparty fails to meet its  contractual
obligations.  The Company's exposure to credit risk can be directly impacted
by   volatile   securities  markets  which  may  impair   the   ability   of
counterparties to satisfy their contractual obligations.  The Company  seeks
to  control  its  credit  risk through a variety of  reporting  and  control
procedures, including establishing credit limits based upon a review of  the
counterparties'  financial  condition  and  credit  ratings.   The   Company
monitors  collateral levels on a daily basis for compliance with  regulatory
and  internal  guidelines  and  requests changes  in  collateral  levels  as
appropriate.


NOTE 15 - RELATED PARTIES:

   On  October  27,  1994,  the Company and the then  President  and  Chief
Investment Officer of its Eagle Asset Management, Inc. ("Eagle") subsidiary,
Herbert E. Ehlers ("Ehlers"), entered into a Separation Agreement by  which
Ehlers (a director of the Company) and certain other Eagle personnel became
employees  of  a new firm, Liberty Investment Management, Inc. ("Liberty"),
effective December 31, 1994.  Ehlers began operating Liberty as of  January
1,  1995, and he remained a dual employee of Eagle and Liberty through June
1995, continuing as investment manager on certain retail accounts until they
were  transferred  to  other portfolio managers.  As of  January  1,  1995,
Liberty  assumed  the  responsibility for providing  investment  management
services  to  institutional growth equity accounts  totaling  $4.3  billion
formerly managed by Eagle.  In accordance with Ehlers' employment agreement,
Eagle receives 50% of the revenues from these accounts through December 31,
1999,  while bearing none of the expenses.  At the end of this period,  the
Company has the option to purchase 20% of Liberty at a predetermined price.
For  the year ended September 29, 1995, Eagle recognized $7,233,000 in fees
from  Liberty,  which  are  included in investment  advisory  fees  on  the
consolidated  statement of income.  At September 29, 1995,  $4,921,000  due
from  Liberty is included in other receivable on the consolidated statement
of                           financial                           condition.
