BUSINESS

(a)

General Description of Business

Raymond James Financial, Inc. ("RJF") is a Florida-based holding company 
incorporated thru a predecessor in 1962. Its principal subsidiaries include Raymond James & Associates, Inc. ("RJA"), Raymond James Financial Services, Inc. ("RJFS"), Raymond James Ltd. ("RJ Ltd."), Eagle Asset Management, Inc. ("Eagle"), Heritage Asset Management, Inc. ("Heritage") and Raymond James Bank, FSB ("RJBank"). All of these subsidiaries are wholly-owned by RJF.  RJF and its subsidiaries are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Company".

RJF's principal subsidiary, RJA, was organized in Florida in 1962.  On May 28, 1999 the Company purchased Roney & Co. ("Roney"), a broker-dealer headquartered in Detroit, Michigan.  At the beginning of fiscal 2000 Roney was contributed to and merged into RJA.  Roney added 320 Financial Advisors and 28 offices to RJA.  RJA is a full service broker-dealer engaged in most aspects of securities distribution and investment banking.  RJA also offers financial planning services for individuals and provides clearing services for RJFS and several unaffiliated broker-dealers. The Company is the largest brokerage and investment firm headquartered in the state of Florida.  RJA is a member of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), American Stock Exchange, Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Boston Stock Exchange, Chicago Board Options Exchange, New York Futures Exchange, Pacific Exchange and Chicago Stock Exchange.  It is also a member of the Securities Ind
ustry Association, National Association of Securities Dealers ("NASD"), and Securities Investors Protection Corporation ("SIPC").  Securities in accounts custodied at RJA are protected by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation up to $500,000, including up to $100,000 in cash, in the event of the firm's liquidation. An additional $99.5 million of coverage, including another $900,000 for cash awaiting investment, was purchased, for a total of $100 million in coverage. This limit per client does not protect against market fluctuations.

RJFS was formed in January 1999, when the Company merged its two independent contractor broker-dealer subsidiaries, Investment Management & Research, Inc. ("IM&R") and Robert Thomas Securities, Inc. ("RTS").  RJFS participates in the distribution of all products and services offered by RJA to its retail clients and has three divisions one which is predominantly a financial planning organization,
one which serves independent contractor brokers who do a majority of their business in individual securities, and a third which offers securities on a third party basis to customers of banks.  RJFS is a member of the NASD and SIPC, but not of any exchange, as it clears all of its business on a fully-disclosed basis through RJA.

On January 1, 2001, the Company purchased Goepel McDermid Inc., a Canadian broker-dealer.  Effective January 23, 2001, Goepel McDermid Inc. changed its name to Raymond James Ltd., and is engaged in both retail and institutional distribution and investment banking.  RJ Ltd. is a member of the Toronto Stock Exchange, Investment Dealers Association of Canada and its U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary is a member of NASD.

Eagle was formed in 1984 as a registered investment advisor to serve as the discretionary manager for individual equity portfolios.

Heritage was organized in 1985 to act as the manager of the Company's internally sponsored Heritage family of mutual funds.

Raymond James Bank was formed in 1994 in conjunction with the purchase from the Resolution Trust Corporation of certain branches of a failed thrift.  Its primary purpose is to provide traditional banking products and services to the clients of the Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries.

Narrative Description of Business

At September 28, 2001 the Company employed 5,811 individuals.  RJA employed 4,517 of these individuals, 995 of whom were full-time retail Financial Advisors.  In addition, 3,428 full-time Financial Advisors were affiliated with the Company as independent contractors.  Through its broker-dealer subsidiaries, the Company provides securities services to more than one million client accounts. No single client accounts for a material percentage of the Company's total business.

The Company currently divides its business into five segments based on the products and services offered. These segments are retail distribution, institutional distribution, investment banking, asset management, and other.

RETAIL DISTRIBUTION

The Company provides securities transaction and financial planning services to its retail clients through the RJA and RJ Ltd. retail branch systems, its independent contractor firm (RJFS), and a general insurance agency.

RJA - Retail Sales

RJA has 79 retail branches and 17 satellites concentrated in Florida and the Midwest, the latter as a result of the acquisition of Roney.  RJA's 995 retail Financial Advisors provide a broad range of financial products and services to their clients. In most cases, RJA charges commissions to its retail clients, on both exchange and over-the-counter equity transactions, in accordance with its established commission schedule.  In certain instances, varying discounts from the schedule are given, generally based upon the client's level of business, the trade size and other relevant factors. In addition, a growing number of clients are electing asset-based fee alternatives to the traditional commission structure.  RJA also distributes both taxable and tax-exempt fixed income products to its retail clients, including municipal, corporate, government agency and mortgage-backed bonds, preferred stock and unit investment trusts.  The vast majority of Financial A
dvisors are also licensed to sell insurance and annuity products through the Company's general agency (see Planning Corporation of America description below).

The retail Financial Advisors sell a number of professionally managed, load mutual funds and offer, in addition, a selection of no-load funds.  RJA maintains dealer-sales agreements with most major distributors of mutual fund shares sold through broker-dealers.  Commissions on such sales generally range from 1% to 5% of the dollar value of the transaction. Alternative sales compensation structures typically include front-end charges, "back-end" or contingent deferred sales charges, and an annual charge in the form of a fund expense.

At September 28, 2001, the Company had 13 internally sponsored mutual fund portfolios for which RJA acts as distributor.  (See Heritage Asset Management, Inc. description on page 7.)  As the distributor of these funds, RJA has the right to enter into dealer agreements with other broker-dealers for the sale of Heritage funds to their clients.

Raymond James Financial Services

RJFS participates in the distribution of all the products and services offered by RJA to its retail clients through 3,428 independent contractor financial advisors in 1,465 offices and 469 satellite offices in all 50 states.  In addition, RJFS has several offices in Europe.

The Company operates with three separate Divisions.  The Investment Management Division has 861 offices and 1,890 Financial Advisors and are better characterized as financial planners than as stock brokers although they are not required to conduct their business as financial planners.  The Securities Division primarily offers individual securities and investment advice to individual investors and institutions through 998 Financial Advisors in 361 branch offices.  The Financial Institutions Division offers securities on a third party basis to customers of financial institutions such as banks, thrifts and credit unions and has 540 Financial Advisors in 243 locations.

The number of Financial Advisors in these offices ranges from 1 to 30.  Such Financial Advisors devote all or substantially all of their time to the sale of securities and, while these independent contractors must conduct all securities business through RJFS, their contracts permit them to conduct insurance, real estate brokerage, accounting services or other business for others or for their own account.  Independent contractors are responsible for all of their direct costs and are paid a larger percentage of commissions and fees to compensate them for their added expenses.

Raymond James Ltd.

RJ Ltd. has 19 retail branches and 227 Financial Advisors located in Canada.  Raymond James Ltd. provides a broad range of financial products and services to clients, primarily in accordance with an established commission schedule.  Raymond James Ltd. also offers asset-based fee alternatives to its traditional commission structure.

Planning Corporation of America

Planning Corporation of America ("PCA"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of RJA, is a general insurance agency and represents a number of insurance companies.  Through the Financial Advisors of the Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries, PCA provides product and marketing support for a broad range of insurance products, principally fixed and variable annuities, numerous forms of life insurance, disability insurance and long-term care coverage.

***************

Clients' transactions in securities are effected on either a cash or margin basis.  In margin transactions, the client pays a portion of the purchase price, and RJA makes a loan to the client for the balance, collateralized by the securities purchased or by other securities owned by the client.  Interest is charged to clients on the amount borrowed to finance margin transactions.  The financing of margin purchases is an important source of revenue to RJA, since the interest rate paid by the client on funds loaned by RJA exceeds RJA's cost of short-term funds. The interest rate charged to a client on a margin loan depends on the average loan balance in the client's account and ranges from prime plus 1% to prime minus .75%.

Typically, broker-dealers utilize secured bank borrowings and equity capital as the primary sources of funds to finance clients' margin account borrowings.  The Company's primary source of funds to finance clients' margin account balances has been cash balances in clients' accounts (Client Interest Program) which are awaiting investment.  In addition, pursuant to written agreements with clients, broker-dealers are permitted by Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and NYSE rules to lend client securities in margin accounts to other brokers. SEC regulations, however, restrict the use of clients' funds derived from pledging and lending clients' securities, as well as funds awaiting investment, to the financing of margin account balances, and to the extent not so used, such funds are required to be deposited in a special account for the benefit of clients.  The regulations also require broker-dealers, within designated periods of time, to obtain po
ssession or control of, and to segregate, clients' fully paid and excess margin securities.

INSTITUTIONAL DISTRIBUTION

The Company's institutional clients are serviced by RJA's and RJ Ltd's Institutional Equity and Fixed Income Departments and by the European offices of RJFS.  In providing securities brokerage services to its institutional clients, the Company discounts its commissions substantially on transactions based on trade size and the amount of business conducted annually with each institution.

The 94 domestic and overseas professionals in the Institutional Equity Sales and Sales Trading Departments maintain relationships with over
1,000 institutional clients, principally in North America and Europe. In addition to the Company's headquarters in St. Petersburg, FL, institutional equity offices are located in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Brussels, Dusseldorf, Geneva, London (Raymond James Financial International, Ltd., a UK broker-dealer), Luxembourg and Paris.

In addition, RJA distributes to its institutional clients both taxable and tax-exempt fixed income products, primarily municipal, corporate, government agency and mortgage-backed bonds.  RJA carries inventory positions of taxable and municipal securities in both the primary and secondary markets.  In addition to St. Petersburg, the Fixed Income Department maintains institutional sales and trading offices in New York, Chicago, Houston, Boston, Atlanta, Boca Raton, and Dublin, Ohio. To assist our institutional clients, the Fixed Income Research Group provides value-added analytical services and publishes research reports containing specific product information and information on topics of interest such as market and regulatory developments.

Raymond James Ltd. has four institutional offices and 24 equity sales and trading professionals servicing predominantly Canadian institutional investors from offices in Calgary, Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver.

***************

The revenues and costs of RJA's back office operations are attributable primarily to the two distribution segments above.  RJA's operations personnel are responsible for the execution of orders, processing of securities transactions, custody of client securities, receipt, identification and delivery of funds and securities, compliance with regulatory and legal requirements, internal financial accounting and controls and general office administration for most of the Company's securities brokerage operations.

INVESTMENT BANKING/CAPITAL MARKETS

Capital Markets activities include both equity and fixed income products and services. This segment consists of the departments described below:

Research Department.

The 49 domestic senior analysts in this department publish research on nearly 500 predominantly U.S. companies, primarily focused on emerging growth, mid-cap and large-cap companies in specific industries including Technology, Telecommunications, Consumer, Financial Services, Healthcare, Real Estate, Energy and Industrial Growth.  Proprietary industry studies and company-specific research reports are provided to both institutional and retail clients.  This department has distinguished itself through its record of extremely successful comparative results as reported each quarter in the Wall Street Journal.  RJ Ltd. adds an additional 18 analysts which publish research on approximately 150 Canadian companies in the Biotechnology, Energy, Industrial Consumer Growth, Paper and Forest Products, Real Estate and Technology sectors.

Over-the-Counter Equity Trading.

Trading securities in the over-the-counter ("OTC") market involves the purchase of securities from, and the sale of securities to, clients of the Company or other dealers who may be purchasing or selling securities for their own account or acting as agent for their clients.  Profits and losses are derived from the spreads between bid and asked prices, as well as market trends for the individual securities during the holding period.  RJA makes markets in approximately 250 common stocks in the OTC market.

Investment Banking

.  The 60 professionals of RJA's Investment Banking Group, located primarily in St. Petersburg with principal offices in Atlanta, Nashville, Chicago, Princeton, Dallas, Houston and Detroit are involved in a variety of activities including public and private equity financing for corporate clients, and merger and acquisition advisory services.  RJ Ltd.'s Investment Banking Group consists of 19 bankers located in Calgary, Toronto and Vancouver providing equity financing and financial advisory services to corporate clients.  The firm's investment banking activities are focused in the same industries as those followed by the Equity Research department.

In addition, RJA acts as an underwriter or selling group member for corporate bonds, agency bonds, preferred stock and unit investment trusts. When underwriting new issue securities, RJA agrees to purchase the issue through a negotiated sale or submits a competitive bid.

Syndicate Department

.  The Syndicate Department coordinates the marketing, distribution, pricing and stabilization of Raymond James' lead- and co-managed equity underwritings. In addition to Raymond James' managed and co-managed offerings, this department coordinates the firm's syndicate and selling group activities in transactions managed by other investment banking firms. Marketing and distribution activities are focused on the firm's institutional and retail clients. The Syndicate Department is also responsible for the Private Client Group which serves the firm's Investment Banking and Research clients by providing specialized brokerage services for corporations and their executives.

Public Finance.

The 21 professionals in the Public Finance division operate out of 8 offices (2 located in the State of Florida, one each in Birmingham, AL, New York, Pittsburgh, Detroit, Chicago, and San Antonio), acting as Financial Advisor or underwriter to various municipal agencies or political subdivisions.

Partnership Investment Banking.

The Company acts as the general partner in equipment leasing and real estate limited partnerships.  Most significantly, Raymond James Tax Credit Funds, Inc. is the general partner in funds that have invested nationwide in properties that qualify for low income housing tax credits.

ASSET MANAGEMENT

The Company's asset management segment includes proprietary asset management operations, internally sponsored mutual funds, outside money management alternatives, and other asset-based fee programs.

Eagle Asset Management, Inc.

Eagle is a registered investment advisor with approximately $4.6 billion under management at September 28, 2001.  Eagle's clients include pension and profit sharing plans, retirement funds, foundations, endowments, trusts, life insurance and mutual fund portfolios and individuals.  Accounts are managed on a discretionary basis in accordance with the investment objective(s) specified by the client.  Eagle manages approximately $1.7 billion for institutional clients and $2.9 billion for retail accounts.

Eagle's investment management fee generally ranges from .20% to 1.0% of asset balances per year depending upon the size and investment objective of the account. In addition to the management fees, clients are required to pay brokerage commissions (or more commonly, a fee in lieu thereof) for transactions in their accounts.

Heritage Asset Management, Inc.

Heritage Asset Management, Inc. ("Heritage") serves as investment advisor to the Heritage Family of Mutual Funds.  Heritage also serves as transfer agent for all of the funds and as fund accountant for all Heritage funds except the Eagle International Equity Portfolio. Portfolio management for the Aggressive Growth Fund, Growth Equity Fund, Technology Fund and the Mid Cap Stock Fund are subcontracted to Eagle Asset Management, Inc. Portfolio management for the Small Cap Stock Fund is subcontracted to both Eagle and the Company's Awad Asset Management subsidiary.  Unaffiliated advisors are employed for the Municipal Money Market Fund, Capital Appreciation Trust, High Yield Bond Fund, Growth and Income Fund, Value Equity Fund,
Intermediate Government Fund and the Eagle International Equity Portfolio.

Heritage also serves as an advisor to Raymond James Bank to make recommendations and monitor the Bank's investment portfolio of mortgage-backed securities.

Net assets under management at September 28, 2001 were as follows (in thousands):

Awad Asset Management, Inc.

Awad Asset Management, Inc. ("Awad") is primarily a small and mid-cap equity portfolio management subsidiary.  Clients pay fees and/or commissions for management of their accounts.  Present fees generally range from .50% to 1.0% of asset balances annually.  In addition to private accounts, Awad also manages a portion of the Heritage Small Cap Stock Fund Portfolio and other non-affiliated mutual fund portfolios. Exclusive of the Heritage Small Cap Stock Fund, Awad had approximately $557 million under management at September 28, 2001.

RJA - Asset Management Services

RJA's Asset Management Services ("AMS") Department manages programs which offer investment advisory services to clients, as well as certain non-advisory programs which offer fee-based alternatives to traditional commission charges for transactions.  The primary advisory service offered by AMS is the Investment Advisory Services ("IAS") program.  IAS  maintains an approved list of investment managers, of which all but one are unaffiliated with the Company, establishes custodial facilities, monitors performance of client accounts, provides clients with accounting and other administrative services and assists investment managers with certain trading management activities.  IAS earns fees generally ranging from .50% to 1.0% of asset balances per annum, a portion of which is paid to investment managers who direct the investment of the clients' accounts. At September 28, 2001, this program had approximately $4 billion in assets under manageme
nt through agreements with 31 independent investment advisors and Awad.

Passport and a similar program, known as IMPAC, offer both a discretionary and  non-discretionary advisory fee alternative that allows clients to pay a quarterly fee plus low transaction charges in lieu of commissions.  Fees are based on the individual account size and are also dependent on the type of securities in the accounts.  For these accounts, clients receive quarterly performance reporting and other services.  As of September 28, 2001, Passport and IMPAC had approximately $5.9 billion and $2.5 billion in assets, respectively, serviced by Financial Advisors.

In addition to the foregoing programs, AMS also offers fee based programs to clients who have contracted for portfolio management services from outside money managers that are not a part of the IAS program.

OTHER

Aside from the retail and institutional distribution, investment banking and asset management businesses, the Company operates a stock borrow/stock loan program, offers bank and trust services, and has several international joint ventures.  These operations are grouped in the "other" segment.

RJA - Stock Borrow/Stock Loan

RJA commenced this program in 1987, involving the borrowing and lending of securities from and to other broker-dealers.  RJA generally acts as an intermediary between broker-dealers and other financial institutions, where it borrows from one party and lends to another.  The borrower of the securities puts up a cash deposit, commonly 102% of the market value of the securities.  This deposit, which is adjusted daily to reflect changes in current market value, earns interest at a negotiated rate.

Raymond James Bank, FSB

RJBank received its federal savings bank charter in 1994.  RJBank provides residential, consumer and commercial loans as well as FDIC-insured deposit accounts to clients of Raymond James Financial's broker-dealer subsidiaries and to the general public.

Access to RJBank's products and services is available nationwide through the offices of its affiliated broker-dealer firms as well as through convenient telephonic and electronic banking services, including Internet Banking with online Bill Pay through

www.rjbank.com debit cards, ATM/point-of-sale, 24-hour TeleDirect

TM

automated telephone banking, checkwriting, direct deposit and ACH payments and deposits.  As of September 28, 2001, RJBank had total assets in excess of $897 million.

Raymond James Trust Company

Raymond James Trust Company West

Raymond James Trust Company was chartered and opened for business in 1992. This wholly owned subsidiary of RJF was formed primarily to provide personal trust services to existing clients of the broker-dealer subsidiaries.  Portfolio management of trust assets is often subcontracted to the asset management operations of the Company.  In October 1993, the Company acquired a second trust company, Sound Trust Company, in Tacoma, Washington. The name of Sound Trust Company was changed to Raymond James Trust Company West effective October 1, 2000. This subsidiary provides personal trust services primarily to broker-dealer clients outside the State of Florida.  These two subsidiaries had a combined total of $624 million in client assets at September 28, 2001.

Raymond James Credit Corporation

Raymond James Credit Corporation ("RJCC") was formed in 1996 as a regulated finance company. To date, this subsidiary has primarily provided loans collateralized by control or restricted securities. RJCC is funded with internal capital and by a $50 million line of credit with a commercial bank. At September 28, 2001, RJCC had $11 million in outstanding loans to clients.

Raymond James International Holdings, Inc.

Raymond James Killik, Ltd.

Raymond James International Holdings, Inc. ("RJIH") is a Delaware corporation formed in 1994 to house some of the Company's foreign operations. RJIH now has ownership in consolidated joint ventures in Argentina, India, Turkey and France.  These joint ventures operate in securities brokerage, investment banking and asset management.  In addition, the Company initiated a joint venture known as Raymond James Killik, Ltd. to develop an independent contractor network in the United Kingdom.

COMPETITION

The Company's subsidiaries compete with many larger, better capitalized providers of financial services, including other securities firms, some of which are affiliated with major financial services companies, insurance companies, banking institutions and other organizations.  They also compete with a number of firms offering discount brokerage services, usually with lower levels of service, to individual clients.  The Company's subsidiaries compete principally on the basis of service, product selection, location and reputation in local markets.

REGULATION

Most of the Company's operations are subject to regulatory oversight by governmental agencies and/or self regulatory organizations.

The securities industry in the United States of America is subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws.  The SEC is the federal agency charged with administration of the federal securities laws.  Much of the regulation of broker-dealers, however, has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations, principally the NASD and the NYSE.  These self-regulatory organizations adopt rules (which are subject to approval by the SEC) for governing the industry and conduct periodic examinations of member broker-dealers.  Securities firms are also subject to regulation by state securities commissions in the states in which they are registered.  RJA and RJFS are currently registered in all 50 states.

See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of certain SEC regulations pertaining to broker-dealer Net Capital Requirements.

The Company's investment advisory operations, including the Company-sponsored mutual funds, are also subject to extensive regulation by the SEC.

Raymond James Bank, FSB, is subject to regulation by various federal banking agencies, including the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

The Company's two trust companies are subject to regulation by the states in which they are chartered.

The Company's various overseas operations and joint ventures are subject to regulation by the authorities in the countries in which they operate.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES

The Company owns a 610,000 square foot headquarters complex in St. Petersburg, FL (three mid-rise office buildings, a bank and trust headquarters building, and a five deck parking garage). The complex covers approximately fifty-five acres, and the Company has the ability to build up to another 753,000 square feet on this site.  The Company has begun the construction of a fourth mid-rise office building and another parking garage.  The office building is expected to be ready for occupancy in March 2003.  The Company also leases 80,000 square feet in a nearby office building, and an additional 30,000 square feet in another nearby facility. 
In addition, the Company acquired a 45,000 square foot, eight story building in Detroit, Michigan as part of the Roney transaction.  The Company also leases 20,000 square feet in a building adjacent to the Detroit building.  With the exception of a Company-owned RJA branch office building in Crystal River, FL, RJA branches are leased with various expiration dates through 2008.  The RJFS Investment Management division headquarters office in Atlanta and Raymond James Trust Company West facility in Tacoma are also under lease.  See Note 10 to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Company's leases.

Leases for branch offices of RJFS are the responsibility of the respective independent contractor registered representatives.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company is a defendant or co-defendant in various lawsuits and arbitrations incidental to its securities business.  The Company is contesting the allegations in these cases and believes that there are meritorious defenses in each of these lawsuits.  In view of the number and diversity of claims against the Company, the number of jurisdictions in which litigation is pending and the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation and other claims, the Company cannot state with certainty what the eventual outcome of pending litigation or other claims will be.  In the opinion of the Company's management, based in part on outside legal counsel, and after consideration of amounts provided for in the accompanying financial statements with respect to these matters, ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on the company's financial position or results of ope
rations.

On June 19, 2000 a judgment in the amount of $40.7 million was entered in the United States of America District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, Covington Division, against Raymond James & Associates, Inc., and RJ Mortgage Acceptance Corp., a subsidiary of the Company which has been inactive since 1995.  In June, 2001, the Company paid Corporex $27.5 million in full settlement of the judgment.  See discussion of financial statement impact in Management's Discussion and Analysis.

As a result of the extensive regulation of the securities industry, the Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to regular reviews and inspections by regulatory authorities and self regulatory organizations which can result in imposition of sanctions for regulatory violations, ranging from non-monetary censure to fines and, in serious cases, temporary or permanent suspension from business.  In addition, from time to time regulatory agencies and self regulatory organizations institute investigations into industry practices which can result in the imposition of such sanctions.  During the course of the past fiscal year, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. resolved a number of self regulatory investigations by payment of fines that were immaterial in amount.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Results of Operations - Three Years Ended September 28, 2001

During fiscal 2001 the Company's total revenues of $1,657,844,000 were its second highest ever, trailing the prior year by 2%. However, excluding the $65 million from Raymond James Ltd. ("RJ Ltd."), which was acquired effective January 1, 2001, revenues declined 6%.  Net income of $96,410,000 represented a decrease of 23% from the prior year; however, operating results (excluding the charge to reserve for the Corporex judgement in 2000 and the partial subsequent reversal of this reserve in 2001) were down 36% from the prior year. The Company continues to be successful in its focus on non-transaction dependent fee revenues, such as investment advisory fees, interest and asset-based commission alternatives.  For fiscal 2001, such fee-based revenues represented approximately 48% of total revenues, up from 36% five years ago.

The major contributors to the decline in revenues were retail commissions and reduced interest income, although the majority of operations performed below expectations as negative market conditions permeated most sectors of our business.

*    Includes $65,463 from RJ Ltd. (formerly Goepel McDermid Inc.) which was acquired January 1, 2001.

In contrast to the prior year, which reflected vibrant retail activity from a combination of strong market conditions and good Financial Advisor recruiting results, fiscal 2001 was plagued by poor equity markets, leading to a decline in transaction volume.  With respect to prior years' activity, the largest dollar increases occurred in mutual funds and over-the-counter equities during fiscal 2000 and in equities and annuities in fiscal 1999.

*    Includes RJ Ltd.

Investment banking revenues, including new issue sales credits, remained well below the record levels of 1997-1998, and were relatively flat with the prior year excluding the $15 million added by RJ Ltd.  During fiscal 2000 and 2001, the Company made significant personnel additions in both the technology and healthcare sectors and acquired RJ Ltd., which further strengthened the energy sector.  The number of managed and co-managed underwritings, the vast majority of which were equity-related offerings, and the dollar volume of these transactions were as follows: 2001 - 25 new issues for $3.7 billion; 2000 - 23 new issues for $3.6 billion and 1999 - 23 new issues for $3.0 billion.  Merger and acquisition fees, which have been a consistent revenue source during the past several years, increased to $28.2 million (including $6.6 million from RJ Ltd.) in fiscal 2001, an increase of 10% (excluding RJ Ltd.) over $19.7 million in fiscal 2000 ($16.3 million in 1999).

Investment advisory fees were flat with the prior year.  RJ Ltd. did not significantly impact this revenue line as their businesses are currently transaction oriented.  Although Eagle and RJA's asset management services had positive net sales of $756 million for the year, the decline in equity asset values more than offset these sales.  Asset management fees had benefited from both overall asset appreciation and net sales in fiscal 2000 and 1999. The largest increase has occurred in Investment Advisory Services (which offers the services of an approved list of predominantly unaffiliated investment advisors to the Company's clients) as a result of the strong performance of several managers in the program and the addition of client assets from the Roney acquisition in 1999.

Interest revenues declined 3% vs. the prior year, while interest expense was flat, resulting in a 9% decline in net interest income.  Even with this decline, net interest increased to 67% of pretax income, up from 57% in both fiscal 2000 and 1999.  The decrease in interest income in fiscal 2001 is the result of the significantly lower margin balances as equity values have declined and retail customers became more conservative in their investing.  Flat interest expense in fiscal 2001 is the result of increased CIP balances combined with decreased interest rates.  As a result net interest income declined in 2001, after a significant increase in fiscal 2000 when margin balances were continuing to grow.

Excluding $1.6 million in trading profits generated by RJ Ltd., trading profits declined slightly as over-the-counter equity trading results declined, attributable largely to decimalization of equity prices.  Almost offsetting the decline in equity trading profits were record trading profit levels in fixed income, with particularly strong municipal trading profits.  Fiscal 2000 trading results reflected significantly improved municipal bond and over-the-counter equity trading results, with the industry having adapted to the changes in the over-the-counter regulations made in fiscal 1998.  Trading results in fiscal 1999 reflected particularly strong corporate and government bond trading results.

Financial service fees increased 6% in fiscal 2001, consistent with the growth in the Company's client base and due to the addition of RJ Ltd.  The two most significant items are IRA fees and wrap fee account transaction fees.  In the past two years, there has been a 50% increase in the number of IRA accounts. Transaction fees arising from retail asset-based fee account programs declined 25% in 2001 after increasing 55% in 2000.

Other income is comprised predominantly of postage and handling fees and floor brokerage income, both of which are related to transaction volume.  Transaction volume declined in fiscal 2001 and the related fees declined similarly.  In addition to increases in volume during fiscal years 2000 and 1999, the Company also increased its postage and handling fee in February 2000.

Expenses were up 3% on an operating (ex-Corporex) basis. This increase was primarily a result of personnel added in operations (to support the previous years' volume), equity capital markets and asset management.

*    Includes $64,418 in expenses from RJ Ltd. (formerly Goepel McDermid Inc.) which was acquired January 1, 2001.

Sales commission expense has varied each period at a rate approximately proportionate to the related revenues.

In the past,

administrative and benefit compensation costs have typically increased at a rate consistent with the growth in total revenues.  However, during the first part of fiscal 2001 the Company continued to add back office personnel in response to the record transaction volumes of the previous years.  In addition, the Company continued to recruit investment bankers and research analysts during a period of slower investment banking revenues and added 770 employees in RJ Ltd.  As a result of the market slowdown the Company has critically reviewed personnel requirements and reduced headcount in the last two quarters of fiscal 2001.  In fiscal 2000 revenues grew 38% and administrative and clerical personnel costs increased only 29%, providing part of the Company's leverage which resulted in improved margins over fiscal 1999.

Incentive compensation expenses, including contributions to qualified retirement plans, are based on departmental, subsidiary and firm-wide profitability.  Effective for fiscal 2001, the Company changed the relationship of incentive compensation and base pay for employees at the assistant vice president level and below, effectively shifting approximately $8 million in compensation from incentive compensation to administrative expense.  In addition, due to the addition of several teams of people in both investment banking and asset management with guaranteed compensation levels, incentive compensation did not decline ratably with income.  The Company's contributions to qualified retirement plans and long term incentive plans did vary proportionately to pretax income in both 2000 and 2001.

The increase in communications and information processing during fiscal 2001 was attributable almost entirely to the addition of RJ Ltd.   While costs associated with overall growth continued to affect communications and information processing expense during fiscal 2000, there were also some significant individual items such as Y2K testing and the development of the former Roney headquarters in Detroit as a second processing center.  Fiscal 1999 included costs associated with the integration of Roney, preparation for Y2K and the merger creating RJFS. The increases in communications and information processing expense in all three fiscal years include the costs of further enhancement and expansion of the Company's systems of internal communication and information dissemination.

Increased occupancy and equipment expense in fiscal 2001 and 2000 includes expanded RJA retail and institutional offices, additional equipment and additional space in Detroit.  In addition, fiscal 2001 includes approximately $6 million from the acquisition of RJ Ltd.

Clearing and floor brokerage increased 9% in fiscal 2001, the net result of the addition of RJ Ltd. and lower transaction volume, and increased 10% in fiscal 2000, a result of increased transaction volume and higher international clearing costs.  As in the past, clearing and floor brokerage expense increased at a rate lower than the growth in related revenues due to volume efficiencies and the cost saving measures implemented.

Business development expenses increased 30% in fiscal 2001 as the Company increased its television advertising and some additional branding efforts on a trial basis under the guidance of an advertising agency.  RJ Ltd. added $2.6 million in business and development expenses in fiscal 2001.  Several of the Company's branding initiatives impacted business development expense in fiscal 2000 and 1999, including the stadium naming rights, general image advertising costs (primarily television), and recruiting-related programs focusing on the creation of RJFS.

Other expense includes the decrease in legal reserves in fiscal 2001 and the increase in legal reserves in 2000 related to the Corporex judgment discussed in Note 10.  In addition, this expense category includes fees paid to outside managers in the Company's investment advisory services program, bank service charges, legal expenses and provisions, and amortization of goodwill arising from the RJ Ltd. and Roney acquisitions.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Net cash provided by operating activities during the current year was $180 million.  Cash was provided by decreased stock borrow balances exceeding decreased stock loan balances, decreased balances in the client margin accounts and increased client interest balances, increased broker-dealer payables, and the fluctuations in various other asset and liability accounts net of the increased segregated cash and cash
equivalents and trading account securities.

Investing activities required
$43 million during the year.  The Company used $48 million to purchase Goepel McDermid Inc. and additions to fixed assets consumed $27 million, predominantly for the purchase of computers, office furniture and equipment.  Net purchases, sales and maturations of investments provided $33 million during the year.

Financing activities provided
$18 million, the result of net borrowing exceeding the payment of cash dividends net of the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchases.

The Company has loans payable consisting of a $37.9 million mortgage on its headquarters office complex, $60 million in Federal Home Loan Bank advances at RJBank, $1.3 million at Raymond James Credit Corporation and a $50 million three year term loan at RJF.  In addition, RJF has a $125 million line of credit and RJ Ltd., has a $40 million Canadian line of credit.  Raymond James & Associates, Inc. has uncommitted bank lines of credit aggregating $305 million with commercial banks.

The Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to requirements of the SEC  and the Investment Dealers Association of Canada relating to liquidity and capital standards (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

Effects of recently issued accounting standards

In September 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FAS No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities ("FAS 140"), an update to FAS No. 125 of the same name.  This statement revised the standards for accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and collateral and requires certain disclosures, but it carries over most of Statement No. 125's provisions without reconsideration.  The Company receives collateral in connection with resale agreements, securities borrowed transactions and customer margin loans.  Under many agreements, the Company is permitted to sell or repledge these securities held as collateral and use these securities to enter into securities lending arrangements or deliver to counterparties to cover short positions.  As a result of this statement the Company added disclosures within Note 10.

In July 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 141, Business Combinations, and Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.  Statement 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 as well as all purchase method business combinations completed after June 30, 2001.  Statement 141 also specifies the criteria intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill.  Statement 142 will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of Statement 142.

The Company has adopted the provisions of SFAS 141, and plans to adopt the provisions of SFAS 142 effective September 29, 2001.

Statement 141 requires upon adoption of Statement 142, that the Company evaluate its existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in a prior purchase business combination, and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria in Statement 141 for recognition apart from goodwill and to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired. In addition, the Company is required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of Statement 142.  Any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period.

As of the planned date of adoption, the Company had unamortized goodwill of approximately $62 million which will be subject to the transition provisions of Statements 141 and 142.  Because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting these Statements 141 and 142, it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting these Statements on the Company's financial statements at the date of this report, including whether it will be required to recognize any transitional impairment losses as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143 - Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.  Statement 143 relates to the accounting for the obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets.  In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144 - Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets.  Statement 144 establishes methods of accounting and reporting for the impairment of long-lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets not being amortized.  The Company is currently reviewing these statements and the impact of their adoption on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  The Company will implement Statement 143 and 144 beginning in the first quarter of its fiscal year ending September 26, 2003.

RISK MANAGEMENT

Risks are an inherent part of the Company's business and activities.  Management of these risks is critical to the Company's soundness and profitability.  Risk management at the Company is a multi-faceted process that requires communication, judgment and knowledge of financial products and markets.  The Company's senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and requires specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment, monitoring and control of various risks.  The principal risks involved in its business activities are market, credit, operational and legal.

Market Risk

The potential for changes in the value of financial instruments owned by the Company is referred to as "market risk".  Market risk is inherent to both derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, and accordingly, the scope of the Company's market risk management procedures extends beyond derivatives to include all market-risk-sensitive financial instruments.

The Company trades tax exempt and taxable debt obligations, including U.S. Treasury bills, notes, and bonds; U.S. Government agency and municipal notes and bonds; bank certificates of deposit; mortgage backed
securities; and corporate obligations.  The Company is also an active market-maker in over-the-counter equity securities.  In connection with these activities, the Company may maintain inventories in order to ensure availability and to facilitate customer transactions.  The Company also invests for its own proprietary investment account on a limited basis.

Changes in value of the Company's financial instruments may result from fluctuations in interest rates, credit ratings, equity prices and the correlation among these factors, along with the level of volatility.

The Company manages its trading businesses by product and has established trading divisions that have responsibility for each product.  The trading inventories are managed with a view toward facilitating client transactions, considering the risk and profitability of each inventory.

Position limits in trading inventory accounts are established and monitored on a daily basis.  Management monitors inventory levels and results of the trading groups, as well as inventory aging, pricing, concentration and securities ratings.

The Company utilizes interest rate swap contracts to hedge its debt inventory, acts in a matched book dealer capacity in these instruments, and to hedge RJBank's loan portfolio against fluctuations in interest rates.  RJ Bank accounts for its swap activity under FAS 133 and monitors this activity by reviewing resulting net yields and spreads.  The Company uses notional (contract) amounts and daily mark to markets among other methods to measure this derivative activity.  Notional amounts are not included on the Company's balance sheet as these contract amounts are not actually paid or received.  Notional amounts allow the Company to calculate the cash flows to be exchanged and are not necessarily indicative of overall market risk.

Interest Rate Risk

The Company is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of maintaining inventories of interest-rate-sensitive financial instruments and from changes in the interest rates on its interest-earning assets (including client loans, stock borrow activities, investments, and inventories) and its funding sources (including client cash balances, stock lending activities, and bank borrowings), which finance these assets.  The collateral underlying financial instruments at the broker-dealer is repriced daily, thus there are no unrecorded gains or losses in value. Interest rates on client balances and stock borrow and lending produce a positive spread to the Company, with the rates generally fluctuating in parallel.

The Company manages its inventory exposure to interest rate risk by setting and monitoring limits and, where feasible, hedging with offsetting positions in securities with similar interest rate risk characteristics.  While a significant portion of the Company's securities inventories have contractual maturities in excess of five years, these inventories, on average, turn over in excess of several times per year.  The Company uses interest rate sensitivity analysis to monitor its exposure in the RJBank portfolio.

Equity Price Risk

The Company is exposed to equity price risk as a consequence of making markets in equity securities.  The Company attempts to reduce the risk of loss inherent in its inventory of equity securities by monitoring those security positions constantly throughout each day and establishing position limits.

The Company's equity securities inventories are repriced on a regular basis and there are no unrecorded gains or losses.  The Company's activities as a dealer are client-driven, with the objective of meeting clients' needs while earning a positive spread.

The tables above primarily represent trading inventory associated with our customer facilitation, market-making activities and RJBank investments, and include net long and short fair values, which is consistent with the way risk exposure is managed.  See Notes 2 and 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the related gross long and short fair values of financial instruments owned and investments.

Credit Risk

The Company is engaged in various trading and brokerage activities whose counterparties primarily include broker-dealer, banks and other financial institutions.  In the event counterparties do not fulfill their obligations, the Company may be exposed to risk.  The risk of default depends on the credit worthiness of the counterparty or issuer of the instrument.  The Company manages this risk by imposing and monitoring position limits for each counterparty, monitoring trading counterparties, conducting regular credit reviews of financial counterparties, reviewing security concentrations, holding and marking to market collateral on certain transactions and conducting business through clearing organizations, which guarantee performance.

The Company's client activities involve the execution, settlement, and financing of various transactions on behalf of its clients.  Client activities are transacted on either a cash or margin basis.  Credit exposure associated with the Company's retail client business consists primarily of customer margin accounts, which are monitored daily and are collateralized.  The Company monitors exposure to industry sectors and individual securities and performs analysis on a regular basis in connection with its margin lending activities.  The Company adjusts its margin requirements if it believes its risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions.  In addition, RJ Bank offers a variety of loan products; including mortgage, commercial real estate, and consumer loans which are collateralized and corporate loans for which the borrower is carefully evaluated and monitored.

The Company is subject to concentration risk if it holds large positions, extends large loans to, or has large commitments with a single counterparty, borrower, or group of similar counterparties or borrowers (i.e. in the same industry). Securities purchased under agreement to resell represent approximately 26% of the Company's total assets and consist of securities issued by the U.S. government.  Receivables from and payables to clients and stock borrow and lending activities are both with a large number of clients and counterparties and any potential concentration is carefully monitored.  Inventory and investment positions taken and commitments made, including underwritings, may involve exposure to individual issuers and businesses.  The Company seeks to limit this risk through careful review of counterparties and borrowers and the use of limits established by senior management, taking into consideration factors including the financial strength of the counte
rparty, the size of the position or commitment, the expected duration of the position or commitment and other positions or commitments outstanding.

The Company is the lessor in two leveraged commercial aircraft transactions with major domestic airlines.  The Company's ability to realize its expected return is dependent upon the airlines' ability to fulfill its lease obligations.  In the unlikely event that the Company was unable to re-lease or sell the plane with adequate terms the Company would suffer a loss of some or all of its investment.  As of September 28, 2001, it is management's opinion that the Company's return on this investment will not be impaired.

Operational Risk

Operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from the Company's operations, including, but not limited to, improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions, deficiencies in the Company's technology or financial operating systems and inadequacies or breaches in the company's control processes.  The Company operates different businesses in diverse markets and is reliant on the ability of its employees and systems to process a large number of transactions.  These risks are less direct than credit and market risk, but managing them is critical, particularly in a rapidly changing environment with increasing transaction volumes.  In the event of a breakdown or improper operation of systems or improper action by employees, the Company could suffer financial loss, regulatory sanctions and damage to its reputation.  In order to mitigate and control operational risk, the Company has developed and continues to enhance specific poli
cies and procedures that are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels throughout the organization and within such departments as Accounting, Operations, Information Technology, Legal, Compliance and Internal Audit.  These control mechanisms attempt to ensure that operational policies and procedures are being followed and that the Company's various businesses are operating within established corporate policies and limits.  Business continuity plans exist for critical systems, and redundancies are built into the systems as deemed appropriate.

Regulatory and Legal Risk

Legal risk includes the risk of a potentially sizable adverse legal judgement and of non-compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.  The Company is generally subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which it conducts its business.  The Company has various procedures addressing issues such as regulatory capital requirements, sales and trading practices, use of and safekeeping of customer funds, credit granting, collection activities, money-laundering and record keeping.

Effects of Inflation

The Company's assets are primarily liquid in nature and are not significantly affected by inflation.  Management believes that the replacement cost of property and equipment would not materially affect operating results. However, the rate of inflation affects the Company's expenses, including employee compensation and benefits, communications and occupancy, which may not be readily recoverable through charges for services provided by the Company.

Factors Affecting "Forward-Looking Statements"

From time to time, the Company may publish "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or make oral statements that constitute forward-looking statements.  These forward-looking statements may relate to such matters as anticipated financial performance, future revenues or earnings, business prospects, projected ventures, new products, anticipated market performance, and similar matters.  The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements.  In order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor, the Company cautions readers that a variety of factors could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the Company's forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyo
nd the Company's control, include, but are not limited to: (i) transaction volume in the securities markets, (ii) the volatility of the securities markets, (iii) fluctuations in interest rates, (iv) changes in regulatory requirements which could affect the cost of doing business or the profitability of certain segments of the Company's business, (v) fluctuations in currency rates, (vi) general economic conditions, both domestic and international, (vii) changes in the rate of inflation and related impact on securities markets, (viii) competition from existing financial institutions and other new participants in the securities markets, (ix) legal developments affecting the litigation experience of the securities industry, (x) changes in federal and state tax laws which could affect the popularity of products sold by the Company, (xi) natural disasters and (xii) political and military events which would affect the United States of America or world markets, which could disrupt the Company's communications and se
curities processing capabilities or other operations.  The Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.

Independent Auditors' Report

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors

of Raymond James Financial, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statement of financial condition of Raymond James Financial, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 28, 2001, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, changes in
shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the year then ended.  These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.  The consolidated financial statements of Raymond James Financial, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 28, 2000 and for the years ended September 28, 2000 and September 24, 1999 were audited by other auditors, whose report dated November 17, 2000 expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements.

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Raymond James Financial, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 28, 2001 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Report of Independent Certified Public Accountants

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders

of Raymond James Financial, Inc.

In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other auditors, the consolidated statement of financial condition as of September 29, 2000 and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended September 29, 2000 (appearing on pages F-5 through F-9 of the Raymond James Financial, Inc. 2001 Form 10-K) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Raymond James Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries at September 29, 2000 and for each of the two fiscal years in the period ended September 29, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We did not audit the financial statements of Raymond James Bank, FSB, a wholly-owned subsidiary, which statements reflect total assets of $712,332,000 as of September 29, 2000 and total revenues of $45,150,000 and $29,200,000 for each of the two fiscal years in the period ended September 29, 2000.  Those statements were audited by other auditors whose report thereon has been furnished to us, and our opinion expressed herein, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for Raymond James Bank, FSB, is based solely on the report of the other auditors.  We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence sup
porting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

The Board of Directors

Raymond James Bank, FSB (a wholly owned

subsidiary of Raymond James Financial, Inc.):

We have audited the balance sheet of Raymond James Bank, FSB (a wholly owned subsidiary  of Raymond James Financial, Inc.) as of September  30,  2000,  and  the  related  statements of income,
stockholder's  equity  and comprehensive  income,  and  cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended September 30, 2000.  These financial  statements are the responsibility of the
Bank's  management.   Our responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial statements  based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in accordance with auditing  standards  generally accepted  in the United States of America.  Those standards require  that  we plan  and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether  the financial  statements are free of material misstatement.  An  audit  includes examining,  on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and  disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles  used  and significant estimates made by management,  as  well  as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all  material respects, the financial position of Raymond James Bank, FSB  (a wholly  owned  subsidiary of Raymond James Financial, Inc.) at September  30, 2000, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended September 30, 2000 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Raymond James Financial, Inc. is a holding company which, through its subsidiaries, is engaged principally in the securities brokerage business, including the underwriting, distribution, trading and brokerage of equity and debt securities and the sale of mutual funds and other investment products.  In addition, it provides investment management services for retail and institutional clients and banking and trust services for retail clients.  The accounting and reporting policies of Raymond James Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the more significant of which are summarized below:

Basis of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Raymond James Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

All consolidated subsidiaries are 100% owned by the Company, except for Awad & Associates, Inc., which is 75% owned; Raymond James Killik, Ltd., which is 60% owned; various foreign joint ventures and RJ Properties, Inc., which was 85% owned until August 1999 (see Note 16).

Reporting period

The Company's fiscal year ends on the last Friday in September of each year.

Recognition of revenues

Securities transactions and related commission revenues and expenses are recorded on a trade date basis.

Investment banking fees are recorded at the time the transaction is completed and the related income is reasonably determinable.  Investment banking revenues include sales credits earned in connection with the distribution of the underwritten securities.  Any warrants received in connection with investment banking transactions are carried at estimated fair value as determined by management.  At such time as the warrants are exercisable and the underlying shares are salable, they are generally sold.

The Company earns an advisory fee based on a client's portfolio value on portfolios managed by its investment advisor subsidiaries.  These fees are recorded under the accrual method.

Management estimates and assumptions

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and cash equivalents, securities purchased under agreements to resell or repurchase

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents for purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows.  These consist primarily of securities purchased under agreements to resell, some of which are held in special reserve accounts, and are stated at cost, which approximates market at fiscal yearend.

In accordance with Rule 15c3-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company, as a broker-dealer carrying client accounts, is subject to requirements related to maintaining cash or qualified securities in a segregated reserve account for the exclusive benefit of its clients.

It is the Company's policy to obtain possession and control of securities purchased under resale agreements.  The net fair value of securities purchased under resale agreements approximates their carrying value, as such financial instruments are short-term in nature.  The Company monitors the risk of loss by assessing the market value of the underlying securities as compared to the related receivable or payable, including accrued interest, and requests additional collateral where deemed appropriate.  At September 28, 2001 and September 29, 2000, there were no agreements with any individual counterparties where the risk of loss exceeded 10% of shareholders' equity.

Transactions involving sale of securities under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements) or purchases of securities under agreements to resell (reverse repurchase agreements) are accounted for as collateralized financings.  Reverse purchase agreements generally require the Company to deposit cash, whereas the Company generally receives collateral in the form of cash under repurchase agreements.

Client receivables

Client receivables are reported at their outstanding principal, adjusted for any allowance for doubtful accounts, write-offs, any deferred fees or costs on originated bank loans and unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans.  Loan origination fees, net of related costs, are capitalized and recognized in income over the contractual life of the loans, adjusted for estimated prepayments based on the Bank's historical prepayment experience.

Client loans are considered to be impaired when it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due.  Impaired loans are written down or reserved to the extent that the principal is judged to be uncollectible.  In the case of collateral-dependent loans where repayment is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral value, the loans are written down to the lower of cost or collateral value.  The accrual of interest on impaired RJBank loans is discontinued when, in management's opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payments as they become due.  Interest is subsequently recognized to the extent cash payments are received. Impairment losses are included in the allowance for doubtful accounts or reserves through an income statement charge.

Loans available for sale

Mortgage loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market are carried at the lower of cost or estimated market value in the aggregate.  Net unrealized losses are recognized through a valuation allowance by charges to income.

Allowance for losses

The Company follows a consistent procedural discipline and accounts for loss contingencies in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies".  RJBank segregates the loan portfolio for loan loss purposes into the following broad segments: commercial, residential mortgage loans and consumer loans.  RJBank provides for a general allowance for losses inherent in the portfolio by the above categories, which consists of two components.  General loss percentages are calculated based upon historical analysis and supplemental portion of the allowance is calculated for inherent loses, which probably exist as of the evaluation date even though they might not have been identified by the more objective historical analysis.

RJBank measures impairment for individually impaired loans in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114, "Accounting by a Creditor for Impairment of a Loan".  RJBank measures impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, except that as a practical expedient, RJBank measures impairment based on the loan's observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.  Regardless of the measurement method, RJBank measures impairment based on the fair value of the collateral when the creditor determines that foreclosure is probable.  A loan is collateral dependent if the repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral. RJBank considers estimated cost to sell, on a discounted basis, in the measure of impairment if those costs are expected to reduce the cash flows available to repay or otherwise sa
tisfy the loan.  If the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral is less that the recorded investment in the loan, RJBank recognizes an impairment as an addition to the allowance for loan losses with a corresponding charge to provision expense.

The Company also makes specific allowances related to other identified and estimatable items including, but not limited to legal issues, trading errors and regulatory issues.

Securities borrowed and securities loaned

Securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions are reported as collateralized financings.  Securities borrowed transactions generally require the Company to deposit cash with the lender.  With respect to securities loaned, the Company generally receives collateral in the form of cash in an amount in excess of the market value of securities loaned.  The Company monitors the market value of securities borrowed and loaned on a daily basis, with additional collateral obtained or refunded as necessary.

Securities owned

The trading and investment account securities held by the brokerage subsidiaries are classified as trading. Marketable securities are recorded on trade date at estimated fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses included in earnings.  Securities which are not readily marketable are carried at estimated fair value, as determined by management, based upon consideration of available information, such as quotations for similar instruments.  The resulting differences between cost and fair value are included in earnings.  The Company accounts for other securities owned in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" ("FAS 115").  FAS 115 requires investments in debt and equity securities to be classified as either "held to maturity,"  "trading," or "available for sale."  The accounting treatment for unrealized ga
ins and losses on those securities is then determined by the classification chosen. Securities available for sale are carried at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses net of deferred taxes, reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity, and realized gains and losses, determined on a specific identification basis, are included in earnings.

Property and equipment

Property, equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.  Depreciation of assets is provided using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from two to five years for software, furniture and equipment and fifteen to thirty-one years for buildings and land improvements.  Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets.  For income tax purposes, assets are depreciated using accelerated methods.

Additions, improvements and expenditures for repairs and maintenance that significantly extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized.  Other expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to operations in the period incurred.  Gains and losses on disposals of property and equipment are reflected in income in the period realized.

Exchange memberships

Exchange memberships are carried at cost or, if an other than temporary impairment in value has occurred, at a value that reflects management's estimate of the impairment.  The Canadian and domestic memberships which are included in prepaid expenses and other assets at a cost of $3,619,000 and $3,339,000 at September 28, 2001, and September 29, 2000, respectively, had an aggregate determinable market value of $8,674,000 and $7,633,000 at September 28, 2001, and September 29, `2000, respectively.  The domestic seats' market values are determined based on last reported sale.  The fair value of the Toronto Stock Exchange membership has not yet been determined.

Intangible assets

Intangible assets which consist almost entirely of goodwill are stated at cost less accumulated amortization of $9,000,000 and $3,596,000 at September 28, 2001 and September 29, 2000, respectively.  Amortization of intangible assets is provided using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes over periods ranging from three to fifteen years.  Goodwill is assessed annually using a discounted cash flow model.

Correspondent clearing

Under clearing agreements, the Company clears trades for unaffiliated correspondent brokers and retains a portion of commissions as a fee for its services.  The Company records clearing charges net of commissions remitted. Total commissions generated by correspondents were $17,168,000, $28,247,000 and $22,126,000, and commissions remitted totaled $13,537,000, $22,877,000, and $17,471,000 for the years ended September 28, 2001, September 29, 2000 and September 24, 1999, respectively.

Stock compensation

The Company has various incentive stock option and restricted stock plans which provide for the issuance of RJF common stock.  The Company accounts for such stock and stock options under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25") as permitted by FAS 123 "Accounting for Stock-based Compensation."  In accordance with APB 25, compensation expense is not recognized for stock options that have no intrinsic value on the date of the grant.  Compensation expense is recognized immediately for restricted stock units for which future service is not required as a condition to the delivery of the underlying shares of common stock.  For restricted stock units with future service requirements, compensation expense is recognized over the relevant vesting period.

Derivative financial instruments

The Company has only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments. Certain derivative financial instruments are used to manage well-defined interest rate risk at RJBank, others are used to hedge fixed income inventories.  On October 1, 2000, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as subsequently amended by SFAS 137 and SFAS 138, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivatives and hedging activities.  This statement establishes standards for designating a derivative as a hedge.  Derivatives in a broker-dealer or that do not meet the criteria for designation as a hedge are accounted for as trading account assets.

To manage interest rate exposures, RJBank uses interest rate swaps.  Interest rate swaps are agreements to exchange interest rate payment streams based on a notional principal amount.  RJBank specifically designates interest rate swaps as hedges during the initial fixed rate period of adjustable rate loan pools and recognizes interest differentials as adjustments to net interest income in the period they occur.

All derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value.  On the date the derivative contract is entered into, RJBank designates the derivative as a hedge of the variability of cash flows to be paid related to a recognized liability ("cash flow" hedge).  RJBank formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.  This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges to specific liabilities on the balance sheet.  RJBank also formally assesses, both at the hedge's inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged items.  When it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, RJBank dis
continues hedge accounting prospectively.

When hedge accounting is discontinued RJBank continues to carry the derivative at its fair value on the balance sheet, and recognizes any changes in its fair value in earnings.

To the extent of the effectiveness of a hedge, changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income, net of tax. For all hedge relationships, ineffectiveness resulting from differences between the changes in cash flows of the hedged item and changes in fair value of the derivative are recognized in the results of operations as other income or other expense.

The Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge certain fixed income inventory positions.  The hedged positions and the swaps are marked to market with the gain or loss recorded in income for the period. In addition to these hedging transactions the Company is entering into swaps with some of its institutional customers.  The Company's management performs evaluations of its potential interest rate risk, including an exposure analysis on municipal bond inventories, and is of the opinion that the exposure to interest rate risk is not material to its financial position.

Foreign currency translation

The Company consolidates its foreign joint ventures.  The joint ventures' statements of financial condition are translated at the rate as of the period end.  The statements of operations are translated at an average rate for the period.  Any gain or loss on foreign currency transaction is included in comprehensive income.

Income taxes

The Company utilizes the asset and liability approach defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("FAS 109").  FAS 109 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.

Net income per share

Net income per share is computed using weighted average common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding.  Common stock equivalents include shares issuable under stock options and are determined under the treasury stock method.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts from prior years have been reclassified for consistency with current year presentation.  These reclassifications were not material to the consolidated financial statements.

The leases expire in September 2013 and June 2016, respectively.

NOTE 5 - PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT (in thousands):

NOTE 6 - BORROWINGS:

The Company has a mortgage note payable of $37.9 million related to the financing of its home office complex.  The mortgage requires monthly principal and interest payments of approximately $291,000 with a balloon payment of $32,615,000 due on January 1, 2008.  The mortgage bears interest at 7.37% and is secured by land, buildings and improvements with a net book value of $45 million at September 28, 2001.  Principal maturities under this mortgage note payable for the succeeding five years are as follows: fiscal 2002 - $722,000, fiscal 2003 - $777,000, fiscal 2004 - $837,000, fiscal 2005 - $900,000, fiscal 2006 - $969,000 and $33,732,000 thereafter.

The Company has a three year term loan for $50 million and a $125 million committed line of credit through a group of commercial banks.  The term loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 3/4%, while any draws on the line of credit would bear interest at the Company's option, at LIBOR plus 3/4%, or the higher of prime or Fed Funds plus 1/2%. There is a 1/8% loan commitment fee on the $125 million line of credit.  The Company paid $161,000 and $118,000 in commitment fees on the line during fiscal 2001 and 2000, respectively.  In fiscal 1999 the Company paid $26,000 in loan commitment fees on a previous line of credit.  The interest rate on borrowings ranged from 4.33% to 7.55% in 2001 and 6.16% to 7.75% in 2000. The term loan and line of credit require that the Company maintain a certain net worth and requires that the Company follow certain other sound business practices.  At September 28, 2001 and September 29, 2000, there was an outs
tanding balance of $50 million on the term loan. In addition, at September 28, 2001 there was a $10 million balance on the line of credit.

The Company's Raymond James Credit Corp. subsidiary has a $50 million line of credit, under which borrowings are collateralized by client securities, which bears interest at a rate of Fed Funds plus 3/4%.  There were borrowings of $1.26 million and $33 million under this facility at September 28, 2001 and September 29, 2000, respectively.  The interest rate on these borrowings ranged from 3.5% to 8% during fiscal 2001 and 5.94% to 8% in 2000.

Raymond James & Associates, Inc., one of the Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries, also maintains uncommitted lines of credit aggregating $305 million with commercial banks ($165 million secured and $140 million unsecured).  Borrowings under the lines of credit bear interest at Fed Funds rate (which ranged from 1.9% to 6.69% in 2001) plus 1/2%.  There were no unsecured short-term borrowings outstanding at September 28, 2001.  The interest rate on borrowings ranged from 4.0% to 7.19% in 2001 and 5.45% to 7.25% in 2000.  Loans on the secured, uncommitted lines of credit are collateralized by firm or client margin securities.

RJ Ltd., the Company's Canadian broker-dealer subsidiary maintains a CDN $40 million line of credit.  This facility is fully collateralized with securities and bears interest at prime minus 1/2%.  At September 28, 2001 short-term borrowings under this facility were CDN $3.6 million.  Interest rates on these borrowings varied from 3.63% to 6.25%.

RJBank has six $5 million and three $10 million FHLB advances outstanding which bear interest at fixed rates ranging from 4.03% to 5.67% and mature between May 2008 and March 2011. Securities with a carrying value of approximately $82 million are pledged as collateral for these and future borrowings.  The Bank's pre-approved borrowing availability related to FHLB advances is 10% of RJBank's total assets.

NOTE 7 - BANK OPERATIONS AND DEPOSITS:

A summary of client deposit accounts (included in client payables) and weighted average interest rates follows:

The certificates of deposit mature as follows: $44,961,000 in fiscal 2002, $18,235,000 in fiscal 2003, $26,314,000 in fiscal 2004, $16,209,000 in fiscal 2005, and $11,413,000 in fiscal 2006 and thereafter.  Certificates of deposit in amounts of $100,000 or more at September 28, 2001 and September 29, 2000 were $26,999,000 and $25,316,000, respectively.

Interest expense on deposit accounts is comprised of the following for the years ended September 28, 2001 and September 29, 2000:

A summary of RJBank's loans receivable (included in client receivables) is as follows:

Activity in the allowance for loan losses for 2001, 2000 and 1999 consists solely of the provision for loan losses.  There were no actual loan losses in 2001, 2000 or 1999.  The average balance of impaired loans at September 28, 2001 and 2000 along with related interest income recognized on these loans, was immaterial to the financial statements.

Generally, mortgage loans are secured by either first or second mortgages on residential property, consumer loans are secured by securities and time deposit accounts, and commercial loans are generally secured by real property or the general assets of the borrower.  As of September 28, 2001 and September 29, 2000, 99% and 98%, respectively, of RJBank's loan portfolio was secured.

RJBank is subject to various regulatory and capital requirements and was in compliance with all requirements at September 28, 2001 and September 29, 2000.

Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA"), RJBank is subject to rules limiting brokered deposits and related interest rates.  Under these rules, banks that are deemed "well-capitalized" may accept brokered deposits without restriction, and banks deemed "adequately capitalized" may do so with a waiver from the FDIC.  An "undercapitalized" bank is not eligible for a waiver and may not accept brokered deposits.  As of September 28, 2001, the most recent notification from the Office of Thrift Supervision categorized RJBank as "well capitalized" under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.

At September 28, 2001 and September 29, 2000, RJBank exceeded the tangible capital, core capital, core/leverage capital, Tier I/risk-based capital and total risk-based capital levels mandated by the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 and FDICIA.  At September 28, 2001 and September 29, 2000, RJBank's Tier I capital to average assets ratio was 6.8% and 7.2%, respectively.

NOTE 8 - DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:

The Company has fairly limited involvement with derivative financial instruments.  The Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge fixed income inventory positions and segments of the RJBank loan portfolio.  In addition, the Company acts as a dealer/agent in matched book swap transactions.

RJBank uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge against the potential impact of increases in market interest rates during the initial fixed rate period of certain purchased adjustable rate loan pools.  These swaps change the variable-rate cash flow exposure to fixed cash flows.  Under the terms of the interest rate swaps the Bank receives variable interest rate payments and makes fixed interest rate payments, thereby creating the equivalent of fixed-rate funding sources.  At September 28, 2001 and September 29, 2000, RJBank was party to $133,402,271 and $84,430,906 notional amount of interest rate swap agreements, respectively.

Changes in the fair value of RJBank interest rate swaps designated as hedging instruments of the variability of cash flows associated with floating-rate funding sources are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income.  The amounts are subsequently reclassified into risk management expense as a yield adjustment of the hedged fund resources.  Risk management expense for the year ended September 28, 2001, includes $1,206,437 of losses representing cash flow hedge ineffectiveness arising from differences between the critical terms of the interest rate swap and the hedged fund resources.  As of September 28, 2001 $0 of the deferred losses on derivative instruments accumulated in other comprehensive income are expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next 12 months.  The maximum term over which RJBank is hedging exposures to the variability of cash flows for interest rate risk is 60 months.  At September 28, 2001, RJBank had $6,524,000 in cash pledg
ed as collateral for the interest rate swap agreements.

At September 28, 2001, the Company had notional values of $25 million in interest rate swaps hedging its fixed income trading inventory and $43 million in interest rate swaps hedging cash positions.  In addition, the Company had acted as dealer in 3 matched book swap transactions for customers.

The Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to its interest rate swap agreements.  The Company anticipates, however, that the counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the agreements.  The Company may require collateral to support their financial instruments as established by the Fixed Income Credit Officer's credit threshold specific to the ISDA Master documents signed with each counterparty and/or as a result of monitoring the credit standing of the counterparties.

NOTE 9 - FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAXES (in thousands):

The provision (benefit) for income taxes consists of:

The Company's income tax expense differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate due to the following:

The major deferred tax asset (liability) items, as computed under FAS 109, are as follows:

The Company has recorded a deferred tax asset at September 28, 2001 and September 29, 2000, respectively.  No valuation allowance as defined by SFAS 109 is required for the years then ended.  Management believes that a valuation allowance is not necessary because it is more likely than not the deferred tax asset is realizable.

NOTE 10 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:

Long-term lease agreements expire at various times through 2008.  Minimum annual rentals under such agreements for the succeeding five fiscal years are approximately: $23,465,096 in 2002, $19,160,515 in 2003, $14,398,740 in 2004, $11,120,349 in 2005, $8,077,691 in 2006 and $15,437,886 thereafter.  Rental expense incurred under all leases, including equipment under short-term agreements, aggregated $23,981,000, $16,338,000 and  $13,154,000 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

The Company has committed to lend to, or guarantee other debt for, Raymond James Tax Credit Funds, Inc. ("RJ Tax Credit") up to $60 million upon request. Any borrowings bear interest at broker call plus 1% per annum. RJ Tax Credit is charged 1% for amounts guaranteed.  The borrowings are secured by properties under development.  At September 28, 2001, balances of $16,025,000 were loaned to RJ Tax Credit and there were no guarantees outstanding.  At September 29, 2000, balances of $15,636,000 were loaned to RJ Tax Credit and $2,740,000 as guaranteed.  The commitment expired in November 2001 at which time any outstanding balances were due and payable. On November 28, 2001, the Board of Directors renewed the commitment until November 2002.

RJBank has outstanding at any time a significant number of commitments to extend credit.  These arrangements are subject to strict credit control assessments and each customer's credit worthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis.  At September 28, 2001, RJBank had standby letters of credit of $3,097,000, consumer lines of credit of $6,948,000 and commercial lines of credit of $19,417,000 outstanding. In addition, RJBank had commitments to fund loans at fixed and variable rates of $9,864,000 and $67,115,000, respectively, at September 28, 2001.

Securities with carrying values of $82,397,000 and $63,053,000 are pledged as collateral with the Federal Home Loan Bank for advances at September 28, 2001 and September 29, 2000, respectively.

As part of an effort to increase brand awareness, the Company entered into a stadium naming rights contract in July 1998.  The contract has a thirteen-year term with a five-year renewal option and a 4% annual escalator.  Expenses of $2,370,300, $2,295,000 and $2,719,000 were recognized in fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into underwriting commitments.  Transactions relating to such commitments that were open at September 28, 2001 and were subsequently settled had no material effect on the consolidated financial statements as of that date.

The Company utilizes a letter of credit and deposits with clearing organizations to satisfy margin deposit requirements. At September 28, 2001 and September 29, 2000, the Company had client margin securities valued at $59,151,000 and $107,778,000, respectively, on deposit with a clearing organization.

The Company also has guaranteed lines of credit for their various foreign joint ventures as follows: three lines of credit totaling $12.5 million in Turkey, two lines of credit not to exceed $11 million in Argentina and a $325,000 letter of credit in India.  In addition, the Company has guaranteed trades with counterparties in Turkey, Argentina and India.

The Company has committed $28.2 million and $25.6 million to 30 and 28 independent venture capital limited partnerships of which $19 million and $17 million had been paid as of September 28, 2001 and September 29, 2000, respectively.

At September 28, 2001, the approximate market values of collateral received that can be repledged by the Company, were:

During the year limited collateral was repledged.  At September 28, 2001, the approximate market values of this portion of collateral and financial instruments owned that were repledged by the Company, were:

In the normal course of business, certain subsidiaries of the Company, as general partner, are contingently liable for the obligations of various limited partnerships engaged primarily in securities investments and real estate activities. In the opinion of the Company, such liabilities, if any, for the obligations of the partnerships will not in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position.

As a result of the extensive regulation of the securities industry, the Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to regular reviews and inspections by regulatory authorities and self-regulatory organizations, which can result in imposition of sanctions for regulatory violations, ranging from non-monetary censure to fines and, in serious cases, temporary or permanent suspension from business.  In addition, from time to time regulatory agencies and self-regulatory organizations institute investigations into industry practices, which can result in the imposition of such sanctions.

The Company is a defendant or co-defendant in various lawsuits incidental to its securities business.  The Company is contesting the allegations of the complaints in these cases and believes that there are meritorious defenses in each of these lawsuits.  In view of the number and diversity of claims against the Company, the number of jurisdictions in which litigation is pending and the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation and other claims, the Company cannot state with certainty what the eventual outcome of pending litigation or other claims will be.  In the opinion of management, based on discussions with counsel, the outcome of these matters will not result in a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the Company.

NOTE 11 - CAPITAL TRANSACTIONS:

The Company's Board of Directors has, from time to time, adopted resolutions authorizing the Company to repurchase its common stock for general corporate purposes.  At September 28, 2001, pursuant to prior authorizations from the Board of Directors, 1,702,000 shares were available to be repurchased.   During 2001, 67,000 shares were repurchased at an average price of $26.00.

NOTE 12 - EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS:

The Company's profit sharing plan and employee stock ownership plan provide certain death, disability or retirement benefits for all employees who meet certain service requirements.  Such benefits become fully vested after seven years of qualified service.  The Company also offers a plan pursuant to section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, which provides for the Company to match 100% of the first $500 and 50% of the next $500 of compensation deferred by each participant annually.  The Company's Long Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP") is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan that provides benefits to employees who meet certain length of service and compensation requirements.  The Company has purchased and holds life insurance on the lives of those employees participating in the LTIP, to earn a competitive rate of return for participants and to provide a source of funds available to satisfy its obligations under this plan.  Contributions to the 
qualified plans and the LTIP contribution for management are made in amounts approved annually by the Board of Directors.  Compensation expense includes aggregate contributions to these plans of $15,345,000, $24,196,000 and $16,240,000, for fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Stock Compensation Plans

At September 28, 2001, the Company has seven stock-based compensation plans, which are described below. In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("FAS 123"), the Company applies APB 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" and related interpretations in accounting for these plans.

If the Company had elected to recognize compensation expense based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under these plans consistent with the methodology prescribed by FAS 123, the Company's net income and net income per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

These pro forma amounts may not be representative of future disclosures since the estimated fair value of stock options is amortized to expense over the vesting period and additional options may be granted in future years.  For disclosure purposes, the fair value of each fixed option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for stock option grants in fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively: dividend yields of 1.4%, 1.4% and 1.3%; expected volatility of 41.5%, 45.7% and 42.6%, risk-free interest rates of 5.18%, 6.25% and 4.96%, and expected lives of 4.83, 5.16 and 5.61 years.

Fixed Stock Option Plans

The Company has one qualified and three non-qualified fixed stock option plans.  Under the 1992 Incentive Stock Option Plan, the Company may grant options to its management personnel for up to 4,612,500 shares of common stock.  The 1992 Plan was established to replace, on substantially the same terms and conditions, the 1982 Plan.  The Board of Directors has approved and recommended for shareholder approval a 2002 Plan with substantially the same terms and conditions.  Options are granted to key administrative employees and Financial Advisors of Raymond James & Associates, Inc. who achieve certain gross commission levels.  Options are exercisable in the 36th to 72nd months following the date of grant and only in the event that the grantee is an employee of the Company at that time.

Under one of the Company's non-qualified stock option plans, the Company may grant up to 2,278,125 shares of common stock to independent contractor Financial Advisors.  Options are exercisable five years after grant date provided that the Financial Advisors are still associated with the Company. Under the Company's second non-qualified stock option plan, the Company may grant up to 379,688 shares of common stock to the Company's outside directors.  Options vest over a five-year period from grant date provided that the director is still serving on the Board of the Company.  Under the Company's third non-qualified stock option plan, the Company may grant up to 1,125,000 shares of common stock to key management personnel. Option terms are specified in individual agreements and expire on a date no later than the tenth anniversary of the grant date.  Under all plans, the exercise price of each option equals the market price of the Company's stock on the date of
 grant and an option's maximum term is 10 years.

A summary of the status of the Company's four fixed stock option plans as of September 28, 2001, September 29, 2000 and September 24, 1999 and changes during the years ending on those dates is presented below:

The following table summarizes information about fixed stock options outstanding at September 28, 2001:

Restricted Stock Plan

Under the 1999 Restricted Stock Plan the Company is authorized to issue up to 1,000,000 restricted shares of common stock to employees and independent contractors.  Awards under this plan may be granted by various departments of the Company in connection with initial employment or under various retention plans for individuals who are responsible for a contribution to the management growth, and/or profitability of the Company.  These shares are forfeitable in the event of voluntary termination.  The compensation cost is recognized over the vesting period of the shares and is calculated as the market value of the shares on the date of grant. As of September 28, 2001, 406,286 shares had been granted at an average market price of $30.42 with a future service period of 5 years.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Under the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the Company is authorized to issue up to 1,125,000 shares of common stock to its full-time employees, nearly all of whom are eligible to participate.  Under the terms of the Plans, employees can choose each year to have up to 20% of their annual compensation specified to purchase the Company's common stock.  Share purchases in any calendar year are limited to the lesser of 1,000 shares or shares with a market value of $25,000.  The purchase price of the stock is 85% of the market price on the day prior to the purchase date.  Under the Plans, the Company sold 179,442, 209,883 and 301,837 shares to employees in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The compensation cost which would have been recognized for the fair value of the employees' purchase rights was calculated as the value of the 15% discount from market value.

Stock Bonus Plan

The Company's 1999 Stock Bonus Plan authorizes the Company to issue up to 1,000,000 restricted shares to officers and certain other employees in lieu of cash for 10% to 20% of annual bonus amounts in excess of $250,000.  Under the plan the restricted stock is granted at a 20% discount in determining the number of shares to be granted and the shares are generally restricted for a three year period, during which time the shares are forfeitable in the event of voluntary termination.  The compensation cost is recognized over the three year vesting period based on the market value of the shares on the date of grant.  As of September 28, 2001, 129,960 shares had been granted at an average market value of $29.94.

Employee Investment Funds

Certain key employees of the Company participate in the Raymond James Employee Investment Funds I and II,  limited partnerships which invest in the merchant banking activities of the Company and other venture capital limited partnerships.  The Company makes non-recourse loans to these employees for two thirds of the purchase price per unit.  The loans plus interest are intended to be paid back from the earnings of the funds.

NOTE 13 - NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS:

The broker-dealer subsidiaries of the Company are subject to the requirements of the Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Raymond James & Associates, Inc. ("RJA"), a member firm of the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. ("NYSE"), is also subject to the rules of the NYSE, whose requirements are substantially the same.  Rule 15c3-1 requires that aggregate indebtedness, as defined, not exceed fifteen times net capital, as defined. Rule 15c3-1 also provides for an "alternative net capital requirement", which RJA has elected.  It requires that minimum net capital, as defined, be equal to the greater of $250,000 or two percent of Aggregate Debit Items arising from client transactions.  The NYSE may require a member firm to reduce its business if its net capital is less than four percent of Aggregate Debit Items and may prohibit a member firm from expanding its business and declaring cash divi
dends if its net capital is less than five percent of Aggregate Debit Items.  The net capital position of the Company's clearing broker-dealer subsidiary was as follows:

The other US broker-dealer subsidiary was in compliance at September 28, 2001 and September 29, 2000.

The Canadian broker-dealer subsidiary of the Company is subject to the Investment Dealers Association of Canada's capital requirements and was in compliance at September 28, 2001.

NOTE 14 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK:

In the normal course of business, the Company purchases and sells securities as either principal or agent on behalf of its clients.  If either the client or a counterparty fails to perform, the Company may be required to discharge the obligations of the nonperforming party.  In such circumstances, the Company may sustain a loss if the market value of the security or futures contract is different from the contract value of the transaction.

The Company also acts as an intermediary between broker-dealers and other financial institutions whereby the Company borrows securities from one broker-dealer and then lends them to another.  Securities borrowed and securities loaned are carried at the amounts of cash collateral advanced and received in connection with the transactions.  The Company measures the market value of the securities borrowed and loaned against the cash collateral on a daily basis.  The market value of securities borrowed and securities loaned was $1,210,673,000 and $1,219,664,000, respectively, at September 28, 2001 and $2,045,325,000 and $2,015,589,000, respectively, at September 29, 2000.  Additional cash is obtained as necessary to ensure such transactions are adequately collateralized.  If another party to the transaction fails to perform as agreed (for example failure to deliver a security or failure to pay for a security), the Company may incur a loss if the market value of the
 security is different from the contract amount of the transaction.

The Company has also loaned, to brokers and dealers and other financial institutions, securities owned by clients and others for which it has received cash or other collateral.  If a borrowing institution or broker-dealer does not return a security, the Company may be obligated to purchase the security in order to return it to the owner. In such circumstances, the Company may incur a loss equal to the amount by which the market value of the security on the date of nonperformance exceeds the value of the collateral received from the financial institution or the broker or dealer.

The Company has sold securities that it does not currently own, and will therefore, be obligated to purchase such securities at a future date. The Company has recorded $58.4 million and $29.7 million, at September 28, 2001 and September 29, 2000, respectively, which represents the market value of the related securities at such dates.  The Company is subject to loss if the market price of those securities not covered by a hedged position increases subsequent to fiscal yearend. The Company utilizes short government obligations and equity securities to hedge long proprietary inventory positions.  At September 28, 2001, the Company had $33,088,000 in short government obligations and $11,196,000 in short equity securities which represented hedge positions.  At September 29, 2000, the Company had $7,968,000 in short government obligations and $784,000 in short equity securities, which represented hedge positions.

The Company enters into security transactions involving forward settlement. The Company has recorded transactions with a contract value of $254,357,000 and $38,099,000 and a market value of $256,912,000 and $38,783,000 as of September 28, 2001 and September 29, 2000, respectively. Transactions involving future settlement give rise to market risk, which represents the potential loss that can be caused by a change in the market value of a particular financial instrument.  The Company's exposure to market risk is determined by a number of factors, including the size, composition and diversification of positions held, the absolute and relative levels of interest rates, and market volatility.

The majority of the Company's transactions, and consequently, the concentration of its credit exposure is with clients, broker-dealers and other financial institutions in the United States of America.  These activities primarily involve collateralized arrangements and may result in credit exposure in the event that the counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations.  The Company's exposure to credit risk can be directly impacted by volatile securities markets, which may impair the ability of counterparties to satisfy their contractual obligations.  The Company seeks to control its credit risk through a variety of reporting and control procedures, including establishing credit limits based upon a review of the counterparties' financial condition and credit ratings.  The Company monitors collateral levels on a daily basis for compliance with regulatory and internal guidelines and requests changes in collateral levels as appropriate.

NOTE 15 - SEGMENT ANALYSIS:

The Company's reportable segments are retail distribution, institutional distribution, investment banking, asset management and other.  The retail distribution segment includes the retail branches of the Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries located throughout the U.S. These branches provide securities brokerage services including the sale of equities, mutual funds, fixed income products and insurance to their retail clients.

Information concerning operations in these segments of business is as follows:

The Company has operations in the US, Canada, Europe and several joint ventures in foreign countries including India, France, Turkey, and Argentina.

NOTE 16 - RELATED PARTIES:

A director and a former employee of the Company each owned 7.5% of the outstanding shares of common stock of RJ Properties, Inc. ("RJP"), a subsidiary of the Company, until August 1999 when the shares were purchased by RJP for an adjusted book value totaling $517,000 and notes payable of $200,000.  They will receive payments on the notes as RJP collects on certain receivables, which were excluded from the adjusted book value calculation. Such shares were acquired for nominal consideration in connection with the organization of RJP in 1980.

NOTE 17 - ACQUISITION OF RONEY & CO.:

On May 28, 1999, the Company purchased Roney from Bank One Corporation for $71.3 million and the assumption of approximately $10 million in deferred compensation liabilities.  For consolidated financial statement purposes the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly, Roney's results are included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. The aggregate purchase price, which was originally financed through available cash resources and the Company's line of credit (subsequently replaced by a three year term note), has been allocated to the assets of Roney based on their respective fair market values. The excess of the purchase price over assets acquired (goodwill) approximated $35 million and is being amortized over 15 years.

The pro forma unaudited consolidated results of operations as though Roney had been acquired as of the beginning of fiscal 1999 are as follows:

NOTE 18 - ACQUISITION OF GOEPEL McDERMID INC.:

Effective January 1, 2001, the Company purchased 100% of Goepel McDermid Inc., a Canadian broker-dealer, for $78 million plus the establishment of CDN $ 17.5 million in deferred compensation.  The $78 million consisted of $48 million in cash and one million shares exchangeable for RJF common stock.  Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, the exchangeable shares have dividend rights equivalent to those of common shares. Approximately 30% of the exchangeable shares are restricted for a two year period and are included in the liability section of the consolidated statement of financial condition.  The exchangeable shares included in the shareholders' equity section of the consolidated statement of financial condition may be exchanged for RJF common stock on a one-for-one basis at any time.

Effective January 23, 2001 Goepel McDermid Inc. changed its name to Raymond James Ltd.  For consolidated financial statement purposes the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly, Raymond James Ltd.'s results are included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. The aggregate purchase price has been allocated to the assets based on their estimated fair value, with the remainder of the purchase price (approximately $35 million) recorded as goodwill, which is being amortized over 15 years.

The unaudited pro forma results of operations as though Goepel McDermid Inc. had been acquired as of the beginning of fiscal 2000 are as follows:
