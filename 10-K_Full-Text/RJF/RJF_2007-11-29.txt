ITEM
      1.

BUSINESS

Raymond
      James Financial, Inc. (“RJF”), the parent company of a business established in
      1962 and a public company since 1983, is a holding company headquartered in
      Florida whose subsidiaries are engaged in various financial services businesses
      predominantly in the United States of America (“U.S.”) and Canada. Its principal
      subsidiaries include Raymond James & Associates, Inc. (“RJA”), Raymond James
      Financial Services, Inc. (“RJFS”), Raymond James Ltd. ("RJ Ltd."), Eagle Asset
      Management, Inc. (“Eagle”), Heritage Asset Management, Inc. (“Heritage”) and
      Raymond James Bank, FSB (“RJBank”). All of these subsidiaries are wholly owned
      by RJF. RJF and its subsidiaries are hereinafter collectively referred to as
      the
“Company”.

PRINCIPAL
      SUBSIDIARIES

RJF's
      principal subsidiary, RJA, is the largest full service brokerage and investment
      firm headquartered in the state of Florida and one of the larger retail
      brokerage firms in North America. RJA is a self-clearing broker-dealer engaged
      in most aspects of securities distribution, trading, investment banking and
      asset management. RJA also offers financial planning services for individuals
      and provides clearing services for RJFS, other affiliated entities and several
      unaffiliated broker-dealers. In addition, RJA has six institutional sales
      offices in Europe. RJA is a member of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”),
      American Stock Exchange, and most regional exchanges in the U.S. It is also
      a

      Investors Protection Corporation (“SIPC”). FINRA was created in July 2007
      through the consolidation of the National Association of Securities Dealers
      and
      the member regulation, enforcement and arbitration functions of the NYSE.

RJFS
      is
      an independent contractor broker-dealer subsidiary, and one of the largest
      independent contractor brokerage firms in the U.S. Financial Advisors affiliated
      with RJFS may offer their clients all products and services offered by RJA.
      RJFS
      is a member of FINRA and SIPC, but not of any exchange, as it clears all of
      its
      business on a fully disclosed basis through RJA.

      is the Company's Canadian broker-dealer subsidiary which engages in both retail
      and institutional distribution and investment banking. RJ Ltd. is a member
      of
      the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) and the Investment Dealers Association of
      Canada ("IDA"). Its U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary is a member of

Eagle
      is

      Mutual Funds.

RJBank
      provides traditional banking products and services to the clients of the
      Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries and to the general public.

BUSINESS
      SEGMENTS

The
      Company has eight business segments: Private Client Group; Capital Markets;
      Asset Management; RJBank; Emerging Markets; Stock Loan/Borrow; Proprietary
      Capital and certain corporate activities combined in the "Other" segment. In
      the
      quarter ended September 30, 2007, management identified a new segment,
      Proprietary Capital, due to increased business activity. The results of this
      segment were previously included within Asset Management and Other.
      Reclassifications have been made in the segment disclosure for previous years
      to
      conform to this presentation. Financial information concerning RJF for each
      of
      the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007, September 30, 2006 and September
      30,
      2005 is included in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.
      Such information is hereby incorporated by reference.

PRIVATE
      CLIENT GROUP

The
      Company provides securities transaction and financial planning services to
      approximately 1.6 million client accounts through the branch office systems
      of
      RJA, RJFS, RJ Ltd., and Raymond James Investment Services Limited (“RJIS"), an
      independent contractor subsidiary in the United Kingdom. The Company's Financial
      Advisors offer a broad range of investments and services, including both third
      party and proprietary products, and a range of financial planning services.
      The
      Company charges sales commissions or asset-based fees for investment services
      it
      provides to its Private Client Group clients based on established schedules.
      Varying discounts may be given, generally based upon the client's level of
      business, the trade size, service level provided, and other relevant factors.
      In
      fiscal year 2007 asset-based fees represented 34% of the Private Client Group's
      commission and fees.

The
      majority of the Company’s U.S. Financial Advisors are also licensed to sell
      insurance and annuity products through its general insurance agency, Planning
      Corporation of America (“PCA”), a wholly owned subsidiary of RJA. Through the
      Financial Advisors of the Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries, PCA provides
      product and marketing support for a broad range of insurance products,
      principally fixed and variable annuities, life insurance, disability insurance
      and long-term care coverage.

The
      Company's Financial Advisors offer a number of professionally managed load
      mutual funds, as well as a selection of no-load funds. RJA and RJFS maintain
      dealer sales agreements with most major distributors of mutual fund shares
      sold
      through broker-dealers, including funds managed by Heritage. Commissions on
      such
      sales generally range up to 6% of the dollar value of the transaction. The
      majority of mutual fund purchases include a front-end sales charge or occur
      at net asset value (“NAV”) in fee-based accounts. In addition, there is
      typically an annual charge in the form of a fund expense.


Private Client Group Securities Commission and Fees

For
      the Fiscal Years Ended:

Net
      interest revenue in the Private Client Group is generated by customer balances,
      predominantly the earnings on margin loans and assets segregated pursuant to
      regulations less interest paid on customer cash balances. See Item 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
      Operations,” in this report for financial information regarding the Company’s
      net interest revenues.

Clients'
      transactions in securities are effected on either a cash or margin basis. In
      margin transactions, the client pays a portion of the purchase price, and RJA
      makes a loan to the client for the balance, collateralized by the securities
      purchased or by other securities owned by the client. Interest is charged to
      clients on the amount borrowed to finance margin transactions. The financing
      of
      margin purchases is an important source of revenue to RJA, since the interest
      rate paid by the client on funds loaned by RJA exceeds RJA's cost of short-term
      funds. The interest charged to a client on a margin loan is based on current
      interest rates and on the size of the loan balance in the client's
      account.

Typically,
      broker-dealers utilize bank borrowings and equity capital as the primary sources
      of funds to finance clients' margin account borrowings. RJA's primary source
      of
      funds to finance clients' margin account balances has been cash balances in
      brokerage clients' accounts (Client Interest Program), which are funds awaiting
      investment. In addition, pursuant to written agreements with clients,
      broker-dealers are permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
      and FINRA rules to lend client securities in margin accounts to other financial
      institutions. SEC regulations, however, restrict the use of clients' funds
      derived from pledging and lending clients' securities, as well as funds awaiting
      investment, to the financing of margin account balances; to the extent not
      so
      used, such funds are required to be deposited in a special segregated account
      for the benefit of clients. The regulations also require broker-dealers, within
      designated periods of time, to obtain possession or control of, and to
      segregate, clients' fully paid and excess margin securities.

No
      single
      client accounts for a material percentage of this segment's total
      business.

      James & Associates

      in
      RJFS offices ranges from one to 36. Independent contractors are responsible
      for
      all of their direct costs and, accordingly, are paid a larger percentage of
      commissions and fees. They are permitted to conduct other approved businesses
      unrelated to their RJFS activities such as offering insurance products,
      independent registered investment advisory services, and accounting and tax
      services, among others.

      its Financial Institutions Division (“FID”), RJFS offers securities to customers
      of financial institutions such as banks, thrifts and credit unions. FID consists
      of 511 Financial Advisors in 206 branches and 191 satellite offices. RJFS also

      and 81 Financial Advisors.

RJA
      – Operations and Information Technology

RJA's
      operations personnel are responsible for the execution of certain orders,
      processing of securities transactions, custody of client securities, support
      of
      client accounts, receipt, identification and delivery of funds and securities,
      compliance with certain regulatory and legal requirements and general office
      administration for most of the Company's securities brokerage operations. At
      September 30, 2007, RJA employed 716 persons in its operations areas who provide
      services primarily to the Private Client Group, but also support the Company's
      other segments.

The
      Company's businesses are supported by, and are dependent upon, an extensive
      system of electronic data processing. These computer systems are largely
      developed and maintained by the 795 employees in the Company’s information
      technology department.

Since
      the
      Company’s principal operations are located in St. Petersburg, the Company has
      continued to enhance certain aspects of its business continuity plan to deal
      with the possible impact of future hurricanes or other events by expanding
      its
      operational and processing capabilities in Southfield, Michigan. As of September
      30, 2007, 23% and 6% of the employees in RJA’s operational and information
      technology areas, respectively, are located in Southfield. The Company’s
      business continuity plan is designed to permit continued operation of critical
      business functions in the event of disruptions to the St. Petersburg facility;
      all mission critical business departments have developed operational plans
      for
      such disruptions, and the Company has a staff which devotes their full time
      to
      monitoring and facilitating those plans. In that connection, the Company
      maintains computer capacity to support mission critical functions at its
      Southfield location, and conducts some of its daily operational activities
      from
      that site. Systems have been designed so that the Company can transfer all
      mission critical processing activities to Southfield, and personnel have been
      identified who are assigned responsibility for this role, including some
      personnel who will be required to temporarily relocate to Southfield to carry
      out these activities if necessary.

CAPITAL
      MARKETS

Capital
      Markets activities consist primarily of equity and fixed income products and
      services. No single client accounts for a material percentage of this segment's
      total business.

Institutional
      Sales

Institutional
      sales commissions account for a significant portion of this segment's revenue,
      which is fueled by a combination of general market activity and the Capital
      Markets group’s ability to identify attractive investment opportunities and
      promote those opportunities. The Company's institutional clients are serviced
      by
      the RJA and RJ Ltd. Institutional Equity Departments, the RJA Fixed Income
      Department, RJA’s European offices, and Raymond James Financial International
      Ltd, an institutional UK broker-dealer located in London. In providing
      securities brokerage services to its institutional clients, the Company charges
      its commissions on equity transactions based on trade size and the amount of
      business conducted annually with each institution. Fixed income commissions
      are
      based on trade size and the characteristics of the specific security
      involved.

Capital
      Markets Commissions

      Services, Business Services, Healthcare, Real Estate, Energy and Industrial
      Growth. Proprietary industry studies and company-specific research reports
      are

      additional 18 analysts who publish research on approximately 190 companies
      primarily focused in the Energy, Energy Services, Mining, Forest Products,
      Biotechnology, Technology, Consumer and Industrial Products, REIT and Income
      Trust sectors. These analysts, combined with 22 additional analysts located
      in
      Europe and Latin America, represent the Company's global research
      effort.

Equity
      Trading

      equity securities in the over-the-counter ("OTC") and TSX markets involves
      the
      purchase and sale of securities from/to clients of the Company or other dealers.

      as
      well as market trends for the individual securities during the holding period.
      RJA makes markets in approximately 340 common stocks in the OTC market. Similar
      to the equity research department, this operation serves to support both the
      Company's institutional and Private Client Group sales efforts. The RJ Ltd.

      securities, preferred stock and certificates of deposit from/to clients of

      coupon and original term to maturity, although the issuer and/or the specific
      pool of mortgage loans is not known at the time of the transaction). Proprietary
      trading positions are also periodically taken by RJA for various purposes.

Asset
      Management Services

RJA's
      Asset Management Services (“AMS”) Department manages several investment advisory
      programs. The primary advisory services offered are the Raymond James Consulting
      Services program, which offers a variety of both affiliated and non-affiliated
      advisors, and the Eagle High Net Worth program. Both programs maintain an
      approved list of investment managers, provide asset allocation model portfolios,
      establish custodial facilities, monitor performance of client accounts, provide
      clients with accounting and other administrative services, and assist investment
      managers with certain trading management activities. AMS earns fees generally
      ranging from 0.35% to 0.85% of asset balances per annum, a portion of which
      is
      paid to the investment managers who direct the investment of the clients'
      accounts. In addition, AMS also offers the Freedom program, where an investment
      committee within AMS manages portfolios of mutual funds on a discretionary
      basis. At September 30, 2007, these three programs had approximately $17.8
      billion in assets under management, including approximately $2.7 billion managed
      by Heritage, Eagle and Awad.

Additional

      and
      the Managed Investment Programs. For these accounts, AMS provides quarterly
      performance reporting and other accounting and administrative services. Advisory
      services are provided by PCG Financial Advisors. Fees are based on the
      individual account size and are also dependent on the type of securities in
      the
      accounts. Total client fees generally range from 0.50% to 3.0% of assets, which
      are predominantly allocated to the Private Client Group. As of September 30,
      2007, these programs had approximately $23.8 billion in assets.

In
      addition to the foregoing programs, AMS also administers fee-based programs
      for
      clients who have contracted for portfolio management services from nonaffiliated
      investment advisors that are not part of the Raymond James Consulting Services
      program.

RJBank
      is
      a federally chartered savings bank, regulated by the Office of Thrift
      Supervision, which provides residential, consumer and commercial loans, as
      well
      as FDIC-insured deposit accounts, to clients of the Company's broker-dealer
      subsidiaries and to the general public. RJBank also purchases residential whole
      loan packages and is active in bank participations and corporate loan
      syndications. RJBank generates revenue principally through the interest income
      earned on the transactions noted above, offset by the interest expense it incurs
      on client deposits and on its borrowings. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion
      and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in this report
      for financial information regarding RJBank’s net interest revenues.

RJBank
      operates from a single branch location adjacent to the Company’s headquarters
      complex in St. Petersburg, Florida. Access to RJBank's products and services
      is
      available nationwide through the offices of its affiliated broker-dealers as
      well as through telephonic and electronic banking services. As of September
      30,
      2007, RJBank had total assets of $6.1 billion with $4.4 billion in loans. These
      loans are either originated or purchased by RJBank and include commercial and
      residential mortgage loans, as well as consumer loans. As of September 30,
      2007,
      RJBank had total liabilities of $5.7 billion with $5.6 billion in deposits.
      These deposits consist predominately of cash balances swept from the investment
      accounts of RJA and RJFS clients. These balances are held in the FDIC insured
      Raymond James Bank Deposit Program administered by RJA. No single client
      accounts for a material percentage of the segment's total business.

EMERGING
      MARKETS

Raymond
      James International Holdings, Inc. (“RJIH”) currently has interests in joint
      ventures in Latin America and Turkey. These joint ventures operate securities
      brokerage, investment banking and asset management businesses. No single client
      accounts for a material percentage of this segment's total
      business.


STOCK
      LOAN/BORROW

This
      activity involves the borrowing and lending of securities from and to other
      broker-dealers, financial institutions and other counterparties, generally
      as an
      intermediary. The borrower of the securities puts up a cash deposit, commonly
      102% of the market value of the securities, on which interest is earned.
      Accordingly, the lender receives cash and pays interest. These cash deposits
      are
      adjusted daily to reflect changes in current market value. The net revenues
      of
      this operation are the interest spreads generated. No single client accounts
      for
      a material percentage of this segment's total business.

PROPRIETARY
      CAPITAL

This
      segment consists of the Company’s principal capital and private equity
      activities including: various direct and third party private equity and merchant
      banking investments, short-term special situations and bridge investments
      (“Special Situations Investments”), Raymond James Employee Investment Funds I
      and II (the “EIF Funds”), and two private equity funds sponsored by the Company:
      Raymond James Capital Partners, L.P., a merchant banking limited partnership,

      subsidiaries, earns management fees for services provided to the Funds and
      participates in profits or losses through both general and limited partnership
      interests. Additionally, the Company incurs profits or losses as a result of
      direct merchant banking investments and Special Situations Investments. The
      EIF
      Funds are limited partnerships, for which the Company is the general partner,
      that invest in the merchant banking and private equity activities of the Company
      and other unaffiliated venture capital limited partnerships. The EIF Funds
      were
      established as compensation and retention measures for certain qualified key
      employees of the Company.

This
      segment includes various corporate activities of Raymond James Financial,
      Inc.

COMPETITION

The
      Company is engaged in intensely competitive businesses. The Company competes
      with many larger, more well capitalized providers of financial services,
      including other securities firms, most of which are affiliated with major
      financial services companies, insurance companies, banking institutions and
      other organizations. The Company also competes with a number of firms offering
      on-line financial services and discount brokerage services, usually with lower
      levels of service, to individual clients. The Company competes principally
      on
      the basis of the quality of its associates, service, product selection, location
      and reputation in local markets.

In
      the
      financial services industry, there is significant competition for qualified
      associates. The Company's ability to compete effectively in its businesses
      is
      substantially dependent on its continuing ability to attract, retain, and
      motivate qualified associates, including successful Financial Advisors,
      investment bankers, trading professionals, portfolio managers and other
      revenue-producing or specialized personnel.

REGULATION

The
      following discussion sets forth some of the material elements of the regulatory
      framework applicable to the financial services industry and provides some
      specific information relevant to the Company. The regulatory framework is
      intended primarily for the protection of customers and the securities markets,
      depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund and not for the protection
      of
      creditors or shareholders. Under certain circumstances, these rules may limit
      the ability of the Company to make capital withdrawals from its broker-dealer
      subsidiaries.

To
      the
      extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory
      provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular
      statutory and regulatory provisions. A change in applicable statutes,
      regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on the Company’s
      business.

Broker-dealers
      are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business,
      including:

·

sales
      methods

·

trading
      practices

·

uses
      and
      safekeeping of clients' funds and securities

·

The
      financial services industry in the U.S. is subject to extensive regulation
      under
      federal and state laws. The SEC is the federal agency charged with
      administration of the federal securities laws. Financial services firms are
      also
      subject to regulation by state securities commissions in those states in which
      they conduct business. RJA and RJFS are currently registered as broker-dealers
      in all 50 states. In addition, financial services firms are subject to
      regulation by various foreign governments, securities exchanges, central banks
      and regulatory bodies, particularly in those countries where they have
      established offices. The Company has offices in France, the United Kingdom,
      Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Luxemburg, Turkey, British Virgin Islands, Canada
      and Latin America.

Much
      of
      the regulation of broker-dealers in the U.S. and Canada, however, has been
      delegated to self-regulatory organizations ("SROs"), principally FINRA, the
      IDA
      and other securities exchanges. These SROs adopt and amend rules (which are
      subject to approval by government agencies) for regulating the industry and
      conduct periodic examinations of member broker-dealers.

The
      SEC,
      SROs and state securities commissions may conduct administrative proceedings
      that can result in censure, fine, suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer,
      its officers or employees. Such administrative proceedings, whether or not
      resulting in adverse findings, can require substantial expenditures and can
      have
      an adverse impact on the reputation of a broker-dealer.

The
      Company's U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are required by federal law to belong
      to SIPC. When the SIPC fund falls below a certain amount, members are required
      to pay annual assessments of up to 1% of adjusted gross revenues. As a result
      of
      adequate SIPC fund levels, each of the Company's domestic broker-dealer
      subsidiaries was required to pay only the minimum annual assessment of $150
      in
      fiscal 2007. The SIPC fund provides protection for securities held in customer
      accounts up to $500,000 per customer, with a limitation of $100,000 on claims
      for cash balances. In December 2003, RJA joined with other major U.S. securities
      brokerage firms to form Customer Asset Protection Company (“CAPCO”), a licensed
      Vermont insurance company, to provide excess SIPC coverage. CAPCO provides
      account protection for the total net equity of client accounts of participating
      firms with no aggregate limit. CAPCO has received a financial strength rating
      of
      A+ from Standard and Poor’s. These coverages do not protect against market
      fluctuations.

RJ
      Ltd.
      is currently registered in all provinces and territories in Canada. The
      financial services industry in Canada is subject to comprehensive regulation
      under both federal and provincial laws. Securities commissions have been
      established in all provinces and territorial jurisdictions which are charged
      with the administration of securities laws. Investment dealers in Canada are
      also subject to regulation by SROs which are responsible for the enforcement
      of
      and conformity with securities legislation for their members and have been
      granted the powers to prescribe their own rules of conduct and financial
      requirements of members. RJ Ltd. is regulated by the securities commissions
      in
      the jurisdictions of registration as well as by the SROs, the IDA and Market
      Regulation Services Inc.

RJ
      Ltd.
      is required by the IDA to belong to the Canadian Investors Protection Fund
      ("CIPF"), whose primary role is investor protection. The CIPF may charge member
      firms assessments based on revenues and risk premiums. The CIPF provides
      protection for securities and cash held in client accounts up to CDN$1,000,000
      per client with separate coverage of CDN$1,000,000 for certain types of
      accounts. This coverage does not protect against market
      fluctuations.

See
      Note
      19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information
      on
      SEC, FINRA and IDA regulations pertaining to broker-dealer regulatory minimum
      net capital requirements.

The Company's investment advisory operations, including the Company-sponsored
      mutual funds, are also subject to extensive regulation. The Company's U.S.
      asset
      managers are registered as investment advisors with the SEC and are also
      required to make notice filings in certain states. Virtually all aspects of
      the
      asset management business are subject to various federal and state laws and
      regulations. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to benefit the
      asset management clients and generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies
      broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict an
      investment advisor from conducting its asset management business in the event
      that it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions
      that
      may be imposed for a failure include the suspension of individual employees,
      limitations on the asset managers engaging in the asset management business
      for
      specified periods of time, the revocation of registrations, and other censures
      and fines. A regulatory proceeding, regardless of whether it results in a
      sanction, can require substantial expenditures and can have an adverse effect
      on
      the reputation of an asset manager.

RJBank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements established by
      the
      federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can
      initiate certain mandatory - and possibly additional discretionary - actions
      by
      regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on RJBank's
      financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory
      framework for prompt corrective action, RJBank must meet specific capital
      guidelines that involve quantitative measures of RJBank's assets, liabilities,
      and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting
      practices. RJBank's capital amounts and classification are also subject to
      qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings,
      and
      other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital
      adequacy require RJBank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and
      Tier
      I capital to risk-weighted assets (as defined in the regulations). See Note
      of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information
      and capital analysis.

The Company's two state-chartered trust companies are subject to regulation
      by
      the states in which they are chartered. These regulations focus on, among other
      things, the soundness of internal controls in place at the trust
      companies.


As
      a public company whose common stock is listed on the NYSE, the Company is
      subject to corporate governance requirements established by the SEC and NYSE,
      as
      well as federal and state law. Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Company is
      required to meet certain requirements regarding business dealings with members
      of the Board of Directors, the structure of its Audit Committee, and ethical
      standards for its senior financial officers. Under SEC and NYSE rules, the
      Company is required to comply with other standards of corporate governance,
      including having a majority of independent directors serve on its Board of
      Directors, and the establishment of independent audit, compensation and
      corporate governance committees.

Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Company is required to complete
      an assessment of its internal controls over financial reporting and to obtain
      a
      report from its independent auditors regarding their opinion of the Company's
      internal control over financial reporting. This requirement imposes additional
      costs on the Company, reflecting internal staff and management time, as well
      as
      additional audit fees and fees for outside service providers and consultants
      since the Act went into effect.

Factors
      Affecting “Forward-Looking Statements”

From
      time
      to time, the Company may publish “forward-looking statements” within the meaning
      of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of
      the
      Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or make oral statements that
      constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements may
      relate to such matters as anticipated financial performance, future revenues
      or
      earnings, business prospects, projected ventures, new products, anticipated
      market performance, and similar matters. The Private Securities Litigation
      Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements. In
      order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor, the Company cautions readers
      that a variety of factors could cause the Company's actual results to differ
      materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in
      the
      Company's forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties, many of
      which are beyond the Company's control, are discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors”
in this report. The Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update
      or revise any forward-looking statements.

ITEM
      1A.

RISK
      FACTORS

The
      Company’s operations and financial results are subject to various risks and
      uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect
      its
      business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the
      trading price of its common stock.

Economic
      and Political Developments and Their Impact on Securities Markets Could
      Adversely Affect the Company’s Business

The
      Company is engaged in various financial services businesses. As such, the
      Company is directly affected by general economic and political conditions,
      changes in the rate of inflation and the related impact on securities markets,
      fluctuations in interest and currency rates, investor confidence, and changes
      in
      volume and price levels of the securities markets. Severe market fluctuations
      or
      weak economic conditions could reduce the Company’s trading volume and net
      revenues and adversely affect its profitability.

The
      Company Faces Intense Competition

The
      Company is engaged in intensely competitive businesses. See the section entitled
      “Competition” of Item 1 of this report for additional information about the
      Company’s competitors. Competitive pressures experienced by the Company could
      have an adverse affect on its business, results of operations, financial
      condition and liquidity.


Regulatory
      and Legal Developments Could Adversely Affect the Company’s
      Business

The
      securities industry is subject to extensive regulation and broker-dealers are
      subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business. See
      the
      section entitled “Regulation” of Item 1 of this report for additional
      information regarding the Company’s regulatory environment and Item 3, “Legal
      Proceedings”, for a discussion of the Company’s legal matters. The Company could
      be subject to civil liability, criminal liability, or sanctions, including
      revocation of its subsidiaries’ registrations as investment advisors or
      broker-dealers, revocation of the licenses of its Financial Advisors, censures,
      fines, or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business,
      if
      it violates such laws or regulations. Any such liability or sanction could
      have
      a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of
      operations, and business prospects. The Company’s banking operations also expose
      it to a risk of loss resulting from failure to comply with banking laws. In
      addition, the regulatory environment in which the Company operates frequently
      changes and has seen significant increased regulation in recent years. The
      Company may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation
      or
      regulations, changes in federal, state or foreign tax laws, or by changes in
      the
      interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations.

The
      Company’s Business Is Highly Dependent on Technology

The
      Company’s businesses rely extensively on electronic data processing and
      communications systems, and its continued success will depend upon its ability
      to successfully maintain and upgrade the capability of those systems and retain
      skilled information technology employees. Failure of those systems, which could
      result from events beyond the Company’s control, could result in financial
      losses, liability to clients and damage to the Company’s
      reputation.

The
      Company Is Exposed to Market Risk

The
      Company, directly and indirectly, is affected by changes in market conditions.
      Market risk generally represents the risk that values of assets and liabilities
      or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions. For
      example, changes in interest rates could adversely affect the Company’s net
      interest margin – the difference between the yield the Company earns on its
      assets and the interest rate the Company pays for deposits and other sources
      of
      funding – which could in turn affect the Company’s net interest income and
      earnings. Market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with
      the Company’s operations and activities including loans, deposits, securities,
      short-term borrowings, long-term debt, trading account assets and liabilities,
      and derivatives. Market conditions that may shift from time to time, thereby
      exposing the Company to market risk, include fluctuations in interest rates,
      equity prices, and price deterioration or changes in value due to changes in
      market perception or actual credit quality of an issuer.

The
      Company Is Exposed to Credit Risk

The
      credit quality of the Company’s loan and investment portfolios can have a
      significant impact on earnings. Credit risk is the risk of loss from a debtor’s
      inability to meet financial obligations in accordance with agreed upon terms.
      Risks associated with credit quality include adverse changes in the financial
      performance or condition of the Company’s debtors that could affect the debtors’
repayment of outstanding obligations, and that the strength of the U.S. economy
      may be different than expected resulting in deterioration in credit quality
      or a
      reduced demand for credit.

The
      Company Is Exposed to Operational Risk

The
      Company’s diverse operations are exposed to risk of loss resulting from
      inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external
      events. Operational risk exists in every activity, function, or unit of the
      Company, and includes: internal or external fraud, employment and hiring
      practices, an error in meeting a professional obligation, business disruption
      or
      system failures, and failed transaction processing. Also, increasing use of
      automated technology has the potential to amplify risks from manual or system
      processing errors, including outsourced operations. Damage to the Company’s
      reputation could also result from a significant operational loss.

The
      Company’s Operations Could Be Adversely Affected By Serious
      Weather

Conditions

The
      Company’s principal operations are located in St. Petersburg, Florida. During
      2004 and 2005, there was a significant increase in hurricane activity on the
      Gulf Coast which directly affected other parts of Florida. While the Company
      has
      a business continuity plan that permits significant operations to be conducted
      from its Southfield, Michigan location (see Item 1, “Business” in this report),
      the Company’s operations could be adversely affected by hurricanes or other
      serious weather conditions that could affect processing of transactions and
      communications. In addition, as a result of high levels of storm induced damage
      during these years in Florida and along the Gulf Coast, insurance coverage
      for
      wind and flood damage has become harder to obtain and substantially more
      expensive. As a consequence, the Company has been forced to pay more for the
      limited coverage it obtained and self-insure against these risks to a greater
      degree than in the past.

The
      Company’s Business is Dependent on Fees Generated from the Distribution of
      Financial Products and on Fees Earned from the Management of Client Accounts
      By
      Our Asset Management Subsidiaries

A
      large
      portion of the Company’s revenues are derived from fees generated from the
      distribution of financial products such as mutual funds and variable annuities.
      Changes in the structure or amount of the fees paid by the sponsors of these
      products could directly affect the Company’s revenues and
      profits.  Further, changes in market values or in the fee structure of
      asset management accounts could affect the Company’s revenues and
      profits.


Insurance
      Risks

The
      Company’s operations and financial results are subject to risks and
      uncertainties related to its use of a combination of insurance, self-insured
      retention and self-insurance for a number of risks, including, without
      limitation, property and casualty, workers’ compensation, general liability, and
      the Company-funded portion of employee-related health care
      benefits.

Other
      Risks

See
      Item
      7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in this report
      regarding the Company’s exposure to, and approaches to managing, market risk,
      interest rate risk, equity price risk, credit risk, operational risk and
      regulatory and legal risk.

PROPERTIES

The
      Company's headquarters is located on approximately 55 acres within the Carillon
      office park in St. Petersburg, Florida. The headquarters complex currently
      includes four main towers which encompass a total of 884,000 square feet of
      office space, the Raymond James Bank building, which is a 26,000-square-foot
      two-story building, and two five-story parking garages. At this location, the
      Company has the ability to add approximately 490,000 square feet of new office
      space. Raymond James also has 30,000 square feet of leased space near Carillon.
      The Company’s facilities are used to some extent for current operations of all
      segments. The Company relocated its Detroit, Michigan operations to a newly
      renovated 84,000 square foot building on 14 acres in Southfield, Michigan.
      The
      Company owns that real estate and has sold the 45,000 square foot building
      in
      Detroit that previously housed those operations.

The
      Company leases offices in various locations throughout the U.S. and in certain
      foreign countries. With the exception of a Company-owned RJA branch office
      building in Crystal River, FL, RJA branches are leased with various expiration
      dates through 2014. RJ Ltd. leases premises for main offices in Vancouver,
      Calgary, and Toronto and for branch offices throughout Canada. These leases
      have
      various expiration dates through 2013. RJ Ltd. does not own any land or
      buildings. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
      information regarding the Company's leases.

Leases
      for branch offices of RJFS, the independent contractors of RJ Ltd. and RJIS
      are
      the responsibility of the respective independent contractor Financial
      Advisors.

LEGAL
      PROCEEDINGS

Raymond
      James Yatyrym Menkul Kyymetler A. S., (“RJY”), the Company’s Turkish affiliate,
      was assessed for the year 2001 approximately $7.6 million by the Turkish tax
      authorities. The authorities applied a significantly different methodology
      than
      in the prior year’s audit which the Turkish tax court affirmed. RJY is
      vigorously contesting most aspects of this assessment and has filed an appeal
      with the Turkish Counsel of State. A significant portion of the matters at
      issue
      involved the activities of an employee terminated in 2004. Audits of 2002
      through 2004 are anticipated and their outcome is unknown in light of the change
      in methodology and the pending litigation.

As
      such,
      the potential tax liability combined for these subsequent
      years could range from a few hundred thousand dollars to $7.5
      million

. The Company has recorded a provision for loss in its
      consolidated financial statements for its net equity interest in this joint
      venture. As of September 30, 2007, RJY had total capital of approximately $12.2
      million, of which the Company owns approximately 73%.

The
      Company is a defendant or co-defendant in various lawsuits and arbitrations
      incidental to its securities business. The Company is contesting the allegations
      in these cases and believes that there are meritorious defenses in each of
      these
      lawsuits and arbitrations. In view of the number and diversity of claims against
      the Company, the number of jurisdictions in which litigation is pending and
      the
      inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation and other claims,
      the Company cannot state with certainty what the eventual outcome of pending
      litigation or other claims will be. In the opinion of the Company's management,
      based on current available information, review with outside legal counsel,
      and
      consideration of amounts provided for in the accompanying consolidated financial
      statements with respect to these matters, ultimate resolution of these matters
      will not have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position
      or
      results of operations. However, resolution of one or more of these matters
      may
      have a material effect on the results of operations in any future period,
      depending upon the ultimate resolution of those matters and upon the level
      of
      income for such period.

The
      Company expects to continue paying cash dividends. However, the payment and
      rate
      of dividends on the Company's common stock is subject to several factors
      including operating results, financial requirements of the Company, and the
      availability of funds from the Company's subsidiaries, including the

MANAGEMENT'S
      DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
      OPERATIONS

Overview

The
      following Management’s Discussion and Analysis is intended to help the reader
      understand the results of operations and the financial condition of the Company.
      Management’s Discussion and Analysis is provided as a supplement to, and should
      be read in conjunction with, the Company’s consolidated financial statements and
      accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.

The
      Company’s results continue to be highly correlated to the direction of the U.S.
      equity markets and are subject to volatility due to changes in interest rates,
      valuation of financial instruments, economic and political trends and industry
      competition. During 2007, the market was impacted by rising energy prices,
      a
      housing market slowdown, a subprime lending collapse, a growing economy, a
      weakening US dollar and stable interest rates. The Company’s Private Client
      Group’s recruiting and retention of Financial Advisors was positively impacted
      by industry consolidation. RJBank benefited from the widening interest rate
      spreads and the availability of attractive loan purchases as a result of the
      subprime lending crisis.


Results

of Operations - Total Company

The
      Company currently operates through the following eight business segments:
      Private Client Group; Capital Markets; Asset Management; RJBank; Emerging
      Markets; Stock Loan/Borrow; Proprietary Capital and certain corporate activities
      in the Other segment.

The
      following table presents consolidated and segment financial information for
      the
      Company for the years indicated:


Year
      ended September 30, 2007 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2006 -
      Total
      Company

The
      Company had record annual revenues and earnings for the fourth consecutive
      year,
      with 2007 total revenues surpassing $3 billion and net income surpassing $250
      million. Revenues exceeded the prior year by 18% while net income exceeded
      the
      prior year by 17%.  Net revenues were $2.6 billion, or up 11% over the
      prior year, thus positive operating leverage was realized. Non-interest expenses
      also rose by 11%. Once again, results were driven by an increase in net interest
      earnings, which were up 31%. All of the Company’s four major segments had higher
      revenues and three of the four had higher pre-tax income than in the prior
      year.

Year
      ended September 30, 2006 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2005 -
      Total
      Company

The
      Company had record annual revenues and earnings for the third consecutive year,
      with net revenues surpassing $2.3 billion. Non-interest expenses rose by 12%,
      contrasted to a 15% increase in net revenues. Net income exceeded $200 million
      for the first time in the Company's history, up 42% from the prior year. All
      of
      the Company’s four major segments had higher revenues and pre-tax income than in
      the prior year, driven by a 36% increase in net interest earnings (see table
      below) combined with solid increases in investment advisory fees (14%) and
      securities commissions and fees (10%), a modest (6%) increase in investment
      banking revenues and an increase in financial service fees (33%).

Total
      firm net revenues increased 15%, while pre-tax profits after consideration
      of
      minority interest were up 38% over the prior year.

Net
      Interest Analysis

The
      following table presents average balance data and interest income and expense
      data for the Company, as well as the related net interest income:

(1)
      See
      Results of Operations - RJBank in Item 7 of Part II for details.


Net
      interest income at RJBank increased over 100%, representing 81% of the $54
      million increase in the Company’s net interest earnings. Average
      interest-earning assets at RJBank increased 131% over the prior year. Average
      bank loan balances have doubled from $1.6 billion to $3.2
      billion.  This increase was funded by a second bulk transfer of client
      cash deposits of $1.3 billion in March 2007 and growth in new client cash
      balances which are a result of the positive recruiting results.

Average
      customer margin balances grew modestly during 2007, thus the increased client
      cash balances in the firm’s Client Interest Program led to a significant
      increase in assets segregated pursuant to regulations. Net interest on the
      stock
      loan/borrow business declined 24%, due to decreased interest spreads despite
      slightly higher balances. Other interest revenue and expense include earnings
      on
      corporate cash, inventory balances, interest on overnight borrowings and the
      mortgage on the headquarters facility.

Results
      of Operations - Private Client Group

The
      following table presents consolidated financial information for the Private
      Client Group segment for the years indicated:

The
      following table presents a summary of Private Client Group Financial Advisors
      as
      of the periods indicated:


Year
      ended September 30, 2007 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2006 –
Private Client Group

The
      Private Client Group (“PCG”) was significantly impacted by the successful
      recruiting of employee Financial Advisors and increased productivity throughout
      domestic PCG. RJA added a net 59 employee Financial Advisors and increased
      average production per Financial Advisor 22% to $493,000, resulting in a 31%
      increase in RJA PCG securities commissions and fees. Average assets under
      management per RJA Financial Advisor increased 24% to $72 million. RJA continues
      to benefit from the industry consolidation and the resultant unrest and
      Financial Advisor turnover. Securities commissions and fees increased 10% in
      RJFS despite a 6% decline in the number of Financial Advisors, most of which
      was
      by design in the strategic upgrading initiative. The increased commission and
      fee revenue is the result of a 16% increase in average production to $316,000
      per Financial Advisor. RJ Ltd’s 4% increase in number of Financial Advisors
      generated a 6.5% increase in securities commissions and fees.

Financial
      service fees in the prior year included a one-time adjustment of approximately
      $10 million related to the change in accounting for IRA fees. Excluding this
      adjustment, financial service fees increased modestly over the prior year.
      Other
      revenue increased $9 million, or 12% over the prior year, as a result of
      increased mutual fund networking and educational and marketing support fees
      from
      mutual fund companies.

Commission
      expense within PCG was up 14%, relatively proportional to the increase in
      commission revenues and fees of 15%. Administrative compensation, occupancy
      and
      business development expenses increased proportionately to net revenues. These
      increases include expenses associated with new branches, sales support staff,
      home office visits and account transfer fees. Information processing expenses
      rose only 4% and reflect the benefit of operating leverage despite continued
      investment in systems upgrades. The decrease in other expense is the result
      of
      lower legal costs and settlements as the last of the outstanding large cases
      related to the 2000 – 2002 market decline were settled in the prior
      year.

Overall
      PCG margins increased by 16% over the prior year, reaching 12.6%.

Year
      ended September 30, 2006 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2005 –
Private Client Group

The
      Private Client Group's results include a $130 million increase in commission
      and
      fee revenues. While commission and fee revenues increased in the PCG segment
      of
      all three broker-dealers, the increases were far more significant in RJA and
      RJ
      Ltd. where there has been an increase in the number of Financial Advisors due
      to
      successful recruiting. RJA added a net 65 employee Financial Advisors and
      increased the average production from $379,000 in fiscal 2005 to $404,000 in
      fiscal 2006. In addition, average assets under management per RJA Financial
      Advisor has increased to an all time high of $58 million from $50 million at
      September 2005. RJA has successfully focused on recruiting high-producing
      Financial Advisors and continued to benefit from industry consolidation. RJA
      commissions and fees increased 23%. RJ Ltd. added 20 employee Financial Advisors
      and 13 independent contractor Financial Advisors. RJ Ltd. commissions and fees
      increased 27%. The modest 5.7% increase in RJFS commissions and fees is
      primarily attributable to a $65.7 million, or 15.6%, increase in fee based
      business and mutual fund trailing commissions.

PCG
      net
      interest earnings increased 36% over the prior fiscal year, a combined result of
      increased client margin balances (up 9%) and increased customer cash balances,
      on which a spread is earned. Net interest represented 65% of the segment's
      pre-tax earnings, down from 78% in fiscal 2005.

Financial
      service fees in the PCG segment increased $26.6 million, or 40% over the prior
      year. The increase included a one-time adjustment of approximately $10 million
      related to a change from cash to accrual accounting for IRA fees. The increase
      in other revenue of $17.2 million is predominantly made up of increased mutual
      fund networking fees and the newly introduced educational and marketing support
      fee from mutual fund companies.

Commission
      expenses increased 2% more than commission revenue, the result of an increased
      number of independent contractors (who receive higher payouts) in RJ Ltd, the
      advances associated with recruiting at RJA and higher payout levels to more
      productive Financial Advisors. Administrative and incentive compensation
      increased due to the increase in the segment’s profits and an increased number
      of support staff related to the growing number of Financial Advisors in RJA
      and
      increased compliance staff in RJFS. Business development expense increased
      as it
      includes advertising costs and increased travel and other expenses related
      to
      recruiting. Other expenses declined as prior years' expense included
      historically high legal costs and settlements related to the 2000 – 2002 market
      decline.

PCG
      margins increased by more than 3% over the prior year, reaching 10.9%. The
      prior
      year was negatively impacted by the historically high legal costs and
      settlements, and the expense of the early stages of the independent contractor
      business in the UK and at RJ Ltd.


Results
      of Operations – Capital Markets

The
      following table presents consolidated financial information for the Capital
      Markets segment for the years indicated:

Year
      ended September 30, 2007 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2006 –
Capital Markets

The
      Capital Markets segment pre-tax earnings declined 12% despite a 2% increase
      in
      net revenues. Commission revenue was down slightly, the net of a decline in
      equity commissions related to the decline in commissions generated by
      underwriting transactions, and an increase in fixed income commissions, a result
      of the increased volatility. Commissions generated by underwriting transactions
      reached a record $41 million in the prior year and were only $22 million in
      the
      current year.

The
      increase in underwriting fees included increases of $3 million at RJA, despite
      a
      decline in the number of deals from 97 to 78, and $3 million at RJ Ltd. on
      deals versus 29 in the prior year. Merger and acquisition fees were up $15
      million, reaching an all time record level of $60 million for the year. During
      fiscal 2007, RJA closed 15 individual merger and acquisition transactions with
      fees in excess of $1 million. Trading profits were down 58% from the prior
      year,
      reflecting a particularly difficult fixed income trading environment during
      the
      fourth quarter. As credit issues drove fixed income product values down there
      was a flight to quality and the firm’s economic hedges (short positions in US
      Treasuries) contributed additional losses. Meanwhile, there were also increased
      losses in equity customer facilitations and OTC market making. Raymond James
      Tax
      Credit Fund (“RJTCF”) revenues increased 11% as they invested $375 million for
      institutional investors versus $277 million in the prior year. Interest revenue
      increased related to higher average fixed income inventory levels.


Expenses
      were generally in line with revenue growth with two
      exceptions.  Communications and information processing increased
      predominantly due to increased costs associated with market information systems
      and software development costs. Other expense reflects a shift to the use of
      electronic and other non-exchange clearing methods and includes transaction
      related underwriting expenses incurred by RJTCF.

Year
      ended September 30, 2006 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2005 –
Capital Markets

The
      Capital Markets segment’s revenues and pre-tax profits increased just slightly
      from the prior year’s record results. Commission revenues in the segment were
      flat, as a 37% decline in fixed income commissions was offset by the 13%
      increase in institutional equity commissions, the latter continuing to be fueled
      by an active new issue market. RJA equity market conditions remained strong,
      allowing RJA to complete 97 managed or co-managed domestic underwritings, just
      one short of the record 98 underwritings completed in fiscal 2005. RJ Ltd.
      completed a record 29 managed or co-managed underwritings, up nine from fiscal
      2005. Merger and acquisition fees increased modestly from the prior year's
      record level, offsetting the decline in private placement fees. Equity Capital
      Market's most active strategic business units in fiscal 2006 were Energy,
      Technology, Financial Services and Real Estate.

The
      $16
      million increase in interest income, predominantly on RJA's fixed income
      inventories, was offset by an equal increase in interest expense to finance
      these inventories. Higher interest income and expenses were primarily the result
      of higher interest rates.

RJTCF's
      revenues were up 19%, to $31.7 million, as RJTCF invested over $277 million
      for
      institutional investors in 78 real estate transactions compared to $250 million
      in 93 deals in fiscal 2005.

Non-interest
      expense increased 3% over the prior year, with the most significant increase
      in
      other expense. This increase was due to increases within the RJTCF variable
      interest entities (“VIEs”), of which 99% is eliminated through minority
      interest.

      Management

The
      Asset
      Management segment has benefited significantly from the successful recruiting
      in
      PCG. New Financial Advisors bring additional client assets, a portion of which
      is often directed into an asset management alternative. In addition, both Eagle
      and Heritage have been successful in their efforts to increase their presence
      on
      outside broker-dealer platforms. Eagle’s retail sales to outside broker-dealers
      were 33% of their total 2007 sales, while Heritage’s were 78% of their total
      sales. Revenues in this segment increased 13% on a 17% increase in assets under
      management, as there continues to be some fee compression. Expenses increased
      only 10%, generating a 24% increase in pre-tax earnings and a 26% margin as
      a
      result of operating leverage. Money market fund balances declined as a result
      of
      the transfer of $1.3 billion to RJBank in March 2007.

Year
      ended September 30, 2006 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2005 -
      Asset
      Management

Investment
      Advisory fees increased over $20 million, or 14%, on a 16% increase in assets
      under management. Increases in assets under management were positively impacted
      by the recruiting of RJA Financial Advisors. New Financial Advisors brought
      significant assets into the Company's asset management programs, particularly
      Eagle and Raymond James Consulting Services ("RJCS"). New managed assets brought
      in by RJA Financial Advisors totaled $3.9 billion for fiscal 2006, a 70%
      increase over $2.3 billion added in fiscal 2005. Eagle's total retail assets
      increased 19% over the prior year.  Of Eagle's retail asset total, 35%
      were introduced by Financial Advisors outside the Raymond James system. Account
      cancellations exceeded sales in Eagle's institutional accounts due to the loss
      of a few significant accounts and the closing of the Institutional Growth
      division in September. RJCS offers 40 independent investment advisors to the
      Company's clients. Assets managed within the program increased 20% over the
      prior year. The Company's managed mutual fund product (Freedom) continued to
      experience significant growth (105%) as this concept continues to be embraced
      by
      clients and Financial Advisors. Heritage Asset Management's non-money market
      funds increased 19% with 65% of the sales through broker-dealers outside of
      the
      Raymond James family. Heritage money market accounts increased 4% despite the
      movement of just over $1 billion to RJBank sweep option during the
      year.

Expenses
      in this segment increased $19 million (14%) with $8 million of that increase
      in
      compensation. The Compensation increase included increased salary expense,
      costs
      associated with closing Eagle's institutional growth division, and increased
      incentive compensation related to the 21% increase in pre-tax profits. The
      other
      notable increase in expense was a $6.2 million (19%) increase in investment
      advisory fees related to the growth in assets in accounts managed by independent
      investment advisors.


Results
      of Operations - RJBank

The
      following table presents consolidated financial information for RJBank for
      the
      years indicated:

Year
      ended September 30, 2007 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2006 -
      RJBank

The
      Company completed its second bulk transfer of cash balances into the RJBank
      Deposit Program in March 2007, moving another $1.3 billion. This, combined
      with
      organic growth from the influx of new client assets, resulted in a $2.6 billion
      increase in average deposit balances. This  increase in average
      deposit balances provided the funding for the $1.6 billion increase in average
      loan balances. This increase was 38% purchased residential mortgage pools and
      62% corporate loans, 98% of which are purchased interests in corporate loan
      syndications with the remainder originated by RJBank. As a result of this
      growth, RJBank net interest income increased 108% to $84.5 million. Due to
      robust loan growth, the associated allowance for loan losses that are
      established upon recording a new loan and making new unfunded commitments
      required a provision of over $32 million in 2007. Accordingly, RJBank’s pre-tax
      income increased only 69%. During periods of growth when new loans are
      originated or purchased, an allowance for loan losses is established for
      potential losses inherent in those new loans. Accordingly, a robust period
      of
      growth generally results in charges to earnings in that period, while the
      benefits of higher interest earnings are realized in later periods.

Year
      ended September 30, 2006 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2005 -
      RJBank

Assets
      at
      RJBank grew a substantial $1.8 billion during the year. The increase was driven
      by a $1.7 billion increase in deposits, $1.3 billion of which were redirected
      from the Company’s Heritage Cash Trust or customer brokerage accounts,
      representing the introduction of a new sweep program for certain brokerage
      accounts. This alternative offers clients a money market equivalent interest
      rate and FDIC insurance. The Company intends to expand this offering over the
      next several years, transferring an additional $2 to $4 billion. During the
      year, RJBank deployed $1.3 billion of the increased deposits into loans.
      Purchased residential loan pools increased $700 million and corporate loans
      increased $600 million. This growth, combined with increased rates, generated
      an
      increase in net interest income of nearly $18 million. Pre-tax income increased
      only $1.8 million, due to the $13.8 million provision for loan loss associated
      with the increase in loans outstanding.


The
      following table presents average balance data and operating interest income
      and
      expense data for the Company's banking operations, as well as the related
      interest yields and rates and interest spread for the years
      indicated:


(1)

Corporate
                loans purchased are recorded in the loan portfolio as of the earlier
                of
                the settlement date or the delayed settlement compensation commencement
                date. Unsettled floating rate loans recognized in the loan portfolio
                earn
                compensation from the loan’s seller for the delayed settlement at the net
                margin over LIBOR. The funded equivalent yield of Loans, Net of Unearned
                Income above would be 6.58% for 2007 if the unsettled loans had earned
                at
                the full loan rate. Additionally, nonaccrual loans are included in
                the
                average loan balances. Income on such nonaccrual loans is recognized
                on a
                cash basis. Fee income on loans included in interest income for the
                years
                ended September 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively was $8.1 million,
                $3.5
                million, and $0.7 million.

                account.

(3)

The
                decline in interest spreads is due to the growth in the deposit balances
                from two bulk transfers of client deposits of $1.3 billion each to
                RJBank,
                which were then invested over time. This process left significant
                cash
                balances invested at low rates until the cash could be deployed and
                used
                to purchase loans, depressing overall interest
                spreads.

(4)

RJBank
                has gone through a period of rapid loan growth and accordingly established
                allowances for loan losses for potential losses inherent in the loan
                portfolios. These charges to earnings have a negative impact on returns
                during periods of loan growth.


Increases
      and decreases in operating interest income and operating interest expense result
      from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning banking assets
      and
      liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. The following table
      shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on RJBank's
      interest-earning assets and the interest incurred on its interest-bearing
      liabilities. The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the
      change in volume by the previous year's average yield/cost. Similarly, the
      effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average
      yield/cost by the previous year's volume. Changes applicable to both volume
      and
      rate have been allocated proportionately.

Year
      ended September 30, 2007 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2006 –
Emerging Markets

This
      segment consists of the results of the Company’s joint ventures in Argentina,
      Uruguay and Turkey. Securities commissions declined in Turkey, increased in
      Argentina, and the joint venture in India generated $2 million in commissions
      in
      fiscal 2006 whereas none were included in fiscal 2007 due to the Company’s sale
      of its interest in this joint venture early in 2007. Investment banking revenues
      were flat. Trading profits increased $3.5 million in Argentina, stemming from
      a
      large volume of ADR trades. Other income includes the $2.5 million gain on
      the
      sale of the Company’s interest in its joint venture in India.

The
      $2
      million increase in expense is predominantly related to the accrual of estimated
      tax liabilities in Turkey.

Year
      ended September 30, 2006 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2005 –
Emerging Markets

This
      segment consists of the results of the Company’s joint ventures in India,
      Argentina, Uruguay and Turkey. Securities commissions increased $9 million
      or
      31% over the prior year. The vast majority of this increase was in the Company’s
      joint venture in Turkey. Investment banking revenues were $2.7 million,
      primarily from a single large Latin American underwriting fee. Investment
      Advisory fees declined as the Company generated $1 million less in asset
      management fees in India.

The
      $20
      million increase in expense is made up predominantly of a $10 million increase
      in compensation related to increased revenues and increased other expense
      related to the accrual of an estimated tax liability in Turkey.

      predominantly the result of a matched-book however, box loan/borrow balances
      are
      also carried. As the Company’s stock loan business is predominantly a
      matched-book business, stock borrow balances were similar. Average spreads
      decreased from 2.0% in fiscal 2006 to 0.5% in 2007, resulting in a 24% decrease
      in net interest income and a 37% decrease in pre-tax profits.

      vs. $1.1 billion in fiscal 2005. As the Company’s stock loan business is
      predominantly a matched-book business, stock loan balances were similar. Average
      spreads increased from 0.9% in fiscal 2005 to 2.0% in 2006 largely due to rising
      interest rates, resulting in a 37% increase in net interest income and a 34%
      increase in pre-tax profits.

Statement
      of Financial Condition Analysis

The
      Company’s statement of financial condition consists primarily of cash and cash
      equivalents (a large portion of which are segregated for the benefit of
      customers), receivables and payables. The items represented in the statement
      of
      financial condition are primarily liquid in nature, providing the Company with
      flexibility in financing its business. Total assets of $16.3 billion at
      September 30, 2007 were up approximately 41% over September 30, 2006. Most
      of
      this increase is due to the significant increases in reverse repurchase
      agreements, brokerage client cash deposits (leading to a similar increase in
      segregated cash balances on the asset side), and growth of RJBank, with the
      increased loan balances being largely funded by deposits. RJBank loan balances
      increased significantly as the Company continued to increase its use of a newly
      introduced bank sweep offering to brokerage customers. The Company initiated
      the
      first phase of this option in July 2006 and the second phase took place in
      March
      2007. The Company plans to continue to expand use of this offering for the
      next
      several years, which will result in continued growth in RJBank balances. The
      other significant increase in assets was in Available For Sale Securities.
      Trade
      and Other Payables increased $311.9 million from the prior year primarily
      due to RJBank’s purchases of $300.6 million in syndicated loans which were not
      settled as of September 30, 2007. The broker-dealer gross assets and
      liabilities, including trading inventory, stock loan/borrow, receivables and
      payables from/to brokers, dealers and clearing organizations and clients
      fluctuate with the Company's business levels and overall market
      conditions.

Liquidity
      and Capital Resources

Cash
      provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended September 30,
      was approximately $436.6 million, primarily attributable to the increase in
      brokerage client deposits (directly correlated to the increase in segregated
      assets), an increase in payables associated with the Company’s stock
      loan/borrowed business, an increase in payables to broker-dealers and clearing
      organizations, an increase in securities sold under agreements to repurchase,
      and an increase in trading instruments sold but not yet purchased. This was
      partially offset by an increase in segregated assets, and an increase in
      receivables from brokerage clients.

Investing
      activities used $2.9 billion, which is primarily due to activity at RJBank,
      including loans originated and purchased, purchases of securities under
      agreements to resell, and purchases of available for sale
      securities.  This was partially offset by loan repayments at RJBank
      and maturations and repayments of available for sale securities.

Financing
      activities provided $2.7 billion, the result of an increase in deposits at
      RJBank and cash provided from the exercise of stock options and employee stock
      purchases. This was partially offset by the payment of cash dividends and the
      repayments of borrowings.

At
      September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006, the Company had loans payable of
      $122.6 million and $141.6 million, respectively. The balance at September 30,
      2007 is comprised of a $65 million loan for its home-office complex, $55 million
      in Federal Home Loan Bank advances (RJBank), and various short-term borrowings
      totaling $2.6 million (used to fund increased levels of trading
      instruments).


In
      addition, the Company and its subsidiaries have the following lines of credit:
      RJF has a committed $200 million line of credit, RJA has uncommitted bank lines
      of credit aggregating $1.035 billion with commercial banks, Raymond James Credit
      Corporation has a line of credit for $25 million, and RJ Ltd. has a CDN$40
      million uncommitted line of credit (see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated
      Financial Statements for further information on the Company's lines of credit).
      There were no outstanding balances against these lines of credit at September
      30, 2007. The Company’s committed $200 million line of credit is subject to a
      0.125% per annum facility fee. RJBank has $55.0 million in FHLB advances
      outstanding at September 30, 2007, which are comprised of one short-term, fixed
      rate advance and several long-term, fixed rate advances. RJBank had $1.32
      billion in credit available from the FHLB at September 30, 2007. During the
      three months ended June 30, 2007, RJA entered into a $500 million uncommitted
      tri-party repurchase agreement line of credit. Under this agreement, the Company
      pledges certain of its trading inventory as collateral against borrowings on
      this line. The required market value of the collateral is generally 102% of
      the
      cash borrowed. The rate is set each day at 25 basis points over the opening
      Fed
      Funds rate and this agreement can be terminated by any party on any business
      day. Under this agreement, there were secured short-term borrowings of
      $195,000,000 outstanding at September 30, 2007 which are included in Securities
      Sold Under Agreement to Repurchase.

The
      Company’s joint ventures in Turkey and Argentina have multiple settlement lines
      of credit. The Company has guaranteed certain of these settlement lines of
      credit as follows: four in Turkey totaling $22.5 million and one in Argentina
      for $3 million. At September 30, 2007, there were no outstanding balances on
      the
      settlement lines in Argentina or Turkey. At September 30, 2007, the aggregate
      unsecured settlement lines of credit available were $76.5 million, and there
      were outstanding balances of $2.7 million on these lines. The Company has also
      from time to time authorized performance guarantees for the completion of trades
      with counterparties in Argentina and Turkey. At September 30, 2007, there were
      no outstanding performance guarantees in Argentina or Turkey.

As
      of
      September 30, 2007, the Company's liabilities are comprised primarily of
      brokerage client payables of $5.7 billion at the broker-dealer subsidiaries
      and
      deposits of $5.6 billion at RJBank, as well as deposits held on stock loan
      transactions of $1.3 billion. The Company primarily acts as an intermediary
      in
      stock loan/borrow transactions. As a result, the liability associated with
      the
      stock loan transactions is related to the $1.3 billion receivable comprised
      of
      the Company's cash deposits for stock borrowed transactions. To meet its
      obligations to clients, the Company has approximately $4.8 billion in cash
      and
      segregated assets. The Company also has client brokerage receivables of $1.7
      billion and $4.7 billion in loans at RJBank.

The
      Company will continue its implementation of a new cash sweep option available
      to
      its clients from RJBank. This new cash sweep option will require substantial
      capital to be contributed to RJBank to meet regulatory requirements, and
      therefore may require the Company to infuse an additional $150 to $200 million
      over the next several years for this purpose.

As
      of
      September 30, 2007, RJBank had not settled the purchases of $300.6 million
      in
      syndicated loans. These loans are expected to be settled during the three months
      ended December 31, 2007.

The
      Company has committed a total of $46.6 million, in amounts ranging from $200,000
      to $2 million, to 41 different independent venture capital or private equity
      partnerships. As of September 30, 2007, the Company has invested $30.4 million
      of that amount and has received $27 million in distributions. The Company
      expects to increase its net investment in external private equity funds up
      to
      $50 million.

Additionally,
      the Company is the general partner in two internally sponsored private equity
      limited partnerships to which it has committed $14 million. Of that amount,
      the
      Company has invested $12.2 million and has received $8.6 million in
      distributions as of September 30, 2007.

The
      Company’s Board of Directors approved the use of up to $200 million in mezzanine
      financing to facilitate investment banking transactions. As of September 30,
      2007, the Company had not utilized this investment facility. During the first
      quarter of fiscal year 2008, the Company entered into a credit agreement and
      pursuant to this agreement, the Company funded a $37.5 million loan
      participation. The Board of Directors also approved the use of up to $50 million
      for investment in proprietary merchant banking opportunities. As of September
      30, 2007, the Company has invested $13.1 million.

Management
      has been authorized by the Board of Directors to repurchase its common stock
      at
      their discretion for general corporate purposes. There is no formal stock
      repurchase plan at this time. In May 2004 the Board authorized the repurchase
      of
      up to $75 million of shares. As of September 30, 2007 the unused portion of
      this
      authorization was $65.4 million.

The
      Company has committed to lend to or guarantee obligations of its wholly owned
      subsidiary, RJTCF, of up to $100 million upon request, subject to certain
      limitations as well as annual review and renewal. RJTCF borrows in order to
      invest in partnerships which purchase and develop properties qualifying for
      tax
      credits. These investments in project partnerships are then sold to various
      tax
      credit funds, which have third party investors, and for which RJTCF serves
      as
      the managing member or general partner. RJTCF typically sells these investments
      within 90 days of their acquisition, and the proceeds from the sales are used
      to
      repay RJTCF’s borrowings. Additionally, RJTCF may make short-term loans or
      advances to project partnerships on behalf of the tax credit funds in which
      it
      serves as managing member or general partner. At September 30, 2007, cash funded
      to invest in either loans or investments in project partnerships was $38.7
      million. In addition, at September 30, 2007, RJTCF is committed to additional
      future fundings of $6.1 million related to project partnerships that have not
      yet been sold to various tax credit funds.

In
      September 2007, Sirchie Acquisition Company, LLC (“SAC”), a 100% owned indirect
      subsidiary of the Company, entered into two agreements. Under the Stock Purchase
      Agreement SAC will acquire 51% of the common stock of Law Enforcement Associates
      Corporation from two sellers. Under the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement
      with
      several sellers, SAC will acquire substantially all of the business, assets,
      and
      properties of Sirchie Finger Print Laboratories, Inc., the assets or stock
      of
      several other companies and certain real estate. SAC and sellers negotiated
      a
      single purchase price for all of the items to be acquired under the two
      agreements. At closing, one of the sellers will become a member of SAC. The
      Company’s share of the purchase price obligation is approximately $50 million.
      The closing of the two agreements is expected to occur before January 31,
      2008.


The
      Company believes its existing assets, which are highly liquid in nature,
      together with funds generated from operations, should provide adequate funds
      for
      continuing operations.

The
      Company is the lessor in a leveraged commercial aircraft transaction with
      Continental Airlines, Inc. (“Continental”). The Company's ability to realize its
      expected return is dependent upon this airline’s ability to fulfill its lease
      obligation. In the event that this airline defaults on its lease commitment
      and
      the Trustee for the debt holders is unable to re-lease or sell the plane with
      adequate terms, the Company would suffer a loss of some or all of its
      investment. The value of the Company’s leveraged lease with Continental was
      approximately $9.9 million as of September 30, 2007. The Company's equity
      investment represented 20% of the aggregate purchase price; the remaining 80%
      was funded by public debt issued in the form of equipment trust certificates.
      The residual value of the aircraft at the end of the lease term of approximately
      17 years is projected to be 15% of the original cost. This lease expires in
      May
      2014. Although Continental remains current on its lease payments to the Company,
      the inability of Continental to make its lease payments, or the termination
      or
      modification of the lease through a bankruptcy proceeding, could result in
      the
      write-down of the Company's investment and the acceleration of certain income
      tax payments. The Company continues to monitor this lessee for specific events
      or circumstances that would increase the likelihood of a default on
      Continental’s obligations under this lease.

The
      Company was also the lessor in a leveraged commercial aircraft transaction
      with
      Delta Air Lines, Inc. (“Delta”). Delta filed for bankruptcy protection on
      September 14, 2005. Accordingly, the Company recorded a $6.5 million pre-tax
      charge in 2005 to fully reserve the balance of its investment in the leveraged
      lease of an aircraft to Delta. The Company had taken a $4 million pre-tax charge
      in 2004 to partially reserve for this investment. No amount of these charges
      represented a cash expenditure. During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the
      Company sold its interest in the Delta transaction for $2 million, which was
      recognized as a pre-tax gain within Other Revenue. Upon closing, certain income
      tax obligations of approximately $8.5 million were accelerated and paid during
      the quarter. These tax payments did not impact net earnings, as these amounts
      were previously recorded as deferred tax liabilities.

The
      Company’s Turkish affiliate was assessed for the year 2001 approximately $7.6
      million by the Turkish tax authorities. This affiliate is vigorously contesting
      most aspects of this assessment and has filed an appeal with the Turkish Counsel
      of State. A significant portion of the matters at issue involved the activities
      of an employee terminated in 2004. Audits of 2002 through 2004 are
      anticipated and their outcome is unknown in light of the change in methodology
      from the prior year’s audit and the pending litigation.

As
      such,
      the potential tax liability combined for these subsequent years could range
      from
      a few hundred thousand dollars to $7.5 million.

As of September 30,
      2007, this affiliate had total capital of approximately $12.2 million, of which
      the Company owns approximately 73%.

The
      Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to requirements of the SEC
      and
      the IDA relating to liquidity and capital standards. The domestic broker-dealer
      subsidiaries of the Company are subject to the requirements of the Uniform
      Net
      Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. RJA,
      a
      member firm of FINRA, is also subject to the rules of FINRA, whose requirements
      are substantially the same. Rule 15c3-1 requires that aggregate indebtedness,
      as
      defined, not exceed 15 times net capital, as defined. Rule 15c3-1 also provides
      for an “alternative net capital requirement”, which RJA, RJFS, and HFD have
      elected. It requires that minimum net capital, as defined, be equal to the
      greater of $250,000 or two percent of Aggregate Debit Items arising from client
      transactions. FINRA may require a member firm to reduce its business if its
      net
      capital is less than four percent of Aggregate Debit Items and may prohibit
      a
      member firm from expanding its business and declaring cash dividends if its
      net
      capital is less than five percent of Aggregate Debit Items. RJA, RJFS, and
      HFD
      all had net capital in excess of minimum requirements as of September 30,
      2007.

RJ Ltd. is subject to the Minimum Capital Rule (By-Law No. 17 of the IDA) and
      the Early Warning System (By-Law No. 30 of the IDA). The Minimum Capital Rule
      requires that every member shall have and maintain at all times Risk Adjusted
      Capital greater than zero calculated in accordance with Form 1 (Joint Regulatory
      Financial Questionnaire and Report) and with such requirements as the Board
      of
      Directors of the IDA may from time to time prescribe. Insufficient Risk Adjusted
      Capital may result in suspension from membership in the stock exchanges or
      the
      IDA. The Early Warning System is designed to provide advance warning that a
      member firm is encountering financial difficulties. This system imposes certain
      sanctions on members who are designated in Early Warning Level 1 or Level 2
      according to its capital, profitability, liquidity position, frequency of
      designation or at the discretion of the IDA. Restrictions on business activities
      and capital transactions, early filing requirements, and mandated corrective
      measures are sanctions that may be imposed as part of the Early Warning System.
      RJ Ltd. was not in Early Warning Level 1 or Level 2 during fiscal 2007 or
      2006.

RJBank
      is
      subject to various regulatory and capital requirements administered by the
      federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can
      initiate certain mandatory - and possibly additional discretionary - actions
      by
      regulators. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework
      for
      prompt corrective action, RJBank must meet specific capital guidelines that
      involve quantitative measures of RJBank's assets, liabilities, and certain
      off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.
      RJBank's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative
      judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other
      factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital
      adequacy require RJBank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and
      Tier
      I Capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined).
      Management believes, as of September 30, 2007, that the Bank meets all capital
      adequacy requirements to which it is subject.

Critical
      Accounting Policies

The
      Company’s financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance
      with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The following is
      a
      summary of the Company’s critical accounting policies. For a full description of
      these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated
      Financial Statements. The Company believes that of its significant accounting
      policies, those described below involve a high degree of judgment and
      complexity. These critical accounting policies require estimates and assumptions
      that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported
      in the consolidated financial statements. Due to their nature, estimates involve
      judgments based upon available information. Actual results or amounts could
      differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the
      consolidated financial statements. Therefore, understanding these policies
      is
      important in understanding the reported results of operations and the financial
      position of the Company.


Valuation
      of Securities and Other Assets

“Trading
      instruments” and “Available for sale securities” are reflected in the
      Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at fair value or amounts that
      approximate fair value. In accordance with SFAS 115, “Accounting for Certain
      Investments in Debt and Equity Securities”, unrealized gains and losses related
      to these financial instruments are reflected in net income or other
      comprehensive income, depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument.
      The
      following table presents the Company’s trading instruments and available for
      sale securities segregated into trading securities (i.e., non-derivative),
      derivative contracts, and available for sale securities:

Trading
      Securities, Available for Sale Securities and Derivative
      Contracts

When
      available, the Company uses prices from independent sources such as listed
      market prices, or broker or dealer price quotations to derive the fair value
      of
      the instruments. For investments in illiquid, privately held or other securities
      that do not have readily determinable fair values, the Company uses estimated
      fair values as determined by management. Fair values for derivative contracts
      are obtained from pricing models that consider current market and contractual
      prices for the underlying financial instruments, as well as time value and
      yield
      curve or volatility factors underlying the positions. The following table
      presents the carrying value of trading securities, available for sale
      securities, and derivative contracts for which fair value is measured based
      on
      quoted prices or other independent sources versus those for which fair value
      is
      determined by management:

Investment
      in Leveraged Leases

The
      Company is the lessor in a leveraged commercial aircraft transaction with
      Continental. The Company's ability to realize its expected return is dependent
      upon this airline’s ability to fulfill its lease obligation. In the event that
      this airline defaults on its lease commitment and the Trustee for the debt
      holders is unable to re-lease or sell the plane with adequate terms, the Company
      would suffer a loss of some or all of its investment. The value of the Company’s
      leveraged lease with Continental was approximately $9.9 million as of September
      30, 2007. The Company's equity investment represented 20% of the aggregate
      purchase price; the remaining 80% was funded by public debt issued in the form
      of equipment trust certificates. The residual value of the aircraft at the
      end
      of the lease term of approximately 17 years is projected to be 15% of the
      original cost. This lease expires in May 2014.

Although
      Continental remains current on its lease payments to the Company, the inability
      of Continental to make its lease payments, or the termination or modification
      of
      the lease through a bankruptcy proceeding, could result in the write-down of
      the
      Company's investment and the acceleration of certain income tax payments. The
      Company continues to monitor this lessee for specific events or circumstances
      that would increase the likelihood of a default on Continental’s obligations
      under this lease.

The
      Company was also the lessor in a leveraged commercial aircraft transaction
      with
      Delta. Delta filed for bankruptcy protection on September 14, 2005. Accordingly,
      the Company recorded a $6.5 million pre-tax charge in 2005 to fully reserve
      the
      balance of its investment in the leveraged lease of an aircraft to Delta. The
      Company had taken a $4 million pre-tax charge in 2004 to partially reserve
      for
      this investment. No amount of these charges represented a cash expenditure.
      During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company sold its interest in
      the
      Delta transaction for $2 million, which was recognized as a pre-tax gain within
      Other Revenue. Upon closing, certain income tax obligations of approximately
      $8.5 million were accelerated and paid during the quarter. These tax payments
      did not impact net earnings, as these amounts were previously recorded as
      deferred tax liabilities.


Goodwill

Goodwill
      is related to the acquisitions of Roney & Co. (now part of RJA) and Goepel
      McDermid, Inc. (now called Raymond James Ltd.). This goodwill, totaling $63
      million, was allocated to the reporting units within the Private Client Group
      and Capital Markets segments pursuant to SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
      Intangible Assets”. Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business
      acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with
      this pronouncement, indefinite-life intangible assets and goodwill are not
      amortized. Rather, they are subject to impairment testing on an annual basis,
      or
      more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment. This
      test involves assigning tangible assets and liabilities, identified intangible
      assets and goodwill to reporting units and comparing the fair value of each
      reporting unit to its carrying amount. If the fair value is less than the
      carrying amount, a further test is required to measure the amount of the
      impairment.

When
      available, the Company uses recent, comparable transactions to estimate the
      fair
      value of the respective reporting units. The Company calculates an estimated
      fair value based on multiples of revenues, earnings, and book value of
      comparable transactions. However, when such comparable transactions are not
      available or have become outdated, the Company uses discounted cash flow
      scenarios to estimate the fair value of the reporting units. As of September
      30,
      2007, goodwill had been allocated to the Private Client Group of RJA, and both
      the Private Client Group and Capital Markets segments of Raymond James Limited
      (“RJ Ltd.”). As of the most recent impairment test, the Company determined that
      the carrying value of the goodwill for each reporting unit had not been
      impaired. However, changes in current circumstances or business conditions
      could
      result in an impairment of goodwill. As required, the Company will continue
      to
      perform impairment testing on an annual basis or when an event occurs or
      circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value
      of a
      reporting unit below its carrying amount.

Reserves

The
      Company recognizes liabilities for contingencies when there is an exposure
      that,
      when fully analyzed, indicates it is both probable that a liability has been
      incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When a range of
      probable loss can be estimated, the Company accrues the most likely amount;
      if
      not determinable, the Company accrues at least the minimum of the range of
      probable loss.

The
      Company records reserves related to legal proceedings in Trade and Other
      Payables. Such reserves are established and maintained in accordance with
      Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 5, "Accounting for
      Contingencies", and Financial Interpretation No. 14, “Reasonable Estimation of
      the Amount of a Loss”. The determination of these reserve amounts requires
      significant judgment on the part of management. Management considers many
      factors including, but not limited to: the amount of the claim; the amount
      of
      the loss in the client's account; the basis and validity of the claim; the
      possibility of wrongdoing on the part of an employee of the Company; previous
      results in similar cases; and legal precedents and case law. Each legal
      proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the reserve
      is
      adjusted as deemed appropriate by management. Lastly, each case is reviewed
      to
      determine if it is probable that insurance coverage will apply, in which case
      the reserve is reduced accordingly. Any change in the reserve amount is recorded
      in the consolidated financial statements and is recognized as a charge/credit
      to
      earnings in that period.

The
      Company also records reserves or allowances for doubtful accounts related to
      client receivables and loans. Client receivables at the broker-dealers are
      generally collateralized by securities owned by the brokerage clients.
      Therefore, when a receivable is considered to be impaired, the amount of the
      impairment is generally measured based on the fair value of the securities
      acting as collateral, which is measured based on current prices from independent
      sources such as listed market prices or broker-dealer price
      quotations.

Client
      loans at RJBank are generally collateralized by real estate or other property.
      RJBank provides for both an allowance for losses in accordance with SFAS No.
      5 and a reserve for individually impaired loans in accordance with SFAS No.
      114, “Accounting by a Creditor for Impairment of a Loan”. The calculation of the
      SFAS No. 5 allowance is subjective as management segregates the loan portfolio
      into different homogeneous classes and assigns each class an allowance
      percentage based on the perceived risk associated with that class of loans.
      During the fiscal year, RJBank re-evaluated and implemented changes to the
      loan
      loss reserve methodology in conjunction with a revision to the corporate loan
      grading process. The new loan grading process was revised and expanded to
      provide more specific and detailed risk measurement across the corporate loan
      portfolio. The factors taken into consideration when assigning the reserve
      percentage to each reserve category include estimates of borrower default
      probabilities and collateral values; trends in delinquencies; volume and terms;
      changes in geographic distribution, lending policies, local, regional, and
      national economic conditions; concentrations of credit risk and past loss
      history. In addition, the Company provides for potential losses inherent in
      RJBank’s unfunded lending commitments using the criteria above, further adjusted
      for an estimated probability of funding. For individual loans identified as
      impaired, RJBank measures impairment based on the present value of expected
      future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's
      observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is
      collateral dependent. At September 30, 2007, the amortized cost of all RJBank
      loans was $4.7 billion and an allowance for loan losses of $47 million was
      recorded against that balance. The total allowance for loan losses, including
      $6.8 million in reserves for off-balance sheet exposures maintained in Trade
      and
      Other Payables, is equal to 1.15% of the amortized cost of the loan portfolio.


The
      following table allocates RJBank’s allowance for loan losses by loan
      category:

The
      Company also makes loans or pays advances to Financial Advisors, primarily
      for
      recruiting and retention purposes. The Company provides for an allowance for
      doubtful accounts based on an evaluation of the Company’s ability to collect
      such receivables. The Company’s ongoing evaluation includes the review of
      specific accounts of Financial Advisors no longer associated with the Company
      and the Company’s historical collection experience. At September 30, 2007 the
      receivable from Financial Advisors was $115.1 million, which is net of an
      allowance of $3.8 million for estimated uncollectibility.

Income
      Taxes

SFAS
      No.
      109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”, establishes financial accounting and
      reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting
      for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable
      for
      the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax
      consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company’s financial
      statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax
      consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company’s financial
      statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future
      tax
      consequences could materially impact the Company’s financial position, results
      of operations, or cash flows.

Effects
      of recently issued accounting standards, not yet
      adopted

In
      June
      2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Interpretation
      No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”), which clarifies
      the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s
      financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN 48 establishes a
      recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement
      recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken
      in a
      tax return. This interpretation uses a two-step process to determine the amount
      of a tax benefit to record for a tax position if it is more likely than not
      to
      be sustained. The amount of the benefit is then measured to be the highest
      tax
      benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement
      with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.
      This interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification,
      interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and
      transition. The Company will be required to adopt FIN No. 48 as of October
      1,
      2007. The Company does not expect this interpretation to have a material impact
      on its consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending September
      30, 2008.


In
      July
      2006, the FASB issued Staff Position (“FSP”) No. FAS 13-2, “Accounting for a
      Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes
      Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction” (“FSP FAS 13-2”). This FSP addresses
      how a change in the timing of cash flows relating to income taxes generated
      by a
      leveraged lease transaction affects the accounting by a lessor for that lease.
      FSP FAS 13-2 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006
      (October 1, 2007 for the Company). The Company does not expect this FSP to
      have
      a material impact on its consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year
      ending September 30, 2008.

In
      September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,
“Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
      Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements” (“SAB 108”). SAB 108
      addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be
      considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements.
      SAB 108 requires an entity to quantify misstatements using a balance sheet
      and
      income statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach results in
      quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and
      qualitative factors. The guidance is effective for annual financial statements
      covering the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. This guidance
      did
      not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the
      fiscal year ended September 30, 2007.

In
      September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
      No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”). SFAS 157 defines fair
      value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures
      about fair-value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements
      but
      does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried
      at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal
      years beginning after November 15, 2007 (October 1, 2008 for the Company),
      and
      interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect SFAS
      to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the
      Company.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
      Standards No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
      Financial Liabilities” (“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159 allows companies to elect to
      follow fair value accounting for certain financial assets and liabilities on
      an
      instrument by instrument basis. SFAS 159 is applicable only to certain financial
      instruments and is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
      2007 (October 1, 2008 for the Company). The Company has not yet completed its
      assessment of what impact, if any, SFAS 159 will have on its consolidated
      financial statements.

In
      April
      2007, the FASB issued Staff Position FIN No. 39-1, "Amendment of FASB
      Interpretation No. 39." FSP FIN No. 39-1 defines "right of setoff" and specifies
      what conditions must be met for a derivative contract to qualify for this right
      of setoff. FSP FIN No. 39-1 also addresses the applicability of a right of
      setoff to derivative instruments and clarifies the circumstances in which it
      is
      appropriate to offset amounts recognized for those instruments in the statement
      of financial position. In addition, this FSP permits offsetting of fair value
      amounts recognized for multiple derivative instruments executed with the same
      counterparty under a master netting arrangement and fair value amounts
      recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the
      obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) arising from the same master
      netting arrangement as the derivative instruments. This interpretation is
      effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 (October 1, 2008
      for the Company), with early application permitted. The Company is currently
      evaluating the impact the adoption of FSP FIN No. 39-1 will have on its
      consolidated financial statements.

In
      May
      2007, the FASB issued FSP FIN No. 46R-7, "Application of FASB Interpretation
      No.
      46(R) to Investment Companies." FSP FIN No. 46R-7 amends the scope of the
      exception to FIN 46R to state that investments accounted for at fair value
      in
      accordance with the specialized accounting guidance in the American Institute
      of
      Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA") Audit and Accounting Guide, Investment
      Companies, are not subject to consolidation under FIN 46R. This interpretation
      is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2007 (October
      1, 2008 for the Company). The Company is currently evaluating the impact the
      adoption of FSP FIN No. 46R-7 will have on its consolidated financial
      statements.

In
      June
      2007, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the AICPA issued Statement
      of Position ("SOP") 07-1, "Clarification of the Scope of the Audit and
      Accounting Guide Investment Companies and Accounting by Parent Companies and
      Equity Method Investors for Investments in Investment Companies." This SOP
      provides guidance for determining whether an entity is within the scope of
      the
      AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide Investment Companies (the "Guide").
      Additionally, it provides guidance as to whether a parent company or an equity
      method investor can apply the specialized industry accounting principles of
      the
      Guide (referred to as investment company accounting). This SOP is effective
      for
      fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2007 (October 1, 2008 for the
      Company), with early application encouraged. The Company is currently evaluating
      the impact the adoption of SOP 07-1 will have on its consolidated financial
      statements.

Off
      Balance Sheet Arrangements

Information
      concerning the Company's off balance sheet arrangements are included in Note
      of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such information is
      hereby incorporated by reference.


Contractual
      Obligations

The
      Company has contractual obligations to make future payments in connection with
      its short and long-term debt, non-cancelable lease agreements, partnership
      investments, commitments to extend credit, loans purchased but not settled,
      underwriting commitments and a naming rights agreement (see Note 13 of  the
      Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on
      the Company's commitments). The following table sets forth these contractual
      obligations by fiscal year:

(1)

Loans
                which are non-recourse to the Company. See Notes 6 and 10 in the
                Notes to
                the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
                information.

(2)

The
                Company has committed a total of $46.6 million, in amounts ranging
                from
                $200,000 to $2 million, to 41 different independent venture capital
                or
                private equity partnerships. As of September 30, 2007, the Company
                has
                invested $30.4 million of that amount and has received $27 million
                in
                distributions. Additionally, the Company is the general partner in
                two
                internally sponsored private equity limited partnerships to which
                it has
                committed $14 million. Of that amount, the Company has invested $12.2
                million and has received $8.6 million in distributions as of September
                30,
                2007. Although the combined remaining balance of $21.4 million has
                been
                included in fiscal year 2008 above, the contributions to the partnerships
                may occur after that time and are dependent upon the timing of the
                capital
                calls by the general partners.

(3)

Because
                many commitments expire without being funded in whole or part, the
                contract amounts are not estimates of future cash
                flows.

(4)

RJTCF
                is committed to additional future fundings related to real estate
                partnerships.

Effects
      of Inflation

The
      Company's assets are primarily liquid in nature and are not significantly
      affected by inflation. However, the rate of inflation affects the Company's
      expenses, including employee compensation, communications and occupancy, which
      may not be readily recoverable through charges for services provided by the
      Company.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
      DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

RISK
      MANAGEMENT

Risks
      are
      an inherent part of the Company's business and activities. Management of these
      risks is critical to the Company's fiscal soundness and profitability. Risk
      management at the Company is a multi-faceted process that requires
      communication, judgment and knowledge of financial products and markets. The
      Company's senior management takes an active role in the risk management process
      and requires specific administrative and business functions to assist in the
      identification, assessment, monitoring and control of various risks. The
      principal risks involved in the Company's business activities are market,
      credit, operational, and regulatory and legal.

Market
      Risk

Market
      risk is the risk of loss to the Company resulting from changes in interest
      rates
      and equity prices. The Company has exposure to market risk primarily through
      its
      broker-dealer and banking operations. The Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries,
      primarily RJA, trade tax exempt and taxable debt obligations and act as an
      active market maker in approximately 340 over-the-counter equity securities.
      In
      connection with these activities, the Company maintains inventories in order
      to
      ensure availability of securities and to facilitate client transactions.
      Additionally, the Company, primarily within its Canadian broker-dealer
      subsidiary, invests for its own proprietary equity investment
      account.

The
      following table represents the fair value of trading instruments associated
      with the Company's broker-dealer client facilitation, market-making activities
      and proprietary trading activities:


Changes
      in value of the Company's trading inventory may result from fluctuations in
      interest rates, credit ratings of the issuer, equity prices and the correlation
      among these factors. The Company manages its trading inventory by product type
      and has established trading divisions that have responsibility for each product
      type. The Company's primary method of controlling risk in its trading inventory
      is through the establishment and monitoring of limits on the dollar amount
      of
      securities positions that can be entered into and other risk-based limits;
      limits are established both for categories of securities (e.g., OTC equities,
      corporate bonds, municipal bonds) and for individual traders. As of September
      30, 2007, the absolute fixed income and equity inventory limits were
      $1,955,000,000 and $83,600,000, respectively. The Company's trading activities
      were well within these limits at September 30, 2007. Position limits in trading
      inventory accounts are monitored on a daily basis. Consolidated position and
      exposure reports are prepared and distributed to senior management. Limit
      violations are carefully monitored. Management also monitors inventory levels
      and trading results, as well as inventory aging, pricing, concentration and
      securities ratings. For derivatives, primarily interest rate swaps, the Company
      monitors exposure in its derivatives subsidiary daily based on established
      limits with respect to a number of factors, including interest rate, spread,
      ratio, basis, and volatility risk. These exposures are monitored both on a
      total
      portfolio basis and separately for selected maturity periods.

Interest
      Rate Risk

The
      Company is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of maintaining trading
      inventories of fixed income instruments and actively manages this risk using
      hedging techniques that involve swaps, futures, and U.S. Treasury obligations.
      The Company monitors, on a daily basis, the Value-at-Risk (“VaR”) in its
      institutional Fixed Income trading portfolios (cash instruments and interest
      rate derivatives). VaR is an appropriate statistical technique for estimating
      the potential loss in trading portfolios due to typical adverse market movements
      over a specified time horizon with a suitable confidence level.

To
      calculate VaR, the Company uses historical simulation. This approach assumes
      that historical changes in market conditions are representative of future
      changes. The simulation is based upon daily market data for the previous twelve
      months. VaR is reported at a 99% confidence level, based on a one-day time
      horizon. This means that the Company could expect to incur losses greater than
      those predicted by the VaR estimates only once in every 100 trading days, or
      about 2.5 times a year. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007, the
      reported daily loss in the institutional Fixed Income trading portfolio exceeded
      the predicted VaR five times, due in part, to volatile movements in bond prices
      experienced during the fourth fiscal quarter.

However,
      trading losses on a single day could exceed the reported VaR by significant
      amounts in unusually volatile markets and might accumulate over a longer time
      horizon, such as a number of consecutive trading days. Accordingly, management
      employs additional interest rate risk controls including position limits, a
      daily review of trading results, review of the status of aged inventory,
      independent controls on pricing, monitoring of concentration risk, and review
      of
      issuer ratings.

The
      following tables set forth the high, low, and daily average VaR for the
      Company's overall institutional portfolio during the twelve months ended
      September 30, 2007, with the corresponding dollar value of the Company's
      portfolio:

*Portfolio
      value achieved on the day of the VaR calculation.

The
      modeling of the risk characteristics of trading positions involves a number
      of
      assumptions and approximations. While management believes that its assumptions
      and approximations are reasonable, there is no uniform industry methodology
      for
      estimating VaR, and different assumptions or approximations could produce
      materially different VaR estimates. As a result, VaR statistics are more
      reliable when used as indicators of risk levels and trends within a firm than
      as
      a basis for inferring differences in risk-taking across firms.

Additional
      information is discussed under Derivative Financial Instruments in Note 11
      of
      the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

RJBank
      maintains an earning asset portfolio that is comprised of mortgage, corporate
      and consumer loans, as well as mortgage backed securities, securities purchased
      under resale agreements, and other investments. Those earning assets are funded
      in part by its obligations to clients, including NOW accounts, demand deposits,
      money market accounts, savings accounts, and certificates of deposit; and FHLB
      advances. Based on the current earning asset portfolio of RJBank, market risk
      for RJBank is limited primarily to interest rate risk. RJBank analyzes interest
      rate risk based on forecasted net interest income, which is the net amount
      of
      interest received and interest paid, and the net portfolio valuation, both
      in a
      range of interest rate scenarios. The following table represents the carrying
      value of RJBank's assets and liabilities that are subject to market risk. This
      table does not include financial instruments with limited market risk exposure
      due to offsetting asset and liability positions, short holding periods or short
      periods of time until the interest rate resets.


RJBank
      Financial Instruments with Market Risk (as described above):

The
      following table shows the distribution of those RJBank loans that mature in
      more
      than one year between fixed and adjustable interest rate loans at September
      30,
      2007:

One
      of
      the core objectives of RJBank's Asset/Liability Management Committee is to
      manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest
      rates. The Asset/Liability Management Committee uses several measures to monitor
      and limit RJBank's interest rate risk including scenario analysis, interest
      repricing gap analysis and limits, and net portfolio value limits. Simulation
      models and estimation techniques are used to assess the sensitivity of the
      net
      interest income stream to movements in interest rates. Assumptions about
      consumer behavior play an important role in these calculations; this is
      particularly relevant for loans such as mortgages where the client has the
      right, but not the obligation, to repay before the scheduled
      maturity.

The
      sensitivity of net interest income to interest rate conditions is estimated
      for
      a variety of scenarios. Assuming an immediate and lasting shift of 100 basis
      points in the term structure of interest rates, RJBank's sensitivity analysis
      indicates that an upward movement would decrease RJBank's net interest income
      by
      10.25% in the first year after the rate increase, whereas a downward shift
      of
      the same magnitude would increase RJBank's net interest income by 6.91%. These
      sensitivity figures are based on positions as of September 30, 2007, and are
      subject to certain simplifying assumptions, including that management takes
      no
      corrective action.

Equity
      Price Risk

The
      Company is exposed to equity price risk as a consequence of making markets
      in
      equity securities and the investment activities of RJA and RJ Ltd. The U.S.
      broker-dealer activities are primarily client-driven, with the objective of
      meeting clients' needs while earning a trading profit to compensate for the
      risk
      associated with carrying inventory. The Company attempts to reduce the risk
      of
      loss inherent in its inventory of equity securities by monitoring those security
      positions constantly throughout each day and establishing position limits.
      The
      Company's Canadian broker-dealer has a proprietary trading business with 26
      traders. The average aggregate inventory held for proprietary trading during
      the
      year ended September 30, 2007 was CDN$12,257,443. The Company's equity
      securities inventories are priced on a regular basis and there are no material
      unrecorded gains or losses.

Credit
      Risk

The
      Company is engaged in various trading and brokerage activities whose
      counterparties primarily include broker-dealers, banks and other financial
      institutions. The Company is exposed to risk that these counterparties may
      not
      fulfill their obligations. The risk of default depends on the creditworthiness
      of the counterparty and/or the issuer of the instrument. The Company manages
      this risk by imposing and monitoring individual and aggregate position limits
      within each business segment for each counterparty, conducting regular credit
      reviews of financial counterparties, reviewing security and loan concentrations,
      holding and marking to market collateral on certain transactions and conducting
      business through clearing organizations, which guarantee
      performance.


The
      Company's client activities involve the execution, settlement, and financing
      of
      various transactions on behalf of its clients.  Client activities are
      transacted on either a cash or margin basis. Credit exposure associated with
      the
      Company's Private Client Group results primarily from customer margin accounts,
      which are monitored daily and are collateralized. When clients execute a
      purchase the Company is at some risk that the client will renege on the trade.
      If this occurs, the Company may have to liquidate the position at a loss.
      However, most private clients have available funds in the account before the
      trade is executed. The Company monitors exposure to industry sectors and
      individual securities and performs analysis on a regular basis in connection
      with its margin lending activities. The Company adjusts its margin requirements
      if it believes its risk exposure is not appropriate based on market
      conditions.

In
      addition, RJBank offers a variety of loan products including residential
      mortgage, commercial real estate, and consumer loans, which are collateralized,
      and corporate loans for which the borrower is carefully evaluated and monitored.
      RJBank's policy is to require customers to provide such collateral prior to
      the
      disbursement of approved loans. The amount of collateral obtained, if it is
      deemed necessary by RJBank upon extension of credit, is based on management's
      credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies but may include
      accounts receivable, inventory, residential real estate, and income-producing
      commercial properties. When using derivative financial instruments to hedge
      exposures to changes in interest rates, RJBank exposes itself to credit risk
      with those counterparties also. RJBank minimizes the credit or repayment risk
      of
      derivative instruments by entering into transactions only with high-quality
      counterparties whose credit rating is investment grade.

The
      Company is subject to concentration risk if it holds large positions, extends
      large loans to, or has large commitments with a single counterparty, borrower,
      or group of similar counterparties or borrowers (e.g. in the same industry).
      Securities purchased under agreements to resell consist entirely of securities
      issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. Receivables from and payables
      to
      clients and stock borrow and lending activities are conducted with a large
      number of clients and counterparties and potential concentration is carefully
      monitored. Inventory and investment positions taken and commitments made,
      including underwritings, may involve exposure to individual issuers and
      businesses. The Company seeks to limit this risk through careful review of
      the
      underlying business and the use of limits established by senior management,
      taking into consideration factors including the financial strength of the
      counterparty, the size of the position or commitment, the expected duration
      of
      the position or commitment and other positions or commitments
      outstanding.

The
      Company is the lessor in a leveraged commercial aircraft transaction with
      Continental. The Company's ability to realize its expected return is dependent
      upon the airline’s ability to fulfill its lease obligation. In the event that
      the airline defaults on its lease commitments and the Trustee for the debt
      holders is unable to re-lease or sell the plane with adequate terms, the Company
      would suffer a loss of some or all of its investment. Although Continental
      remains current on its lease payments to the Company, the inability of
      Continental to make its lease payments, or the termination or modification
      of
      the lease through a bankruptcy proceeding, could result in the write-down of
      the
      Company's investment and the acceleration of certain income tax payments. The
      Company continues to monitor this lessee for specific events or circumstances
      that would increase the likelihood of a default on Continental’s obligations
      under this lease.

Operational
      Risk

Operational
      risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from the Company's
      operations, including, but not limited to, business disruptions, improper or
      unauthorized execution and processing of transactions, deficiencies in the
      Company's technology or financial operating systems and inadequacies or breaches
      in the Company's control processes. The Company operates different businesses
      in
      diverse markets and is reliant on the ability of its employees and systems
      to
      process a large number of transactions. These risks are less direct than credit
      and market risk, but managing them is critical, particularly in a rapidly
      changing environment with increasing transaction volumes. In the event of a
      breakdown or improper operation of systems or improper action by employees,
      the
      Company could suffer financial loss, regulatory sanctions and damage to its
      reputation. In order to mitigate and control operational risk, the Company
      has
      developed and continues to enhance specific policies and procedures that are
      designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels
      throughout the organization and within such departments as Accounting,
      Operations, Information Technology, Legal, Compliance and Internal Audit. These
      control mechanisms attempt to ensure that operational policies and procedures
      are being followed and that the Company's various businesses are operating
      within established corporate policies and limits. Business continuity plans
      exist for critical systems, and redundancies are built into the systems as
      deemed appropriate.

A
      Compliance and Standards Committee comprised of senior executives meets monthly
      to consider policy issues. The Committee reviews material customer complaints
      and litigation, as well as issues in operating departments, for the purpose
      of
      identifying issues that present risk exposure to customers or to the Company.
      The Committee adopts policies to deal with these issues, which are then
      disseminated throughout the Company.

The
      Company has established a Quality of Markets Committee that meets regularly
      to
      monitor the best execution activities of the trading departments within the
      Company as they relate to customer orders. This Committee is comprised of
      representatives from the OTC Trading, Listed Trading, Options, Municipal
      Trading, Taxable Trading, Compliance and Legal Departments and is under the
      direction of a senior officer of the Company. This Committee reviews reports
      from OTC Trading, Listed Trading, Options, Municipal Trading and Taxable Trading
      departments and recommends action for improvement when necessary.

Regulatory
      and Legal Risk

Legal
      risk includes the risk of Private Client Group customer claims, the possibility
      of sizable adverse legal judgments and non-compliance with applicable legal
      and
      regulatory requirements. The Company is generally subject to extensive
      regulation in the different jurisdictions in which it conducts business.
      Regulatory oversight of the securities industry has become increasingly
      demanding over the past several years and the Company, as well as others in
      the
      industry, has been directly affected by this increased regulatory
      scrutiny.


The
      Company has comprehensive procedures addressing issues such as regulatory
      capital requirements, sales and trading practices, use of and safekeeping of
      customer funds, extension of credit, collection activities, money-laundering
      and
      record keeping. The Company and its subsidiaries have designated Anti-money
      Laundering Compliance Officers who monitor compliance with regulations adopted
      under the U.S.A. Patriot Act. The Company acts as an underwriter or selling
      group member in both equity and fixed income product offerings. Particularly
      when acting as lead or co-lead manager, the Company has financial and legal
      exposure. To manage this exposure, a committee of senior executives review
      proposed underwriting commitments to assess the quality of the offering and
      the
      adequacy of due diligence investigation.

The
      Company's major business units have compliance departments that are responsible
      for regularly reviewing and revising compliance and supervisory procedures
      to
      conform to changes in applicable regulations.

During
      the past year, the number of claims has continued to decline to more historic
      levels. While these claims may not be the result of any wrongdoing, the Company
      does, at a minimum, incur costs associated with investigating and defending
      against such claims. See further discussion on the Company's reserve policy
      under "Critical Accounting Policies"; see also "Legal Proceedings" and
      "Regulation".

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY
      DATA

REPORT
      OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The
      Board
      of Directors and Shareholders

Raymond
      James Financial, Inc.:

We
      have
      audited the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition of
      Raymond James Financial, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2007 and
      2006, and the related Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive
      Income, Changes in Shareholders’ Equity, and Cash Flows for each of the years in
      the three-year period ended September 30, 2007. These consolidated financial
      statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
      responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
      statements based on our audits.

We
      conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
      Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
      plan
      and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
      statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
      on a
      test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
      statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
      and
      significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
      financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
      reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
      our
      opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly,

NOTES
      TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note
      1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

Description
      of Business

Raymond
      James Financial, Inc. (“RJF”) is a holding company headquartered in Florida
      whose subsidiaries are engaged in various financial services businesses,
      including the underwriting, distribution, trading and brokerage of equity and
      debt securities and the sale of mutual funds and other investment products.
      In
      addition, some of these subsidiaries provide investment management services
      for
      retail and institutional clients and banking and trust services. The accounting
      and reporting policies of Raymond James Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries
      (the “Company”) conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the
      United States of America (“U.S.”), the more significant of which are summarized
      below:

Basis
      of Presentation

The
      consolidated financial statements include the accounts of RJF and its
      consolidated subsidiaries that are generally controlled through a majority
      voting interest. All material consolidated subsidiaries are 100% owned by the
      Company. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
      Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 46R, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities”
(“FIN 46R”), the Company also consolidates any variable interest entities
      (“VIEs”) of which it is the primary beneficiary, as defined. Additional
      information is provided in Note 6 below. When the Company does not have a
      controlling interest in an entity, but exerts significant influence over the
      entity, the Company applies the equity method of accounting. All material
      intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
      consolidation.

Effective
      October 1, 2006, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue
      04-5, “Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a
      Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited
      Partners Have Certain Rights,” for partnerships created before and not
      subsequently modified after June 29, 2005. As a result, the Company consolidated
      three partnerships beginning in the three months ended December 31, 2006. As
      of
      September 30, 2007, these partnerships had assets of approximately $77.1
      million.

Management
      Estimates and Assumptions

The
      preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting
      principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates
      and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
      disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
      financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
      the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and
      could
      have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Reporting
      Period

The
      Company’s quarters end on the last day of each calendar quarter.

Recognition
      of Revenues

Securities
      transactions and related commission revenues and expenses are recorded on a
      trade date basis.

Investment
      banking revenues are recorded at the time a transaction is completed and the
      related income is reasonably determinable. Investment banking revenues include
      management fees and underwriting fees, net of reimbursable expenses, earned
      in
      connection with the distribution of the underwritten securities, merger and
      acquisition fees, private placement fees and limited partnership
      distributions.

The
      Company earns investment advisory fees based on the value of clients'
      portfolios. These fees are recorded ratably over the period earned.

Financial
      service fees include per account fees such as IRA fees, transaction fees on
      fee
      based accounts, service fees and distribution fees received from mutual
      funds.

Under
      clearing agreements, the Company clears trades for unaffiliated correspondent
      brokers and retains a portion of commissions as a fee for its services.
      Correspondent clearing revenues are recorded net of commissions remitted and
      included in other revenue. Total commissions generated by correspondents were
      $39,634,000, $29,985,000, and $28,957,000 and commissions remitted totaled
      $34,004,000, $25,049,000, and $24,435,000 for the years ended September 30,
      2007, September 30, 2006, and September 30, 2005, respectively.

Cash
      and Cash Equivalents

Cash
      equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days
      or
      less, other than those used for trading purposes.


Assets
      Segregated Pursuant to Regulations and Other Segregated
      Assets

In
      accordance with Rule 15c3-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Raymond
      James & Associates (“RJA”), as a broker-dealer carrying client accounts, is
      subject to requirements related to maintaining cash or qualified securities
      in a
      segregated reserve account for the exclusive benefit of its clients. In
      addition, Raymond James Limited (“RJ Ltd.”) is required to hold client
      Registered Retirement Savings Plan funds in trust. Segregated assets at
      September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006 consist of cash and cash
      equivalents.

Repurchase
      Agreements and Other Collateralized Financings

The
      Company purchases short-term securities under agreements to resell (“reverse
      repurchase agreements”). Additionally, the Company sells securities under
      agreements to repurchase (“repurchase agreements”). Both reverse repurchase and
      repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financings and are
      carried at contractual amounts plus accrued interest. Other than Raymond James
      Bank’s (“RJBank”) policy described below, it is the Company's policy to obtain
      possession of collateral with a market value equal to or in excess of the
      principal amount loaned under the reverse repurchase agreements. To ensure
      that
      the market value of the underlying collateral remains sufficient, the collateral
      is valued daily, and the Company may require counterparties to deposit
      additional collateral (or may return collateral to counterparties) when
      appropriate. Other collateralized financings include secured call loans
      receivable held by RJ Ltd. These financings represent loans of excess cash
      to
      financial institutions which are fully collateralized by treasury bills and
      bear
      interest at call loan rates.

RJBank’s
      reverse repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized investing
      transactions and are recorded at the amounts at which the securities were
      acquired plus accrued interest. Securities obtained under the resale agreements
      have a market value equal to or exceeding the principal amount of the resale
      agreements. The securities are held by third party custodians and are segregated
      under written agreements that recognize RJBank’s interest in the securities. The
      securities purchased are primarily mortgage backed securities or collateralized
      mortgage obligations (“CMOs”) issued by U.S. agencies. The market value of
      securities purchased is monitored and collateral is obtained from or returned
      to
      the counterparty when appropriate. These reverse repurchase agreements generally
      mature on the next business day. RJBank has the right to sell, transfer or
      pledge the securities purchased under agreements to resell.

Financial
      Instruments

Trading
      instruments are comprised primarily of the financial instruments held by the
      Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries. These instruments are recorded at fair
      value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in current period earnings.
      Fair values are generally based on prices from independent sources, such as
      listed market prices or broker or dealer price quotations. For investments
      in
      illiquid and privately held securities that do not have readily determinable
      fair values through quoted market prices, the determination of fair value is
      based upon consideration of available information, including types of
      securities, current financial information, restrictions on dispositions, market
      values of underlying securities and quotations for similar
      instruments.

Available
      for sale securities are comprised primarily of CMOs and mortgage related debt.
      Debt and equity securities classified as available for sale are reported at
      fair
      value with unrealized gains or losses, net of deferred taxes, reported in
      shareholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
      Fair values of the debt securities are estimated based on bid quotations
      received from securities dealers or, if quoted market prices are not available,
      then the fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar
      securities, pricing models, or discounted cash flow analyses, using observable
      market data where available. All realized gains and losses are determined on
      a
      specific identification basis and are included in current period earnings.
      Additionally, any unrealized losses deemed to be other than temporary are
      included in current period earnings and a new cost basis for the security is
      established. Many factors are considered to determine whether an impairment
      is
      other-than-temporary, including whether the Company has the ability and intent
      to hold the investment until a market price recovery and whether evidence
      indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable outweighs evidence to
      the
      contrary. Evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the
      impairment, the severity and duration of the impairment, changes in value
      subsequent to year-end, and forecasted performance of the security.

Brokerage
      Client Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Brokerage
      client receivables include receivables of the Company's asset management and
      broker-dealer subsidiaries. The receivables from asset management clients are
      primarily for accrued asset management service fees, while the receivables
      from
      broker-dealer clients are principally for amounts due on cash and margin
      transactions and are generally collateralized by securities owned by the
      clients. Both the receivables from the asset management and broker-dealer
      clients are reported at their outstanding principal balance, adjusted for any
      allowance for doubtful accounts. When a broker-dealer receivable is considered
      to be impaired, the amount of the impairment is generally measured based on
      the
      fair value of the securities acting as collateral, which is measured based
      on
      current prices from independent sources such as listed market prices or
      broker-dealer price quotations. Securities owned by customers, including those
      that collateralize margin or other similar transactions, are not reflected
      in
      the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.

The
      Company also makes loans or pays advances to Financial Advisors, primarily
      for
      recruiting and retention purposes. The Company provides for an allowance for
      doubtful accounts based on an evaluation of the Company’s ability to collect
      such receivables. The Company’s ongoing evaluation includes the review of
      specific accounts of Financial Advisors no longer associated with the Company
      and the Company’s historical collection experience. When the review of these
      accounts indicates that further collection activity is highly unlikely, the
      loans are written off and the corresponding allowance for doubtful accounts
      is
      reversed.


Securities
      Borrowed and Securities Loaned

Securities
      borrowed and securities loaned transactions are reported as collateralized
      financings and recorded at the amount of collateral advanced or received.
      Securities borrowed transactions generally require the Company to deposit cash
      with the lender. With respect to securities loaned, the Company generally
      receives collateral in the form of cash in an amount in excess of the market
      value of securities loaned. The Company monitors the market value of securities
      borrowed and loaned on a daily basis, with additional collateral obtained or
      refunded as necessary.

Bank
      Client Loans and Allowances for Losses

Bank
      loans are primarily comprised of loans originated or purchased by RJBank and
      include commercial and residential mortgage loans, as well as non-real estate
      commercial and consumer loans. The Company records these loans at amortized
      cost, adjusted for an allowance for loan loss. Included in amortized cost are
      any deferred fees or loan origination costs plus the unamortized premiums or
      discounts on purchased loans. Syndicated loans purchased are reported as of
      the
      earlier of the settlement date or the delayed settlement compensation
      commencement date.

Loan
      origination fees, net of related costs, are capitalized and recognized in
      interest income using the interest or straight-line method, or proportionate
      to
      the amount of principal payments, over the contractual life of the
      loans.

Residential
      mortgage loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market are
      carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value in the
      aggregate.  Gains and losses on sales of these assets are included as
      a component of other income, while interest collected on these assets is
      included in interest income.  Net unrealized losses are recognized
      through a valuation allowance by charges to income.

Client
      loans at RJBank are generally collateralized by real estate or other property.
      RJBank provides for both an allowance for losses in accordance with Statement
      of
      Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies"
      (“SFAS 5”), and a reserve for individually impaired loans in accordance with
      SFAS No. 114, “Accounting by a Creditor for Impairment of a Loan”. The
      calculation of the SFAS 5 allowance is subjective as management segregates
      the
      loan portfolio into different homogeneous classes and assigns each class an
      allowance percentage based on the perceived risk associated with that class
      of
      loans. The factors taken into consideration when assigning the reserve
      percentage to each reserve category include estimates of borrower default
      probabilities and collateral values; trends in delinquencies; volume and terms;
      changes in geographic distribution, lending policies, local, regional, and
      national economic conditions; concentrations of credit risk and past loss
      history. In addition, the Company provides for potential losses inherent in
      RJBank’s unfunded lending commitments using the criteria above, further adjusted
      for an estimated probability of funding. For individual loans identified as
      impaired, RJBank measures impairment based on the present value of expected
      future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's
      observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is
      collateral dependent. At September 30, 2007, the amortized cost of all RJBank
      loans was $4.7 billion and an allowance for loan losses of $47 million was
      recorded against that balance. RJBank also has $6.8 million in reserves for
      off-balance sheet exposures maintained in Trade and Other Payables. The total
      allowance for losses and reserves for unfunded commitments is equal to 1.15%
      of
      the amortized cost of the loan portfolio.

Once
      RJBank has identified a loan as impaired, the accrual of interest on the loan
      is
      discontinued when either principal or interest becomes 90 days past due or
      when
      the full timely collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain. When
      a
      loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the accrued and unpaid interest receivable
      is written off and accretion of the net deferred loan origination fees ceases.
      The loan is accounted for on the cash or cost recovery method thereafter until
      qualifying for return to accrual status. When the uncollectibility of a loan
      balance is believed to be confirmed, loan losses are charged against the
      allowance and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the
      allowance.

Real
      estate acquired in the settlement of loans, including through, or in lieu of,
      loan foreclosure, is initially recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair
      value less estimated selling costs, establishing a new cost basis. Subsequent
      to
      foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets
      are carried at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, as determined
      by
      a current appraisal, less estimated costs to sell. Costs relating to development
      and improvement of the property are capitalized, whereas those relating to
      holding the property are charged to operations.

Investments
      in Real Estate Partnerships- Held by Variable Interest
      Entities

A
      wholly
      owned subsidiary of the Company is the managing member or general partner in
      several separate tax credit housing funds. Additional information is presented
      in Note 6 below. These funds invest in limited partnerships which purchase
      and
      develop affordable housing properties qualifying for federal and state tax
      credits. As of September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006, the investments
      related to these limited partnerships totaled approximately $221.1 million
      and
      $228.0 million, respectively, on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of
      Financial Condition.

Property
      and Equipment

Property,
      equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost less accumulated
      depreciation and amortization. Depreciation of assets is primarily provided
      for
      using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets,
      which range from two to seven years for software, two to five for furniture
      and
      equipment and 10 to 31 years for buildings and land improvements. Leasehold
      improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter
      of
      the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets.

Additions,
      improvements and expenditures for repairs and maintenance that significantly
      extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. Other expenditures for
      repairs and maintenance are charged to operations in the period incurred. Gains
      and losses on disposals of property and equipment are reflected in income in
      the
      period realized.


Goodwill

Goodwill
      is related to the acquisitions of Roney & Co. (now part of RJA) and Goepel
      McDermid, Inc. (now called Raymond James Ltd.). This goodwill, totaling $63
      million, was allocated to the reporting units within the Private Client Group
      and Capital Markets segments pursuant to SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
      Intangible Assets”. Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business
      acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with
      this pronouncement, indefinite-life intangible assets and goodwill are not
      amortized. Rather, they are subject to impairment testing on an annual basis,
      or
      more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment. This
      test involves assigning tangible assets and liabilities, identified intangible
      assets and goodwill to reporting units and comparing the fair value of each
      reporting unit to its carrying amount. If the fair value is less than the
      carrying amount, a further test is required to measure the amount of the
      impairment.

When
      available, the Company uses recent, comparable transactions to estimate the
      fair
      value of the respective reporting units. The Company calculates an estimated
      fair value based on multiples of revenues, earnings, and book value of
      comparable transactions. However, when such comparable transactions are not
      available or have become outdated, the Company uses discounted cash flow
      scenarios to estimate the fair value of the reporting units. As of September
      30,
      2007, goodwill had been allocated to the Private Client Group of RJA, and both
      the Private Client Group and Capital Markets segments of RJ Ltd. As of the
      most
      recent impairment test, the Company determined that the carrying value of the
      goodwill for each reporting unit had not been impaired. However, changes in
      current circumstances or business conditions could result in an impairment
      of
      goodwill. As required, the Company will continue to perform impairment testing
      on an annual basis or when an event occurs or circumstances change that would
      more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its
      carrying amount.

Legal
      Reserves

The
      Company recognizes liabilities for contingencies when there is an exposure
      that,
      when fully analyzed, indicates it is both probable that a liability has been
      incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When a range of
      probable loss can be estimated, the Company accrues the most likely amount;
      if
      not determinable, the Company accrues at least the minimum of the range of
      probable loss.

The
      Company records reserves related to legal proceedings in Trade and
      Other Payables. Such reserves are established and maintained in accordance
      with SFAS 5 and FIN No. 14, “Reasonable Estimation of the Amount of a Loss”. The
      determination of these reserve amounts requires significant judgment on the
      part
      of management. Management considers many factors including, but not limited
      to:
      the amount of the claim; the amount of the loss in the client's account; the
      basis and validity of the claim; the possibility of wrongdoing on the part
      of an
      employee of the Company; previous results in similar cases; and legal precedents
      and case law. Each legal proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting
      period and the reserve is adjusted as deemed appropriate by management. Lastly,
      each case is reviewed to determine if it is probable that insurance coverage
      will apply, in which case the reserve is reduced accordingly. Any change in
      the
      reserve amount is recorded in the consolidated financial statements and is
      recognized as a charge/credit to earnings in that period.

Stock
      Compensation

Effective
      October 1, 2005, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment”, which
      requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all
      share-based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated
      fair values. Given that the Company had adopted the fair value recognition
      provisions as of September 28, 2002, using the modified prospective method
      of
      adoption within the provisions of SFAS No. 148 “Accounting for Stock-Based
      Compensation – Transition and Disclosure”, the adoption of SFAS No. 123R did not
      have a material impact on the Company’s accounting for employee stock-based
      compensation.

At
      September 30, 2007, the Company had multiple stock-based employee compensation
      plans, which are described more fully in Note 17 below. In addition, the Company
      has two stock option plans for its independent contractor Financial Advisors,
      which are described more fully in Note 18 below. The Company accounts for
      share-based awards to its independent contractor Financial Advisors in
      accordance with EITF No. 96-18, “Accounting for Equity Instruments That are
      Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling,
      Goods or Services” and EITF 00-19, “Accounting for Derivative Financial
      Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock”. As a
      result, these awards are revalued at each reporting date for purposes of
      measuring compensation expense associated with these awards. Compensation
      expense is recognized for all stock-based compensation with future service
      requirements over the relevant vesting periods using the straight-line
      method.

Derivative
      Financial Instruments

The
      Company accounts for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
      in
      accordance with SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
      Activities", as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137, "Accounting for Derivative
      Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB
      Statements No. 133", SFAS No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative
      Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities", and SFAS No. 149, "Amendments
      of
      Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", which
      establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivatives and hedging
      activities. These statements establish standards for designating a derivative
      as
      a hedge. Derivatives in a broker-dealer or those that do not meet the criteria
      for designation as a hedge are accounted for as trading account assets and
      liabilities, and recorded at fair value in the statement of financial condition
      with the realized and unrealized gains or losses recorded in the consolidated
      statement of income for that period.

Under
      FIN
      39, “Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts”, the Company elects to
      net-by-counterparty the fair value of interest rate swap contracts entered
      into
      by the Fixed Income Trading group. Certain contracts contain a legally
      enforceable master netting arrangement and therefore, the fair value of those
      swap contracts are netted by counterparty in the Consolidated Statements of
      Financial Condition.


The
      Company uses interest rate swaps as well as future contracts as part of its
      fixed income business. In addition, the Company enters into interest rate swaps
      which are, in turn, substantially economically hedged with counterparties.
      These
      positions are marked to market with the gain or loss and the related interest
      recorded in Net Trading Profits within the statement of income for the
      period. Any collateral exchanged as part of the swap agreement is recorded
      in
      broker receivables and payables in the Consolidated Statements of Financial
      Condition for the period.

Leases

The
      Company leases office space and equipment under operating leases. The Company
      recognizes rent expense related to these operating leases on a straight-line
      basis over the lease term. The lease term commences on the earlier of the date
      when the Company becomes legally obligated for the rent payments or the date
      on
      which the Company takes possession of the property. For tenant improvement
      allowances and rent holidays, the Company records a deferred rent liability
      in
      other liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and
      amortizes the deferred rent over the lease term as a reduction to rent expense
      in the consolidated statement of income.

Foreign
      Currency Translation

The
      Company consolidates its foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures. The statement
      of financial condition of the subsidiaries and joint ventures are translated
      at
      exchange rates as of the period end. The statements of income are translated
      at
      an average exchange rate for the period. The gains or losses resulting from
      translating foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included
      in shareholders' equity as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive
      Income.

Income
      Taxes

The
      Company utilizes the asset and liability approach defined in SFAS No. 109,
      “Accounting for Income Taxes”, which requires the recognition of deferred tax
      assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary
      differences between the financial statement amounts and the tax bases of assets
      and liabilities.

Earnings
      per Share ("EPS")

Basic
      EPS
      is calculated by dividing earnings available to common stockholders by the
      weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is similar
      to
      basic EPS, but adjusts for the effect of the potential issuance of common shares
      by application of the treasury stock method.

Reclassifications

Certain
      revisions and reclassifications have been made to the consolidated financial
      statements of the prior years to conform to the current year presentation.
      As a
      result, Financial Service Fees revenue and Investment Advisory Fees expense
      increased by approximately $12.8 million and $11.2 million, respectively, for
      the years ended September 30, 2006 and 2005. These revisions did not impact
      the
      Company’s net income for the years ended September 30, 2006 and 2005. The
      Company also reclassified certain amounts from cash to segregated
      assets and reverse repurchase agreements on its 2006 and 2005 Consolidated
      Statements of Financial Condition and related cash flow activity on its 2006
      and
      2005 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For fiscal year 2006, $176.8 million
      was reclassified from cash to segregated assets and $72.5 million was
      reclassified from cash to securities purchased under agreements to resell.
      For
      fiscal year 2005, $146.4 million was reclassified from cash to segregated assets
      and $137.3 million was reclassified from cash to securities purchased under
      agreements to resell. These revisions did not impact the Company’s net income
      for the years ended September 30, 2006 and 2005.

In
      the
      quarter ended September 30, 2007, a new segment was established: Proprietary
      Capital. The components of this segment were previously included in the Asset
      Management and Other segments. Reclassifications have been made in the segment
      disclosure for previous years to conform to this presentation. Additional
      information is provided in Note 22 below.


NOTE
      2 – TRADING INSTRUMENTS AND TRADING INSTRUMENTS SOLD BUT NOT YET
      PURCHASED:

Mortgage
      backed securities of $48.9 million and $77.1 million at September 30, 2007
      and
      September 30, 2006, respectively, are included in Corporate Obligations and
      Agencies in the table above. Mortgage backed securities sold but not yet
      purchased of $60.8 million and $34 million at September 30, 2007 and September
      30, 2006, respectively, are included in Agencies in the table above. Net
      unrealized (losses) gains related to open trading positions at September
      30, 2007, September 30, 2006, and September 30, 2005 were $(726,000),
      $4,387,000, and $(1,257,000), respectively.

NOTE
      3 - AVAILABLE FOR SALE SECURITIES:

Available
      for sale securities are comprised primarily of CMOs, mortgage related debt,
      and
      certain equity securities of the Company's non-broker-dealer subsidiaries,
      principally RJBank. There were proceeds from the sale of available for sale
      securities of $81,000 for the year ended September 30, 2007, $252,000 for the
      year ended September 30, 2006 and $9,250,000 for the year ended September 30,
      2005. The realized gains and losses related to the sale of available for sale
      securities were immaterial to the consolidated financial statements for all
      years presented.

The
      amortized cost and estimated market values of securities available for sale
      at
      September 30, 2007, September 30, 2006 and September 30, 2005 are as
      follows:


The
      following table shows the scheduled maturities, carrying values and current
      yields for RJBank's available for sale securities at September 30, 2007. Since
      RJBank’s available for sale securities are backed by mortgages, actual
      maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have
      the right to call or prepay obligations with or without prepayment
      penalties.


The
      following table shows RJBank’s investments’ gross unrealized losses and fair
      value, aggregated by investment category and length of time the individual
      securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, at September
      30,
      2007:

The
      reference point for determining when securities are in a loss position is fiscal
      year-end. As such, it is possible that a security had a fair value that exceeded
      its amortized cost on other days during the past twelve-month period. The
      unrealized losses at September 30, 2007, were primarily caused by interest
      rate
      changes and market irregularities. The Federal National Mortgage Association
      or
      Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation guarantees the contractual cash flows
      of
      the agency collateralized mortgage obligation securities. As of September 30,
      2007, $359 million of the non-agency collateralized mortgage obligations are
      rated AAA, and $21 million are investment grade rated below AAA. All of the
      non-agency securities carry various amounts of credit enhancement, and none
      are
      collateralized with subprime loans. It is expected that the securities would
      not
      be settled at a price less than the amortized cost of the investment. Because
      the decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and
      market irregularities and not credit quality, and because the Company has the
      ability and intent to hold these investments until a fair value recovery or
      maturity, these investments are not considered "other-than-temporarily"
      impaired.

NOTE
      4 - RECEIVABLES FROM AND PAYABLES TO BROKERAGE
      CLIENTS:

Receivables
      from Brokerage Clients

Receivables
      from brokerage clients include amounts arising from normal cash and margin
      transactions and fees receivable. Margin receivables are collateralized by
      securities owned by brokerage clients. Such collateral is not reflected in
      the
      accompanying consolidated financial statements. The amount receivable from
      clients at September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006 is as follows:


Payables
      to Brokerage Clients

Payables
      to brokerage clients include brokerage client funds on deposits awaiting
      reinvestment. The following table presents a summary of such payables at
      September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006:

Interest
      expense on brokerage client payables for the years ended September 30, 2007,
      September 30, 2006, and September 30, 2005 was $204,158,000, $143,428,000,
      and
      $58,486,000, respectively.

NOTE
      5 – BANK LOANS, NET:

Bank
      client receivables are primarily comprised of loans originated or purchased
      by
      RJBank and include commercial and residential real estate loans, as well as
      commercial and consumer loans. These receivables are collateralized by first
      or
      second mortgages on residential or other real property, by other assets of
      the
      borrower, or are unsecured. The following table presents the balance and
      associated percentage of each major loan category in RJBank's portfolio,
      including loans receivable and loans available for sale:

(1)
      Includes purchase premiums, purchase discounts, and net deferred origination
      fees and costs.


At
      September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006, $55,000,000 and $60,000,000 in
      Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances, respectively, were secured by a
      blanket lien on RJBank's residential mortgage loan portfolio.

At
      September 30, 2007 and 2006, RJBank had $5,064,000 and $1,137,000 in loans
      available for sale, respectively.  RJBank's gain from the sale of
      originated loans available for sale was $518,000, $413,000, and $421,000 for
      the
      years ended September 30, 2007, September 30, 2006, and September 30, 2005,
      respectively.

Certain
      officers, directors, and affiliates, and their related interests were indebted
      to RJBank for $999,000 and $294,000 at September 30, 2007 and September 30,
      2006, respectively.  All such loans were made in the ordinary course
      of the business.

Interest
      income on loans, net of unearned income, for the years ended September 30,
      2007,
      2006, and 2005 was $205.0 million, $95.4 million, and $37.2 million,
      respectively.

The
      following table shows the contractual maturities of RJBank’s loan portfolio at
      September 30, 2007, including contractual principal repayments. This table
      does
      not, however, include any estimates of prepayments. These prepayments could
      significantly shorten the average loan lives and cause the actual timing of
      the
      loan repayments to differ from those shown in the following table:

RJBank
      classifies loans as nonperforming when full and timely collection of interest
      or
      principal becomes uncertain or when they are 90 days past due. The following
      table shows the comparative data for nonperforming loans and
      assets:

The
      gross
      interest income related to non-performing loans, which would have been recorded
      had these loans been current in accordance with their original terms and had
      been outstanding throughout the period or since origination, and the interest
      income recognized on these loans for the year ended, September 30, 2007 were
      immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.  As of September
      30, 2007, there were no impaired loans.  There were no troubled debt
      restructurings for any of the periods presented above.


Changes
      in the allowance for loan losses at RJBank were as follows:

The
      calculation of the allowance is subjective as management segregates the loan
      portfolio into different homogeneous classes and assigns each class an allowance
      percentage based on the perceived risk associated with that class of loans.
      The
      factors taken into consideration when assigning the reserve percentage to each
      reserve category include estimates of borrower default probabilities and
      collateral values; trends in delinquencies; volume and terms; changes in
      geographic distribution, lending policies, local, regional, and national
      economic conditions; concentrations of credit risk and past loss history. In
      addition, the Company provides for potential losses inherent in RJBank’s
      unfunded lending commitments using the criteria above, further adjusted for
      an
      estimated probability of funding.

In
      addition to the allowance for loan losses shown net of Bank Loans, Net, RJBank
      had reserves for unfunded lending commitments included in Trade and Other
      Payables of $6.78 million and $4.05 million for the years ended September 30,
      2007 and 2006.

RJBank’s
      net interest income after provision for loan losses for the years ended
      September 30, 2007, 2006, and 2005 was $52.4 million, $26.8 million, and $21.6
      million, respectively.

RJBank
      originates and purchases portfolios of loans that have certain features that
      may
      be viewed as increasing its exposure to nonpayment risk by the borrower.
      Specifically, RJBank originates and purchases residential loans that subject
      the
      borrower to payment increases over the life of the loan or have high
      loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios. These features, including interest-only features
      and high LTV ratios, may be considered non-traditional for residential
      mortgages. RJBank does not originate or purchase residential loans that have
      terms that permit negative amortization features or are option adjustable rate
      mortgages.


The
      table
      below summarizes the level of exposure from each type of loan at September
      30,
      2007, 2006, and 2005:

Loans
      where borrowers may be subject to payment increases include adjustable rate
      mortgage loans with terms that initially require payment of interest only,
      that
      may result in payments increasing significantly when the interest-only period
      ends and the loan principal begins to amortize. These loans are underwritten
      based on a variety of factors including the borrower’s credit history, debt to
      income ratio, employment, the LTV ratio, and the borrower’s disposable income
      and cash reserves. In instances where the borrower is of lower credit standing,
      the loans are typically underwritten to have a lower LTV ratio and/or other
      mitigating factors.

High
      LTV
      loans include all mortgage loans where the LTV is greater than 90% and the
      borrower has not purchased private mortgage insurance (“PMI”). High LTV loans
      may also include residential mortgage products where a mortgage and home equity
      loan are simultaneously established for the same property. The maximum original
      LTV ratio for the mortgage portfolio with no PMI or other security is 100%.

NOTE
      6 - VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (“VIEs”):

Under
      the
      provisions of FIN 46R the Company has determined that Raymond James Employee
      Investment Funds I and II (the “EIF Funds”), Comprehensive Software Systems,
      Inc. (“CSS”), certain entities in which Raymond James Tax Credit Funds, Inc.
      (“RJTCF”) owns variable interests, various partnerships involving real estate,
      and a trust fund established for employee retention purposes are
      VIEs.  Of these, the Company has determined that the EIF Funds,
      certain tax credit fund partnerships/LLCs, and the trust fund should be
      consolidated in the financial statements as the Company is the primary
      beneficiary.

The
      following table summarizes the balance sheets of the variable interest entities
      consolidated by the Company:

*  Included
      in common shares in treasury in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of
      Financial Condition.


The
      following table summarizes the statements of income of the variable
      interest entities consolidated by the Company:

The
      EIF
      Funds are limited partnerships, for which the Company is the general partner,
      that invest in the merchant banking and private equity activities of the Company
      and other unaffiliated venture capital limited partnerships. The EIF Funds
      were
      established as compensation and retention measures for certain qualified key
      employees of the Company. The Company makes non-recourse loans to these
      employees for two-thirds of the purchase price per unit. The loans and
      applicable interest are to be repaid based on the earnings of the EIF Funds.
      The
      Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary, and accordingly, consolidates
      the EIF Funds, which had combined assets of approximately $17.4 million at
      September 30, 2007. None of those assets act as collateral for any obligations
      of the EIF Funds. The Company's exposure to loss is limited to its contributions
      and the non-recourse loans funded to the employee investors, for which their
      partnership interests serve as collateral. At September 30, 2007 that exposure
      is approximately $5.1 million.

CSS
      was
      formed by a group of broker-dealer firms, including the Company, to develop
      a
      back-office software system. CSS had assets of $4.1 million at September 30,
      2007. As of September 30, 2007, the Company owns approximately 42% of CSS.
      The
      Company's exposure to loss is limited to its capital contributions. The Company
      is not the primary beneficiary of CSS and accounts for its investment using
      the
      equity method of accounting. The carrying value of the Company’s investment in
      CSS is zero at September 30, 2007. CSS has agreed in principal to be acquired
      by
      an affiliate of a shareholder. No distributions to shareholders are
      anticipated.

RJTCF
      is
      a wholly owned subsidiary of RJF and is the managing member or general partner
      in approximately 49 separate tax credit housing funds having one or more
      investor members or limited partners. These tax credit housing funds are
      organized as limited liability companies or limited partnerships for the purpose
      of investing in limited partnerships which purchase and develop low income
      housing properties qualifying for tax credits. As of September 30, 2007, 47
      of
      these tax credit housing funds are VIEs as defined by FIN 46R, and RJTCF’s
      interest in these tax credit housing funds which are VIEs range from .01% to
      1.0%.

RJTCF
      has
      concluded that it is the primary beneficiary in approximately one fifth of
      these
      tax credit housing funds, and accordingly, consolidates these funds, which
      have
      combined assets of approximately $267.7 million at September 30, 2007. None
      of
      those assets act as collateral for any obligations of these funds. The Company's
      exposure to loss is limited to its investments in, advances to, and receivables
      due from these funds and at September 30, 2007, that exposure is approximately
      $6.9 million.

RJTCF
      is
      not the primary beneficiary of the remaining tax credit housing funds it
      determined to be VIEs and accordingly the Company does not consolidate these
      funds. The Company's exposure to loss is limited to its investments in, advances
      to, and receivables due from these funds and at September 30, 2007, that
      exposure is approximately $26.8 million.

The
      two
      remaining tax credit housing funds that have been determined not to be VIEs
      are
      wholly owned by RJTCF and are included in the Company’s consolidated financial
      statements. During September 30, 2007, only one of these funds had any material
      activity. These funds typically hold interests in certain tax credit limited
      partnerships for less than 90 days. The fund had assets of approximately $1.1
      million at September 30, 2007.


As
      of
      September 30, 2007, the Company has a variable interest in several limited
      partnerships involved in various real estate activities, in which a subsidiary
      is the general partner. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of these
      partnerships and accordingly the Company does not consolidate these
      partnerships. These partnerships have assets of approximately $11 million at
      September 30, 2007. The Company's exposure to loss is limited to its capital
      contributions. The carrying value of the Company's investment in these
      partnerships is not material at September 30, 2007.

One
      of
      the Company’s restricted stock plans is associated with a trust fund which was
      established through the Company’s wholly owned Canadian subsidiary. This trust
      fund was established and funded to enable the trust fund to acquire Company
      common stock in the open market to be used to settle restricted stock units
      granted as a retention vehicle for certain employees of the Canadian subsidiary.
      For financial statement purposes, the Company is deemed to be the primary
      beneficiary in accordance with FIN 46R, and accordingly, consolidates this
      trust
      fund, which has assets of approximately $6.5 million at September 30, 2007.
      None
      of those assets are specifically pledged as collateral for any obligations
      of
      the trust fund. The Company's exposure to loss is limited to its contributions
      to the trust fund and at September 30, 2007, that exposure is approximately
      $6.5
      million.

NOTE
      7 – LEVERAGED LEASES

The
      Company is the lessor in a leveraged commercial aircraft transaction with
      Continental Airlines, Inc. (“Continental"). The Company's ability to realize its
      expected return is dependent upon this airline’s ability to fulfill its lease
      obligation. In the event that this airline defaults on its lease commitment
      and
      the Trustee for the debt holders is unable to re-lease or sell the plane with
      adequate terms, the Company would suffer a loss of some or all of its
      investment.

The
      value
      of the Company’s leveraged lease with Continental was approximately $9.9 million
      as of September 30, 2007. The Company's equity investment represented 20% of
      the
      aggregate purchase price; the remaining 80% was funded by public debt issued
      in
      the form of equipment trust certificates. The residual value of the aircraft
      at
      the end of the lease term of approximately 17 years is projected to be 15%
      of
      the original cost. This lease expires in May 2014.

Although
      Continental remains current on its lease payments to the Company, the inability
      of Continental to make its lease payments, or the termination or modification
      of
      the lease through a bankruptcy proceeding, could result in the write-down of
      the
      Company's investment and the acceleration of certain income tax payments. The
      Company continues to monitor this lessee for specific events or circumstances
      that would increase the likelihood of a default on Continental’s obligations
      under this lease.

The
      Company was also the lessor in a leveraged commercial aircraft transaction
      with
      Delta Air Lines, Inc. (“Delta”). Delta filed for bankruptcy protection on
      September 14, 2005. Accordingly, the Company recorded a $6.5 million pre-tax
      charge in 2005 to fully reserve the balance of its investment in the leveraged
      lease of an aircraft to Delta. The Company had taken a $4 million pre-tax charge
      in 2004 to partially reserve for this investment. No amount of these charges
      represented a cash expenditure. During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the
      Company sold its interest in the Delta transaction for $2 million, which was
      recognized as a pre-tax gain within Other Revenue. Upon closing, certain income
      tax obligations of approximately $8.5 million were accelerated and paid during
      the quarter. These tax payments did not impact net earnings, as these amounts
      were previously recorded as deferred tax liabilities.

                uncommitted lines of credit denominated in U.S. dollars and one
                uncommitted line of credit denominated in Canadian dollars (“CDN”). At

                and
                CDN $40 million, respectively. The interest rates for these lines
                of
                credit are variable and are based on the Fed Funds rate, LIBOR, and
                Canadian prime rate. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007,
                interest rates on the lines of credit ranged from 5.25% to 6.70%.
                For the
                fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, interest rates on the lines

                have multiple settlement lines of credit. The Company has guaranteed
                certain of these settlement lines of credit as follows: four in Turkey
                totaling $22.5 million and one in Argentina for $3.0 million. On
                September
                30, 2007, there were no outstanding balances on the settlement lines
                in
                Argentina and Turkey. At September 30, 2007 the aggregate unsecured

                rates
                for these lines of credit ranged from 9% to 20%. During the three
                months
                ended June 30, 2007, the Company entered into a $500 million uncommitted
                tri-party repurchase agreement line of credit. Under this agreement,
                the
                Company pledges certain of its trading inventory as collateral against
                borrowings on this line. The required market value of the collateral
                is
                generally 102% of the cash borrowed. The rate is set each day at
                25 basis
                points over the opening Fed Funds rate and this agreement can be
                terminated by any party on any business day. Under this agreement,
                there
                were secured short-term borrowings of $195,000,000 outstanding at

                February 2011. The maximum amount of FHLB advances outstanding at
                any
                month-end during the year ended September 30, 2007, 2006, and 2005
                was $70
                million, $473.7 million, and $122.6 million, respectively. The average
                amounts of FHLB advances outstanding and the weighted average interest

                and $77 million at a rate of 4.01%, respectively. These advances are
                secured by a blanket lien on RJBank's residential loan portfolio
                granted
                to FHLB. The FHLB has the right to convert advances totaling $35
                million
                and $50 million at September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006,
                respectively, to a floating rate at one or more future dates. RJBank
                has
                the right to prepay these advances without penalty if the FHLB exercises
                its right.

NOTE
      11 – DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:

The
      Company uses interest rate swaps as well as futures contracts as part of its
      fixed income business. These positions are marked to market with the gain or
      loss and the related interest recorded in Net Trading Profits within the
      statement of income for the period. Any collateral exchanged as part of the
      swap
      agreement is recorded in Broker Receivables and Payables in the Consolidated
      Statements of Financial Condition for the period. At September 30, 2007 and
      September 30, 2006, the Company had outstanding interest rate derivative
      contracts with notional amounts of $3.5 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively.
      The notional amount of a derivative contract does not change hands; it is simply
      used as a reference to calculate payments. Accordingly, the notional amount
      of
      the Company’s derivative contracts outstanding at September 30, 2007 vastly
      exceeds the possible losses that could arise from such transactions. The net
      market value of all open swap positions at September 30, 2007 and September
      30,
      2006 was $22.2 million and $13 million, respectively.

The
      Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the
      counterparties to its interest rate swap agreements. The Company performs a
      credit evaluation of counterparties prior to entering into swap transactions
      and
      monitors their credit standings. Currently, the Company anticipates that all
      counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under those
      agreements. The Company may require collateral from counterparties to support
      these obligations as established by the credit threshold specified by the
      agreement and/or as a result of monitoring the credit standing of the
      counterparties. The Company is also exposed to interest rate risk related to
      its
      interest rate swap agreements. The Company monitors exposure in its derivatives
      subsidiary daily based on established limits with respect to a number of
      factors, including interest rate, spread, ratio and basis, and volatility risks.
      These exposures are monitored both on a total portfolio basis and separately
      for
      selected maturity periods.


NOTE
      12 - INCOME TAXES:

The
      provision (benefit) for income taxes consists of the following:

The
      Company's income tax expense differs from the amount computed by applying the
      statutory federal income tax rate due to the following:

U.S.
      and
      international components of income before income taxes were as
      follows:


The
      major
      deferred tax asset (liability) items, as computed under SFAS 109, are as
      follows:

The
      Company has recorded a deferred tax asset at September 30, 2007 and September
      30, 2006. A deferred tax asset has also been recognized for net operating loss
      carryforwards that will expire between 2008 and 2016. No valuation allowance
      as
      defined by SFAS 109 is required for the years then ended as Management believes
      that it is more likely than not the deferred tax asset is
      realizable.

The
      “American Jobs Creation Act of 2004” provides for a one-time deduction for
      qualifying repatriations of foreign earnings in either fiscal year 2005 or
      2006.
      The 85% dividends received deduction can result in a lower tax rate if the
      eligible dividends are reinvested within the limitations and requirements of
      Internal Revenue Code Section 965. During fiscal year 2006, the Company
      repatriated $1.9 million in extraordinary dividends and recorded a tax liability
      of $102,000. To the degree that the cumulative undistributed earnings of
      non-U.S. subsidiaries were permanently invested, no deferred U.S. federal income
      taxes have been provided. The Company has provided for U.S. deferred income
      taxes in the amount of $11.6 million on undistributed earnings not considered
      permanently reinvested in its non-U.S. subsidiaries.

NOTE
      13 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:

Long-term
      lease agreements expire at various times through 2017. Minimum annual rentals
      under such agreements for the succeeding five fiscal years are approximately:
      $28.7 million in 2008, $22.2 million in 2009, $19.3 million in 2010, $12.5
      million in 2011, $8.8 million in 2012 and $8.9 million thereafter. Rental
      expense incurred under all leases, including equipment under short-term
      agreements, aggregated $40 million, $34.3 million and $31.9 million in 2007,
      2006 and 2005, respectively.

See
      Note
      7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to the
      Company's interest in certain commercial aircraft leveraged leases.

At
      September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006, no securities other than FHLB stock
      were pledged by RJBank as collateral with the FHLB for advances. In addition
      to
      the FHLB stock pledged as collateral for advances, RJBank provided the FHLB
      with
      a blanket lien against RJBank's entire portfolio of residential mortgage
      loans.

As
      of
      September 30, 2007, RJBank has entered into reverse repurchase agreements
      totaling $905 million with two counterparties, with individual exposures of
      $500
      million and $405 million. Although RJBank is exposed to risk that these
      counterparties may not fulfill their contractual obligations, the risk of
      default is minimal due to the creditworthiness of these counterparties,
      collateral received and the short duration of these agreements.

As
      of
      September 30, 2007, RJBank had not settled the purchases of $300.6 million
      in
      syndicated loans. These loans are expected to be settled during the three months
      ended December 31, 2007.

See
      Note
      20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to RJBank’s
      commitments to extend credit and other credit-related off balance sheet
      financial instruments such as standby letters of credit and loan
      purchases.


As
      part
      of an effort to increase brand awareness, the Company entered into a stadium
      naming rights contract in July 1998. The contract expires in 2016 and has a
      4%
      annual escalator. Expenses of $3.0 million, $2.9 million and $2.8 million were
      recognized in the fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

In
      the
      normal course of business, the Company enters into underwriting commitments.
      Transactions relating to such commitments of RJA that were open at September 30,
      2007 and were subsequently settled had no material effect on the consolidated
      financial statements as of that date. Transactions relating to such commitments
      of RJ Ltd. that were recorded and open at September 30, 2007 were approximately
      $11.8 million.

The
      Company utilizes client marginable securities to satisfy deposits with clearing
      organizations. At September 30, 2007, the Company had client margin securities
      valued at $135.7 million pledged with a clearing organization to meet the point
      in time requirement of $67.5 million. At September 30, 2006, the Company had
      client margin securities valued at $93.5 million pledged with a clearing
      organization to meet the point in time requirement of $57.4
      million.

In September 2007, Sirchie Acquisition Company, LLC (“SAC”), a 100% owned
      indirect subsidiary of the Company, entered into two agreements. Under the
      Stock
      Purchase Agreement SAC will acquire 51% of the common stock of Law Enforcement
      Associates Corporation from two sellers. Under the Stock and Asset Purchase
      Agreement with several sellers, SAC will acquire substantially all of the
      business, assets, and properties of Sirchie Finger Print Laboratories, Inc.,
      the
      assets or stock of several other companies and certain real estate. SAC and
      sellers negotiated a single purchase price for all of the items to be acquired
      under the two agreements. At closing, one of the sellers will become a member
      of
      SAC. The Company’s share of the purchase price obligation is approximately $50
      million. The closing of the two agreements is expected to occur before January
      31, 2008.

The Company has committed a total of $46.6 million, in amounts ranging from
      $200,000 to $2 million, to 41 different independent venture capital or private
      equity partnerships. As of September 30, 2007, the Company has invested $30.4
      million of that amount and has received $27 million in distributions.
      Additionally, the Company is the general partner in two internally sponsored
      private equity limited partnerships to which it has committed $14 million.
      Of
      that amount, the Company has invested $12.2 million and has received $8.6
      million in distributions as of September 30, 2007.

The
      Company is the general partner in EIF Funds. These limited partnerships invest
      in the merchant banking and private equity activities of the Company and other
      unaffiliated venture capital limited partnerships. The EIF Funds were
      established as compensation and retention measures for certain qualified key
      employees of the Company. At September 30, 2007, the funds have unfunded
      commitments of $3.4 million.

At
      September 30, 2007, the approximate market values of collateral received that
      can be repledged by the Company, were:

In
      the
      normal course of business, certain subsidiaries of the Company act as general
      partner and may be contingently liable for activities of various limited
      partnerships. These partnerships engaged primarily in real estate activities.
      In
      the opinion of the Company, such liabilities, if any, for the obligations of
      the
      partnerships will not in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the
      Company's consolidated financial position.

The
      Company and its subsidiaries maintain one committed and several uncommitted
      lines of credit denominated in U.S. dollars and one uncommitted line of credit
      denominated in Canadian dollars (“CDN”). At September 30, 2007, the aggregate
      domestic lines were $1.26 billion and CDN $40 million, respectively. There
      were
      no outstanding balances against these lines of credit at September 30, 2007.
      The
      interest rates for these lines of credit are variable and are based on the
      Fed
      Funds rate, LIBOR, and Canadian prime rate. The Company’s committed $200 million
      line of credit is subject to a 0.125% per annum facility fee. RJBank has $55
      million in FHLB advances outstanding at September 30, 2007, which are comprised
      of one short-term, fixed rate advance and several long-term, fixed rate
      advances. RJBank had $1.32 billion in credit available from the FHLB at
      September 30, 2007. During the three months ended June 30, 2007, the Company
      entered into a $500 million uncommitted tri-party repurchase agreement line
      of
      credit. Under this agreement, the Company pledges certain of its trading
      inventory as collateral against borrowings on this line. The required market
      value of the collateral is generally 102% of the cash borrowed. The rate is
      set
      each day at 25 basis points over the opening Fed Funds rate and this agreement
      can be terminated by any party on any business day. Under this agreement, there
      were secured short-term borrowings of $195,000,000 outstanding at September
      30,
      2007 which are included in Securities Sold Under Agreement to
      Repurchase.


The
      Company’s joint ventures in Turkey and Argentina have multiple settlement lines
      of credit. The Company has guaranteed certain of these settlement lines of
      credit as follows: four in Turkey totaling $22.5 million and one in Argentina
      for $3.0 million. On September 30, 2007, there were no outstanding balances
      on
      the settlement lines in Argentina and Turkey. At September 30, 2007 the
      aggregate unsecured settlement lines of credit available were $76.5 million,
      and
      there were outstanding balances of $2.7 million on these lines. The Company
      has
      also from time to time authorized performance guarantees for the completion
      of
      trades with counterparties in Argentina and Turkey. At September 30, 2007,
      there
      were no outstanding performance guarantees in Argentina or Turkey.

The
      Company guarantees the existing mortgage debt of RJA of approximately $65
      million. The Company guarantees interest rate swap obligations of RJ Capital
      Services, Inc. The Company has also committed to lend to or guarantee
      obligations of RJTCF of up to $100 million upon request, subject to certain
      limitations as well as annual review and renewal. RJTCF borrows in order to
      invest in partnerships which purchase and develop properties qualifying for
      tax
      credits. These investments in project partnerships are then sold to various
      tax
      credit funds, which have third party investors, and for which RJTCF serves
      as
      the managing member or general partner. RJTCF typically sells these investments
      within 90 days of their acquisition, and the proceeds from the sales are used
      to
      repay RJTCF’s borrowings. Additionally, RJTCF may make short-term loans or
      advances to project partnerships on behalf of the tax credit funds in which
      it
      serves as managing member or general partner. At September 30, 2007, cash funded
      to invest in either loans or investments in project partnerships was $38.7
      million. In addition, at September 30, 2007, RJTCF is committed to additional
      future fundings of $6.1 million related to project partnerships that have not
      yet been sold to various tax credit funds. RJTCF has also issued certain
      guarantees to various third parties related to elements of specific performance
      of certain project partnerships which have been sold to various tax credit
      funds. RJTCF is not the primary guarantor of these obligations which aggregate
      to a cumulative maximum obligation of approximately $5.1 million as of September
      30, 2007.

See
      Note
      14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to the
      Company's legal and regulatory proceedings.

NOTE
      14 – LEGAL AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS:

As
      a
      result of the extensive regulation of the securities industry, the Company's
      broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to regular reviews and inspections by
      regulatory authorities and self-regulatory organizations, which can result
      in
      the imposition of sanctions for regulatory violations, ranging from non-monetary
      censure to fines and, in serious cases, temporary or permanent suspension from
      business. In addition, from time to time regulatory agencies and self-regulatory
      organizations institute investigations into industry practices, which can also
      result in the imposition of such sanctions.

Raymond
      James Yatyrym Menkul Kyymetler A. S., (“RJY”), the Company’s Turkish affiliate,
      was assessed for the year 2001 approximately $7.6 million by the Turkish tax
      authorities. The authorities applied a significantly different methodology
      than
      in the prior year’s audit which the Turkish tax court affirmed. RJY is
      vigorously contesting most aspects of this assessment and has filed an appeal
      with the Turkish Counsel of State. A significant portion of the matters at
      issue
      involved the activities of an employee terminated in 2004. Audits of 2002
      through 2004 are anticipated and their outcome is unknown in light of the change
      in methodology and the pending litigation.

As
      such,
      the potential tax liability combined for these subsequent
      years could range from a few hundred thousand dollars to $7.5
      million

. The Company has recorded a provision for loss in its
      consolidated financial statements for its net equity interest in this joint
      venture. As of September 30, 2007, RJY had total capital of approximately $12.2
      million, of which the Company owns approximately 73%.

The
      Company is a defendant or co-defendant in various lawsuits and arbitrations
      incidental to its securities business. The Company is contesting the allegations
      in these cases and believes that there are meritorious defenses in each of
      these
      lawsuits and arbitrations. In view of the number and diversity of claims against
      the Company, the number of jurisdictions in which litigation is pending and
      the
      inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation and other claims,
      the Company cannot state with certainty what the eventual outcome of pending
      litigation or other claims will be. In the opinion of the Company's management,
      based on current available information, review with outside legal counsel,
      and
      consideration of amounts provided for in the accompanying consolidated financial
      statements with respect to these matters, ultimate resolution of these matters
      will not have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position
      or
      results of operations. However, resolution of one or more of these matters
      may
      have a material effect on the results of operations in any future period,
      depending upon the ultimate resolution of those matters and upon the level
      of
      income for such period.

NOTE
      15 - CAPITAL TRANSACTIONS:

The
      following table presents information on a monthly basis for purchases of the
      Company’s stock for the quarter ended September 30, 2007:


(1)

The
                Company does not have a formal stock repurchase plan. Shares are
                repurchased at the discretion of management pursuant to prior
                authorization from the Board of Directors. On May 20, 2004, the Board
                of
                Directors authorized purchases of up to $75 million. Since that date
                461,500 shares have been repurchased for a total of $9.6 million,
                leaving
                $65.4 million available to repurchase shares. Historically the Company
                has
                considered such purchases when the price of its stock approaches 1.5 times
                book value or when employees surrender shares as payment for option
                exercises. The decision to repurchase shares is subject to cash
                availability and other factors. During 2007 and 2006, 69,986 and
                189,664
                shares were repurchased at an average price of $31.54 and $28.97,
                respectively. During the three months ended December 31, 2006, 42,618
                shares were purchased for the trust fund that was established and
                funded
                to acquire Company common stock in the open market to be used to
                settle
                restricted stock units granted as a retention vehicle for certain
                employees of the Company’s wholly owned Canadian subsidiary (see Note 17
                below for more information on this trust fund). With the exception
                of the
                shares purchased through this trust fund, the Company only purchased
                shares during the balance of the year that were surrendered by employees
                as a payment for option exercises.

NOTE
      17 - EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS:

The
      Company's profit sharing plan and employee stock ownership plan provide certain
      death, disability or retirement benefits for all employees who meet certain
      service requirements. The plans are noncontributory. Contributions by the
      Company, if any, are determined annually by the Company’s Board of Directors on
      a discretionary basis and are recognized as compensation cost throughout the
      year. Benefits become fully vested after seven years of qualified service.
      All
      shares owned by the ESOP are included in earnings per share calculations. Cash
      dividends paid to the ESOP are reflected as a reduction of retained earnings.
      The number of shares of RJF common stock held by the ESOP at September 30,
      and 2006 was approximately 5,538,000 and 5,370,000, respectively. The Company
      also offers a plan pursuant to section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code,
      which provides for the Company to match 100% of the first $500 and 50% of the
      next $500 of compensation deferred by each participant annually. The Company's
      Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan
      that provides benefits to employees who meet certain compensation or production
      requirements. The Company has purchased and holds life insurance on the lives
      of
      most of those employees participating in the LTIP, to earn a competitive rate
      of
      return for participants and to provide a source of funds available to satisfy
      its obligations under this plan. Contributions to the qualified plans and the
      LTIP contribution for management are made in amounts approved annually by the
      Board of Directors. Compensation expense includes aggregate contributions to
      these plans of $40,476,439, $36,912,285, and $26,872,875 for fiscal years 2007,
      2006, and 2005, respectively.


Stock-Based
      Compensation Plans

At
      September 30, 2007, the Company had multiple stock-based employee compensation
      plans, which are described below. The Company issues new shares under all plans
      approved by shareholders. Effective October 1, 2005, the Company adopted SFAS
      No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment”. The adoption of this statement did not have a
      material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements given that it
      adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 effective
      September 28, 2002 using the modified prospective application transition method
      within the provisions of SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
– Transition and Disclosure”. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, benefits
      of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs were reported
      as
      operating cash flows. SFAS No. 123R requires excess tax benefits to be reported
      as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid, as part
      of
      operating cash flows.

Fixed
      Stock Option Plans

The
      Company has two qualified and two non-qualified fixed stock option plans
      available for grants to employees and members of the Company’s Board of
      Directors. Under the 2002 Incentive Stock Option Plan, one of the Company’s
      qualified plans, the Company may grant options to its management personnel
      for
      up to 9,000,000 shares of common stock. The 2002 Plan was established to
      replace, on substantially the same terms and conditions, the 1992 Plan. As
      of
      September 30, 2007, the 1992 Plan still has options outstanding. Options are
      granted to key administrative employees and Financial Advisors of Raymond James
      & Associates, Inc. who achieve certain gross commission levels. Options are
      exercisable in the 36th to 72nd months following the date of grant and only
      in
      the event that the grantee is an employee of the Company at that time, disabled,
      deceased or recently retired.

As
      noted
      above, the Company has two non-qualified fixed stock option plans. Under the
      first of those plans, the Company may grant up to 854,298 shares of common
      stock
      to the Company's outside directors. Options vest over a three-year period from
      grant date provided that the director is still serving on the Board of the
      Company. Under the Company's second non-qualified stock option plan, the Company
      may grant up to 2,531,250 shares of common stock to key management personnel.
      Option terms are specified in individual agreements and expire on a date no
      later than the tenth anniversary of the grant date. Under all fixed stock option
      plans, the exercise price of each option equals the market price of the
      Company's stock on the date of grant.

The
      Company’s net income for the years ended September 30, 2007, September 30, 2006,
      and September 30, 2005 includes $5.9 million, $5.6 million, and $6.2 million,
      respectively, of compensation costs and $212,000, $281,000, and $293,000,
      respectively of income tax benefits related to the Company’s four fixed stock
      option plans available for grants to employees and members of its Board of
      Directors.

These
      amounts may not be representative of future stock-based compensation expense
      since the estimated fair value of stock options is amortized to expense straight
      line over the vesting period and additional options may be granted in future
      years. The fair value of each fixed option grant for these plans is estimated
      on
      the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
      following weighted average assumptions used for stock option grants in years
      ended 2007, 2006, and 2005:




Dividend
                Yield

1.32%

1.19%

1.10%

Expected
                Volatility

29.44%

29.38%

38.56%

Risk-free
                Interest Rate

                Lives

4.9
                yrs

5.1
                yrs

The
      dividend yield assumption is based on the Company’s current declared dividend as
      a percentage of the stock price. The expected volatility assumption for the
      current period and fiscal 2006 is based on the Company’s historical stock price
      and is a weighted average combining (1) the volatility of the most recent year,
      (2) the volatility of the most recent time period equal to the expected lives
      assumption, and (3) the annualized volatility of the price of the Company’s
      stock since the late 1980’s. The expected volatility used by the Company in
      fiscal 2005 was based on the annualized volatility of the price of the Company’s
      stock since the late 1980’s. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based on
      the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the options.
      The
      expected lives assumption is based on the average of (1) the assumption that
      all
      outstanding options will be exercised at the midpoint between their vesting
      date
      and full contractual term and (2) the assumption that all outstanding options
      will be exercised at their full contractual term.


A
      summary
      of option activity of the Company's four fixed stock option plans available
      for
      grants to employees and members of its Board of Directors for the year ended
      September 30, 2007 is presented below:

As
      of
      September 30, 2007, there was $9.6 million of total unrecognized compensation
      cost related to stock options for these plans. These costs are expected to
      be
      recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.2 years. The
      weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted under these
      plans during the years ended September 30, 2007, September 30, 2006 and
      September 30, 2005 was $9.37 per share, $7.36 per share and $6.44 per share,
      respectively. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised for these
      plans during the years ended September 30, 2007, September 30, 2006 and
      September 30, 2005 was $25.0 million, $15.3 million and $11.2 million,
      respectively. The total grant date fair value of stock options vested for these
      plans during the years ended September 30, 2007, September 30, 2006 and
      September 30, 2005  was $8.0 million, $5.4 million and $7.0 million,
      respectively.

Cash
      received from stock option exercises for these plans for the year ended
      September 30, 2007 was $20.2 million. The actual tax benefit realized for the
      tax deductions from option exercise for these stock option plans was $612,000
      for the year ended September 30, 2007.

Restricted
      Stock Plan

Under
      the
      2005 Restricted Stock Plan the Company is authorized to issue up to 4,250,000
      restricted stock units or restricted shares of common stock to employees and
      independent contractors. The 2005 Plan was established to replace, on
      substantially the same terms and conditions, the 1999 Plan. During the three
      months ended March 31, 2006, this plan was amended to allow the issuance of
      restricted stock units as retention measures for certain employees of the
      Company. In addition, the Company, through its wholly owned Canadian subsidiary,
      established a trust fund which is associated with the 2005 Plan. This trust
      fund
      was established and funded to enable the trust fund to acquire Company common
      stock in the open market to be used to settle restricted stock units granted
      as
      a retention vehicle for certain employees of the Canadian subsidiary. Awards
      under this plan may be granted by the Company in connection with initial
      employment or under various retention plans for individuals who are responsible
      for a contribution to the management, growth, and/or profitability of the
      Company. These awards are forfeitable in the event of termination other than
      for
      death, disability or retirement. The compensation cost is recognized over the
      vesting period of the awards and is calculated as the market value of the awards
      on the date of grant. The following employee related activity occurred during
      the year ended September 30, 2007:


The
      Company’s net income for the year ended September 30, 2007 includes $11.7
      million of compensation costs and $4.5 million of income tax benefits related
      to
      the Company’s Restricted Stock Plan. The Company’s net income for the years
      ended September 30, 2006 and September 30, 2005 includes $7.5 million and $3.7
      million, respectively, of compensation costs and $2.9 million and $1.4 million,
      respectively, of income tax benefits related to this plan.

As
      of
      September 30, 2007, there was $44.2 million of total unrecognized compensation
      cost related to grants under the Company’s Restricted Stock Plan. These costs
      are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately
      3.4 years. The total fair value of shares vested under this plan during the
      year
      ended September 30, 2007 was $2.4 million.

Employee
      Stock Purchase Plan

Under
      the
      2003 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the Company is authorized to issue up to
      3,375,000 shares of common stock to its full-time employees, nearly all of
      whom
      are eligible to participate. Under the terms of the Plan, employees can choose
      each year to have up to 20% of their annual compensation specified to purchase
      the Company's common stock. Share purchases in any calendar year are limited
      to
      the lesser of 1,000 shares or shares with a market value of $25,000. The
      purchase price of the stock is 85% of the market price on the day prior to
      the
      purchase date. Under the Plan the Company sold approximately 444,000, 379,000
      and 493,000 shares to employees during the years ended September 30, 2007,
      September 30, 2006 and September 30, 2005, respectively. The compensation cost
      is calculated as the value of the 15% discount from market value and was $2.1
      million, $1.6 million and $1.4 million during the years ended September 30,
      2007, September 30, 2006 and September 30, 2005, respectively.

Stock
      Bonus Plan

The
      Company's 2007 Stock Bonus Plan authorizes the Company to issue up to 3,000,000
      restricted shares to officers and certain other employees in lieu of cash for
      10% to 20% of annual bonus amounts in excess of $250,000.  The 2007
      Plan was established to replace, on substantially the same terms and conditions,
      the 1999 Plan.  The determination of the number of shares to be
      granted may encompass a discount from market value at the discretion of the
      Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Under the plan the shares
      are
      generally restricted for a three year period, during which time the shares
      are
      forfeitable in the event of voluntary termination other than for death,
      disability or retirement. The compensation cost is recognized over the
      three-year vesting period based on the market value of the shares on the date
      of
      grant. The following activity occurred during the year ended September 30,
      2007:

The
      Company’s net income for the year ended September 30, 2007 includes $9.1 million
      of compensation costs and $3.5 million of income tax benefits related to the
      Company’s Stock Bonus Plan. The Company’s net income for the years ended
      September 30, 2006 and September 30, 2005 includes $5.4 million and $3.5
      million, respectively, of compensation costs and $2.0 million and $1.3 million,
      respectively, of income tax benefits related to this plan.

As
      of
      September 30, 2007, there was $10.2 million of total unrecognized compensation
      cost related to grants under the Company’s Stock Bonus Plan. These costs are
      expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.2
      years. The total fair value of shares vested under this plan during the fiscal
      year ended September 30, 2007 was $3.6 million.

Employee
      Investment Funds

Certain
      key employees of the Company participate in the Raymond James Employee
      Investment Funds I and II, which are limited partnerships that invest in the
      merchant banking and venture capital activities of the Company and other
      unaffiliated venture capital limited partnerships. The Company makes
      non-recourse loans to these employees for two thirds of the purchase price
      per
      unit. The loans and applicable interest are to be repaid based solely on the
      distributions from the funds.


NOTE
      18 – NON-EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION:

Under
      two
      of its non-qualified fixed stock option plans, the Company may grant stock
      options to its independent contractor Financial Advisors. Under the 2007 Stock
      Option Plan for Independent Contractors, the Company may grant up to 2,000,000
      shares of common stock to independent contractor Financial Advisors. The 2007
      Plan was established to replace, on substantially the same terms and conditions,
      the 1990 Plan. As of September 30, 2007, the 1990 Plan still has options
      outstanding. Options are exercisable five years after grant date provided that
      the Financial Advisors are still associated with the Company, disabled, deceased
      or recently retired. Under these fixed stock option plans, the exercise price
      of
      each option equals the market price of the Company's stock on the date of
      grant.

Prior
      to
      fiscal 2006, the Company valued stock options awarded to its independent
      contractor Financial Advisors at fair value on the date of grant and amortized
      these options over their expected service period in accordance with SFAS No.
      123. However, after further analysis on the application of SFAS No. 123R, the
      SEC guidance contained in Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 107, and
      Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) No. 96-18, “Accounting for Equity
      Instruments That are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in
      Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services”, to these non-employee awards, the
      Company concluded that absent a specific performance commitment, these grants
      are to be measured at their vesting date fair value and their fair value
      estimated at reporting dates prior to that time. The compensation expense
      recognized each period should be based on the most recent estimated value.
      The
      Company’s recording of compensation expenses prior to fiscal 2006 for these
      grants were an estimate based on grant date fair value. Fiscal 2006 includes
      the
      effect of the change for that year. The effect on years prior to fiscal 2006
      was
      not material. Further, in accordance with EITF 00-19, “Accounting for Derivative
      Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own
      Stock,” the Company classifies these non-employee awards as liabilities at fair
      value upon vesting, with changes in fair value reported in earnings until these
      awards are exercised or forfeited.

The
      Company’s net income for the years ended September 30, 2007, September 30, 2006,
      and September 30, 2005 includes $7.0 million, $9.7 million, and $2.1 million,
      respectively, of compensation costs and $2.7 million, $3.7 million, and
      $804,000, respectively, net of income tax benefits related to option grants
      to
      its independent contractor Financial Advisors.

The
      fair
      value of each fixed option grant awarded to an independent contractor Financial
      Advisor is estimated on the date of grant and periodically revalued using the
      Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average
      assumptions used for fiscal years ended 2007, 2006,  and
      2005:

The
      dividend yield assumption is based on the Company’s current declared dividend as
      a percentage of the stock price. The expected volatility assumption for the
      current period and fiscal 2006 is based on the Company’s historical stock price
      and is a weighted average combining (1) the volatility of the most recent year,
      (2) the volatility of the most recent time period equal to the expected lives
      assumption, and (3) the annualized volatility of the price of the Company’s
      stock since the late 1980’s. The expected volatility used by the Company in
      fiscal 2005 was based on the annualized volatility of the price of the Company’s
      stock since the late 1980’s. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based on
      the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at each point in time the options are
      valued. The expected lives assumption is based on the difference between the
      option’s vesting date plus 90 days (the average exercise period) and the date of
      the current reporting period.

A
      summary
      of option activity of the Company's fixed stock option plans under which awards
      are granted to its independent contractor Financial Advisors for the year ended
      September 30, 2007 is presented below:


As
      of
      September 30, 2007, there was $7.7 million of total unrecognized compensation
      cost related to unvested stock options granted to its independent contractor
      Financial Advisors based on estimated fair value at that date. These costs
      are
      expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.3
      years. The weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted
      under
      these plans during the years ended September 30, 2007, September 30, 2006 and
      September 30, 2005 was $9.70 per share, $11.87 per share and $9.51 per share,
      respectively. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised for these
      plans during the years ended September 30, 2007, September 30, 2006 and
      September 30, 2005 was $6.1 million, $5.6 million and $2.7 million,
      respectively. The total estimated fair value of stock options vested for these
      plans during the years ended September 30, 2007, September 30, 2006 and
      September 30, 2005 was $6.2 million, $4.1 million and $3.5 million,
      respectively.

Cash
      received from stock option exercises for these plans for the year ended
      September 30, 2007 was $5.9 million. There were no actual tax benefits realized
      for the tax deductions from option exercise of awards to its independent
      contractor Financial Advisors for the year ended September 30,
      2007.

Under
      the
      2005 Restricted Stock Plan the Company may grant restricted shares of common
      stock or restricted stock units to employees and independent contractor
      Financial Advisors. The following activity  for independent contractor
      Financial Advisors occurred during the year ended September 30,
      2007:

The
      Company’s net income for the year ended September 30, 2007 includes $276,000 of
      compensation costs and $105,000 of income tax benefits related to restricted
      shares granted to its independent contractor Financial Advisors.

As
      of
      September 30, 2007, there was $2.0 million of total unrecognized compensation
      cost related to grants issued to its independent contractor Financial Advisors
      based on estimated fair value at that date. These costs are expected to be
      recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 4.7 years. The total
      fair value of shares vested under this plan during the year ended September
      30,
      2007 was $18,000.

NOTE
      19 - REGULATIONS AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS:

Certain
      broker-dealer subsidiaries of the Company are subject to the requirements of
      the
      Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1) under the Securities Exchange Act of
      1934. RJA, a member firm of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
      (“FINRA”), is also subject to the rules of FINRA, whose requirements are
      substantially the same. Rule 15c3-1 requires that aggregate indebtedness, as
      defined, not exceed 15 times net capital, as defined. Rule 15c3-1 also provides
      for an “alternative net capital requirement”, which RJA, Raymond James Financial
      Services, Inc. (“RJFS”) and Heritage Fund Distributors, Inc. (“HFD”) have
      elected. It requires that minimum net capital, as defined, be equal to the
      greater of $250,000 or two percent of Aggregate Debit Items arising from client
      transactions. FINRA may require a member firm to reduce its business if its
      net
      capital is less than four percent of Aggregate Debit Items and may prohibit
      a
      member firm from expanding its business and declaring cash dividends if its
      net
      capital is less than five percent of Aggregate Debit Items. The net capital
      position of RJA at September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006 was as
      follows:


At
      September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006, RJFS had no Aggregate Debit Items
      and
      therefore the minimum net capital of $250,000 was applicable. The net capital
      position of RJFS at September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006 was as
      follows:

At
      September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006, HFD had no Aggregate Debit Items
      and
      therefore the minimum net capital of $250,000 was applicable. The net capital
      position of HFD at September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006 was as
      follows:

RJ
      Ltd.
      is subject to the Minimum Capital Rule (By-Law No. 17 of the Investment Dealers
      Association ("IDA") and the Early Warning System (By-Law No. 30 of the IDA).
      The
      Minimum Capital Rule requires that every member shall have and maintain at
      all
      times Risk Adjusted Capital greater than zero calculated in accordance with
      Form
      1 (Joint Regulatory Financial Questionnaire and Report) and with such
      requirements as the Board of Directors of the IDA may from time to time
      prescribe. Insufficient Risk Adjusted Capital may result in suspension from
      membership in the stock exchanges or the IDA.

The
      Early
      Warning System is designed to provide advance warning that a member firm is
      encountering financial difficulties. This system imposes certain sanctions
      on
      members who are designated in Early Warning Level 1 or Level 2 according to
      their capital, profitability, liquidity position, frequency of designation
      or at
      the discretion of the IDA. Restrictions on business activities and capital
      transactions, early filing requirements, and mandated corrective measures are
      sanctions that may be imposed as part of the Early Warning System. RJ Ltd.
      was
      not in Early Warning Level 1 or Level 2 at September 30, 2007 or September
      30,
      2006.

The
      Risk
      Adjusted Capital of RJ Ltd. was CDN $47,724,293 and CDN $42,841,000 September
      30, 2007 and September 30, 2006, respectively.

The
      Company’s other domestic and international broker-dealers are in compliance with
      and meet all net capital requirements.

RJBank
      is
      subject to various regulatory and capital requirements administered by the
      federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can
      initiate certain mandatory - and possibly additional discretionary - actions
      by
      regulators. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework
      for
      prompt corrective action, RJBank must meet specific capital guidelines that
      involve quantitative measures of RJBank's assets, liabilities, and certain
      off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.
      RJBank's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative
      judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other
      factors.

Quantitative
      measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require RJBank
      to
      maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total
      and
      Tier I Capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as
      defined). Management believes that, as of September 30, 2007, RJBank meets
      all
      capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.

As
      of
      September 30, 2007, the most recent notification from the Office of Thrift
      Supervision categorized RJBank as “well capitalized” under the regulatory
      framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as “well capitalized”,
      RJBank must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier I risk-based, and Tier
      I leverage ratios as set forth in the table below. There are no conditions
      or
      events since that notification that management believes have changed RJBank's
      category.


NOTE
      20 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET
      RISK:

In
      the
      normal course of business, the Company purchases and sells securities as either
      principal or agent on behalf of its clients. If either the client or
      counterparty fails to perform, the Company may be required to discharge the
      obligations of the nonperforming party. In such circumstances, the Company
      may
      sustain a loss if the market value of the security or futures contract is
      different from the contract value of the transaction.

The
      Company also acts as an intermediary between broker-dealers and other financial
      institutions whereby the Company borrows securities from one broker-dealer
      and
      then lends them to another. Securities borrowed and securities loaned are
      carried at the amounts of cash collateral advanced and received in connection
      with the transactions. The Company measures the market value of the securities
      borrowed and loaned against the cash collateral on a daily basis. The market
      value of securities borrowed and securities loaned was $1,159,689,000 and
      $1,159,615,000, respectively, at September 30, 2007 and $1,034,563,000 and
      $1,197,215,000, respectively, at September 30, 2006. The contract value of
      securities borrowed and securities loaned was $1,200,798,000 and $1,204,702,000,
      respectively, at September 30, 2007 and $1,068,102,000 and $1,235,104,000,
      respectively, at September 30, 2006. Additional cash is obtained as necessary
      to
      ensure such transactions are adequately collateralized. If another party to
      the
      transaction fails to perform as agreed (for example failure to deliver a
      security or failure to pay for a security), the Company may incur a loss if
      the
      market value of the security is different from the contract amount of the
      transaction.

The
      Company has also loaned, to brokers-dealers and other financial institutions,
      securities owned by clients and others for which it has received cash or other
      collateral. The market value of securities loaned was $74,074,000 at September
      30, 2007. If a borrowing institution or broker-dealer does not return a
      security, the Company may be obligated to purchase the security in order to
      return it to the owner. In such circumstances, the Company may incur a loss
      equal to the amount by which the market value of the security on the date of
      nonperformance exceeds the value of the collateral received from the financial
      institution or the broker-dealer.

The
      Company has sold securities that it does not currently own, and will therefore,
      be obligated to purchase such securities at a future date. The Company has
      recorded $138.4 million and $94 million at September 30, 2007 and September
      30,
      2006, respectively, which represents the market value of the related securities
      at such dates. The Company is subject to loss if the market price of those
      securities not covered by a hedged position increases subsequent to fiscal
      year
      end. The Company utilizes short government obligations and equity securities
      to
      economically hedge long proprietary inventory positions. At September 30, 2007,
      the Company had $106,010,000 in short government obligations and $11,048,000
      in
      short equity securities, which represented economic hedge positions. At
      September 30, 2006, the Company had $31,636,000 in short government obligations,
      $34,023,000 in short agency securities and $19,068,000 in short equity
      securities, which represented hedge positions.

The
      Company enters into security transactions involving forward settlement. Forward
      contracts provide for the delayed delivery of the underlying instrument. The
      Company has entered into transactions with contract values of $2,036,818,000
      and
      $2,304,629,000 and market values of $2,033,023,000 and $2,297,824,000 as of
      September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006, respectively. The contractual amounts
      related to these financial instruments reflect the volume and activity and
      do
      not reflect the amounts at risk. The gain or loss on these transactions is
      recognized on a trade date basis. Transactions involving future settlement
      give
      rise to market risk, which represents the potential loss that can be caused
      by a
      change in the market value of a particular financial instrument. The Company's
      exposure to market risk is determined by a number of factors, including the
      duration, size, composition and diversification of positions held, the absolute
      and relative levels of interest rates, and market volatility. The credit risk
      for these transactions is limited to the unrealized market valuation gains
      recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.


The
      majority of the Company's transactions, and consequently, the concentration
      of
      its credit exposure is with clients, broker-dealers and other financial
      institutions in the U.S. These activities primarily involve collateralized
      arrangements and may result in credit exposure in the event that the
      counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations. The Company's exposure
      to credit risk can be directly impacted by volatile securities markets, which
      may impair the ability of counterparties to satisfy their contractual
      obligations. The Company seeks to control its credit risk through a variety
      of
      reporting and control procedures, including establishing credit limits based
      upon a review of the counterparties' financial condition and credit ratings.
      The
      Company monitors collateral levels on a daily basis for compliance with
      regulatory and internal guidelines and requests changes in collateral levels
      as
      appropriate.

RJBank
      has outstanding at any time a significant number of commitments to extend credit
      and other credit-related off balance sheet financial instruments such as standby
      letters of credit and loan purchases. These arrangements are subject to strict
      credit control assessments and each customer’s credit worthiness is evaluated on
      a case-by-case basis. A summary of commitments to extend credit and other
      credit-related off balance sheet financial instruments outstanding at September
      30, 2007 and 2006, is as follows:

Because
      many loan commitments expire without being funded in whole or part, the contract
      amounts are not estimates of future cash flows.

Credit
      risk represents the accounting loss that would be recognized at the reporting
      date if counterparties failed completely to perform as contracted. The credit
      risk amounts are equal to the contractual amounts, assuming that the amounts
      are
      fully advanced and that the collateral or other security is of no value. RJBank
      uses the same credit approval and monitoring process in extending loan
      commitments and other credit-related off balance sheet instruments as it does
      in
      making loans.

RJBank’s
      policy is generally to require customers to provide collateral at the time
      of
      closing. The amount of collateral obtained, if it is deemed necessary by RJBank
      upon extension of credit, is based on RJBank’s credit evaluation of the
      borrower. Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory,
      real estate, and income producing commercial properties.

In
      the
      normal course of business, RJBank issues, or participates in the issuance of,
      financial standby letters of credit whereby it provides an irrevocable guarantee
      of payment in the event the letter of credit is drawn down by the beneficiary.
      As of September 30, 2007, $100.4 million of such letters of credit were
      outstanding. Of the letters of credit outstanding, $100 million are underwritten
      as part of a larger corporate credit relationship. In the event that a letter
      of
      credit is drawn down, RJBank would pursue repayment from the account party
      under
      the existing borrowing relationship, or would liquidate collateral, or both.
      The
      proceeds from repayment or liquidation of collateral are expected to satisfy
      the
      maximum potential future amount of any payments of amounts drawn down under
      the
      existing letters of credit. At September 30, 2007, RJBank had $1.6 million
      in
      unearned fees related to these instruments. The credit risk involved in issuing
      letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved with extending loan
      commitments to clients, and accordingly, RJBank uses a credit evaluation process
      and collateral requirements similar to those for loan commitments.


NOTE
      21 – EARNINGS PER SHARE:

The
      following table presents the computation of basic and diluted earnings per
      share:

*     
      2005 amounts have been adjusted for the March 22, 2006 3-for-2 stock split
      .

(1)  
        Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average
        number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common
        shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive
        potential common shares include stock options, units and awards.

NOTE
      22 – SEGMENT ANALYSIS:

SFAS
      No.
      131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information”,
      establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments.
      Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which
      separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by
      the
      chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to
      allocate resources and in assessing performance. Revisions have been made in
      the
      segment disclosures for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2006 and 2005
      to
      conform to the current period presentation. As a result, financial service
      fees
      revenue and investment advisory fees expense increased by approximately $12.8
      million and $11.2 million, respectively, for the fiscal years ended September
      30, 2006 and 2005 in the Asset Management segment. These revisions did not
      impact the Company’s net income for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2006
      and 2005.

The
      Company currently operates through the following eight business segments:
      Private Client Group; Capital Markets; Asset Management; RJBank; Emerging
      Markets; Stock Loan/Borrow; Proprietary Capital and various corporate activities
      combined in the "Other" segment.  In the quarter ended September 30,
      2007, a new segment was established: Proprietary Capital. The components of
      this
      segment were previously included in Asset Management and Other.
      Reclassifications have been made in the segment disclosure for previous years
      to
      conform to this presentation. The business segments are based upon factors
      such
      as the services provided and the distribution channels served and are consistent
      with how the Company assesses performance and determines how to allocate
      resources throughout the Company and its subsidiaries. The financial results
      of
      the Company's segments are presented using the same policies as those described
      in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”. Segment data includes
      charges allocating corporate overhead and benefits to each segment. Intersegment
      revenues, charges, receivables and payables are eliminated between segments
      upon
      consolidation.

The
      Private Client Group segment includes the retail branches of the Company's
      broker-dealer subsidiaries located throughout the U.S., Canada and the United
      Kingdom. These branches provide securities brokerage services including the
      sale
      of equities, mutual funds, fixed income products and insurance products to
      their
      individual clients. The segment includes net interest earnings on client margin
      loans and cash balances. Additionally, this segment includes the correspondent
      clearing services that the Company provides to other broker-dealer
      firms.


The
      Capital Markets segment includes institutional sales and trading in the U.S.,
      Canada and Europe. It provides securities brokerage, trading, and research
      services to institutions with an emphasis on the sale of U.S. and Canadian
      equities and fixed income products. This segment also includes the Company's
      management of and participation in underwritings, merger and acquisition
      services, public finance activities, and the operations of Raymond James Tax
      Credit Funds.

The
      Asset
      Management segment includes investment portfolio management services of Eagle
      Asset Management, Inc., Awad Asset Management, Inc., and Raymond James
      Consulting Services (RJA’s asset management services division), mutual fund
      management by Heritage Asset Management, Inc., and trust services of Raymond
      James Trust Company and Raymond James Trust Company West. In addition to the
      asset management services noted above, this segment also offers fee-based
      programs to clients who have contracted for portfolio management services from
      outside money managers.

RJBank
      is
      a separate segment, which provides consumer, residential, and commercial loans,
      as well as FDIC-insured deposit accounts to clients of the Company's
      broker-dealer subsidiaries and to the general public.

The
      Emerging Markets segment includes various joint ventures in Turkey and Latin
      America. These joint ventures operate in securities brokerage, investment
      banking and asset management.

The
      Stock
      Loan/Borrow segment involves the borrowing and lending of securities from and
      to
      other broker-dealers, financial institutions and other counterparties, generally
      as an intermediary.

The
      Proprietary Capital segment consists of the Company’s principal capital and
      private equity activities including: various direct and third party private
      equity and merchant banking investments (including Raymond James Capital, Inc.
      a
      captive private equity business), Special Situations Investments, the EIF Funds,
      and two private equity funds sponsored by the Company: Raymond James Capital
      Partners, L.P., and Ballast Point Ventures, L.P.

      controls are procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
      disclosed in the Company's reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this
      report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods
      specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed
      to
      ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management,
      including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as
      appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In
      designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management
      recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
      operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving
      the
      desired control objectives, as the Company's are designed to do, and management
      necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
      relationship of possible controls and procedures.

Under
      the
      supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including
      the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company has
      evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures pursuant
      to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this
      report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
      Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures
      are effective. There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over
      financial reporting during the year ended September 30, 2007 that have
      materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
      Company’s internal control over financial reporting.


REPORT
      OF
      MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The
      Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
      internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal control
      over
      financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding
      the
      reliability of the Company’s financial reporting for external purposes in
      accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
      Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that
      in
      reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the Company’s transactions;
      providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
      for
      preparation of its financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that
      receipts and expenditures of Company assets are made in accordance with
      management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized
      acquisition, use or disposition of Company assets that could have a material
      effect on the Company’s financial statements would be prevented or detected on a
      timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
      financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a
      misstatement of the Company’s financial statements would be prevented or
      detected.

Management
      conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
      over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control –
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
      of the
      Treadway Commission (COSO)

. Based on this evaluation, management concluded
      that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
      September 30, 2007. KPMG LLP, who audited and reported on the consolidated
      financial statements of the Company included in this report, has issued an
      attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as
      of September 30, 2007 (included below).


REPORT
      OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The
      Board
      of Directors and Shareholders

Raymond
      James Financial, Inc.:

We
      have
      audited Raymond James Financial, Inc.’s internal control over financial
      reporting as of September 30, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
      Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Raymond James Financial,
      Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
      financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
      control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of
      Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility
      is
      to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
      based on our audit.

We
      conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
      Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
      plan
      and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
      internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
      respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
      over
      financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and
      testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
      control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such
      other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
      that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
      company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
      provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
      and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
      with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control
      over
      financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
      to
      the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
      reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
      provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
      permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
      accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
      being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
      of
      the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
      detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
      assets that could have a material effect on the financial
      statements.

Because
      of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
      not
      prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
      effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
      inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
      with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
      our
      opinion, Raymond James Financial, Inc. maintained, in all material respects,
      effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2007,
      based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework
      issued by the Committee

of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
      Commission (COSO)

.

We
      also
      have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
      Oversight Board (United States), the Consolidated Statements of Financial
      Condition of Raymond James Financial, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September
      30,
      2007 and 2006, and the related Consolidated Statements of Income and
      Comprehensive Income, Changes in Shareholders’ Equity, and Cash Flows for each
      of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2007, and our report
      dated November 29, 2007

expressed an unqualified opinion on those
      consolidated financial statements
