SPECIAL CAUTIONARY NOTICE REGARDING

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

We believe that it is important to communicate our plans and expectations about the future to our shareholders and to the public. Some of the statements we use in this report, and in some of the documents we
incorporate by reference in this report contain forward-looking statements concerning our business operations, economic performance and financial condition, including in particular, our business strategy and means to implement the strategy, the
amount of future capital expenditures, our success in developing and introducing new products and expanding our business, the successful integration of future acquisitions, and the timing of the introduction of new and modified products or services.
You can sometimes identify forward looking-statements by our use of the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends” and similar expressions. For these statements, we claim the protection of the safe
harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Although we believe that the plans and expectations reflected in or suggested by our forward-looking statements are reasonable, those statements are based
on a number of assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to significant risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, cannot be foreseen, and reflect future business decisions that are subject to change. Accordingly, we
cannot guarantee you that our plans and expectations will be achieved. Our actual revenues, revenue growth rates and margins, other results of operation and shareholder values could differ materially from those anticipated in our forward-looking
statements as a result of many known and unknown factors, many of which are beyond our ability to predict or control. These factors include, but are not limited to, those set forth in Exhibit 99.1 to this report, those set forth elsewhere in this
report and those set forth in our press releases, reports and other filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These cautionary statements qualify all of our forward-looking statements and you are cautioned not to place undue reliance
on these forward-looking statements.

Our forward-looking
statements speak only as of the date they are made and should not be relied upon as representing our plans and expectations as of any subsequent date. While we may elect to update or revise forward-looking statements at some time in the future, we
specifically disclaim any obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to our forward-looking statements.

PART I

ITEM 1—BUSINESS

General Developments

Financial Highlights

In fiscal 2003, revenue increased $53.3 million or 12% to $516.1 million
from $462.8 million in fiscal 2002. Revenue growth is primarily driven by the growth in our direct merchant service offering in the United States and Canadian portfolios. Operating income is $93.3 million for fiscal 2003, compared to $71.4 million
in the prior year’s comparable period. This resulted in an increase in operating margin from 15.4% for fiscal 2002 to 18.1% for fiscal 2003. Operating income excluding the effect of the restructuring and other charges from fiscal 2003 and 2002,
increased $12.1 million or 15% to $94.5 million in fiscal 2003 from $82.4 million in fiscal 2002. Net income increased $29.5 million or 124% to $53.3 million in fiscal 2003 from $23.8 million in the prior year’s comparable period, resulting in
a $0.78 increase in diluted earnings per share to $1.41 from $0.63. Net income, excluding the impact of the restructuring and other charges from fiscal 2003 and 2002 and excluding the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle from
fiscal 2002, increased by $7.5 million or 16% to $54.1 million in fiscal 2003 from $46.6 million in fiscal 2002 and diluted earnings per share on the same basis increased $0.20 or 17% to $1.43 in fiscal 2003 from $1.23 in fiscal 2002. Refer to
Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Pending Acquisition

On
August 11, 2003, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Latin America Money Services, LLC, or LAMS, a holding company which directly owns a majority of the outstanding equity interest in DolEx Dollar Express, Inc., or DolEx, and
indirectly owns a majority of the outstanding equity interest in DolEx Envios S.A. de C.V., a Mexican subsidiary of DolEx. The transaction, which is structured as a merger between a newly created subsidiary of Global Payments and LAMS, is subject to
regulatory approvals; however it is expected to close before the end of calendar year 2003. We are also acquiring the remaining minority interest in DolEx, so that following the transaction, DolEx will be a wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary of
Global Payments Inc. The purchase price is $190 million, plus a contingent payment of up to $10 million based on the calendar year 2003 financial results of DolEx. We expect the purchase price to be financed under our existing line of credit, cash
on hand, and notes payable. We intend to operate the business in a manner consistent with DolEx’s historical operations. We plan to include this business in our funds transfer offering, with a consumer-to-consumer focus. Once the transaction
closes, we will re-name the funds transfer offering to money transfer.

Founded in 1996, DolEx is a leading provider of consumer-to-consumer electronic money transfer services to the Latino community living in the U.S. and their Latin American families abroad. DolEx provides services that allow customers to
send money from its network of retail branches in the U.S. to beneficiaries in Latin America. The company has its headquarters in Arlington, Texas, operates hundreds of branches across the U.S. in areas with large Latino populations, and has
settlement arrangements with thousands of bank, exchange house, and retail locations in Latin America. For the year ended December 31, 2002, DolEx and DolEx Envios reported total revenues of $69.9 million.

Acquisition Integration

As part of our ongoing strategy to integrate our acquisitions into our existing systems, we completed the conversion of
National Bank of Canada’s, or National Bank, merchant accounts onto our back-end operating platform during October 2002. We also completed the front-end conversion of the merchant accounts acquired from National Bank to a Canadian-based third
party processor during February 2003.



Index to Financial Statements

Acquisition Strategy

We continue to pursue our acquisition strategy, which includes entering new markets and expanding existing markets. Our focus will be on international
processing and payment-related businesses that will allow us to leverage our back-end platform, risk, and chargebacks infrastructure and gain greater economies of scale. We believe that the experience we have gained from past acquisitions has made
us proficient on systems conversions.

Merchant Processing Industry Matters

On June 5, 2003, MasterCard and VISA announced that they
have settled the class-action antitrust lawsuit which was filed by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Sears, Roebuck and Co. and other merchants against MasterCard and VISA. This lawsuit began in 1996 when a group of merchants sued MasterCard and VISA over their
signature debit interchange rates and policies on merchant card acceptance, which is commonly known in the industry as the “honor all cards” rule. The settlement included damages to be paid to certain merchants, lower signature debit
interchange rates and modification of card acceptance policies, so that merchants are no longer required to accept VISA and MasterCard signature based, offline debit cards as a condition for accepting VISA and MasterCard credit cards. Due to the
policy changes on cards merchants can choose to accept and consumers’ preference for higher security, we believe that this settlement may result in an increase in Personal Identification Number, or PIN-based debit usage. Although it is
difficult to determine the impact of this settlement on Global Payments, we do not expect this to have a significant negative impact on our future growth.

Business Description

Global Payments Inc., or Global Payments, is a high volume processor of electronic transactions and related money transfers that principally enables
consumers, corporations, government agencies and other profit and non-profit business enterprises to purchase goods and services or further other economic goals. Our role is to serve as an intermediary in the exchange of information and funds that
must occur between the necessary parties such that a transaction can be completed. Including our time as part of National Data Corporation, now known as NDCHealth, or NDC, we have provided transaction processing services since 1968. During that
period, we have expanded our business to include debit card, business-to-business purchasing card, check guarantee, check verification and recovery, and terminal management services, which we collectively include as a component of our merchant
service offerings. In addition, we provide funds transfer services to domestic and international financial institutions, corporations, and government agencies in the United States, Canada, and Europe. We were incorporated in Georgia as Global
Payments Inc. in September 2000.

We operate in one business
segment, electronic transaction processing, and provide products and services through our merchant services and funds transfer offerings. We provide our products and services to merchant customers in many vertical industries including government,
professional services, restaurant, universities, utilities, gaming, retail and health care.

Total revenues from our merchant service and funds transfer customers are as follows:

Merchant Services

Our merchant services offerings provides merchants and financial
institutions with credit and debit card transaction processing, check guarantee, check verification and recovery services. We are primarily the intermediary between the merchant and the card associations and debit networks or individual financial
institutions. Our value added services allow us to leverage our scale to concentrate high volume transactions for



Index to Financial Statements

many merchant customers to access the card associations and debit networks at a significantly lower cost. Our check products offer merchant customers risk
management, in the case of verification and recovery, or risk elimination, in the case of guarantee, by leveraging our vast database of checkwriters to help decide whether the merchant should accept a check as the form of payment from a particular
checkwriter.

Credit and Debit Card Transaction Processing

Credit and debit card transaction processing includes
business-to-business purchasing card, private label, gift and loyalty card and electronic benefits transfer program processing. Credit and debit card processing describes a consumer acquiring goods or services from a retail location, whereas
business-to-business card processing refers to a corporate purchasing department acquiring goods, such as office supplies or raw materials, from a corporate vendor.

Although card transactions may appear simplistic, a transaction requires a complex process involving various participants in
a series of electronic connections. Aside from electronic transaction processors, also known as merchant acquirers, such as Global Payments, participants in this process include card issuers, merchants, cardholders, and card associations. Card
issuers are financial institutions that issue credit cards to approved applicants and are identifiable by their trade name typically imprinted on the issued cards. The term merchant generally refers to any organization that accepts credit or debit
cards for the payment of goods and services, such as retail stores, restaurants, corporate purchasing departments, universities, and government agencies.

An approved applicant for a credit card from a card issuer is referred to as a cardholder, and may be any entity for which an issuer wishes to extend a
line of credit, such as a consumer, corporation, or government agency. The cardholder may use the card at any merchant location that meets the qualification standards of the card associations, known as MasterCard and VISA, or other card issuers such
as American Express, Discover, Diners Club and debit networks such as STAR, NYCE, and PULSE in the United States and Interac in Canada. Debit cards payments differ slightly from traditional credit card transactions in that the cardholder is required
to have sufficient funds available in a deposit account at the time of the transaction, or the debit card transaction will not be authorized. PIN-based or online debit transactions are sent through a debit network, while signature-based, offline
debit, or check card transactions are sent through card associations and require a signature at the time of purchase. Also, PIN-based or online debit transactions deduct the purchase amount from the cardholder’s deposit account within a day of
the purchase, depending on the time of the purchase. Signature-based, offline debit, or check card transactions typically debit the cardholder’s deposit account two to three days after the purchase, although the funds are “held” with
a memo posted to the cardholder’s bank account. A credit card posts to a cardholders account, reducing the available credit limit in a similar manner.

The card associations and debit networks consist of members, generally financial institutions, who establish uniform regulations that govern much of the
industry. During a typical card transaction, the merchant and the card issuer do not interface directly with each other, but instead rely on electronic transaction processor intermediaries, such as Global Payments, and card associations to exchange
the required information and funds. Credit card and debit card transactions account for approximately 81% and 19%, respectively, in the United States, and 34% and 66%, respectively, in Canada, of our total transactions processed. We perform a series
of services including authorization, electronic draft capture, funds settlement and certain exception-based, back office support services such as chargeback and retrieval resolution. The following is a more detailed description of credit and debit
card transactions:

A card transaction begins when a cardholder
presents a card for payment at a merchant location and the merchant swipes the card’s magnetic strip through a point of sale, or POS, terminal card reader, which may be provided by Global Payments through our terminal management offering. For a
credit card transaction, authorization services generally refer to the process whereby the card issuer indicates whether a particular credit card is authentic and whether the impending transaction value will cause the cardholder to exceed a defined
limit. The terminal electronically records sales draft information, such as the credit card identification number, transaction date, and dollar value of the goods or services purchased. In a PIN-based debit transaction, the terminal records the card
number, PIN and dollar value of the purchase.



Index to Financial Statements

After a card is swiped, the terminal automatically dials a pre-programmed phone number connected to our
network in order to receive authorization of the transaction. We route the request to the applicable card association or debit network. The card association or debit network forwards the authorization request to the card issuer, who determines a
response based on the status of the cardholder’s account. The response is returned to the merchant’s terminal via the same communication network. This entire authorization and response process occurs within seconds from the time the
merchant swipes the cardholder’s card through the point of sale terminal card reader.

Electronic draft capture is the process of transferring sales draft data into electronic format so that it may be sent through networks for clearing and settlement. The card associations use either a system known as
interchange, in the case of credit cards, or the debit networks in the case of debit cards, to transfer the information and funds between the card issuers and us to complete the link between merchants and card issuers.

Funds settlement refers to the process of transferring funds for sales and
credits between cardholders and card issuers, including the final debiting of a cardholder’s account and crediting of a merchant’s account for a sales transaction. Depending on the type of transaction, either the interchange system or the
debit networks are used to transfer the information and funds between electronic transaction processors and card issuers, and complete the link between merchants and card issuers. We use our network telecommunication infrastructure and the Federal
Reserve’s Automated Clearing House system, or ACH in the United States and the Automated Clearing Settlement System, and the Large Value Transfer System, both in Canada, to ensure that our merchants receive the proper funds due to them for the
value of the goods or services that the cardholder purchased. In the United States, merchant funding primarily occurs after we receive the funds from the card issuer. This business model differs from the business model followed in Canada, where we
advance payment to merchants for credit and debit card transactions before receiving the interchange or debit transaction reimbursement from the card issuers. Each participant in the transaction process receives compensation for their services. As
an illustration, on a $100.00 credit card or offline debit transaction, the card issuer may fund us $98.50 retaining approximately $1.50 referred to as an interchange fee. We would, in turn, pay the merchant $100.00 and pay assessment fees to the
card association of approximately $0.10. After the end of the month, we would bill the merchant a percentage of the transaction, or discount, to cover the full amount of the interchange fee, assessment fee and our net revenue from the transaction.
If our net revenue from the merchant in the above example was 40 basis points, we would bill the merchant $2.00 at the end of the month for the transaction, reimburse ourselves for approximately $1.60 in interchange and assessment fees and retain
$0.40 as our net revenue for the transaction. For a PIN-based debit card transaction, a rate per transaction is charged which includes our fee and debit network fees. The card issuer seeks reimbursement of $100.00 from the cardholder in the form of
a monthly credit card bill or charging the cardholders bank account in the case of a debit card transaction.

In addition to the card processing services described above, we also process retrieval requests on behalf of merchants for issuing banks and portfolios
and provide chargeback resolution services, both of which relate to cardholders disputing an amount that has been charged to their credit card. We review the dispute and handle the related exchange of information and funds between the merchant and
the card issuer if a charge is to be reversed.

Our merchant
accounting services provide information primarily for our financial institution customers to monitor portfolio performance, control expenses, disseminate information, and track profitability through the production and distribution of detailed
statements summarizing electronic transaction processing activity. Our risk management services allow financial institutions and independent sales organizations, or ISOs, to monitor credit risk, thereby enhancing the profitability of their merchant
portfolios. Our risk management services include credit underwriting, credit scoring, fraud control, account processing, and collections. We also provide our customers with various support services, such as working with merchants to set-up their
credit card programs or resolving issues relating to their terminal card readers.

Check Guarantee Services

Check guarantee
services include comprehensive check verification and guarantee services designed for a merchant’s specific needs and risk adversity. Since this service offering guarantees payment of all checks that are



Index to Financial Statements

electronically verified (primarily using point-of-sale check readers) through our extensive database, merchants may safely expand their revenue base by
applying less stringent requirements when accepting checks from consumers. If a verified check is dishonored, our check guarantee service generally provides the merchant with reimbursement of the check’s face value, and then pursues collection
of the check through our internal collection services. To protect against this risk, we use verification databases that contain information on historical delinquent check writing activity and up-to-date consumer bank account status. We derive
revenue for these services primarily by charging the merchant a percentage of the face value of each guaranteed check.

In the specialized vertical market of gaming, our VIP Preferred proprietary software provides the gaming industry with the tools necessary to establish
revolving check cashing limits for the casinos’ customers. Because VIP Preferred cardholders have fast access to cash with high limits, gaming establishments can increase money to their floor and eliminate associated risk because transactions
are 100 percent guaranteed. We also offer an electronic check option, VIP Preferred e-Check, which eliminates the need for paper checks as part of the VIP Preferred suite of products.

Check Verification and Recovery Services

Check verification and recovery services are similar to those provided in the check guarantee service, except that this service does not guarantee payment
of the verified checks. This service provides a low-cost, loss-reduction solution for merchants wishing to quickly measure a customer’s check worthiness at the point of sale, while not having to incur the additional expense of check guarantee
services. We derive revenue for these services primarily from the service fees collected from delinquent check writers, fees charged to merchants based on a transaction rate per verified check, and fees charged to merchants for specialized services,
such as electronic re-deposits of dishonored checks.

Our
terminal management offering provides a variety of products and services relating to electronic transaction processing equipment, such as terminal programming and deployment, set-up and telephone training, maintenance and equipment replacement,
warehousing and inventory control, customer service and technical support, customized reporting, and conversions. We provide these services directly to our own portfolio of merchants to support our credit and debit card transaction processing, check
guarantee and check verification and recovery services, as well as, indirectly to merchants on behalf of our financial institution and independent sales organization customers. We derive revenue from equipment sales and rentals, programming and
deployment fees, and repairs and maintenance services.

Funds Transfer

Our electronic funds transfer product and service
offerings include a wide variety of services such as financial electronic data interchange, or EDI, account balance reporting, management information and deposit reporting. These products and services provide financial, management and operational
data to financial institutions, corporations and government agencies worldwide and allow these organizations to exchange the information with financial institutions and other service providers. We also provide EDI tax filing and Internet tax payment
services that allow financial institutions and government agencies to offer corporate taxpayers a secure and convenient method of paying taxes electronically. Tax payment security is handled through both SSL encryption/decryption and multi-level
password access and operates through a web site that serves as the portal for securely receiving tax information and delivering the transaction for payment.

Sales and Marketing

We offer end-to-end services, which means that we believe we have the ability to fulfill all of our customers’ needs with respect to merchant
services and funds transfer offerings. We market our services through a variety of sales channels that includes a large, dedicated sales force, independent sales organizations, independent sales representatives, an internal telesales group, trade
associations, alliance and agent bank relationships, and financial institutions.



Index to Financial Statements

In addition to receiving referrals from approximately 1,800 bank branch locations in Canada, we have
affiliations with more than 200 organizations, including financial institutions and trade associations, and approximately 300 Certified Application Providers, or CAPs, in the United States that provide sales leads. Additionally, we market directly
to customers through print advertising and direct mail efforts. We also participate in major industry tradeshow and publicity events and actively employ various public relations campaigns. We pursue this strategy in an attempt to utilize the lowest
delivery cost system available to successfully acquire target customers.

We market our products and services throughout the United States, Canada and Europe. For a discussion of revenues in the United States, Canada and Europe for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, see
Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

We
have two basic business models we use to market our products and services. In one model, which we refer to as “direct” merchant services, we have a salaried and commissioned sales force and ISOs which sell our end-to-end services directly
to merchants. In the other model, which we refer to as “indirect” merchant services, we provide unbundled products and services primarily to financial institutions that in turn resell our products and their services to their merchants.

For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2003, approximately 83% of
our revenue arose from direct merchant services and 15% arose from indirect merchant services, while the remaining 2% arose from our funds transfer service offering. Direct revenue is generated on services primarily priced as a percentage of
transaction value, whereas indirect and funds transfer revenue is generated on merchants charged a specified amount per transaction. We also charge for other processing fees, unrelated to the number of transactions or the transaction value.

Employees

As of June 30, 2003, we and our subsidiaries had approximately 1,700
employees. Many of our employees are highly skilled in technical areas specific to electronic transaction processing, and we believe that our current and future operations depend substantially on retaining these employees.

Competition

Our primary competitors in the electronic transaction processing industry include other independent processors, as well as
major national and regional financial institution processors and ISOs. Certain of these companies are privately held, and the majority of those that are publicly held do not release the information necessary to precisely quantify our relative
competitive position. As an independent processor, our principal affiliation with financial institutions relates to the sponsorship that enables our access to the card associations and debit networks. We believe an independent processor will tend to
be a merchant customer advocate, as there is no other relationship with a card issuing business or cardholder customer service, as a financial institution. Also, a financial institution processor sales channel is primarily based on referrals with in
the institution, to further leverage a customer relationship, an independent processor or ISO will tend to be focused on sales from all channels, including internally generated leads. Finally, a financial institution processor may not have the same
executive focus on a merchant services business, as the business is not core to the total revenues of the financial institution. We primarily differ from ISOs in that we have our own platform and financial institution sponsorship agreements.

Based on industry publications such

The Nilson Report

,
dated March 2003, we are a leading, mid-market merchant acquirer in the United States. According to that report, one of our competitors, First Data Corporation and its affiliates, is the largest electronic transaction processor in the United States.
In April 2003, First Data Corporation announced a definitive agreement to merge with Concord EFS, Inc. The merger is currently under review by antitrust authorities and if approved, the combined companies, excluding VISA and MasterCard, would result
in the largest market share of electronic transaction processing and network ownership in the United States. Although the consummation of this merger would increase the size of the largest competitor in the



Index to Financial Statements

merchant processing industry, this merger may present us and other merchant processors with additional opportunities. This merger should not directly impact
us as we focus on the mid-market merchant segment in the United States and we do not own a debit network, whereas these competitors focus on larger market merchants and own debit networks.

Our primary competitor in Canada is Moneris Solutions, which we believe has a
slightly larger share of the Canadian electronic transaction market than we do. Moneris Solutions is a joint investment of the Royal Bank of Canada and the Bank of Montreal. However, we believe that we are the largest, publicly traded independent
processor in Canada.

The most significant competitive factors
related to our product and services include customer service, quality, value-added features, functionality, price, reliability, the breadth and effectiveness of our distribution channel, and the manner in which we deliver our services. While we
service all industry segments, we specialize in the mid-market segment in the United States and the large market segment in Canada. We define mid-market as a merchant with an average of $250 thousand to $300 thousand in annual VISA and/or MasterCard
volume. These competitive factors will continue to change as new distribution channels and alternative payment solutions are developed by our competitors and us.

Our primary strategy to distinguish ourselves from our competitors focuses on offering a variety of electronic transaction
processing payment solutions to our customers. These enhanced services involve vertical market and sophisticated reporting features that add value to the information obtained from our electronic transaction processing databases. We believe that our
knowledge of these specific markets, the size and effectiveness of our dedicated sales force, affiliations with trade associations, agent banks and CAPs, our ability to offer specific, integrated solutions to our customers, including hardware,
software, processing, and network facilities, and our flexibility in packaging these products are positive factors that enhance our competitive position.

Industry Overview and Target Markets

We believe that significant opportunities exist for continued growth in the application of transaction processing services to the electronic commerce
market. Although a large percentage of retail transactions still utilize cash, merchants encourage electronically authorized and settled transactions using credit and debit cards as a more efficient means of transacting business with their
customers.

The rapid growth of retail credit card
transactions, as well as the increased utilization of debit cards, directly correlates with the historic growth of our business. In the United States, total consumer spending is expected to continue to increase, together with an increase in the
percentage of consumers using forms of payment other than cash and checks (i.e., credit and debit cards and other electronic means). Based on

The Nilson Report

dated April 2003, we believe that more than $2.1 trillion of annual consumer
spending is charged using VISA and MasterCard. In Canada, we expect to benefit from similar consumer spending trends. Based on

The Nilson Report

dated July 2003, we also believe that over $157 billion (U.S.) of annual Canadian consumer
spending uses VISA, MasterCard or debit as the form of payment.

Payment processing service providers, such as Global Payments, provide high volume electronic transaction processing and support services directly to banking institutions and to new entrants into the business. The shift in the industry from
traditional financial institution providers to independent providers is due in large part to more efficient distribution channels, as well as increased technological capabilities required for the rapid and efficient creation, processing, handling,
storage, and retrieval of information. These capabilities have become increasingly complex, requiring significant capital commitments to develop, maintain, and update the systems necessary to provide these advanced services at a competitive price.

As a result of the continued growth in our industry, several
large merchant processors, including us, have expanded operations through the creation of alliances or joint ventures with banks and have acquired new merchant portfolios from banks that previously serviced these merchant accounts.



Index to Financial Statements

We believe that the proliferation of “loyalty” or co-branded cards that provide consumers with
added benefits for card use should contribute to increased use of credit and debit cards in the future. Additionally, as merchants and consumers continue to use electronic commerce as a means to purchase goods and services, both the
consumer-to-business and business-to-business aspects of electronic commerce will demand a growing array of transaction processing and support services. We currently provide complete processing capabilities for major credit cards, co-branded credit
cards, debit cards and purchasing cards and are continuing to research services to compliment new technology and demand.

Business-to-business electronic data interchange using purchasing card technology and associated systems software provides businesses with increased
efficiency and us with strong growth in industries that have not traditionally utilized credit cards. Purchasing cards and the related business-to-business electronic data interchange replace the costly, time-consuming paper ordering and invoicing
with inexpensive, real-time electronic payment processing transactions.

VISA has recently announced that they will begin offering cards containing chip technology in Canada. Chip technology can securely store and encrypt confidential information. The chip is virtually impossible to copy and has the power to be
programmed with spending and usage limits making it possible to authorize transactions off-line. Chip technology will enable a host of additional features including a choice of applications such as loyalty, access control, rewards, and public
transit passes. This complex project to offer chip technology in the Canadian marketplace is expected to take up to seven years for all participants to implement the equipment necessary to accept and process the chip card compliant transactions. We
have been working to develop a long-term plan to ensure our merchants will benefit from the migration to chip technology in the Canadian market.

We believe that the number of electronic transactions will continue to grow in the future and that an increasing percentage of these transactions will be
processed through emerging technologies, such as wireless payment products, stored value cards and other custom payment solutions. We have focused on bringing niche wireless POS products and services into the mainstream. Today, we offer products
that meet the needs of fixed location, portable and mobile merchants. We have also participated in multiple wireless payment card pilots, also known as Radio Frequency Identification, RFID or contact less payment card pilots, designed to decrease
consumer checkout time allowing our merchants to service more customers and process more transactions. We continue our development of a new electronic check system, which the industry sometimes refers to as check truncation or conversion, designed
to further reduce our customer’s paper handling cost by converting paper checks into an electronic ACH file transaction. In anticipation of the growing demand for Internet communications by traditional merchants we are focused on developing new
and secure solutions. These emerging technologies will be a major factor in accelerating the continued conversion from paper transaction processing to electronic transaction processing, which will result in greater growth opportunities for our
business.

Strategy

Our business strategy centers on providing a full range of electronic
transaction processing services in our existing markets and expanding into new markets through customer service, products and services, strategic acquisitions and new relationships with trade associations and agent banks. We believe that this
strategy provides us with the greatest opportunity for leveraging our existing infrastructure and maintaining a consistent base of recurring revenues. We believe that the electronic commerce market presents additional attractive opportunities for
continued growth. In pursuing our business strategy, we seek to increase our penetration of existing markets, to continue to identify and create new markets, such as the electronic commerce market, and to further leverage our infrastructure through
the following:

•

providing the best possible customer service by investing in technology, training and product enhancements;

•

expanding distribution channels, primarily direct merchant services, ISOs, and CAPs;

•

growing our domestic and Canadian market share by concentrating on the mid-market segment in the United States and on the small and mid-market segment in Canada;



Index to Financial Statements

•

providing the latest, secure, enhanced products and services by developing value-added applications, enhancing existing products, and developing new systems and services to blend
technology with our customer needs;

•

continuing systems integrations, primarily consolidation of operating platforms and implementation of cost reduction initiatives; and

•

focusing on potential acquisitions, investments and alliances with companies that have compatible products, services, development capabilities and distribution capabilities in the
direct card business (domestic and international).

Banking
Regulations

Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, or CIBC,
owns 26.3% of our common stock outstanding. As a result of CIBC’s equity interest in our company, we are considered a subsidiary of CIBC for U.S. bank regulatory purposes. CIBC is a Canadian Bank with operations in the United States.
Accordingly, CIBC is regulated in the U.S. as a foreign bank and, as a result, is subject to most of the same limitations as a U.S. bank holding company under provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act. As a subsidiary of CIBC for U.S. bank
regulatory purposes, we are subject to those same regulations. We are also subject to examination by the Federal Reserve Board. As a general matter, we are able to operate our merchant services and funds transfer businesses as we have historically,
but our ability to expand into unrelated businesses may be limited unless they are activities that the Bank Holding Company Act allows or the Federal Reserve Board approves.

Bank holding companies may engage in the business of banking, managing and controlling banks, and in other activities so
closely related to managing and controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, enacted in 1999, amended the Bank Holding Company Act to allow greater operational flexibility for bank holding companies that are
well-capitalized, well-managed and meet certain other conditions. Such companies are referred to as “financial holding companies.” Financial holding companies may engage in activities that are financial in nature, or that are incidental or
complimentary to financial activities. The legislation defines securities and insurance activities as being permissible financial activities, allows certain merchant banking activities, and establishes a procedure for the Federal Reserve Board,
together with the U.S. Treasury Department, to announce additional permissible activities.

As a foreign bank, CIBC may qualify for financial holding company status and has done so. If a financial holding company falls out of compliance with the well-managed, well-capitalized, community reinvestment
requirements, it must enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve to rectify the situation. The Federal Reserve may refuse to allow the financial holding company, which would include its subsidiaries, to engage in new “financial”
activities; may require it to cease current “financial” activities; and may require it to divest its bank.

The merchant services and funds transfer businesses that we conduct are permissible activities for bank holding companies (as well as financial holding
companies) under U.S. law, and we do not expect the limitations described above to adversely affect our current operations. It is possible, however, that these restrictions might limit our ability to enter other businesses that we may wish to engage
in at some time in the future. It is also possible that these laws may be amended in the future, or new laws or regulations adopted, that adversely affect our ability to engage in our current or additional businesses.

Additionally, CIBC is subject to the

Bank Act

(Canada), which, among
other things, limits the types of business which CIBC may conduct, directly or indirectly, and the types of investments which CIBC may make. CIBC’s shareholding in our company is currently permitted under the

Bank Act.

The

Bank
Act

, except as we have discussed, does not otherwise apply to us.

Under the

Bank Act

, CIBC is permitted to continue to hold its interest in us, as long as the business undertaken by us is consistent with the applicable provisions of the

Bank Act

. If we undertake businesses inconsistent with
the businesses in which CIBC is permitted to hold an interest, CIBC may be required, pursuant to the provisions of the

Bank Act

, to dispose of its shares prior to the expiration of the restrictions on re-sale that we have negotiated with
CIBC.



Index to Financial Statements

We have agreed with CIBC, in effect, that we will not undertake any business inconsistent with the
applicable provisions of the

Bank Act.

We do not anticipate that compliance with this undertaking will affect, in any material way, our ability to carry on the merchant services and funds transfer businesses. Our ability to expand into other
businesses will be governed by the undertaking and the applicable provisions of Canadian banking legislation at the relevant time. There is no assurance that subsequent amendments to the

Bank Act

will not adversely affect our ability to carry
on our business in some respects.

ITEM 2—PROPERTIES

Our
corporate headquarters are located at Four Corporate Square in Atlanta, Georgia, where we lease from NDC a five-story, 85,000 square foot building. This lease expires in January 2004 unless extended prior to that time. We are currently negotiating
an extension of this lease. Our merchant acquiring business back-office and customer service operation is located in a 105,000 square foot facility that we lease in Owings Mills, Maryland. In addition, we lease a total of 27 other facilities in the
United States, one in Peterborough, United Kingdom, two in Toronto, Canada, and eight others throughout the rest of Canada. We own or lease a variety of computers and other related equipment for our operational needs. We continue to upgrade and
expand our computers and related equipment in order to increase efficiency, enhance reliability, and provide the necessary base for business expansion.

We believe that all of our facilities and equipment are suitable and adequate for our business as presently conducted.

ITEM 3—LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We
are party to a number of claims and lawsuits incidental to the normal course of our business. In our opinion, the ultimate outcome of such matters, in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, liquidity or
results of operations. For additional information, refer to Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Forward-Looking Results of Operations—Airlines.

—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” appearing elsewhere in this report.

General

We are a leading mid-market merchant acquirer in the United States, and the largest, publicly traded independent VISA and
MasterCard acquirer in Canada. We provide a wide range of end-to-end electronic transaction processing solutions to merchants, corporations, financial institutions and government agencies. Our products and services are marketed through a variety of
distinct sales channels that include a large, dedicated direct sales force, independent sales organizations, independent sales representatives, an internal telesales group, trade associations, alliance bank relationships and financial institutions.

We operate in one business segment, electronic transaction
processing, and provide products and services through our merchant services and funds transfer offerings. Approximately 98% of our current revenue base is from merchant services offerings. The remaining 2% of our total revenue is from our funds
transfer service offerings.

Merchant services include credit
and debit card transaction processing, business-to-business purchase card transaction processing, check guarantee, check verification and recovery, and terminal management services. We have two basic business models. In one model, which we refer to
as “direct” merchant services, we have a salaried and commissioned sales force and independent sales organizations, or ISOs, that sell our end-to-end services directly to merchants. In the other model, which we refer to as
“indirect” merchant services, we provide unbundled products and services primarily to financial institutions that in turn resell to their merchants. Approximately 83% of our total revenue arose from direct merchant services and 15% arose
from indirect merchant services.

Components of Income Statement

We derive our revenues from three primary sources:
charges based on volumes and fees for merchant services; charges based on transaction quantity; and equipment sales, leases and service fees. Revenues generated by these areas depend upon a number of factors, such as demand for and price of our
services, the technological competitiveness of our product offerings, our reputation for providing timely and reliable service, competition within our industry, and general economic conditions.

Cost of service consists primarily of: the cost of network telecommunications
capability; transaction processing systems; depreciation and occupancy costs associated with the facilities performing these functions; and provisions for operating losses.

Sales, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales
personnel; non-revenue producing customer support functions and administrative employees and



Index to Financial Statements

management; commissions to independent contractors and ISOs; advertising costs; other selling expenses; employee training costs; and occupancy of leased
space directly related to these functions.

Other income and
expense primarily consists of minority interest in earnings, interest income and expense and other miscellaneous items of income and expense.

Results of Operations

Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2003 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2002

In fiscal 2003, revenue increased $53.3 million or 12% to $516.1 million from $462.8 million in fiscal 2002. Revenue growth is primarily driven by the
growth in our direct merchant service offering in the United States and Canada. Excluding the impact of the National Bank portfolio acquisition that annualized in October 2002, and a stronger Canadian dollar relative to the prior year, our full year
revenue growth is approximately 8%. Domestically, our direct card transactions growth ranged in the mid-teens which compares favorably to market trends of 12% for credit and debit card growth per

The Nilson Report

dated March 2003. We believe
our transaction growth rates compared to the market trends, demonstrate that we continue to gain market share in both our domestic direct and ISO sales channels. Consistent with our domestic direct sales strategy, we continue to focus on ongoing
revenue growth by signing mid-market merchants in various vertical markets to maintain our diversification. Our domestic direct sales force successfully signs thousands of mid-market merchants each quarter. In addition, our domestic average dollar
value of transaction and net revenue per transaction have remained stable for the year, which we believe is a result of our diversified mid-market segmentation. The number of Canadian transactions continued to grow this year in the mid to high
single digits. In addition, our Canadian average dollar value of transaction and net revenue per transaction have held relatively constant as we continue to further penetrate the Canadian market and successfully cross-sell between our VISA and
MasterCard portfolios. Historically, the transaction growth in Canada is slower than our domestic transaction growth due to the maturity of the Canadian market. However, the revenue impact of slower Canada transaction growth in fiscal 2003 was
slightly offset by the change in foreign exchange rates.

Our
direct merchant service revenue growth is partially offset by expected declines in the mid-teens of our indirect and funds transfer businesses. The decline in revenue from indirect merchant services is primarily a result of the consolidating
financial institution market. Revenue from the funds transfer business declined 10% to $12.3 million in fiscal 2003, compared to $13.7 million in fiscal 2002, partially due to the consolidation of our UK operations and discontinuance of new business
development activities through our UK operations, previously announced during our fiscal 2002 fourth quarter. We also eliminated non-recurring product revenue from our funds transfer business.

Cost of service increased by $8.2 million or 3% from $252.1 million in fiscal
2002 to $260.3 million in fiscal 2003. As a percentage of revenue, cost of service decreased to 50% in fiscal 2003 from 54% in fiscal 2002. This decrease in cost of service as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to the integration of our recent
acquisitions and the implementation of cost reduction initiatives, including facility consolidations.

The increase in cost of service expenses for fiscal 2003 from the prior year’s comparable period is primarily due to variable direct costs associated
with the revenue increase, an increase in our provision for operating losses and non-recurring conversion costs, such as duplicate labor, relating to the National Bank back-end conversion, completed in early October 2002. The increase in provision
for operating losses in fiscal 2003 was a result of the increase in credit and debit card volumes processed and losses associated with merchant fraud.

Sales, general and administrative expenses increased $33.0 million or 26% to $161.3 million in fiscal 2003 from $128.3 million in the prior year’s
comparable period. As a percentage of revenue, these expenses increased to 31% for fiscal 2003, compared to 28% for fiscal 2002.

The increase in sales, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2003, compared to the prior year comparable period is due to growth in commission
payments to ISOs and the higher level of sales infrastructure and related costs to grow revenue. The increase in sales, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of



Index to Financial Statements

revenue is due to the increase in ISO related commission payments. The ISO business generally produces lower margins than the other direct business due to
the ongoing commission payments to the ISOs.

During the fourth
quarter fiscal 2003, we initiated the closure and consolidation of three operating facilities and their related functions into existing operating centers. We implemented the plan in April 2003 and expect to complete it by the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2004. Our facility closure plan includes the following:

•

closing our Cleveland merchant settlement function and consolidating it to our Baltimore facility;

•

relocating our terminal deployment and related services from our Winston-Salem facility to our Baltimore and St. Louis facilities; and

•

relocating our Salt Lake City check operation to our primary check operating facility in Niles, Illinois.

We anticipate total costs and expenses associated with the plan to be approximately $8 million. One-time employee
termination benefits will be approximately $4 million and the balance relates to contract termination and other related facility closure costs and expenses. The fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2003 results included a net restructuring charge of
$1.3 million related to the consolidation plan. Accordingly, we expect approximately $6.5 million to be incurred during fiscal 2004 related to these activities.

During fiscal 2002, we incurred restructuring and other charges of $11.0 million. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we completed plans for the
closing of four locations including associated management and staff reductions. Of the $11.0 million in charges, $1.5 million related to facility closing costs; $6.7 million related to severance and related costs; and $2.8 million related to other
costs. See Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this report for more details on the restructuring and other charges incurred in both fiscal years ended and the charges expected to be incurred during fiscal
2004.

Operating income is $93.3 million for fiscal 2003,
compared to $71.4 million in the prior year’s comparable period. This resulted in an increase in operating margin from 15.4% for fiscal 2002 to 18.1% for fiscal 2003. This operating income and related operating margin reflects restructuring and
other charges of $1.3 million and $11.0 million in fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively. The changes in operating income and operating margins are due to the revenue and cost factors described above. The fixed cost nature of the business resulted in
higher income in fiscal 2003 than in fiscal 2002.

In fiscal
2002, we recorded a charge of $16.0 million, net of tax, for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to an indefinite life intangible asset, a trademark, with a carrying value of $24.6 million at June 1, 2001. The trademark
was acquired on April 1, 1996 with the purchase of 92.5% ownership interest in MasterCard International’s Merchant Automated Point-of-Sale Program, or MAPP. The value of the trademark related to the use of the MAPP name and logo. In connection
with the spin-off from NDC, we launched a rebranding effort under the Global Payments Inc. name and logo. In addition, effective June 1, 2001, we purchased MasterCard’s remaining minority interest, ending all existing marketing alliances with
MasterCard, and conducted a study related to the future use of the trademark. In fiscal 2002, we completed an appraisal with an independent valuation firm of the fair value of the trademark as of June 1, 2001, the implementation date of SFAS No.
142. Based on the lack of continuing use of the MAPP trademark as of June 1, 2001, the fair value of the trademark was determined to be zero. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, the $24.6 million ($16.0 million, net of tax, or $0.42 diluted earnings
per share) was written off as of June 1, 2001 and was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.

Net income increased $29.5 million or 124% to $53.3 million in fiscal 2003 from $23.8 million in the prior year’s comparable period, resulting in a
$0.78 increase in diluted earnings per share to $1.41 from $0.63. This net income and diluted earnings per share reflects restructuring and other charges, net of tax, of $0.8 million or $0.02 diluted earnings per share and $6.8 million or $0.18
diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively. Also, net income for fiscal 2003 is comparable to income before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in fiscal 2002, since there were no changes in accounting
principle recorded in fiscal 2003. Our effective tax rate was 37.4% in fiscal 2003 as compared to 38.2% in fiscal 2002, as a result of the impact of our acquisitions and tax planning initiatives. For fiscal 2004, we continue to plan for a 37.4% tax
rate.



Index to Financial Statements

Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2002 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2001

In fiscal 2002, revenue increased $109.6 million or 31% to $462.8 million
from $353.2 million in fiscal 2001. The increase in revenue was primarily due to the CIBC, Imperial Bank, and National Bank portfolio acquisitions as well as continued growth in our direct merchant services business. Our ISO sales channel also
continued to be a strong contributor to revenue, while revenues from our indirect merchant services and funds transfer declined as forecasted. The growth in direct merchant card services revenue was due primarily to our portfolio acquisitions, the
addition of new merchant relationships, including those added through our ISO relationships, and increased usage of credit cards and debit cards within our existing merchant customers. The decline in revenue from indirect merchant services was
primarily a result of the consolidating financial institution market. Funds transfer is a mature market and although we continue to service our existing customers we do not intend to invest in this area.

In fiscal 2001, we recorded approximately $13.9 million in non-recurring
revenue. We divested our card issuing business for cash consideration approximately equal to its net book value. The revenue from the card issuing business in fiscal 2001 was $2.9 million. In addition, we had $11.0 million of other non-recurring
revenue during fiscal 2001. We decided to significantly reduce our bulk terminal equipment sale business during the first quarter of fiscal 2002, which did not produce meaningful operating income. The revenue from the bulk terminal business
decreased by $4.0 million to $2.4 million in fiscal 2002 from $6.4 million in fiscal 2001. Further, we provided processing services during fiscal 2001 to CIBC and Imperial Bank for which, after the related portfolio acquisitions, we were no longer
able to record as revenue externally. The revenue recorded during fiscal 2001 from these institutions was approximately $1.3 million. We also recorded $5.7 million in non-recurring revenue from a limited number of customers, of which approximately
$2.5 million related to non-recurring chargeback services and $3.2 million related to our non-core domestic funds transfer business.

Cost of service increased by $59.7 million or 31% from $192.4 million in fiscal 2001 to $252.1 million in fiscal 2002. As a percentage of revenue, cost of
service remained unchanged from 54% in both fiscal 2002 and 2001. The increase in cost of service expenses was attributable to the inclusion of costs associated with CIBC’s and Imperial Bank’s merchant acquiring businesses, which we
acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, and National Bank’s merchant acquiring business, which we acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2002. In addition, cost of service increased in 2002 due to our provision for operating losses,
from $8.4 million in fiscal 2001 to $9.8 in fiscal 2002. The increase in operating losses in fiscal 2002 was a result of the increase in credit and debit card volumes processed and losses associated with merchant fraud.

On July 20, 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statements
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”

(“SFAS No. 142”). SFAS No. 142 eliminates the amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets and requires that goodwill be
evaluated for impairment by applying a fair value-based test. We adopted this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we discontinued the amortization of goodwill and certain intangible assets that were
determined to have an indefinite life. The cost of service increases were partially offset by a decrease associated with the adoption of SFAS No. 142, which lowered amortization expense by $7.4 million in fiscal 2002, and a decrease of $2.3 million
in other costs associated with the divested card issuing business in fiscal 2001.

Sales, general and administrative expenses increased $25.4 million or 25% to $128.3 million in fiscal 2002 from $102.9 million in fiscal 2001. As a percentage of revenue, these expenses decreased to 28% in fiscal
2002, compared to 29% in fiscal 2001. The increase in sales, general and administrative expenses was due to the higher level of sales infrastructure, personnel and related costs to grow revenue, the inclusion of merchant acquiring portfolio
acquisitions, growth in commission payments to ISOs, and the CIBC and Imperial Bank merchant acquiring portfolio back-end conversion costs, offset by a decrease of $0.7 million associated with the divested card issuing business in fiscal 2001. The
decrease in sales, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was due to a reduction of administrative costs related to the consolidation of business locations and acquisition integrations.



Index to Financial Statements

In fiscal 2002, we continued our efforts to streamline operations through office consolidations and
incurred restructuring and other charges of $11.0 million. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we completed plans for the closing of four locations including associated management and staff reductions. Of the $11.0 million in charges, $1.5
million related to facility closing costs; $6.7 million related to severance and related costs; and $2.8 million related to other costs. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, we incurred a $4.9 million restructuring charge related to office
consolidations and severance payments to terminated employees. See Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this report for more details on these restructuring and other charges.

Operating income increased $18.4 million or 35% to $71.4 million in fiscal
2002 from $53.0 million in fiscal 2001. This operating income reflects restructuring and other charges of $11.0 million and $4.9 million in fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in operating income and operating income margin was
attributable to synergies from our acquisition integration efforts, improvement due to the ISO sales channel growth and the reduction of administrative costs related to the consolidation of business locations. However, the improvements were
partially offset by the impact of the restructuring and other charges and the continued declines in our indirect merchant services and funds transfer businesses, discussed above.

Other expense, net decreased by $7.6 million or 52% to $7.0 million for fiscal 2002 from $14.6 million for fiscal 2001. This
decrease is primarily due to a one-time charge of $5.0 million in fiscal 2001 associated with the non-cash loss on an investment. We held a $5.0 million investment in eCharge Corporation, a private company that offers Internet users secure and
convenient ways to make purchases over the Internet. During the fourth quarter ended May 31, 2001, we completed an evaluation of this investment as it had experienced difficulty securing additional funding. As a result, we determined the carrying
value of the investment was not recoverable and recognized a loss on investment of $5.0 million in fiscal 2001. The balance of the decrease in net other expense was due to lower variable interest rates on our credit facilities in fiscal 2002 and the
buyout of the MasterCard minority interest in Global Payment Systems LLC effective June 1, 2001. Also, the decrease in outstanding balances on the credit facilities resulted in lower interest expense in fiscal 2002.

Income before a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle
increased $16.1 million or 68% to $39.8 million in fiscal 2002 from $23.7 million in fiscal 2001. This was due to improvements in income before tax, discussed above, and in part to a decrease in our effective tax rate from 38.5% during fiscal 2001
to 38.2% during fiscal 2002. The income before a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle includes the after-tax effect of the restructuring and other charges in fiscal 2002 and 2001 and the non-cash loss on the investment in fiscal
2001. The decreases in the tax rate were due in part to tax credits and the adoption of SFAS No. 142, discussed in Notes 1 and 6 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In fiscal 2002, we recorded a charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to an indefinite
life intangible asset, a trademark, with a carrying value of $24.6 million at June 1, 2001, that was determined to have no fair value. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, the $24.6 million ($16.0 million, net of tax, or $0.42 diluted earnings per
share) was written off as of June 1, 2001 and was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. See Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this report and Results of Operations for the
fiscal year ended May 31, 2003 compared to fiscal year ended May 31, 2002 above for more details.

Diluted earnings per share calculated on income before a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle increased 28% to $1.05 in fiscal 2002 from
$0.82 in fiscal 2001. The increase in earnings per share before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was due to an increase in income and was impacted by the additional shares outstanding as a result of the stock issued in
consideration of the purchase of CIBC’s merchant acquiring portfolio.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity to meet our needs. At May 31, 2003,
we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $38.0 million. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $124.9 million to $35.6 million for fiscal 2003 from $160.5 million for fiscal 2002. This decrease is primarily due to the impact of the
change in net merchant processing from cash provided by operating activities of $69.1 million in fiscal 2002 to cash used by operating activities of $89.3 million in fiscal 2003. The change in net merchant processing was primarily due to the change
in working capital associated with our Canadian merchant processing during the year ended May 31, 2003. Our Canadian credit facility was amended in December 2002 to provide our CIBC merchants in Canada with “same-day value”. Prior to this
amendment, CIBC provided the funding directly to support the same-day value practice. Since the amendment in December 2002, we are providing the merchants with same-day value, resulting in a net receivable balance due from the card associations. See
additional discussion under Credit Facilities below. Excluding the impact of the change in net merchant processing working capital from cash provided by operating activities, our cash flow growth is attributed to increases in our direct card
business, including the Canadian businesses. This cash flow growth also benefited from a favorable variance in deferred income taxes due to tax planning initiatives, and an increase in other non-cash operating items, such as provision for bad debt
and foreign currency translations adjustments.

Net cash used
in investing activities decreased $68.4 million to $19.1 million for fiscal 2003 from $87.5 million for fiscal 2002. This decrease was primarily due to a decline in business development activities relating to acquisitions in the year ending May 31,
2003, compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of any acquisitions in fiscal 2004, we expect approximately $15 million to $20 million in total capital spending, primarily related to continued office consolidations, systems infrastructure,
acquisition of Canadian merchant terminals and product development.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $2.3 million for fiscal 2003 compared to net cash used in financing activities of $59.8 million for fiscal 2002. During fiscal 2003, we paid the remaining $22.0 million on our line of credit
balance outstanding at May 31, 2002. However, we had borrowed at May 31, 2003, $33.9 million associated with our Canadian credit facility to support our merchant funding. We periodically use our lines of credit, reflecting the funding of timing
differences between merchant funding and receipts from card associations and the debit networks. See additional discussion under Credit Facilities below.

We believe that our current level of cash and borrowing capacity under our committed lines of credit described below, together with future cash flows from
operations, are sufficient to meet the needs of our existing operations and planned requirements for the foreseeable future. We currently do not have any material capital commitments, other than commitments under capital and operating leases or
planned expansions. We may develop our own hardware and software facilities for the transaction processing, cash management, file transfer and related communications functions in an effort to improve productivity and reduce cost of services. If
undertaken, this development would further increase our capital expenditures above historical levels.

We regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and acquisitions and we may elect to raise additional
funds for these purposes in the future, either through the issuance of debt, equity or otherwise. Our cash flow strategy has remained unchanged and is to first pay off debt arising from the timing of working capital needs, second to pursue accretive
acquisitions and third to continue to make capital investments in our business.

Credit Facilities

We have a commitment for a
$125 million revolving line of credit. It was initially used to fund the cash due to NDC to reflect our share of debt incurred by NDC prior to our spin-off to establish our initial capitalization. This line of credit is also available to meet
working capital needs and to finance acquisitions. This line has a variable interest rate based on market rates. The credit agreement contains certain financial and non-financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this
nature. The facility has a three-year term, expiring in January 2004. We are currently negotiating with the lender to extend the term of this facility. The full



Index to Financial Statements

amount outstanding is due upon demand and, therefore, we classify any amount outstanding as a current liability. As of May 31, 2002, we had $22.0 million
outstanding under this facility and no amounts outstanding at May 31, 2003.

On October 1, 2001, we obtained a commitment for a $25 million revolving credit facility to finance working capital needs and other general corporate purposes. This line has a variable interest rate based on market
rates. The credit agreement contains certain financial and non-financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this nature. The credit facility originally had a sixteen-month term, expiring in January 2003. Prior to its
expiration, we executed an amendment with the lender to extend the term of this facility for an additional twelve months through January 2004. At May 31, 2003 and May 31, 2002, there were no amounts outstanding on this credit facility.

We also have a credit facility from CIBC that provides a line of credit up
to $175 million (Canadian dollars), approximately $128 million U.S., with an additional overdraft facility available to cover larger advances during periods of peak usage of credit cards. This line has a variable interest rate based on market rates
and it contains certain financial and non-financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this nature. This line of credit is secured by a first priority security interest in our accounts receivable from VISA
Canada/International, and has been guaranteed by our subsidiaries. This guarantee is subordinate to our primary credit facility. On December 10, 2002, we executed a third amendment to this credit facility which extended the term of the facility for
an additional 364 days through December 9, 2003 and provided for the incurrence of interest costs in connection with offering merchants “same day value” for their deposits. Same day value, which has been an accepted industry practice in
Canada for more than ten years, is the practice of giving merchants same day value for their sales transactions, even though their deposits are made at a later date. Essentially, the merchant’s deposits are backdated to the date of the
applicable sales transaction. Under the terms of the credit agreement prior to the execution of the third amendment, CIBC credited the merchants’ deposit account for their sales transactions on the day of the transaction and we reimbursed CIBC
when we received the corresponding funding from the card association. At May 31, 2002, there were no amounts outstanding on this facility. At May 31, 2003, there were $46.3 million (Canadian dollars), or approximately $33.9 million U.S. outstanding
on this credit facility. This amount is included as of component of the net merchant processing receivable on the balance sheet. The amount borrowed is restricted in use to pay merchants and will be received from the card associations on the
following day.

Forward-Looking Results of Operations

During fiscal 2004, we intend to continue to focus on growing our domestic
and Canadian presence, build our ISO sales channel, increase customer satisfaction, assess opportunities for profitable acquisition growth, pursue enhanced products and services for our customers, and leverage our existing business model. Consistent
with this strategy, our expectation for fiscal 2004 revenue is $542 million to $562 million, or 5% to 9% growth, compared to $516 million in fiscal 2003. We expect net interest and other expense to approximate fiscal 2003 levels in fiscal 2004 and
minority interest will grow in fiscal 2004 at rates consistent with our overall earnings growth. Our expectation for fiscal 2004 diluted earnings per share is $1.57 to $1.64 or 10% to 15% growth, compared to diluted earnings per share of $1.43 in
fiscal 2003, excluding the impact of restructuring charges in both periods. The earnings per share target reflect our expectation of achieving operating margin of 19% to 19.5% in fiscal 2004, excluding the impact of restructuring charges. The
forward-looking statement in this Management Discussion and Analysis does not reflect the impact of potential acquisitions and acquisitions announced after May 31, 2003. We intend to provide revised guidance after the closing of any acquisitions
consummated in fiscal 2004.

Airlines

We currently process card transactions for Air Canada, the single largest
airline in Canada, which according to its Revised Renewal Annual Information Form, dated May 15, 2003, held approximately 60% of the Canadian domestic market share and approximately 43% of the Canadian transborder market share during the first
quarter of 2003. Our revenue from this relationship represents less than 1% of our consolidated revenue. On April 1, 2003, Air Canada filed for and obtained protection from the court under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement



Index to Financial Statements

Act, which generally allows a company to reorganize while it continues normal operations with the assistance of a court-appointed Monitor. It is our
understanding that the court order provides for a general stay that precludes its creditors and others from taking any action against Air Canada. The purpose of the stay is to provide Air Canada with relief designed to stabilize operations and
business relationships with customers, vendors, employees and creditors. The court order also provides that Air Canada shall honor all airline tickets in the usual and ordinary course of business.

In the event that Air Canada’s restructuring is not successful and it is
liquidated, there will likely be limited assets available from which to pay creditor claims. If the restructuring is not successful and any of Air Canada’s liability for deferred ticket revenues is unfunded and such charges are properly
reversed by VISA and MasterCard cardholders, we may be liable for such reversed charges under the chargeback rules of these card associations; for more details, refer to

Reserve for operating losses

under Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this report. According to the Eighth Report of the Monitor dated July 31, 2003, deferred ticket revenues for Air Canada as of June 30, 2003, representing advance ticket sales collected, were approximately
$566 million Canadian, or $420 million U.S., based on then existing exchange rates. In conjunction with the acquisition of the merchant acquiring business of CIBC in March 2001, CIBC agreed to reimburse us by the amount, if any, that Air
Canada’s VISA chargebacks and credit losses for any 12 month period exceed twice the level of VISA chargebacks and credit losses experienced during the one-year period ending October 31, 1999. This reimbursement obligation is scheduled to
expire on March 20, 2004. Based on an April 21, 2003 affidavit of M. Robert Peterson, Chief Financial Officer of Air Canada, it is our understanding that 80% of Air Canada customers elect to pay using credit cards and, of those credit card users,
29.3% use VISA cards and 8.4% use MasterCard cards. Therefore, based on the information contained in the affidavit of M. Robert Peterson, the information contained in Eighth Report of the Monitor, and taking into consideration CIBC’s
reimbursement obligations for Air Canada’s chargebacks and credit losses, we believe our maximum potential chargeback liability exposure relative to Air Canada as of June 30, 2003 is $38-$48 million Canadian, or $28-$35 million U.S., based on
existing exchange rates.

As a result of our exposure, we filed
a motion for court ordered protection for our chargeback liability exposure. The supervising judge dismissed our application on the basis that the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act does not provide protection to credit card processors for
this risk. We appealed the decision to the Court of Appeal (Ontario). The Court of Appeal upheld the supervising judge’s decision. As a consequence of the dismissal of our motion and appeal, we are compelled by court order to continue to
provide VISA card processing and MasterCard card processing in accordance with the ordinary course of the processing relationship as it existed immediately prior to Air Canada’s filing under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act.
However, effective June 1, 2003, we were permitted to collect our fee revenue daily (also known as daily discount) or as we process card transactions. This has significantly mitigated our exposure to potential losses from unpaid fees.

The VISA merchant processing agreement expires on April 30, 2005 and the
MasterCard merchant processing agreement expired on or about January 1, 1997. We intend to terminate the MasterCard processing relationship at the earliest opportunity. At this time, it is not clear when we will be able to terminate such processing
relationship.

We are continuing to closely monitor Air
Canada’s restructuring. Based on information currently available to us, which primarily consists of publicly available information, we believe a material loss is unlikely as long as Air Canada continues to honor all airline tickets in the
ordinary course of business and is not a factor in our guidance for fiscal year 2004.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies

In applying the accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements, we necessarily make accounting estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Some of these
accounting estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimates. We base these assumptions and the resulting estimates



Index to Financial Statements

on historical information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these assumptions and estimates on an
ongoing basis. However, in many instances we reasonably could have used different accounting estimates, and in other instances changes in our accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, with the result in each case
being a material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as “critical accounting estimates.” Among those critical accounting
estimates that we believe are most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements are those that we discuss below.

Accounting estimates necessarily require subjective determinations about future events and conditions. Therefore, the following descriptions of critical
accounting estimates are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by these forward-looking statements. You should read the following in conjunction with Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements and “Risk Factors” contained in Exhibit 99.1 to this annual report.

Reserve for operating losses

—We have a reserve for operating losses. We process credit card transactions for our direct merchants. Our
merchant customers have the liability for any charges properly reversed by the cardholder. In the event, however, that we are not able to collect such amount from the merchants, due to merchant fraud, insolvency, bankruptcy or any other reason, we
may be liable for any such reversed charges. We require cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit and other types of collateral by certain merchants to minimize any such contingent liability. We also utilize a number of systems and procedures to
manage merchant risk. In addition, we believe that the diversification of our merchant portfolio among industries and geographic regions minimizes our risk of loss.

We recognize most revenue based on a percentage of the gross amount charged and have a potential liability for the full
amount of the merchant sales volume. We establish valuation allowances for operational losses based primarily on historical experience and other relevant factors. Economic downturns or increases in merchant fraud may result in significant increases
in credit related issues. As of May 31, 2003, we have $5.4 million in reserves for losses associated with operating merchant card processing. Expenses of $15.6 million, $9.8 million and $8.4 million were recorded for fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively, for these losses.

We also have a check guarantee
business. Similar to the credit card business, we charge our merchants a percentage of the gross amount of the check and guarantee payment of the check to the merchant in the event the check is not honored by the checkwriter’s bank. We have the
right to collect the full amount of the check from the checkwriter but have not historically recovered 100% of the guaranteed checks. We establish a valuation allowance for this activity based on historical and projected loss experiences. As of May
31, 2003, the Company had a check guarantee reserve of $3.2 million. Expenses of $10.4 million, $12.4 million and $9.9 million were recorded for fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, for these losses. The estimated check returns and recovery
amounts are subject to the risk that actual amounts returned and recovered in the future may differ significantly from estimates used in calculating the valuation allowance.

Impact of New Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities

or SFAS No. 146. The standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. Examples of costs covered by the standard
include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring, discontinued operation, plant closing, or other exit or disposal activity. Previous accounting guidance was provided by EITF Issue No.
94-3, “Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring).” Statement 146 replaces Issue 94-3. We adopted this Statement effective for
applicable activities initiated after December 31, 2002.

In
November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 45,

Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others

or FIN No. 45. FIN No. 45
requires footnote disclosure of the guarantees or indemnification agreements a



Index to Financial Statements

company issues. With certain exceptions, these agreements will also require a company to prospectively recognize an initial liability for the fair value, or
market value, of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this Interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The
disclosure requirements of the Interpretation are effective for financial statements of the interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. The adoption of the recognition and measurement provisions of FIN No. 45 did not have a material
impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows for guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements of FIN No. 45 are included in Note 1 or our Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statement relative to our check guarantee services revenue recognition and reserve for operating losses.

In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standard No. 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation—Transition and Disclosure

or SFAS No. 148. SFAS No. 148 addresses alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, the
Statement amends the disclosure requirements of Statements of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” to require prominent disclosure in both annual and interim financial statements about the method
of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. Additional information is included in Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM 7A—QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Based on analyses completed and described below, we do not believe that we are exposed to material market risk from changes in interest rates and/or
foreign currency rates.

Interest Rate Risk

Our $125 million revolving line of credit has a variable interest rate based
on the London Interbank Offered Rates, or LIBOR. Accordingly, we are exposed to the impact of interest rate fluctuations. We have performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis over the near term with a 10% change in interest rates. A 10%
proportionate increase in interest rates would have resulted in no effect in fiscal 2003 and a decrease in net income of $0.1 million in fiscal 2002.

Foreign Currency Risk

We generate a percentage of our net income from foreign operations. We are vulnerable to fluctuations in the Canadian dollar and British pound against the
United States dollar and have performed a foreign exchange sensitivity analysis over the near term with a 10% change in foreign exchange rates. Assuming a 10% appreciation or depreciation in exchange rate of the British pound and the Canadian dollar
would result in net increase or decrease of $3.7 million in income. This analysis does not take into effect the change in revenue that may result from such a change in exchange rate.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Historically, we have not entered into derivative financial instruments to mitigate interest rate fluctuation risk or foreign currency exchange rate risk,
as it has not been cost effective. We may use derivative financial instruments in the future, if we deem it useful in mitigating our exposure to interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

ITEM 8—FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

Board of Directors and Shareholders

Global Payments Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Global
Payments Inc. (a Georgia corporation) and subsidiaries (“the Company”) as of May 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended. Our
audits also included the 2003 and 2002 financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 16. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. The consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule for the Company for the year ended May 31, 2001, before the inclusion
of the additional disclosures discussed in Notes 2 and 6 to the financial statements, were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations. Those auditors expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and stated that such
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the 2001 basic financial statements taken as a whole, presented fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein, in their reports dated July 17, 2001.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Global Payments Inc. and subsidiaries as of May 31, 2003 and 2002, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the 2003 and 2002 financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the 2003 and 2002 basic consolidated financial statements taken as whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed above, the consolidated financial statements of Global Payments Inc. for the year ended May 31, 2001 were
audited by other auditors who have ceased operations. As described in Note 6, the 2001 financial statements have been revised to include the transitional disclosures required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,

Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets

, which was adopted by the Company as of June 1, 2001. We performed the following audit procedures with respect to the disclosures in Note 6 with respect to 2001. We (i) agreed the adjustments to reported net income
representing goodwill and trademark amortization expense (including any related tax effects) recognized in those periods to the Company’s underlying accounting records obtained from management, and (ii) tested the mathematical accuracy of the
reconciliation of reported net income to adjusted net income, and the related earnings per-share amounts. Additionally, the seventh and eighth paragraphs of Note 2 contain disclosures related to 2001 that were not previously included in the 2001
notes to the financial statements. The additional disclosures relate to a 2001 acquisition and are required under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16. We performed the following audit procedures with respect to such additional disclosures. We
(i) derived the number of shares of common stock issued from the purchase agreement and, (ii) agreed the value of the shares issued, the amount of the cash purchase price adjustment, the allocation of the purchase price to various assets and
liabilities, and the useful lives of the resulting intangibles to the Company’s underlying records obtained from management. In our opinion, the disclosures discussed above are appropriate. However, we were not engaged to audit, review, or
apply any procedures to the 2001 financial statements of the Company other than with respect to such disclosures and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2001 financial statements taken as a whole.



Index to Financial Statements

As discussed in Note 1 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2002 the Company changed its
method of accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets to conform to Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142 and recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on June 1, 2001. Also as discussed in Note 1 to the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2003 the Company changed its method of accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities to conform to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business, Consolidation and Presentation—

Global Payments Inc. (“Global Payments” or the
“Company”) is an integrated provider of high volume electronic transaction processing and value-added end-to-end information services and systems to merchants, multinational corporations, financial institutions, and government agencies.
These services are marketed to customers within the merchant services and the funds transfer businesses through various sales channels.

In December 1999, National Data Corporation, now known as NDCHealth Corporation (“NDC”), announced its intent to spin-off the NDC eCommerce
business segment into a separate publicly traded company with its own management and Board of Directors (the “Distribution”). This Distribution occurred on January 31, 2001 (the “Distribution Date”) and was accomplished by
forming Global Payments on September 1, 2000, transferring the stock of the companies which comprised the NDC eCommerce business segment to the Company and then distributing all of the shares of common stock of Global Payments to NDC’s
stockholders. NDC stockholders received 0.8 share of Global Payments for each NDC share held as of the Distribution Date. After the Distribution, Global Payments and NDC became two separate public companies.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its majority-owned subsidiaries. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and present the Company’s financial
position, results of operations, and cash flows. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Prior to the Distribution Date, the financial statements included the accounts of the subsidiaries of NDC that comprised its eCommerce business segment.
Through the Distribution Date of January 31, 2001, these amounts were derived from NDC’s historical financial statements. As further described in Note 3, certain corporate and interest expenses had been allocated to the Company that were not
previously allocated to NDC’s eCommerce business segment. These allocations were based on an estimate of the proportion of corporate expenses related to the Company, utilizing such factors as revenues, number of employees, number of
transactions processed and other applicable factors. In the opinion of management, these allocations have been made on a reasonable basis. The costs of these services charged to the Company may not reflect the actual costs the Company would have
incurred for similar services as a stand-alone company.

Use
of estimates—

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Revenue—

Card information and
transaction processing services revenue are primarily based on a percentage of transaction value or on a specified amount per transaction, and is recognized as such services are performed. Revenue for processing services provided directly to
merchants is recorded net of interchange fees charged by credit card associations, which are not controlled by the Company.

Check guarantee services include the process of electronically verifying the check being presented to the Company’s merchant customer, through an
extensive database. The Company generally guarantees the face value of the verified and guaranteed check to the merchant customer. If a verified and guaranteed check is dishonored, the Company reimburses the merchant for the check’s guaranteed
value, and pursues collection from the delinquent checkwriter. The Company has the right to collect the full amount of the check from the checkwriter but has historically recovered approximately 50% to 55% of the guaranteed, dishonored checks. The
Company



Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

establishes a claims receivable from the delinquent checkwriter for the full amount of the guaranteed check and a valuation allowance for this activity based
on historical and projected loss experience. See

Reserve for Operating Losses

below.

Revenue for the check guarantee offering is primarily derived from a percentage of the face value of each guaranteed check. The Company recognizes revenue upon satisfaction of its guarantee obligation to the merchant
customer. The check guarantee offering also earns revenue based on fees collected from delinquent checkwriters which is recognized when collected, as collectibility is not reasonably assured until that point.

Check verification services are similar to the services provided in the check
guarantee offering, except the Company does not guarantee the verified checks. Revenue for this offering is primarily derived from fees collected from delinquent checkwriters and is recognized when collected, as collectibility is not reasonably
assured until that point. This offering also earns revenue based on a fixed amount each merchant pays for each check that is verified. This revenue is recognized when the transaction is processed, since the Company has no further obligations
associated with the transaction.

Terminal management products
and services consist of electronic transaction processing terminal sales and rentals, terminal set-up, telephone training and technical support. Revenue associated with the terminal sale, set-up and telephone training is considered a single earnings
process and is recognized when the set-up and telephone training is completed, and the merchant customer can begin processing transactions. Terminal rental revenues are recognized when the service is provided. Revenue associated with technical
support is considered an independent earnings process and is recognized based on either a maintenance agreement, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the maintenance contract term, or based on time and materials when the support is
completed.

Cash and cash equivalents—

Cash and cash
equivalents include cash on hand and all liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or less when purchased.

Inventory—

Inventory, which includes computer hardware and peripheral equipment, and electronic point of sale terminals, is stated at the lower
of cost or market. Cost is determined by using the average cost method.

Merchant processing receivable/payable—

The merchant processing receivable/payable results from timing differences in the Company’s settlement process with merchants and card sales processed. These timing differences are
primarily due to the fluctuations in volume and timing of credit and debit card sales volume funded to merchants and the settlement received from the card associations and debit networks.

Reserve for operating losses—

The Company processes credit card transactions for direct merchants. The
Company’s merchant customers have the liability for any charges properly reversed by the cardholder. In the event, however, that the Company is not able to collect such amount from the merchants, due to merchant fraud, insolvency, bankruptcy or
any other reason, the Company may be liable for any such reversed charges. The Company requires cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit and other types of collateral by certain merchants to minimize any such contingent liability. The Company
also utilizes a number of systems and procedures to manage merchant risk.

The Company recognizes revenue based on a percentage of the gross amount charged and has a potential liability for the full amount of the charge. The Company establishes valuation allowances for operational losses
based primarily on historical experience and other relevant factors. Economic downturns or increases in merchant fraud may result in significant increases in credit related issues. As of May 31, 2003 and 2002, $5.4 million and $2.1 million,
respectively, has been reserved for losses associated with operating merchant card

processing. The expense associated with the valuation allowance is included in cost of service in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
Expenses of $15.6 million, $9.8 million and $8.4 million were recorded for fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, for these losses.

The Company also has a check guarantee business. Similar to the credit card business, the Company charges its merchants a percentage of the gross amount
of the check and guarantees payment of the check to the merchant in the event the check is not honored by the checkwriter’s bank. The Company has the right to collect the full amount of the check from the checkwriter but has not historically
recovered 100% of the guaranteed checks. The Company establishes a valuation allowance for this activity based on historical and projected loss experiences. As of May 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had a check guarantee reserve of $3.2 million.
Expenses of $10.4 million, $12.4 million and $9.9 million were recorded for fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, for these losses and is included in cost of service in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The estimated check
returns and recovery amounts are subject to the risk that actual amounts returned and recovered in the future may differ significantly from estimates used in calculating the valuation allowance.

Property and equipment

—Property and equipment, including
equipment under capital leases, are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method. Equipment is depreciated over 2 to 5 year lives. Leasehold improvements and property acquired under capital leases are
amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the term of the lease. The costs of purchased and internally developed software used to provide services to customers or internal administrative services are capitalized and amortized on
a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, not to exceed 5 years. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.

Goodwill and Other Intangibles Assets—

On July 20, 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statements of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 141, “

Business Combinations

” (“SFAS No. 141”) and No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”

(“SFAS No. 142”). SFAS No. 141 requires that all business combinations initiated
after June 30, 2001 be accounted for under the purchase method. SFAS No. 142 eliminates the amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets and requires that goodwill be evaluated for impairment at least annually by applying a fair
value-based test. Global Payments adopted SFAS No. 142 in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. In accordance with this new standard, the Company discontinued the amortization of goodwill and certain intangible assets that were determined to have an
indefinite life.

Global Payments completed the testing for
impairment of goodwill as of June 1, 2002 using the present value of expected future cash flows. The Company determined that the fair value of the reporting units exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets, including goodwill of the respective
reporting units. Therefore, no impairment charge to goodwill is required. No other changes in amortization periods were required for other intangible assets. See Note 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Other intangible assets primarily represent customer lists and
merchant contracts associated with acquisitions. Customer lists and merchant contracts are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of 10 to 30 years. The useful lives for customer lists/merchant contracts are
determined based primarily on information concerning start/stop dates and yearly attrition.

The Company had one indefinite life intangible asset, a trademark with a carrying value at June 1, 2001 of $24.6 million. The trademark was acquired on April 1, 1996 with the purchase of 92.5% ownership interest in
MasterCard International’s Merchant Automated Point-of-Sale Program, or MAPP. The value of the trademark related to the use of the MAPP name and logo. In connection with the spin-off from NDC, the Company launched a significant rebranding
effort under the Global Payments Inc. name and logo. In addition, effective June 1, 2001, the Company purchased MasterCard’s remaining minority interest, ending all existing marketing alliances with MasterCard under the MAPP brand and conducted
a study related to the future use of the trademark.



Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

In fiscal 2002, the Company obtained an appraisal from an independent valuation firm of the fair
value of the trademark as of June 1, 2001, the implementation date of SFAS No. 142. Based on the lack of continuing use of the MAPP trademark as of June 1, 2001, the fair value of the trademark was determined to be zero. In accordance with SFAS No.
142, the $24.6 million ($16.0 million, net of tax) was written off as of June 1, 2001 and was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.

Impairment of long-lived assets—

The Company regularly evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred
that indicate the carrying amount of property and equipment and other intangible assets may warrant revision or may not be recoverable. When factors indicate that these long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, the Company
assesses the recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such long-lived assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted cash flows expected from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. In management’s opinion,
the long-lived assets, including property and equipment and other intangible assets are appropriately valued at May 31, 2003 and May 31, 2002.

Investments—

The Company held a $5 million investment in eCharge Corporation, a private company that offers Internet users secure and
convenient ways to make purchases over the Internet. During the fourth quarter ending May 31, 2001, the Company completed an evaluation of this investment as it had experienced difficulty securing additional funding. As a result, management
determined the carrying value of the investment was not recoverable and recognized a loss on investment of $5.0 million in fiscal 2001.

Income taxes—

Deferred income taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and
liabilities using enacted tax laws and rates (see Note 9).

Fair value of financial instruments—

Management considers that the carrying amounts of financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables, line of credit, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate
fair value.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities

—Global Payments has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 133,

“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”

(“SFAS No. 133”) and Statement No. 149,

“Amendment
of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”

(“SFAS No. 149”). SFAS No. 133 requires that a company recognize derivatives as assets or liabilities on its balance sheet, and also requires that the gain or loss
related to the effective portion of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges be recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. SFAS No. 149 amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative
instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133. The Company has not used any derivative instruments and the adoption of these statements was not significant.

Foreign currency translation—

The Company has foreign subsidiaries
operating in Canada and the United Kingdom, whose functional currency is their local currency. Gains and losses on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies are included in determining net income for the period in
which exchange rates change. The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating in foreign currencies are translated at the year-end rate of exchange, and income statement items are translated at the average rates prevailing during the year. The
resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a component of shareholders’ equity. Translation gains and losses on intercompany balances of a long-term investment nature are also recorded as a component of shareholders’ equity. The
effects of foreign currency gains and losses arising from these translations of assets and liabilities are included as a component of other comprehensive income.

Segment disclosure—

The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, “

Disclosure
About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information

” (“SFAS No. 131”). The Company’s chief operating decision making group currently operates one reportable segment—electronic transaction processing—therefore
the majority of the disclosures required by SFAS No. 131 do not apply to the Company. The Company’s measure of segment profit is operating income. The Company’s results of operations and its financial

condition are not significantly reliant upon any single customer. Revenues from external customers from the Company’s service offerings are as follows:

The Company’s
operations are provided in the United States, Canada, and Europe. The following is a breakdown of revenues by geographic region:

Earnings per
share—

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing reported earnings available to common shareholders by weighted average shares outstanding during the period. Earnings available to common shareholders are the same as reported net
income for all periods presented. For periods prior to the Distribution Date, weighted average shares outstanding is computed by applying the distribution ratio of 0.8 of a share of the Company for each NDC share held to the historical NDC weighted
average shares outstanding for the same periods presented.

Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing reported earnings available to common shareholders by weighted average shares outstanding during the period and the impact of securities that, if exercised, would have a dilutive effect on
earnings per share. All options with an exercise price less than the average market share price for the period generally are assumed to have a dilutive effect on earning per share. The dilutive effect of stock options was 0.9 million shares, 1.4
million shares and 0.3 million shares in fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. The diluted share base for the year ended May 31, 2003 excludes incremental shares of 0.7 million related to employee stock options. These shares were excluded due
to their anti-dilutive effect as a result of their option exercise prices being greater than the average market price of the common shares. No shares had an anti-dilutive effect in fiscal 2002 and 2001. No additional securities were outstanding that
could potentially dilute basic earnings per share that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share.

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended May 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001:

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Effective March 1, 2003, Global Payments adopted Statements of Financial Accounting Standard No. 148,
“

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure

” (“SFAS No. 148”). SFAS No. 148 addresses alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of Statements of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123, “

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

” (“SFAS No. 123”) to require
prominent disclosure in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results.

At May 31, 2003, the Company has three stock-based compensation plans, which
are described more fully in Note 10. The Company accounts for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, “

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”

, and related interpretations. No
stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The following table illustrates the
effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, to stock-based employee compensation.

Impact of new
accounting pronouncements—

In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 146, “

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities” (

“SFAS No. 146”). The standard requires
companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. Examples of costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and
certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring, discontinued operation, plant closing, or other exit or disposal activity. Previous accounting guidance was provided by EITF Issue No. 94-3, “

Liability Recognition
for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)

” (“Issue No. 94-3”). SFAS No. 146 replaces Issue No. 94-3. The Company adopted SFAS No. 146
effective for applicable activities initiated after December 31, 2002. See Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 45, “

Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Other

” (“FIN No. 45”). FIN No. 45 requires footnote disclosure of the guarantees or indemnification agreements a company issues. With certain
exceptions, these agreements will also require a company to prospectively recognize an initial liability for the fair value, or market value, of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee. The initial recognition and initial measurement
provisions of this Interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements of the Interpretation are effective for financial statements of the interim or annual
periods ending after December 15,

2002. The adoption of the recognition and measurement provisions of FIN No. 45 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
position, results of operations, or cash flows for guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements of FIN No. 45 are included above, relative to the Company’s check guarantee services revenue recognition and
reserve for operating losses.

NOTE 2—BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS

During fiscal 2003, the Company did not acquire any
material businesses. In fiscal years 2002 and 2001, the Company acquired the following businesses and assets:

These acquisitions
have been recorded using the purchase method of accounting, and accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value as of the date of acquisition. The operating
results are included in the Company’s consolidated statements of income from the date of the acquisition.

In August 2001, Global Payments purchased the 7.5% minority interest owned by MasterCard International Corporation in Global Payment Systems LLC. The
transaction was effective as of June 1, 2001, with a purchase price of $15.0 million.

On October 1, 2001, the Company acquired National Bank of Canada’s merchant acquiring business and formed a ten-year alliance for marketing merchant payment-related products and services to National Bank of
Canada’s customers. The purchase price was $45.9 million (U.S.), at the then current Canadian exchange rate. This acquisition was completed to compliment the Company’s existing Canadian customer portfolio and broaden the Company’s
presence in Canada.

The following table summarizes the
estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in fiscal 2002 at the date of the acquisitions.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The amount assigned to the customer list for the National Bank merchant acquiring business is being
amortized over 17 years. Of the amount assigned to goodwill, 100% is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

On March 20, 2001, the Company acquired substantially all the net assets of the merchant acquiring business of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, and
formed a ten year marketing alliance with CIBC to offer merchant payment-related products and services to CIBC’s customers. In exchange for the net assets acquired, the Company issued CIBC approximately 9.8 million unregistered shares of our
common stock with a fair value of $133.6 million and paid CIBC a cash purchase price adjustment of $10.1 million. The deferred cash purchase price adjustment was a negotiated, formula driven amount based on the financial performance of business from
the date of the definitive agreement to the closing.

The net
assets of the CIBC merchant acquiring business consisted of accounts receivable of $60.6 million, property and equipment of $14.1 million, accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $7.5 million, and an obligation under a capital lease of $0.6
million. The difference in total consideration of $143.7 million and the net tangible assets acquired created an excess of $77.1 million. The excess was allocated to merchant contracts in the amount of $44.4 million and goodwill in the amount of
$32.7 million, with an estimated useful life of 17 years and 20 years, respectively.

The aggregate cash price paid for the acquisitions in 2001 of $23.4 million is detailed as follows (

in thousands)

:

The excess of cost
over tangible assets acquired totaled $117.0 million, with $52.7 million allocated to goodwill and $64.3 million to customer lists/merchant contracts. The depreciable and intangible assets are being amortized over periods ranging from 2 to 20 years.

The following unaudited pro forma information for the purchase
acquisitions discussed above has been prepared as if the 2002 and 2001 acquisitions had occurred on June 1 of the preceding year. The information is based on historical and estimated results of the separate companies and may not necessarily be
indicative of the results that would have been achieved or of results that may occur in the future. The pro forma information includes the expense for amortization of other intangible assets resulting from these transactions and interest expense
related to financing costs but does not reflect any synergies or operating cost reductions that may be achieved from the combined operations.

NOTE 3—TRANSACTIONS WITH NDC

In conjunction with the Distribution, the Company and NDC entered into various agreements that address the allocation of
assets and liabilities between them and that define their relationship after the Distribution, including the Distribution Agreement, the Tax Sharing and Indemnification Agreement, the Employee Benefits Agreement, the Lease Agreement for Office
Headquarters, the Intercompany Systems/Network Services Agreement, the Batch Processing Agreement and the Transition Support Agreement. In fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company paid NDC $7.8 million, $8.5 million and $2.4 million, respectively,
for transitional services. At May 31, 2003 and 2002, there was $4.8 million and $2.6 million respectively outstanding to be paid. Payments made in connection with these transitional services are based on terms and conditions arrived at between the
Company and NDC bargained at arms length.

The Company was
charged with incremental corporate costs through the Distribution Date in the amount of $4.7 million in fiscal 2001. These allocations were based on an estimate of the proportion of corporate expenses related to the Company, utilizing such factors
as revenues, number of employees, number of transactions processed and other applicable factors.

The Company was also charged corporate interest expense through January 31, 2001 based on the corporate debt allocations of NDC to the Company at the
Distribution Date. The Company utilized a rollback approach to allocate the portion of the NDC consolidated group’s debt and interest expense for all historical periods presented. This treatment records the debt allocation percentage for all
historical periods presented. The allocated portion of the consolidated group’s debt was presented as due to NDC. Interest expense recorded by the Company related to this debt was $3.1 million in fiscal 2001 and is included in interest and
other expense. NDC did not charge any incremental interest expense to the Company after the Distribution Date.

NOTE 4—PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

As of May 31, 2003 and May 31, 2002, property and equipment consisted of the following:

Depreciation and

Prior to the Distribution, the Company participated in the NDC noncontributory defined benefit pension plan (the “NDC
Plan”) covering substantially all of its United States employees who have met the eligibility provisions of the NDC Plan as of May 31, 1998. During fiscal 1998, NDC made an evaluation of its current retirement plan offerings and decided to
provide its employees with a greater emphasis on its deferred compensation 401(k) plan by substantially increasing the employer match of participants’ contributions. At the same time, NDC closed the defined benefit pension plan to new
participants beginning June 1, 1998. Benefits are based on years of service and the employee’s compensation during the highest five consecutive years of earnings of the last ten years of service. Plan provisions and funding meet the
requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. Effective on the Distribution Date, the Company established the Global Payments defined benefit pension plan (the “Global Payments Plan”) and NDC transferred
to this plan a proportionate share of assets allocable to the accrued benefits for the Company’s participants under the NDC Plan. Expenses for fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 were actuarially determined.

The following table provides a reconciliation of the changes in the benefit
obligations and fair value of assets over the two-year period ending May 31, 2003 and a statement of funded status at May 31 for each year:

NOTE 10—SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Stock Options—

NDC had certain Stock Option Plans (the “Plan”) under which incentive stock options and
non-qualified stock options have been granted to officers, key employees and directors of NDC. In connection with the separation of the Company from NDC, stock options under the Plan held by employees of the Company that were not exercised prior to
the date of the Distribution were replaced with options of Global Payments. In accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 44,

Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation

, NDC
stock options were replaced with Global Payments stock options in amounts and at exercise prices intended to preserve the economic benefit of the NDC stock options at such time. No compensation expense resulted from the replacement of the options.
The exercise price of such options ranged from $3.26 to $20.90. As a result, options for 2,364,849 shares of Global Payments common stock were issued to replace NDC options under the Global Payments Inc. 2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended and
restated (“The 2000 Plan”). The Company also has a Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan (“The Director Plan”), which provides for grants of options to directors who are not employees with the Company. A summary of changes in
all outstanding options and the related weighted average exercise price per share is as follows:

Employee Stock
Purchase Plan

—The Company has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under which the sale of 1,200,000 shares of its common stock have been authorized. Employees may designate up to the lesser of $25,000 or 20% of their annual compensation for the
purchase of stock. The price for shares purchased under the plan is the lower of 85% of market value on the first day or the last day of the quarterly purchase period. At May 31, 2003, 141,328 shares have been issued under this plan, with 1,058,672
shares reserved for future issuance.

The weighted-average
grant-date fair value per share granted in fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001 under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan is $4.96, $6.90 and $4.15, respectively.

officers that were participants in the NDC Plan were granted 256,565 restricted shares of the Company under the restricted stock program to replace the awards previously granted under the NDC Plan. Shares awarded under the restricted stock program
are held in escrow and released to the grantee upon the grantee’s satisfaction of conditions of the grantee’s restricted stock agreement. Awards are recorded as deferred compensation, a reduction of shareholders’ equity based on the
quoted fair market value of the

Company’s common stock at the award date. Compensation expense is recognized ratably during the escrow period of the award. The compensation cost that
was charged against income for restricted stock was $1.3 million in 2003 and $1.1 million in both 2002, and 2001.

NOTE 11—RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company, consistent with its strategy to leverage infrastructure and consolidate operations, committed to a
plan to close three locations and consolidate these and other functions into existing locations. The plan requires associated management and staff reductions, contract termination and other facility closure costs. The Company started executing the
plan in April 2003 and expects to be completed by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. The major components of the restructuring charge associated with these activities are as follows:

The charge incurred
for the year ended May 31, 2003 is reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income under the caption “Restructuring and other”. As of May 31, 2003, no amounts have been paid for the fiscal 2003 planned restructuring
activities, thus $1.7 million is accrued as of May 31, 2003.

During the fourth quarters of fiscals 2002 and 2001, the Company completed plans for the closing of four and six locations, respectively, including associated management and staff reductions. Total charges for the years ended May 31, 2002
and 2001 are categorized as follows:

The charges relating
to facilities represent locations that are either already closed or have management approved plans to be closed within twelve months of incurring the charges. These charges included future minimum lease and operating payments, commencing on the
planned exit timing, for all noncancelable leases under remaining terms of the locations identified, net of current and estimated future sublease income. The charges also include facility exit costs and an estimate of the net book value of leasehold
improvements and furniture and fixtures that will not be realizable when the facilities are vacated. Normal lease payments, operating costs and depreciation will continue to be charged to operating expenses prior to actually vacating the specific
facilities.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The severance and related costs arise from the Company’s actions to reduce personnel in areas of
redundant operations and activities. These operations are those that related to the facility consolidation, recent acquisitions and integration of acquisition functions. The charges reflect specifically identified employees whose employment will be
terminated and were informed by the time the charges were incurred. The non-cash costs associated with the severance and related costs reflect compensation expense due to the acceleration of the vesting of certain stock options for those employees
that were terminated and had options outstanding.

The other
costs incurred in the year ended May 31, 2002 relate to the book value of certain current assets that were deemed to be unrecoverable after the purchase of MasterCard’s remaining minority interest in Global Payment Systems LLC.

The cash items were accrued at the time the charges were incurred. As of May
31, 2003, $1.5 million of the cash portion of the restructuring charges from fiscal 2002 remains accrued as a current liability in the accrued liabilities section of the balance sheets as follows:

As of May 31, 2002,
$2.2 million of the $9.5 million of the cash portion of the restructuring charge had been paid in severance and related costs. The remaining restructuring charges of $0.7 million relating to facilities closing costs and $6.6 million relating to
severance and related costs were accrued as a current liability in the accrued liabilities section of the balance sheet.

NOTE 12—RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

In connection with the fiscal 2001 purchase of CIBC’s merchant acquiring business, CIBC holds approximately 26.3% of the Company’s outstanding
common stock. CIBC provides transition services under an agreement to provide various support services to the merchant acquiring business for a 24-month period commencing on the acquisition date of March 20, 2001. The purpose of the agreement is to
facilitate the integration into our existing operations. These services include customer service, credit and debit card processing and settlement functions. CIBC has continued to provide certain transitional services subsequent to the 24-month
period under a new agreement currently in final negotiations. For the years ended May 31, 2003, May 31, 2002 and May 31, 2001, the Company incurred expenses of approximately $6.2 million, $31.1 million and $11.2 million, respectively, related to
these services.

In addition, the Company has a credit facility
from CIBC that provides a line of credit up to $175 million (Canadian dollars), approximately $128 million U.S. dollars. See Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

NOTE 13—COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Leases

The Company conducts a major part of its operations using leased facilities and equipment. Many of these leases have renewal
and purchase options and provide that the Company pay the cost of property taxes, insurance and maintenance.

Rent expense on all operating leases for fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $7.8 million, $7.6 million

Future minimum lease payments
for all noncancelable leases at May 31, 2003 were as follows:

Legal

The Company currently processes card transactions for Air Canada, the single
largest airline in Canada. Revenue from this relationship represents less than 1% of the Company’s consolidated revenue. On April 1, 2003, Air Canada filed for and obtained protection from the court under the Companies’ Creditors
Arrangement Act, which generally allows a company to reorganize while it continues normal operations with the assistance of a court-appointed Monitor. The court order provides for a general stay that precludes its creditors and others from taking
any action against Air Canada. The purpose of the stay is to provide Air Canada with relief designed to stabilize operations and business relationships with customers, vendors, employees and creditors. The court order also provides that Air Canada
shall honor all airline tickets in the usual and ordinary course of business.

In the event that Air Canada’s restructuring is not successful and it is liquidated, there will likely be limited assets available from which to pay creditor claims. If the restructuring is not successful and any
of Air Canada’s liability for deferred ticket revenues is unfunded and such charges are properly reversed by VISA and MasterCard cardholders, the Company may be liable for such reversed charges under the chargeback rules of these card
associations; for more details, refer to

Reserve for operating losses

under Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this report. According to the Eighth Report of the Monitor dated July 31, 2003,
deferred ticket revenues for Air Canada as of June 30, 2003, representing advance ticket sales collected, were approximately $566 million Canadian, or $420 million U.S, based on then existing exchange rates. In conjunction with the acquisition of
the merchant acquiring business of CIBC in March 2001, CIBC agreed to reimburse Global Payments by the amount, if any, that Air Canada’s VISA chargebacks and credit losses for any 12 month period exceed twice the level of VISA chargebacks and
credit losses experienced during the one-year period ending October 31, 1999. This reimbursement obligation is scheduled to expire on March 20, 2004. Based on an affidavit of an Air Canada officer, 80% of Air Canada customers elect to pay using
credit cards and, of those credit card users, 29.3% use VISA cards and 8.4% use MasterCard cards. Therefore, based on the information contained in that affidavit, the information contained in Eighth Report of the Monitor, and taking into
consideration CIBC’s reimbursement obligations for Air Canada’s chargebacks and credit losses, our maximum potential chargeback liability exposure relative to Air Canada as of June 30, 2003 is $38-$48 million Canadian, or $28-$35 million
U.S., based on existing exchange rates.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

We are continuing to monitor Air Canada’s restructuring. Based on information currently
available, which primarily consists of publicly available information, management believes a material loss to the Company is unlikely as long as Air Canada continues to honor all airline tickets in the ordinary course of business.

The Company is party to a number of other claims and lawsuits incidental to
its business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate outcome of such matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

Line of Credit

The Company has a commitment for a $125 million revolving line of credit. It was initially used to fund the cash due to NDC
to reflect the Company’s share of NDC’s pre-distribution debt used to establish the Company’s initial capitalization. This line of credit is also available to meet working capital needs and financing acquisitions. This line has a
variable interest rate based on a market short-term floating rate plus a margin that varies according to the Company’s trailing four quarter leverage ratio. The credit agreement contains certain financial and non-financial covenants customary
for financings of this nature. The facility has a three-year term, expiring in January 2004. The Company is currently negotiating with the lender to extend the term of this facility. The full amount outstanding is due upon demand, therefore, the
Company classifies any amount outstanding as a current liability. There are no amounts outstanding as of May 31, 2003. As of May 31, 2002, the Company had $22 million outstanding under this facility.

On October 1, 2001, the Company obtained a commitment for a $25 million
revolving credit facility to finance working capital and other general corporate purposes. This line has a variable interest rate based a market short-term floating rate plus a margin. The credit agreement contains certain financial and
non-financial covenants customary for financings of this nature. The facility originally had a sixteen-month term, expiring in January 2003. Prior to its expiration, the Company executed an amendment with the lender to extend the term of this
facility for an additional twelve months through January 2004. There were no amounts outstanding at May 31, 2003 and May 31, 2002 on this credit facility.

The Company also has a credit facility from CIBC that provides a line of credit up to $175 million (Canadian dollars), approximately $128 million U.S.,
with an additional overdraft facility available to cover larger advances during periods of peak usage of credit and debit cards. This line has a variable interest rate based on a market short-term floating rate plus a margin. It contains customary
covenants and events of default. This line of credit is secured by a first priority security interest in our accounts receivable from VISA Canada/International, and has been guaranteed by our subsidiaries. This guarantee is subordinate to our
primary credit facility. On December 10, 2002, the Company executed a third amendment to this credit facility which increased the line of credit from $140 million to $175 million (Canadian dollars), extended the term of the facility for an
additional 364 days through December 9, 2003, and provided for the incurrence of interest costs in connection with offering merchants “same day value” for their deposits. Same day value, which has been an accepted industry practice in
Canada for more than ten years, is the practice of giving merchants same day value for their sales transactions, even though their deposits are made at a later date. Essentially, the merchant’s deposits are backdated to the date of the
applicable sales transaction. Under the terms of the credit agreement prior to the execution of the third amendment, CIBC credited the merchants’ deposit account for their sales transactions on the day of the transaction and the Company
reimbursed CIBC after receipt of the corresponding funding from the card association and debit network. At May 31, 2003, there were $46.3 million (Canadian dollars), approximately $33.9 million U.S. outstanding on this credit facility. This amount
is included as a component of the net merchant processing receivable on the balance sheet. The amount borrowed is restricted in use to pay merchants and will be received from the card associations and debit network on the following day. There was no
amount outstanding under the CIBC credit facility as of May 31, 2002.

BIN/ICA Agreements

In connection with the
Company’s acquisition of merchant credit card operations of banks, the Company has also entered into depository and processing agreements (the “Agreements”) with certain of the banks. These



Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Agreements allow the Company to use the banks’ identification numbers (“BIN/ICA”) to clear credit card transactions through VISA and
MasterCard. Certain agreements contain financial covenants, and the Company was in compliance with all such covenants as of May 31, 2003. In management’s opinion, the Company would be able to obtain alternative BIN/ICA agreements without
material impact to the Company in the event of the termination of these Agreements.

NOTE 14—SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION

Supplemental cash flow disclosures and non-cash investing and financing activities for the years ended May 31, 2003, May 31, 2002 and May 31, 2001 are as follows:

Through the
Distribution Date, the Company’s cash flow had been calculated with and included in the NDC consolidated group’s Supplemental Cash Flows. The Company’s payments for income taxes have been calculated on the Company’s separate
income and reflect federal and state income tax payment allocations as if the Company had been operating on a stand-alone basis (Note 9). The Company has utilized a “rollback” approach to allocate the portion of the consolidated
group’s interest payments for the historical period presented (Note 3).

NOTE 16—SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On August 11, 2003, Global Payments Inc. entered into a definitive agreement
to acquire Latin America Money Services, LLC, or LAMS, a holding company which directly owns a majority of the outstanding equity interest in DolEx Dollar Express, Inc., or DolEx, and indirectly owns a majority of the outstanding equity interest in
DolEx Envios S.A. de C.V., a Mexican subsidiary of DolEx. The transaction, which is structured as a merger between a newly created subsidiary of Global Payments and LAMS, is subject to regulatory approvals; however it is expected to close before the
end of calendar year 2003. The purchase price is $190 million, plus a contingent payment of up to $10 million based on the calendar year 2003 financial results of DolEx. Global Payments expects the purchase price to be financed under its existing
line of credit, cash on hand, and notes payable.
