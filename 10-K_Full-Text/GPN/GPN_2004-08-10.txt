CAUTIONARY NOTICE REGARDING

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

We believe that it is important to communicate our plans and expectations about the future to our shareholders and to the public. Some of the statements we use in this report, and in some of the documents we
incorporate by reference in this report, contain forward-looking statements concerning our business operations, economic performance and financial condition, including in particular, our business strategy and means to implement the strategy, the
amount of future capital expenditures, our success in developing and introducing new products and expanding our business, the successful integration of future acquisitions and the timing of the introduction of new and modified products or services.
You can sometimes identify forward looking-statements by our use of the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends” and similar expressions. For these statements, we claim the protection of the safe
harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Although we believe that the plans and expectations reflected in or suggested by our forward-looking statements are reasonable, those statements are based
on a number of assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to significant risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, cannot be foreseen and reflect future business decisions that are subject to change. Accordingly, we
cannot guarantee you that our plans and expectations will be achieved. Our actual revenues, revenue growth rates and margins, other results of operation and shareholder values could differ materially from those anticipated in our forward-looking
statements as a result of many known and unknown factors, many of which are beyond our ability to predict or control. These factors include, but are not limited to, those set forth in Exhibit 99.1 to this report, those set forth elsewhere in this
report and those set forth in our press releases, reports and other filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These cautionary statements qualify all of our forward-looking statements, and you are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on these forward-looking statements.

Our
forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and should not be relied upon as representing our plans and expectations as of any subsequent date. While we may elect to update or revise forward-looking statements at some time in
the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to our forward-looking statements.

PART I

ITEM 1—BUSINESS

General Developments

Financial Highlights

In fiscal 2004, revenue increased $113.2 million or 22% to $629.3 million
from $516.1 million in fiscal 2003. Revenue growth was primarily driven by the growth in our direct merchant service offering in the United States and acquisitions closed in fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of our acquisitions in fiscal 2004, our
revenue grew 12% compared to fiscal 2003. Operating income was $112.9 million for fiscal 2004, compared to $93.3 million for fiscal 2003, which resulted in a decrease in operating margin from 18.1% for fiscal 2003 to 17.9% for fiscal 2004. Net
income increased $9.1 million or 17% to $62.4 million in fiscal 2004 from $53.3 million in the prior year’s comparable period, resulting in a $0.19 increase in diluted earnings per share from $1.41 in fiscal 2003 to $1.60 in fiscal 2004.

The operating income amounts reflect restructuring charges of
$9.6 million and $1.3 million in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, respectively. Operating income, excluding the effect of restructuring charges, increased $28.0 million or 30% to $122.5 million in fiscal 2004 from $94.5 million in fiscal 2003. Operating
margins excluding the effect of restructuring charges from both periods increased from 18.3% in fiscal 2003 to 19.5% in fiscal 2004. Net income, excluding the impact of the restructuring and other charges from fiscal 2004 and 2003, increased by
$14.4 million or 27% to $68.5 million in fiscal 2004 from $54.1 million in fiscal 2003 and diluted earnings per share on the same basis increased $0.33 or 23% to $1.76 in fiscal 2004 from $1.43 in fiscal 2003. Management believes that reporting such
results without inclusion of the restructuring charges is useful to investors comparing the Company’s annual and quarterly performance to prior periods, and management uses such non-GAAP measures when internally evaluating the Company’s
performance.

Refer to “Item 7—Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a detailed explanation of these results.

Acquisitions

On November 12, 2003, we completed the acquisition of Latin America Money Services, LLC (“LAMS”), a Delaware limited liability company which
owned a majority of the outstanding equity interests in DolEx Dollar Express, Inc. (“DolEx”), a Texas corporation, and all but one share of the outstanding equity interests in DolEx Envios, S.A. de C.V. (“DolEx Envios”), a
Mexican subsidiary of DolEx. The transaction was structured as a merger of GP Ventures (Texas), Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Global Payments, into LAMS, with LAMS remaining as the surviving entity in the merger. We
also acquired the remaining equity interests in DolEx that were not already owned by LAMS. We gave consideration of approximately $190.4 million for LAMS, DolEx and DolEx Envios through a combination of $59.7 million in cash, net of cash acquired of
$8.7 million, the issuance of $114.2 million in promissory notes payable to the order of the sellers, and the issuance of common stock with an approximate fair value of $7.8 million based on the closing price of Global Payments Inc. common stock on
the date the acquisition closed. On December 1, 2003, the Company repaid the promissory notes in full using its U.S. credit facility.

As a result of the transaction, LAMS, a holding company, is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Global Payments. DolEx, the U.S. operating company, is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of LAMS and DolEx Envios, the Mexican operating company, is a majority-owned subsidiary of DolEx because one share of DolEx Envios is owned by GP Finance, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Global Payments. We frequently
refer to this transaction as the DolEx acquisition, since DolEx and DolEx Envios are the operating companies within the LAMS group. Concurrent with this acquisition, we changed the name of our “funds transfer” service offering to
“money transfer”. The acquisition expanded our money transfer service product offerings to include electronic consumer-to-consumer money transfer, primarily in the United States to the Latin American corridor. DolEx operates hundreds of
originating retail branches located in the United States, and has settlement arrangements in Latin America with thousands of banks, exchange houses, and retail locations.



On February 18, 2004, we acquired 52.6% of the outstanding voting shares of MUZO, a.s. from
Komerční banka, a.s., or KB, for $34.7 million in cash. Pursuant to Czech law, we completed a public tender offer on May 14, 2004 for the remaining shares of MUZO. The public tender offer resulted in Global Payments obtaining 46,576
additional shares of MUZO for the equivalent of approximately $28.8 million in cash, bringing our ownership to 98.3% of the outstanding voting shares of MUZO. We have begun the process of acquiring the remaining shares of MUZO in accordance with
Czech law.

We believe that MUZO is the largest indirect
payment processor in the Czech Republic. Based in Prague, MUZO employs approximately 250 employees and has served as an indirect processor for financial institutions since 1992. MUZO offers a comprehensive package of payment services including
credit and debit card transaction processing services; sales, installation and management of ATMs and POS devices; and card personalization.

Headquarters Relocation

In March 2004, we substantially completed the relocation of our corporate functions in Atlanta, except for our data center, which we expect to relocate by
March 2006. The primary purpose of the relocation was to comply with an IRS requirement regarding our facility lease with NDCHealth, formerly known as National Data Corporation, which was our landlord and former parent company. We believe this
relocation is consistent with the tax-free nature of the spin-off from NDCHealth which occurred on January 31, 2001.

Public Equity Offering

On May 17, 2004, CIBC Investments Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, or CIBC, completed the sale of a total of 2.3
million shares of our common stock through an underwritten offering at a public offering price of $44.25 per share. CIBC also entered into a derivative transaction with an affiliate of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. consisting of five equal-sized
collars of 1.2 million shares each maturing between March 2006 and April 2007. The effect of this derivative transaction will be to permit CIBC to recognize some gains on increases in our stock price, while limiting CIBC’s downside risk and
defer certain tax liabilities. As a result of this derivative transaction, the 6.0 million shares reflect a “short” position in our stock, a portion of which will remain through 2007. After delivery of all the shares of our stock under the
derivative transaction, CIBC will no longer own any shares of our stock, unless it otherwise purchases our shares on the open market.

CIBC acquired its shares in Global Payments in 2001 as consideration for the sale of CIBC’s merchant acquiring and terminal businesses. Global
Payments did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares by CIBC, nor did we issue any new shares of our common stock in connection with the offering.

Business Description

Global Payments Inc., or Global Payments, is a leading payments company. As a high volume payments processor of electronic transactions, we enable
consumers, corporations, government agencies and other profit and non-profit business enterprises to facilitate payments to purchase goods and services or further other economic goals. Our role is to serve as an intermediary in the exchange of
information and funds that must occur between the necessary parties so that a transaction can be completed. Including our time as part of National Data Corporation, now known as NDCHealth, or NDC, we have provided transaction processing services
since 1967. We were incorporated in Georgia as Global Payments Inc. in September 2000 and we spun off from NDCHealth on January 31, 2001.

We market our products and services throughout the United States, Canada and Europe, and we also conduct business in the Latin America through our money
transfer product offering. We operate in one business segment; electronic transaction payment processing and we provide products and services through our merchant services and money transfer offerings. Our products and services primarily target
customers in many vertical industries including government, professional services, restaurants, universities, utilities, gaming, retail and health care.



Total revenues from our merchant services and money transfer customers are as follows:

For a discussion of
revenues in the United States, Canada and Europe for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, see Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Merchant Services

Our merchant services offerings provide merchants and financial institutions with credit and debit card transaction processing, check services and
terminal management. We have two basic business models that we use to market our merchant services offerings. In one model, which we refer to as “direct” merchant services, we have a salaried and commissioned sales force, independent sales
organizations, or ISOs, and independent sales representatives, all of whom sell our end-to-end services directly to merchants. In the other model, which we refer to as “indirect” merchant services, we provide the same basic products and
services as direct merchant services, primarily to financial institutions on an unbundled basis, that in turn resell our products and their services to their merchants. Our direct merchant service offering is marketed in the United States and Canada
and our indirect merchant service offering is marketed in the United States, Canada and Central and Eastern Europe.

For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2004, approximately 79% of our total revenue arose from direct merchant services and approximately 12% arose from
indirect merchant services. Direct merchant services revenue is generated on services primarily priced as a percentage of transaction value, whereas indirect merchant services revenue is generated on services primarily priced on a specified amount
per transaction. In both merchant services models, we also charge for other processing fees unrelated to the number of transactions or the transaction value.

Direct Merchant Services

We market our services through a variety of sales channels that includes a dedicated sales force, ISOs, an internal telesales group, trade associations,
alliance and agent bank relationships, retail outlets and financial institutions. In addition to receiving referrals from approximately 1,600 bank branch locations in Canada, we have affiliations with more than 300 organizations, including financial
institutions and trade associations, and approximately 300 Certified Application Providers, or CAPs, in the United States that provide sales leads. Additionally, we market directly to customers through print advertising and direct mail efforts. We
also participate in major industry tradeshow and publicity events and actively employ various public relations campaigns. We pursue this strategy because we believe that it utilizes one of the lowest delivery cost systems available to successfully
acquire target customers.

Credit and Debit Card Transaction
Processing

Credit and debit card transaction processing
includes consumer credit card, on-line and off-line debit card, private label, gift and loyalty card and electronic benefits transfer program processing. Credit and debit card processing describes a consumer acquiring goods or services from a
merchant, and using a card as the form of payment. The term merchant generally refers to any organization that accepts credit or debit cards for the payment of goods and services, such as retail stores, both physical locations and internet sites,
restaurants, universities, and government agencies. We are primarily the intermediary between the merchant and the card associations and debit networks or individual financial institutions. Our value-added services allow us to leverage our scale to
concentrate high-volume transactions for many merchant customers to access the card associations and debit networks at a significantly lower cost.

Although card transactions may appear to be simple, a transaction requires a complex process involving various participants in a series of electronic
connections. Aside from electronic transaction payment processors,



also known as merchant acquirers, such as Global Payments, participants in this process include card issuers, merchants, cardholders, and card associations.
Card issuers are financial institutions that issue credit and debit cards to approved applicants and are identifiable by their trade name typically imprinted on the issued cards.

An approved applicant for a credit or debit card from a card issuer is referred to as a cardholder, and may be any entity
for which an issuer wishes to extend a line of credit, such as a consumer, corporation, or government agency. The cardholder may use the card at any merchant location that meets the qualification standards of the card associations, known as
MasterCard and VISA, or other cards such as American Express, Discover, Diners Club, etc. and debit networks such as STAR, NYCE, and PULSE in the United States and Interac in Canada.

The card associations and debit networks consist of members, generally financial institutions, who establish uniform
regulations that govern much of the industry. During a typical card transaction, the merchant and the card issuer do not interface directly with each other, but instead rely on merchant acquirers, such as Global Payments, and card associations to
exchange the required information and funds. We perform a series of services including authorization, electronic draft capture, funds settlement and certain exception-based, back office support services such as chargeback and retrieval resolution.
The following is a more detailed description of credit and debit card transactions:

A card transaction begins when a cardholder presents a card for payment at a merchant location and the merchant swipes the card’s magnetic strip through a point of sale, or POS, terminal card reader, which may be
provided by Global Payments through our terminal management offering. Alternatively, card and transaction information may be captured and transmitted to our network through a POS device by one of a number of products that we offer directly or
through a CAP. For a credit card transaction, authorization services generally refer to the process in which the card issuer indicates whether a particular credit card is authentic and whether the impending transaction value will cause the
cardholder to exceed defined limits. The terminal electronically records sales draft information, such as the credit card identification number, transaction date, and dollar value of the goods or services purchased. Debit card payments differ
slightly from traditional credit card transactions in that the cardholder is required to have sufficient funds available in a deposit account at the time of the transaction, or the debit card transaction will not be authorized. PIN-based or on-line
debit transactions are sent through a debit network, while signature-based, off-line debit, or check card transactions are sent through card associations and require a signature at the time of purchase. Also, PIN-based or on-line debit transactions
typically deduct the purchase amount from the cardholder’s deposit account within a day of the purchase, depending on the time of the purchase. Signature-based, off-line debit, or check card transactions typically debit the cardholder’s
deposit account two to three days after the purchase, although the funds are “held” with a memo posted to the cardholder’s bank account. A credit card posts to a cardholder’s account, reducing the available credit limit in a
similar manner.

After the card and transaction information is
captured by the POS device, the terminal automatically either dials a pre-programmed phone number or otherwise connects to our network, such as through the internet or a leased line, in order to receive authorization of the transaction. We route the
request to the applicable card association or debit network. The card association or debit network forwards the authorization request to the card issuer, who determines a response based on the status of the cardholder’s account. The response is
returned to the merchant’s terminal via the same communication network. This entire authorization and response process occurs within seconds from the time the merchant swipes the cardholder’s card through the point of sale terminal card
reader.

Electronic draft capture is the process of
transferring sales draft data into electronic format so that it may be sent through networks for clearing and settlement. The card associations use a system known as interchange, in the case of credit and check cards, and financial institutions use
the debit networks, in the case of debit cards, to transfer the information and funds between the card issuers and us to complete the link between merchants and card issuers.

In order to perform funds settlement, merchant acquirers that are not financial institutions and members of the card
associations require sponsorship from a financial institution which is also a member of the card



associations. As an independent merchant acquirer, we have financial institution sponsors in the United States and Canada with whom we have sponsorship or
depository and processing agreements. These agreements allow us to use the banks’ identification numbers, or BIN and ICA, to clear credit card transactions through VISA and MasterCard, respectively.

Funds settlement refers to the process of transferring funds for sales and
credits between cardholders and merchants, including the final debiting of a cardholder’s account and crediting of a merchant’s account for a sales transaction. Depending on the type of transaction, either the interchange system or the
debit networks are used to transfer the information and funds between electronic transaction payment processors and card issuers, to complete the link between merchants and card issuers. We use our network telecommunication infrastructure and the
Federal Reserve’s Automated Clearing House system, or ACH, in the United States and the Automated Clearing Settlement System, and the Large Value Transfer System, both in Canada, to ensure that our merchants receive the proper funds due to them
for the value of the goods or services that the cardholder purchased. In the United States, merchant funding primarily occurs after we receive the funds from the card issuer. This business model differs from the business model followed in Canada,
where for most merchants we advance payment for credit and debit card transactions before receiving the interchange or debit transaction reimbursement from the card issuers. Each participant in the transaction process receives compensation for their
services.

As an illustration, on a $100.00 credit card
transaction, the card issuer may fund us $98.50 after retaining approximately $1.50 referred to as an interchange fee. The card issuer seeks reimbursement of $100.00 from the cardholder in the cardholder’s monthly credit card bill. We would, in
turn, pay the merchant $100.00 and pay assessment fees to the card association of approximately $0.10. After the end of the month, we would bill the merchant a percentage of the transaction, or discount, to cover the full amount of the interchange
fee, assessment fee and our net revenue from the transaction. If our net revenue from the merchant in the above example was 40 basis points, we would bill the merchant $2.00 at the end of the month for the transaction, reimburse ourselves for
approximately $1.50 in interchange fees and retain $0.50 as our net revenue for the transaction, while the assessment fee is charged to our cost of services operating expense. Our gross profit on the transaction reflects the net revenue less
operating expenses, including the network and systems cost to process the transaction and commissions paid to our sales force or ISO.

In addition to the card processing services described above, we also process retrieval requests on behalf of merchants for issuing banks and provide
chargeback resolution services, both of which relate to cardholders disputing an amount that has been charged to their credit card. We review the dispute and handle the related exchange of information and funds between the merchant and the card
issuer if a charge is to be reversed. As a result of our financial institution sponsorship and the terms of our standard merchants’ agreement, our direct merchant services customers have the liability for any charges properly reversed by the
cardholder. In the event, however, that we are not able to collect such amount from the merchants, due to merchant fraud, insolvency, bankruptcy or any other reason, we may be liable for any such reversed charges. We utilize a number of systems and
procedures to manage merchant risk. Our risk management services include credit underwriting, credit scoring, fraud control, account processing, and collections. In addition, we may require cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit and other
types of collateral by certain merchants to minimize any such contingent liability; however, we historically have experienced some losses due to merchant defaults.

Check Services

Our check products offer merchant customers risk management alternatives, in the case of verification and recovery, or risk elimination, in the case of
guarantee, by leveraging our internal and external databases of checkwriters to help decide whether the merchant should accept a check as the form of payment from a particular checkwriter.

Check guarantee services include comprehensive check verification and
guarantee services designed for a merchant’s specific needs and risk adversity. This service offering guarantees payment of all checks that are electronically verified (primarily using point-of-sale check readers) through our extensive
databases, which allows merchants to expand their revenue base by applying less stringent requirements when accepting checks



from consumers. If a verified check is dishonored, our check guarantee service generally provides the merchant with reimbursement of the check’s face
value, and then we pursue collection of the check through our internal collection services. While we have the right to collect the full amount of the check from the checkwriter, we have not historically recovered 100% of the guaranteed checks. To
protect against this risk, we use verification databases that contain information on historical delinquent check writing activity and up-to-date consumer bank account status. We derive revenue for these services primarily by charging the merchant a
percentage of the face value of each guaranteed check.

Check
verification and recovery services are similar to those provided in the check guarantee service, except that this service does not guarantee payment of the verified checks. This service provides a low-cost, loss-reduction solution for merchants
wishing to quickly measure a customer’s check worthiness at the point of sale, while not having to incur the additional expense of check guarantee services. We derive revenue for these services primarily from the service fees collected from
delinquent check writers, fees charged to merchants based on a transaction rate per verified check, and fees charged to merchants for specialized services, such as electronic re-deposits of dishonored checks.

In the specialized vertical market of gaming, our VIP Preferred proprietary
software product provides the gaming industry with the tools necessary to establish revolving check cashing limits for the casinos’ customers. VIP Preferred also offers an electronic check option, VIP Preferred e-Check, which eliminates the
need for paper checks as part of the VIP Preferred suite of products. Our gaming products allow fast access to cash with high limits so that gaming establishments can increase money to the gaming floors and eliminate risk. We derive revenue from our
gaming products primarily based on a percentage of the transaction value.

Indirect Merchant Services

In our indirect merchant services business model, we market unbundled products and services primarily to financial institutions that in turn resell our products and their services to their merchants. The primary
service offering in this business model is credit and debit card transaction processing. These products and services are identical with those offered under our direct merchant services business model. We primarily perform authorization, electronic
draft capture and file transfer services for our indirect merchant services customers. In addition, we may perform merchant accounting and other back office services. The primary differences between indirect merchant services credit and debit card
transaction processing and direct merchant services are those relating to funds settlement and financial institution sponsorship. Our indirect merchant services customers perform their own funds settlement and either have their own BIN/ICA or
financial institution sponsorship. Since we are not party to the financial institution sponsorship, we do not have a potential liability for any charges properly reversed by the cardholder.

Our merchant accounting services provide information primarily for our
indirect merchant services customers to monitor portfolio performance, control expenses, disseminate information, and track profitability through the production and distribution of detailed statements summarizing electronic transaction payment
processing activity. Our risk management services allow financial institutions to monitor credit and transaction risk, thereby enhancing the profitability of their merchant portfolios. Our risk management services include credit underwriting, credit
scoring, fraud control, account processing, and collections.

In Europe, we provide these indirect merchant services through our MUZO subsidiary. In addition MUZO provides sales, installation, and servicing of ATM and POS terminals, and card-issuing services. Our card issuing services in Europe
include card database management and card personalization.

Terminal Management

Our
terminal management offering supports both the direct and indirect merchant services business models. This offering provides a variety of products and services relating to electronic transaction payment processing equipment, such as terminal
programming and deployment, set-up and telephone training, maintenance and equipment replacement, warehousing and inventory control, customer service, technical support, customized reporting, and conversions. We provide these services directly to
our own portfolio of merchants to support our



credit and debit card transaction processing and check services. We also provide these services indirectly to merchants on behalf of a limited number of our
financial institution and independent sales organization customers. We derive revenue from equipment sales and rentals, programming and deployment fees, and repairs and maintenance services.

Money Transfer

Our money transfer product and service offerings include a variety of
services such as consumer-to-consumer money transfer, financial electronic data interchange, or EDI, account balance reporting, management information and deposit reporting. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2004, approximately 9% of our total
revenue arose from money transfer services.

Consumer-To-Consumer Money Transfer

Following the DolEx acquisition, a majority of the revenue derived from our money transfer offering consists of our consumer-to-consumer electronic money transfer services marketed to the growing population of first and second generation
Latin Americans living in the United States. This part of the population regularly transfers money to their family and friends living in Latin America. We operate over 620 originating retail branch locations in the United States and have settlement
arrangements in Latin America with approximately 10,000 bank, exchange house and retail locations. DolEx was founded in 1996, primarily by its current management team. The consumer-to-consumer money transfer service offering is primarily driven by
transaction levels and unit pricing. Our business strategy is to competitively price our services, provide a timely and quality service, diversify our services through our customer loyalty program and increase our physical presence through
additional originating branch locations and expansion into other settlement countries, which we believe will further expand our customer base and increase our market share.

In a typical consumer-to-consumer money transfer transaction, a customer visits one of our originating branch locations and
pays a fee based on the nature and amount of the transaction performed on the customer’s behalf. In addition, the customer is quoted a retail exchange rate when the money transfer transaction is requested. The customer will receive a receipt
that includes the amount the beneficiary will receive, the retail exchange rate, money transfer fee, settlement location and total amount that needs to be remitted to DolEx. Once the transaction is completed at the originating branch location, our
call center contacts the beneficiary to provide an identification number, settlement location, and the amount to enable the recipient to claim the money transferred in its name. We earn additional revenue based on the difference between the retail
exchange rate that is quoted and the wholesale exchange rate when the currency is purchased in much larger denominations than the individual customer’s transaction. Each business day, we determine the amount of currency needed to settle daily,
bid the wholesale exchange rates based on the amount needed and purchase currency at the best available rates.

Business-To-Business Money Transfer

Our money transfer products and services also provide financial, management and operational data to financial institutions, corporations and government
agencies worldwide and allow these organizations to exchange the information with financial institutions and other service providers. We also provide EDI tax filing and Internet tax payment services that allow financial institutions and government
agencies to offer corporate taxpayers a secure and convenient method of paying taxes electronically. Tax payment security is handled through both SSL encryption/decryption and multi-level password access and operates through a web site that serves
as the portal for securely receiving tax information and delivering the transaction for payment. Our business-to-business money transfer services are primarily priced based on a rate per transaction processed.

Employees

As of June 30, 2004, we and our subsidiaries had approximately 3,500 employees. Many of our employees are highly skilled in
technical areas specific to electronic transaction payment processing and consumer-to-consumer money transfer. We believe that our current and future operations depend substantially on retaining our key technical employees.



Competition

Merchant Services

Our primary competitors in the electronic transaction payment processing industry include other merchant acquirers, as well as major national and regional
financial institution processors and ISOs, some of which are our customers. Certain of these companies are privately held, and the majority of those that are publicly held do not release the information necessary to precisely quantify our relative
competitive position. As an independent merchant acquirer, our principal affiliation with financial institutions relates to the sponsorship that enables our access to the card associations and debit networks. We believe an independent merchant
acquirer, such as Global Payments, will tend to be a merchant customer advocate, as there is no other relationship with a card issuing business or cardholder customer service, which is typical of a financial institution processor. Also, a financial
institution processor sales channel is primarily based on referrals within the institution, to further leverage a customer relationship, while an independent processor or ISO will tend to be focused on sales from all channels, including internally
generated leads. Finally, a financial institution processor may not have the same executive focus on a merchant acquiring business, as the business is not core to the total revenues of the financial institution. We primarily differ from ISOs in that
we have our own platform and financial institution sponsorship agreements.

Based on industry publications such as

The Nilson Report

, dated April 2004, we are a leading, mid-market merchant acquirer in the United States. According to that report, one of our competitors, First Data
Corporation and its affiliates, is the largest electronic transaction payment processor in the United States.

Our primary competitor in Canada is Moneris Solutions, which we believe has a slightly larger share of the Canadian merchant acquirer’s market based
on merchant dollar volume. Moneris Solutions is a joint investment of the Royal Bank of Canada and the Bank of Montreal. However, we believe that we are the largest publicly traded independent processor in Canada.

We service all industry segments and specialize in the direct merchant
services, mid-market segment in the United States and the large and mid-market segment in Canada. We define mid-market as a merchant with an average of $150,000 to $300,000 in annual VISA and/or MasterCard volume. Many of our ISO relationships
provide merchant referrals in the small-market segment, with average annual VISA and/or MasterCard volumes below $150,000. National accounts or large-market merchants that we serve average between $3.0 million to $10.0 million in annual VISA and/or
MasterCard volume.

Our primary strategy to distinguish
ourselves from our competitors focuses on offering a variety of electronic transaction payment processing solutions to our customers. These enhanced services involve vertical market and sophisticated reporting features that add value to the
information obtained from our electronic transaction payment processing databases. We believe that our knowledge of these specific markets, the size and effectiveness of our dedicated sales force, affiliations with trade associations, agent banks
and CAPs, our ability to offer specific, integrated solutions to our customers, including hardware, software, processing, and network facilities, and our flexibility in packaging these products are positive factors that enhance our competitive
position.

Money Transfer

Our primary competitors in the consumer-to-consumer money transfer offering
are more diversified, with a broader international reach. We believe our service offering ranks fourth in dollar volume transferred from the United States to Latin America. In addition, many of our competitors use agency agreements with third
parties, at the point of sale, to collect funds and input transaction data. We generally use a fixed-cost, branch-owned model, at the point of sale, rather than a variable-cost, agent-based model. We believe this model enhances our growth strategy,
as higher transaction levels may provide significant future leverage.

The most significant competitive factors relating to our consumer-to-consumer money transfer offering include customer service, quality, value-added features, functionality, price, reliability, the breadth and



effectiveness of our distribution channel, and the manner in which we deliver our services. These competitive factors will continue to change as new
distribution channels and alternative payment solutions are developed by our competitors and us. For instance, we believe the electronic money transfer offerings may evolve from a cash-based solution to a card-based solution at the origination and
settlement points in the transaction process. Our ability to effectively compete in the marketplace depends on our ability to adapt to these technological and competitive advancements. We believe our knowledge of the industry, our relative size, and
our branched-owned model gives us an advantage over our competitors when adapting to these changes.

Industry Overview and Target Markets

Industry Overview

Payment processing service
providers, such as Global Payments, provide high volume electronic transaction payment processing and support services directly to financial institutions, merchants, and independent sales organizations. As a general rule, the payment processing
market in the United States and Canada continues to transition from traditional financial institution providers to independent merchant acquirers. We believe merchants seek more efficient distribution channels, as well as increased technological
capabilities required for the rapid and efficient creation, processing, handling, storage, and retrieval of information.

In Europe, financial institutions remain the dominant provider of payment processing services to merchants, although the outsourcing of back-end
processing services to third party service providers is becoming more prevalent. Throughout all markets, processing services have become increasingly complex, requiring significant capital commitments to develop, maintain and update the systems
necessary to provide these advanced services at a competitive price.

Global Payments also provides money transfer services to Latinos in the United States sending money to Latin America. Our main service to these customers involves the electronic transfer of money to their families in Latin America. Unlike
our major competitors in the Latin American corridor that operate an agent-based network, we generally utilize a branch-owned network strategy at the point of sale. We believe that this differentiation allows us to be more flexible and competitive
when setting our prices and introducing new products and services.

As a result of continued growth in our industry, several large merchant acquirers, including us, have expanded operations both domestically and internationally. This expansion has come in the form of acquisitions, and the creation of
alliances and joint ventures. We believe that the electronic payment transaction processing and money transfer industries will continue to consolidate as banks and independent processors that do not have the necessary infrastructure to participate
in a highly competitive environment look to exit the business.

VISA, through its member banks, has recently announced that it will begin offering cards containing chip technology in Canada. Chip technology can securely store and encrypt confidential information. The chip is difficult to copy and has
the power to be programmed with spending and usage limits, making it possible to authorize transactions off-line. Chip technology will enable a host of additional features including applications such as loyalty, access control, rewards, and public
transit passes. We expect that it will take up to five years for all participants to implement the equipment necessary to accept and process the chip card compliant transactions in the Canadian marketplace. We have been working to develop a
long-term plan to ensure our merchants will benefit from the migration to chip technology in the Canadian market. We believe that the technology acquired as part of the MUZO acquisition will contribute to our ability to timely migrate our Canadian
platform to chip card compliant technology.

We believe the
number of electronic transactions will continue to grow in the future and that an increasing percentage of these transactions will be processed through emerging technologies. To help our customers reduce their transaction costs and speed up the
transaction approval process, we have integrated new technologies into our service offerings such as Internet protocol communications and check truncation or conversion at the point of sale. As new technologies like radio frequency identification or
contactless payment card continue to evolve, we plan to develop new products and services that will exploit the benefits that these new technologies can offer our



customers. We also believe that new emerging markets will continue to develop in areas that have been previously dominated by paper-based transactions.
Industries such as quick service restaurants, government, recurring payments, and business-to-business, should continue to see transaction volumes migrate to more electronic-based settlement solutions. We believe that the continued development of
new products and services and the emergence of new vertical markets will be a significant factor in the growth of our business for the foreseeable future.

Target Markets

We believe that significant global opportunities exist for continued growth in the application of electronic transaction payment processing and money
transfer services. Although the United States accounts for the largest payment processing volume in the world, global expansion by financial institutions into new geographies and the increased recognition by governments for the ability of payment
cards to facilitate economic growth, is rapidly transforming the electronic commerce market into a global payments opportunity. Additionally, positive migration trends led by the rapid globalization of the economy are also leading the way for
increased electronic money transfer opportunities.

The rapid
growth of retail credit card transactions, as well as the increased utilization of debit cards, directly correlates with the historic growth of our business. According to VISA and MasterCard, worldwide annual purchase volume increased 18% to over
$2.8 trillion in 2003 which equates to approximately 12% of the $22 trillion in worldwide personal consumption expenditures.

In the United States,

The Nilson Report

dated February 2004 estimates that more than $1.3 trillion of annual consumer spending is charged using
VISA and MasterCard cards. Based on figures reported in

The Nilson Report

dated May 2004, we also believe that over $197 billion (U.S.) of annual Canadian consumer spending uses VISA, MasterCard or debit as the form of payment. In Europe,
credit card utilization remains underdeveloped relative to the two most developed credit markets in the world, the United States and United Kingdom. According to a 2003 report by

Lafferty

, if European spending patterns grew to half of the
penetration rate and spending levels of the United States market, there would be an $800 billion credit card processing volume opportunity for our industry.

Equally as attractive has been the increase in the number of international immigrants, which the United Nations Population Division estimates has
increased from 75 million in 1965 to 175 million at the end of 2003. The World Bank estimates that $111 billion was remitted worldwide in 2001 with over 50% of the volume originating in the United States. We estimate that approximately 35 million
immigrants reside within the United States, of which over 50% are from Latin America. According to a March 2004 report released by the Inter-American Development Bank, the expected value of electronic money transfer remittances to the Latin American
market at the end of 2003 was estimated to be almost $38 billion and it has been estimated that the Latin American market will continue to grow at over 10% per year for at least the next five years.

Strategy

In pursuing our business strategy, we seek to increase our penetration in existing markets, expand into new geographic
regions as represented by our acquisition of MUZO in the Czech Republic, and expand into new payment areas as represented by our acquisition of DolEx in the electronic money transfer service industry. We believe that this strategy provides us with
the greatest opportunity to expand our existing business, leverage our existing infrastructure, and maintain a consistent base of recurring revenues, thereby maximizing shareholder equity and acquisition returns on investment. We intend to
accomplish this overall strategy as follows:

Existing offerings

In pursuing this business strategy, we intend to
increase our penetration of existing markets and to further leverage our infrastructure. Our objectives to execute this strategy include the following:

•

expand distribution channels, primarily direct merchant services, ISOs, and CAPs;



•

provide the best possible customer service at levels that exceed our competitors by investing in technology, training and product enhancements;

•

grow our direct merchant services, domestic and Canadian market share by concentrating on the mid-market segment in the United States and on the small and mid-market segment in
Canada;

•

grow our consumer-to-consumer money transfer customer base and market share by expanding our branch locations and offering competitive pricing;

•

provide the latest, secure, enhanced products and services by developing value-added applications, enhancing existing products, and developing new systems and services to blend
technology with our customer needs;

•

focus on potential domestic and international acquisitions or investments and alliances with companies that have high growth and operate in profitable sectors of payments-related
industries through compatible products and services, development capabilities and distribution capabilities.

International markets

We intend to focus on further diversification in international markets with geographic areas of payments industry growth, such as Latin America, the
European Union, Central and Eastern Europe and the Asia Pacific region. We are evaluating these markets due to the following attractive characteristics:

•

current low but growing credit and debit card utilization;

•

money transfer opportunities;

•

the absence of a dominant merchant acquirer and;

•

potential to satisfy our acquisition strategy.

Infrastructure

Our focus on the existing infrastructure will center on attracting, developing and retaining talent to execute our strategy and migrate our systems to
leading edge technology. We intend to continue systems integrations, primarily the consolidation of operating platforms. In addition, we expect to increase management focus on employee investments.

Maximize corporate returns

Finally, we believe we will maximize corporate returns by leveraging our
core technology and operational capabilities and continue cost reduction initiatives to maximize shareholder equity and acquisition returns on investment.

Banking Regulations

As of the date of this report, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, or CIBC, owns approximately 16% of our outstanding common stock. As a result of
CIBC’s equity interest in our company, we are considered a subsidiary of CIBC for U.S. bank regulatory purposes. CIBC is a Canadian Bank with operations in the United States. Accordingly, CIBC is regulated in the U.S. as a foreign bank and, as
a result, is subject to most of the same limitations as a U.S. bank holding company under provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act. As a subsidiary of CIBC for U.S. bank regulatory purposes, we are subject to those same regulations. We are also
subject to examination by the Federal Reserve Board. As a general matter, we are able to operate our merchant services and money transfer businesses as we have historically, but our ability to expand into unrelated businesses may be limited unless
they are activities that the Bank Holding Company Act allows or the Federal Reserve Board approves.

Bank holding companies may engage in the business of banking, managing and controlling banks, and in other activities so closely related to managing and
controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. The



Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, enacted in 1999, amended the Bank Holding Company Act to allow greater operational flexibility for bank holding companies whose U.S.
depository institution subsidiaries are well-capitalized, well-managed and meet certain other conditions. Such companies are referred to as “financial holding companies”. A foreign bank also may qualify as a financial holding company if it
(as well as any foreign bank affiliate that maintains a U.S. branch, agency, or commercial lending company) is well-capitalized and well-managed. Financial holding companies may engage in activities that are financial in nature, or that are
incidental or complimentary to financial activities. The legislation defines securities and insurance activities as being permissible financial activities, allows certain merchant banking activities, and establishes a procedure for the Federal
Reserve Board, together with the U.S. Treasury Department, to announce additional permissible activities.

As a foreign bank, CIBC may qualify for financial holding company status and has done so. If a financial holding company falls out of compliance with the
well-managed, well-capitalized, or other requirements, it must enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve to rectify the situation. The Federal Reserve may refuse to allow the financial holding company, which would include its subsidiaries, to
engage in new “financial” activities may require it to cease current “financial” activities and may require it to divest its bank.

The merchant services and money transfer businesses that we conduct are permissible activities for bank holding companies (as well as financial holding
companies) under U.S. law, and we do not expect the limitations described above to adversely affect our current operations. It is possible, however, that these restrictions might limit our ability to enter other businesses that we may wish to engage
in at some time in the future. It is also possible that these laws may be amended in the future, or new laws or regulations may be adopted, which could adversely affect our ability to engage in our current or additional businesses.

Additionally, CIBC is subject to the

Bank Act

(Canada), which, among
other things, limits the types of business which CIBC may conduct, directly or indirectly, and the types of investments which CIBC may make. CIBC’s shareholding in our company is currently permitted under the

Bank Act.

Under the

Bank Act

, CIBC is permitted to continue to hold its interest
in us, as long as the business undertaken by us is consistent with the applicable provisions of the

Bank Act

. If we undertake businesses inconsistent with the businesses in which CIBC is permitted to hold an interest, CIBC may be required,
pursuant to the provisions of the

Bank Act

, to dispose of its shares.

We have agreed with CIBC, in effect, that we will not undertake any business inconsistent with the applicable provisions of the

Bank Act.

We do not anticipate that compliance with this undertaking will affect,
in any material way, our ability to carry on the merchant services and funds transfer businesses. Our ability to expand into other businesses will be governed by the undertaking and the applicable provisions of Canadian banking legislation at the
relevant time.

The Office of the Superintendent of Financial
Institutions (Canada), or OSFI, has recently ruled that it considers the provision of our consumer electronic money transfer business, albeit conducted outside of Canada, to be a business that is to a significant extent the business of banking and
that we are therefore a foreign bank as defined in the

Bank Act

. Following receipt of this OSFI ruling, we applied for and received an exemption order which exempts us from most of the foreign bank provisions of the

Bank Act

. As a
result of receiving this exemption order, we do not believe that OSFI’s determination that we are a foreign bank under the

Bank

Act will affect, in any material way, our ability to carry on the merchant services and funds transfer
businesses in Canada or to expand into other non-banking businesses. However, there is no assurance that subsequent amendments to the

Bank Act

would not adversely affect our ability to carry on our business in Canada as it is conducted today.
Except as discussed above, the

Bank Act

does not otherwise apply to us.

Money Transfer Licensing and Regulations

In
the United States, most states license consumer money transfer service providers and issuers of money orders such as DolEx. The applicable state statutes and regulations typically require DolEx to obtain and



maintain certain required licenses as a condition to performing these activities. These statutes and regulations generally require DolEx to: (a) satisfy
minimum net worth requirements, (b) procure and maintain a surety bond with minimum statutory levels of coverage, (c) demonstrate the character and fitness of the officers and directors DolEx, and (d) subject itself to periodic financial audits.

The consumer money transfer service offering also is subject
to regulation in the United States by various agencies of the federal government, which have been charged with implementing anti-money laundering statutes and certain restrictions on transactions to or from certain individuals, entities or countries
in order to combat terrorism. In addition, the money transfer service offering is subject to some form of regulation in each of the Latin American settlement countries in which DolEx offers its services. These regulations include limitations on what
types of entities may offer money transfer services, limitations on the amount of principal that can be moved into or out of a country, limitations on the number of money transfers that may be received by a customer, limitations on the exchange
rates between foreign currencies, and regulations intended to help detect and prevent money laundering. DolEx has developed compliance programs to monitor regulatory requirements and developments, and to implement policies and procedures to help
satisfy these requirements. In addition, DolEx’s use of a branch network in the U.S. for the origination of electronic money transfers rather than an agent model typically utilized by our larger competitors allows greater control over our
regulatory compliance.

ITEM 2—PROPERTIES

The
following summarizes the type of facilities being utilized as of May 31, 2004:

The principal
facilities in the United States are located in Atlanta, Georgia; Dallas, Texas; Owings Mills, Maryland; Niles, Illinois and St. Louis, Missouri. Our principal international facilities are located in Mexico City, Mexico; Monterrey, Mexico; Prague,
Czech Republic and Toronto, Canada. The majority of our sales facilities are DolEx originating retail branches.

We believe that all of our facilities and equipment are suitable and adequate for our business as presently conducted.

ITEM 3—LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We
are party to a number of claims and lawsuits incidental to the normal course of our business. In our opinion, the ultimate outcome of such matters, in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, liquidity or
results of operations. For additional information, refer to “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the section entitled “Airlines”.

ITEM 4—SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matters were submitted to a vote of our shareholders during our fourth quarter ended May 31, 2004.

—FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” appearing elsewhere in this annual report.

General

We are a leading payments company. As a high-volume processor of electronic transactions, we enable consumers, corporations,
government agencies and other profit and non-profit business enterprises to facilitate payments to purchase goods and services or further other economic goals. Our role is to serve as an intermediary in the exchange of information and funds that
must occur between parties so that a transaction can be completed. Including our time as part of National Data Corporation, now known as NDCHealth or NDC, we have provided transaction processing services since 1967. We were incorporated in Georgia
as Global Payments Inc. in September 2000.

We market our
products and services throughout the United States, Canada and Europe, and we also conduct business in Latin America in connection with our money transfer product offering. We operate in one business segment, electronic transaction payment
processing, and provide products and services through our merchant services and money transfer offerings. Our products and services primarily target customers in many vertical industries including government, professional services, restaurants,
universities, utilities, gaming, retail and health care.

Our
merchant services offerings provide merchants and financial institutions with credit and debit card transaction processing, check services and terminal management. We have two basic business models that we use to market our merchant services
offerings. In one model, which we refer to as “direct” merchant services, we have a salaried and commissioned sales force, ISOs, and independent sales representatives, all of whom sell our end-to-end services directly to merchants. In the
other model, which we refer to as “indirect” merchant services, we provide the same basic products and services as direct merchant services, primarily to financial institutions on an unbundled basis, that in turn resell our products and
their services to their merchants. Our direct merchant services offering is marketed in the United States and Canada, and our indirect merchant services are marketed in the United States, Canada and Central and Eastern Europe.

For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2004, approximately 79% of our total
revenue arose from direct merchant services and approximately 12% arose from indirect merchant services. Direct merchant services revenue is generated on services primarily priced as a percentage of transaction value, whereas indirect merchant
services revenue is generated on services primarily priced on a specified amount per transaction. In both merchant services models, we also charge for other processing fees unrelated to the number of transactions or the transaction value.

Our money transfer product and service offerings include a
variety of services such as consumer-to-consumer money transfer, financial electronic data interchange, or EDI, account balance reporting, management information and deposit reporting. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2004, approximately 9% of our
total revenue arose from money transfer services.

Our products
and services are marketed through a variety of distinct sales channels that include a large, dedicated direct sales force, ISOs, independent sales representatives and an internal telesales group, originating retail branch outlets, trade
associations, alliance bank relationships and financial institutions.



Executive Overview

We reported strong financial results for fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2004, revenue increased $113.2 million or 22% to $629.3 million from $516.1 million in
fiscal 2003. Revenue growth was primarily driven by the growth in our direct merchant service offering in the United States and acquisitions closed in fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of our acquisitions in fiscal 2004, our revenue grew 12%
compared to fiscal 2003. Operating income was $112.9 million for fiscal 2004, compared to $93.3 million in the prior year’s comparable period, which resulted in a decrease in operating margin from 18.1% for fiscal 2003 to 17.9% for fiscal 2004.
Net income increased $9.1 million or 17% to $62.4 million in fiscal 2004 from $53.3 million in the prior year’s comparable period, resulting in a $0.19 increase in diluted earnings per share from $1.41 in fiscal 2003 to $1.60 in fiscal 2004.

The operating income amounts reflect restructuring charges of
$9.6 million and $1.3 million in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, respectively. Operating income, excluding the effect of restructuring charges, increased $28.0 million or 30% to $122.5 million in fiscal 2004 from $94.5 million in fiscal 2003. Operating
margins excluding the effect of restructuring charges increased from 18.3% in fiscal 2003 to 19.5% in fiscal 2004. Net income, excluding the impact of the restructuring and other charges, increased by $14.4 million or 27% to $68.5 million in fiscal
2004 from $54.1 million in fiscal 2003 and diluted earnings per share, on the same basis, increased $0.33 or 23% to $1.76 in fiscal 2004 from $1.43 in fiscal 2003. Management believes that reporting such results without inclusion of the
restructuring and other charges is useful to investors comparing the Company’s annual and quarterly performance to prior periods, and management uses such non-GAAP measures when internally evaluating the Company’s performance as well.

On November 12, 2003, we completed the acquisition of Latin
America Money Services, LLC (“LAMS”), a Delaware limited liability company which owned a majority of the outstanding equity interests in DolEx Dollar Express, Inc. (“DolEx”), a Texas corporation, and all but one share of the
outstanding equity interests in DolEx Envios, S.A. de C.V. (“DolEx Envios”), a Mexican subsidiary of DolEx. The transaction was structured as a merger of GP Ventures (Texas), Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of
Global Payments, into LAMS, with LAMS remaining as the surviving entity in the merger. We also acquired the remaining equity interests in DolEx that were not already owned by LAMS. We gave consideration of approximately $190.4 million for LAMS,
DolEx and DolEx Envios through a combination of $59.7 million in cash, net of cash acquired of $8.7 million, the issuance of $114.2 million in promissory notes payable to the order of the sellers, and the issuance of common stock with an approximate
fair value of $7.8 million based on the closing price of Global Payments Inc. common stock on the date the acquisition closed. On December 1, 2003, the Company repaid the promissory notes in full using its U.S. credit facility.

As a result of the transaction, LAMS, a holding company, is now a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Global Payments. DolEx, the operating company, is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of LAMS and DolEx Envios, the Mexican operating company, is now a majority-owned subsidiary of DolEx because one share of DolEx Envios is
owned by GP Finance, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Global Payments. We frequently refer to this transaction as the DolEx acquisition, since DolEx and DolEx Envios are the primary operating companies within the LAMS group. Concurrent with this
acquisition, we changed the name of our “funds transfer” service offering to “money transfer”. The acquisition expanded our money transfer service product offerings to include electronic consumer-to-consumer money transfer,
primarily in the United States to Latin American corridor. DolEx operates hundreds of originating retail branches located in the United States, and has settlement arrangements in Latin America with thousands of banks, exchange houses, and retail
locations.

On February 18, 2004, we acquired 52.6% of the
outstanding voting shares of MUZO, a.s. from Komerční banka, a.s., or KB, for $34.7 million in cash. Pursuant to Czech law, we completed a public tender offer on May 14, 2004 for the remaining shares of MUZO. The public tender offer
resulted in Global Payments obtaining 46,576 additional shares of MUZO for the equivalent of approximately $28.8 million in cash, bringing our ownership to 98.3% of the outstanding voting shares of MUZO. We have begun the process of acquiring the
remaining shares of MUZO in accordance with Czech law.

We
believe that MUZO is the largest indirect payment processor in the Czech Republic. Based in Prague, MUZO employs approximately 250 employees and has served as an indirect processor for financial institutions



since 1992. MUZO offers a comprehensive package of payment services including credit and debit card transaction processing services; sales, installation and
management of ATMs and POS devices; and card personalization.

Finally, in fiscal 2004, we substantially completed the relocation of our corporate functions in Atlanta, except for our data center, which we expect to relocate by March 2006. The primary purpose of the relocation was to comply with an IRS
requirement regarding our facility lease with NDCHealth, formerly known as National Data Corporation, which was our landlord and former parent company. We believe that this relocation is consistent with the tax-free nature of the spin-off from
NDCHealth which occurred on January 31, 2001.

Components of Income
Statement

We derive our revenues from three primary
sources: charges based on volumes and fees for services, charges based on transaction quantity, and equipment sales, leases and service fees. Revenues generated by these areas depend upon a number of factors, such as demand for and price of our
services, the technological competitiveness of our product offerings, our reputation for providing timely and reliable service, competition within our industry, and general economic conditions.

Cost of service consists primarily of the cost of operational-related
personnel, including those who monitor our transaction processing systems and settlement; transaction processing systems, including third-party services such as the costs of settlement channels for consumer-to-consumer money transfer services;
network telecommunications capability, depreciation and occupancy costs associated with the facilities performing these functions; and provisions for operating losses.

Sales, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales
personnel, non-revenue producing customer support functions and administrative employees and management, commissions to independent contractors and ISOs, advertising costs, other selling expenses, and occupancy of leased space directly related to
these functions.

Other income and expense primarily consist of
minority interest in earnings, interest income and expense and other miscellaneous items of income and expense.

Results of Operations

Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2004 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2003

In fiscal 2004, revenue increased $113.2 million or 22% to $629.3 million from $516.1 million in the prior year’s comparable period. We attribute
this revenue growth primarily to increases in our domestic direct merchant services offering and acquisitions closed in fiscal 2004. We intend to continue to grow our domestic and international presence, build our ISO sales channel, increase
customer satisfaction, assess opportunities for profitable acquisition growth, pursue enhanced products and services for our customers, and leverage our existing business model. We expect fiscal 2005 revenue of $722 million to $743 million,
reflecting growth of 15% to 18%, compared to $629.3 million in fiscal 2004.

The Company’s service offering revenues from external customers are as follows (dollars in millions):



Merchant services

Our merchant services offering revenue increased 14% in fiscal 2004. This revenue growth includes $10.2 million in revenue from the MUZO acquisition. We
continue to expect MUZO’s revenue to grow in the mid-to-high single-digit range for fiscal 2005 as we work on our strategy to expand MUZO into other geographic areas. These projections include the previously disclosed and expected loss of a
significant customer who provided notice of its intent to move the business prior to the closing of the MUZO acquisition which was previously disclosed.

We experienced continued growth in our domestic direct merchant channel by continuing to sign mid-market merchants in various vertical markets to maintain
our diversification. The increase in revenue reflects high-teen transaction growth in our domestic direct card merchant channel, primarily driven by increases in our ISO sales channel. We believe this transaction growth is compared favorably to
industry trends. According to

The Nilson Report

dated February 2004, industry growth averaged 12%. Our domestic average dollar value of transaction, or average ticket, remained stable and we experienced an increase in our domestic average
discount revenue per dollar value volume, or spread, for fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003.

Our Canadian transactions processed for fiscal 2004 grew in the low to mid-single digits compared to the prior year. This reflects the impact of the recent removal from our portfolio of certain lower margin, higher
risk merchants, such as airlines and travel agencies. The average ticket and spread in Canada declined in fiscal 2004 compared to the prior year. The declines in average ticket and spread are primarily due to the recent mix of merchant signings,
such as the addition of petroleum and grocery retailers, and the strategic removal of certain lower margin, higher risk merchants. The decline in Canadian revenue was more than offset by a stronger year-over-year Canadian currency exchange rate. We
expect stronger results in Canada as the impact from last summer’s SARs crisis and our decision to exit certain, higher risk, lower margin merchants annualize during fiscal 2005.

These revenue growth factors were partially offset by continued and expected high-teen declines in our domestic indirect
channel. These declines are attributed to the industry consolidation of financial institutions and competitive pricing pressures.

Money transfer

Our revenue growth from the money transfer offering in fiscal 2004 includes an additional $42.5 million relating to our DolEx acquisition completed on
November 12, 2003.

The consumer-to-consumer money transfer
service offering revenue is primarily driven by transaction levels and unit pricing. Consumer-to-consumer money transfer transactions for the year experienced double-digit growth, primarily due to continued industry growth, additional U.S.
originating branch locations, and a more competitive unit pricing strategy compared to the prior year. Our business strategy is to competitively price our money transfer services, which we believe will further expand our customer base and increase
our market share. Further, our use of fixed-cost employees rather than variable-cost agents at the originating point of sale enhances this strategy, as higher transaction levels will provide enhanced future leverage. For fiscal 2005, we anticipate
that revenue will expand in the low teens compared to fiscal 2004. In addition, we continue to expand our settlement reach throughout the Latin America market with approximately 10,000 convenient location choices for our customers.

Operating expenses

Cost of service increased by $29.1 million or 11% from $260.3 million in fiscal 2003 to $289.4 million in fiscal 2004. As a
percentage of revenue, cost of service decreased to 46% in fiscal 2004 from 50% in the prior year. This decrease in cost of service as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to the integration of our acquisitions, other cost reduction initiatives,
and the achievement of a greater economy of scale with our operating expenses. The increase in the cost of service expense is primarily attributable to the increased operating expenses and acquired intangible asset amortization through our recent
acquisitions.



Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by $56.1 million or 35% to $217.4 million in fiscal
2004 from $161.3 million in the prior year. As a percentage of revenue, these expenses increased to 35% for fiscal 2004 compared to 31% for fiscal 2003. The increase in sales, general and administrative expenses and the increase in such expenses as
a percentage of revenue is primarily due to growth in commission payments to ISOs resulting from the increased revenue in this sales channel. The ISO business generally produces lower margins than the other direct business due to the ongoing
commission payments to the ISOs. This commission model differs from our other sales channels where the commissions are paid for a finite period. In addition, these increases are attributed to ongoing investments made in our direct sales channels,
business development costs, and additional sales, general and administrative expenses inherited in connection with our recent acquisitions.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we announced the closure and consolidation of three operating facilities and their related functions into
existing operating centers. We implemented the plan in April 2003 and completed it in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Our facility closure plan included the following:

•

closing our Cleveland location which housed our merchant settlement function and consolidating it in our Baltimore facility;

•

relocating our terminal deployment and related services from our Winston-Salem facility to our Baltimore and St. Louis facilities; and

•

closing our Salt Lake City check operating facility and relocating to our primary check operating facility in Niles, Illinois.

In addition to these activities, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we
incurred restructuring costs of $2.7 million associated with the termination and position elimination of an executive officer.

Total costs and expenses associated with these activities were approximately $10.9 million. One-time employee termination benefits were approximately $8.4
million and the balance relates to contract termination and other related facility closure costs and expenses. In the fiscal years 2004 and 2003, we recognized net restructuring charges of $9.6 million and $1.3 million, respectively. See Note 10 in
the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information.

Operating income

Operating income increased
$19.6 million or 21% to $112.9 million for fiscal 2004 compared to $93.3 million in the prior fiscal year. This resulted in an operating margin of 17.9% for fiscal 2004 compared to 18.1% for fiscal 2003. This increase in operating income and related
margin decrease includes restructuring charges of $9.6 million or 1.5% of revenue and $1.3 million or 0.2% of revenue in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, respectively. The changes in operating income and operating margins are primarily due to the
revenue growth factors and benefits from acquisition integration and other cost factors described further above. These improvements are partially offset by the impact of restructuring charges. We anticipate an operating income margin of 19.5% to
19.8% for fiscal 2005.

Other income/expense

Other income/expense increased as a net expense by $5.1 million to $13.2
million for fiscal 2004 compared to $8.1 million in the prior fiscal year. This increase is primarily due to increases in the minority interest expense of $4.0 million resulting from the minority interest in earnings of MUZO (of which we owned 52.6%
from the acquisition date until May 14, 2004) and increases in earnings from our existing alliance with Comerica Bank in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003.

The increase in interest expense is due to additional borrowing in the second half of fiscal 2004 used to finance our acquisitions. The increases in other
expenses were partially offset by a gain of approximately $0.6 million from the sale of stock in an unrelated public company included in interest and other income. Global Payments initially received these shares in partial consideration for the sale
of a business in June 2000. Excluding the impact of the non-recurring gain from the stock sale, for fiscal 2005, we anticipate the net of our other income and expense to be approximately the same rate as fiscal 2004.



Net income

Net income increased $9.1 million or 17% to $62.4 million in fiscal 2004 from $53.3 million in the prior year, resulting in a $0.19 increase in diluted
earnings per share to $1.60 in fiscal 2004 from $1.41 in the prior fiscal year. This increase in net income and diluted earnings per share includes restructuring charges of $6.0 million, net of tax, or $0.16 diluted earnings per share and $0.8
million, net of tax, or $0.02 diluted earnings per share, in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, respectively. For fiscal 2005, we anticipate lowering our effective tax rate to 37.0% from 37.4% in the prior year, due to tax planning initiatives and the
impact of lower income tax rates in the Czech Republic. We expect diluted earnings per share to be $1.96 to $2.05 for fiscal 2005.

Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2003 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2002

In fiscal 2003, revenue increased $53.3 million or 12% to $516.1 million from $462.8 million in fiscal 2002. Revenue growth was primarily driven by the
growth in our direct merchant service offering in the United States and Canada. Excluding the impact of the National Bank portfolio acquisition that annualized in October 2002, and a stronger Canadian dollar relative to the prior year, our full year
revenue growth was approximately 8%. Domestically, our direct card transactions growth ranged in the mid-teens which compared favorably to market trends of 12% for credit and debit card growth per

The Nilson Report

dated March 2003. We
believe our transaction growth rates compared to the market trends, demonstrated that we continued to gain market share in both our domestic direct and ISO sales channels. Our domestic average dollar value of transaction and net revenue per
transaction remained stable for the year, which we believe was a result of our diversified mid-market segmentation. The number of Canadian transactions continued to grow in the mid to high single digits. In addition, our Canadian average dollar
value of transaction and net revenue per transaction held relatively constant as we continued to further penetrate the Canadian market and by cross-selling between our VISA and MasterCard portfolios. Historically, the transaction growth in Canada
was slower than our domestic transaction growth due to the maturity of the Canadian market. However, the revenue impact of slower Canada transaction growth in fiscal 2003 was slightly offset by the change in foreign exchange rates.

Our direct merchant service revenue growth was partially offset by expected
declines in the mid-teens of our indirect and money transfer businesses. The decline in revenue from indirect merchant services was primarily a result of the consolidating financial institution market. Revenue from the money transfer business
declined 10% to $12.3 million in fiscal 2003, compared to $13.7 million in fiscal 2002, partially due to the consolidation of our Operations in the United Kingdom and discontinuance of new business development activities through our Operations in
the United Kingdom, previously announced during our fiscal 2002 fourth quarter. We also eliminated non-recurring product revenue from our money transfer business.

Cost of service increased $8.2 million or 3% from $252.1 million in fiscal 2002 to $260.3 million in fiscal 2003. As a
percentage of revenue, cost of service decreased to 50% in fiscal 2003 from 54% in fiscal 2002. This decrease in cost of service as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the integration of our recent acquisitions and the implementation of
cost reduction initiatives, including facility consolidations.

The increase in cost of service expenses for fiscal 2003 from the prior year’s comparable period was primarily due to variable direct costs associated with the revenue increase, an increase in our provision for operating losses and
non-recurring conversion costs, such as duplicate labor, relating to the National Bank back-end conversion, completed in early October 2002. The increase in provision for operating losses in fiscal 2003 was a result of the increase in credit and
debit card volumes processed and losses associated with merchant fraud.

Sales, general and administrative expenses increased $33.0 million or 26% to $161.3 million in fiscal 2003 from $128.3 million in the prior year’s comparable period. As a percentage of revenue, these expenses increased to 31% for
fiscal 2003, compared to 28% for fiscal 2002.

The increase in
sales, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2003, compared to the prior year comparable period was due to growth in commission payments to ISOs and the higher level of sales infrastructure and related costs to grow revenue. The increase in
sales, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was due to the increase in ISO related commission payments. The ISO business generally produced lower margins than the other direct business due to the ongoing commission payments
to the ISOs.



In the fourth quarter fiscal 2003, we initiated the closure and consolidation of three operating
facilities and their related functions into existing operating centers. The fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2003 results included a net restructuring charge of $1.3 million related to the consolidation plan.

During fiscal 2002, we incurred restructuring and other charges of $11.0
million. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we completed plans for the closing of four locations including associated management and staff reductions. Of the $11.0 million in charges, $1.5 million related to facility closing costs; $6.7
million related to severance and related costs; and $2.8 million related to other costs. See Note 10 in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” appearing elsewhere in this report for more details on the restructuring and other
charges incurred in both fiscal years.

Operating income was
$93.3 million for fiscal 2003, compared to $71.4 million in the prior year’s comparable period. This resulted in an increase in operating margin from 15.4% for fiscal 2002 to 18.1% for fiscal 2003. This operating income and related operating
margin reflects restructuring and other charges of $1.3 million and $11.0 million in fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively. The changes in operating income and operating margins were due to the revenue and cost factors described above. The fixed cost
nature of the business resulted in higher income in fiscal 2003 than in fiscal 2002.

In fiscal 2002, we recorded a charge of $16.0 million, net of tax, for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to an indefinite life intangible asset, a trademark, with a carrying value of
$24.6 million at June 1, 2001. The trademark was acquired on April 1, 1996 with the purchase of 92.5% ownership interest in MasterCard International’s Merchant Automated Point-of-Sale Program, or MAPP. The value of the trademark related to the
use of the MAPP name and logo. In connection with the spin-off from NDC, we launched a rebranding effort under the Global Payments Inc. name and logo. In addition, effective June 1, 2001, we purchased MasterCard’s remaining minority interest,
ending all existing marketing alliances with MasterCard, and conducted a study related to the future use of the trademark. In fiscal 2002, we completed an appraisal with an independent valuation firm of the fair value of the trademark as of June 1,
2001, the implementation date of SFAS No. 142. Based on the lack of continuing use of the MAPP trademark as of June 1, 2001, the fair value of the trademark was determined to be zero. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, the $24.6 million ($16.0
million, net of tax, or $0.42 diluted earnings per share) was written off as of June 1, 2001 and recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.

Net income increased $29.5 million or 124% to $53.3 million in fiscal 2003 from $23.8 million in the prior year’s
comparable period, resulting in a $0.78 increase in diluted earnings per share to $1.41 from $0.63. This net income and diluted earnings per share reflected restructuring and other charges, net of tax, of $0.8 million or $0.02 diluted earnings per
share and $6.8 million or $0.18 diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively. Also, net income for fiscal 2003 was comparable to income before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in fiscal 2002, since there were
no changes in accounting principle recorded in fiscal 2003. Our effective tax rate was 37.4% in fiscal 2003 as compared to 38.2% in fiscal 2002, as a result of the impact of our acquisitions and tax planning initiatives.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of
liquidity to meet our needs. At May 31, 2004, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $34.5 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased $63.0 million to $92.2 million in fiscal 2004 from $29.2 million in fiscal 2003. The increase in cash
flow from operations was due to the increase in net income and the timing of net settlement processing receivable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The increase in the net settlement processing receivable is due to timing, and higher
processing volume in our direct merchant services offering and the impact of providing a majority of our Canadian VISA merchants with same-day value, which is standard practice in Canada. See discussion under “Credit Facilities” for
further details on same-day value. These increases were partially offset by the change in prepaid expenses resulting from our prepayment to a major vendor in exchange for a discount.



Net cash used in investing activities increased $127.7 million to $146.8 million in fiscal 2004 from
$19.1 million in fiscal 2003 due to the increase in business acquisition activities. On November 12, 2003, we completed our DolEx acquisition at a purchase price of approximately $190.4 million, through a combination of $59.7 million in cash, net of
acquired cash of $8.7 million, the issuance of $114.2 million in promissory notes payable to the sellers, and the issuance of approximately 232,000 shares of our common stock with an approximate fair value of $7.8 million based on the closing price
of Global Payments Inc. common stock on the date the acquisition closed. On December 1, 2003, we repaid the notes in full using our U.S. credit facility. On February 18, 2004, we completed our acquisition of 52.6% of MUZO’s outstanding
shares at a purchase price of approximately $34.7 million in cash, net of cash acquired of $1.0 million. We completed a public tender offer on May 14, 2004 for the remaining shares of MUZO. The public tender offer resulted in Global Payments
obtaining 46,576 additional shares of MUZO for the equivalent of $28.8 million in cash, bringing our ownership to 98.3% of the outstanding voting shares of MUZO. The amounts necessary to acquire our interest in MUZO was financed using our U.S.
credit facility.

Capital expenditures increased $6.7 million
from $17.9 million in fiscal 2003 to $24.6 million in fiscal 2004 due to investments in software, infrastructure and Canadian merchant terminals. In fiscal 2005, we expect approximately $25 to $35 million in total capital spending primarily to
invest in ongoing capital for our recent acquired businesses, as well as systems development and hardware relating to our next generation front-end processing system, which we anticipate will be completed over the next two years.

Net cash provided by financing activities increased $47.8 million to $50.1
million in 2004 from $2.3 million in fiscal 2003. This increase was primarily due to our borrowings on our U.S. credit facility to fund our recent acquisitions, net of the payoff of the $114.2 million in notes payable to the sellers of DolEx. The
increase in financing activities was also due to our net borrowings on our Canadian line of credit which is restricted for merchant funding. This reflects the net borrowings required to provide Canadian VISA merchants with same-day value. These
borrowings increased primarily due to increased consumer credit card spending and the impact of transferring approximately $40 million from our Canadian to our U.S. cash accounts to minimize our borrowings on our U.S. lines of credit in fiscal 2004.
This cross-border cash transfer reduced the amount of our cash which we utilized in the Canadian settlement processing cycle and increased our borrowings on the CIBC credit facility. As of May 31, 2003, we repaid our outstanding balance on our U.S.
credit facility of $22 million.

We believe that our current
level of cash and borrowing capacity under our committed lines of credit described below, together with future cash flows from operations, are sufficient to meet the needs of our existing operations and planned requirements for the foreseeable
future. As of May 31, 2004, we do not have any material capital commitments, other than commitments under capital and operating leases or planned expansions—see “Commitments and Contractual Obligations” below for more details.

We regularly evaluate cash requirements for current
operations, commitments, development activities and acquisitions and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future, either through the issuance of debt, equity or otherwise. Our cash flow strategy has remained unchanged and
is to first pay off debt, second, to continue to make capital investments in our business and third, to pursue acquisitions that meet our growth strategies.

Credit Facilities

On November 25, 2003, we entered into a three-year, $350 million revolving credit facility agreement with a syndicate of U.S. banks. The credit agreement
contains certain financial and non-financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this nature. The facility expires in November 2006 and has a variable interest rate based on a market short-term floating rate plus a margin
that varies according to our leverage position.

In addition,
the facility allows us to expand the facility size to $500 million by requesting additional commitments from existing or new lenders. We plan to use the credit facility to fund future strategic acquisitions and to provide a source of working capital
for general corporate purposes. This agreement replaces our prior



credit facilities with U.S. banks, which had an aggregate capacity of $150 million. As of May 31, 2004, we had $122 million outstanding on our U.S. credit
facilities. Unless we have additional acquisitions or other capital needs, we intend to pay off this amount in fiscal year 2005. No amounts were outstanding on our U.S. credit facilities as of May 31, 2003.

We also have a credit facility from CIBC that provides a line of credit up to
$175 million (Canadian), approximately $128 million (U.S.) based on exchange rates existing on May 31, 2004, with an additional overdraft facility available to cover larger advances during periods of peak usage of credit cards. This line has a
variable interest rate based on market rates and it contains certain financial and non-financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this nature. This credit facility is secured by a first priority security interest in our
accounts receivable from VISA Canada/International, and has been guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries. This guarantee is subordinate to our U.S. credit facility. The credit facility was originally scheduled to expire on December 9, 2003, but
the expiration date has been extended until October 31, 2004. We are currently negotiating the syndication of this facility among CIBC and a group of U.S. lenders and expect to receive future periodic extensions (if necessary) until we complete the
syndication.

The third amendment of the CIBC credit facility,
executed in December 2002, provides for the incurrence of interest costs in connection with offering merchants “same day value” for their deposits. Same day value, which has been an accepted industry practice in Canada for several years,
is the practice of giving merchants same day value for their sales transactions, even though their deposits are made at a later date. Essentially, merchants’ deposits are backdated to the date of the applicable sales transaction. In order to
continue offering “same day value” to our merchants in Canada after the execution of the third amendment to the CIBC credit facility, we have been required to draw on our CIBC credit facility to pay merchants in advance of the date we
receive the corresponding funds from VISA Canada/International resulting in a net merchant processing receivable. In contrast, under the terms of the CIBC credit facility prior to the execution of the third amendment, CIBC credited the
merchants’ deposit accounts for their sales transactions on the day of the transaction and we reimbursed CIBC when we received the corresponding funds from VISA Canada/International without incurring a short term loan. At May 31, 2004 and 2003,
there was $113.2 million and $46.3 million (Canadian), or approximately $83.1 million and $33.9 million (U.S.), respectively, outstanding on this credit facility, based on then existing exchange rates. The amount borrowed is restricted in use to pay
merchants and is generally received from VISA Canada/International on the following day.

Airlines

We currently
process card transactions for Air Canada, the single largest airline in Canada, which according to its Annual Information Form, filed with the Canadian Securities Administrator and dated May 19, 2004, held approximately 52% of the Canadian domestic
market share and approximately 43% of the Canadian transborder market share during the first calendar quarter of 2004. On April 1, 2003, Air Canada filed for and obtained protection from the court under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act,
which generally allows a company to reorganize while it continues normal operations with the assistance of a court-appointed Monitor. It is our understanding that the court order provides for a general stay that precludes its creditors and others
from taking any action against Air Canada. The purpose of the stay is to provide Air Canada with relief designed to stabilize operations and business relationships with customers, vendors, employees and creditors. The court order also provides that
Air Canada shall honor all airline tickets in the usual and ordinary course of business.

In the event that Air Canada’s restructuring is not successful and it is liquidated, there will likely be limited assets available from which to pay creditor claims. If the restructuring is not successful and any
of Air Canada’s liability for deferred ticket sales is unfunded and such charges are properly reversed by VISA and MasterCard cardholders, the Company may be liable for such reversed charges under the chargeback rules of these card
associations. The Company maintains a reserve for such reversed charges, as described under

Reserve for operating losses

in Note 1 in the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, but has not made any specific adjustment to that
allowance as a result of the Air Canada situation. According to the Twenty-Sixth Report of the Monitor dated May 20, 2004, deferred ticket revenues for Air Canada as of March 31, 2004, representing advance ticket sales collected, were approximately
$557.2 million (Canadian), or $426.2 million (U.S.), based on then existing exchange rates.



As a result of our exposure, we filed a motion for court ordered protection for our chargeback liability
exposure. The supervising judge dismissed our application on the basis that the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act does not provide protection to credit card processors for this risk. We appealed the decision to the Court of Appeal (Ontario).
The Court of Appeal upheld the supervising judge’s decision. As a consequence of the dismissal of our motion and appeal, we are compelled by court order to continue to provide VISA card processing and MasterCard card processing in accordance
with the ordinary course of the processing relationship as it existed immediately prior to Air Canada’s filing under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act or CCAA. However, effective June 1, 2003, we were permitted to collect our fee
revenue daily (also known as daily discount) or as we process card transactions. This has significantly mitigated our exposure to potential losses from unpaid fees.

The VISA merchant processing agreement expires on April 30, 2005 and the MasterCard merchant processing agreement expired on
or about January 1, 1997. We intend to terminate the VISA processing relationship as soon as the VISA merchant processing agreement expires, and the MasterCard processing relationship at our earliest opportunity following Air Canada’s emergence
from its proceedings under the CCAA. At this time, it is not clear when we will be able to terminate such processing relationships. Our revenue from the Air Canada relationship represents less than 1% of our consolidated revenue.

In connection with the acquisition of the merchant acquiring business of CIBC
in March 2001, CIBC agreed to reimburse Global Payments for certain chargeback and credit loss exposure, and on March 20, 2004, this reimbursement obligation expired. According to a March 2003 affidavit of an Air Canada officer, 80% of Air Canada
customers elect to pay using credit cards and, of those credit card users, 29.3% use VISA cards and 8.4% use MasterCard cards. As a result of the expiration of CIBC’s reimbursement obligation, the Company estimates that its maximum potential
chargeback liability exposure relative to Air Canada as of March 31, 2004 was $168-$178 million (Canadian), or $128-$138 million (U.S.), based on exchange rates in existence on March 31, 2004. This estimate is based on the information contained in
the Air Canada affidavit and the information contained in the Twenty-Sixth Report of the Monitor. We believe that maximum potential chargeback liability exposure as of May 31, 2004 is not materially different than the exposure as of March 31, 2004,
which is the latest date for publicly available information necessary to determine our exposure.

We are continuing to closely monitor Air Canada’s restructuring. Based on information currently available to us, which primarily consists of publicly
available information, we believe a material loss is unlikely as long as Air Canada continues to honor all airline tickets in the ordinary course of business and any losses from this relationship are not factored into our expectations and guidance
for fiscal year 2005.

Commitments and Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our contractual
obligations and commitments as of May 31, 2004:

Note:

This table excludes other obligations that we may have, such as employee benefit plan obligations, and other current and long-term liabilities reflected in our consolidated
balance sheets.

(1)

These obligations exclude interest owed on fixed rate debt totaling $2.2 million in the aggregate.



We believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity
and capital resources to meet our expected long-term needs for the operation of our business and the satisfaction of these obligations and commitments.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies

In applying the accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements, we necessarily make accounting estimates that affect our
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Some of these accounting estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimates. We base these assumptions and the
resulting estimates on historical information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis, however, in many instances we reasonably could have used
different accounting estimates, and in other instances changes in our accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, with the result in each case being a material change in the financial statement presentation of our
financial condition or results of operations. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as “critical accounting estimates”. Among those critical accountings estimates that we believe are most important to an understanding of our
consolidated financial statements are those that we discuss below.

Accounting estimates necessarily require subjective determinations about future events and conditions. Therefore, the following descriptions of critical accounting estimates are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ
materially from the results anticipated by these forward-looking statements. You should read the following in conjunction with Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and “Risk Factors” contained in Exhibit 99.1 to this
annual report.

Reserve for operating losses

—We
process credit card transactions for direct merchants and recognize revenue based on a percentage of the gross amount charged. Our direct merchant customers have the liability for any charges properly reversed by the cardholder. In the event,
however, that we are not able to collect such amount from the merchants, due to merchant fraud, insolvency, bankruptcy or any other reason, we may be liable for any such reversed charges. We require cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit and
other types of collateral by certain merchants to minimize any such contingent liability, and we also utilize a number of systems and procedures to manage merchant risk. We have, however, historically experienced losses due to merchant defaults.

During fiscal 2003, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards
Board Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” referred to as FIN 45. We believe our potential liability for the full amount of
the charge is a guarantee under FIN 45. Our liability is represented by an allowance for operational losses that is based primarily on historical experience and other relevant factors. The adoption of FIN 45 did not have a material impact on the
allowance, partially due to the risk management procedures described in the preceding paragraphs, as the carrying value approximates fair value. Economic downturns or increases in merchant fraud may result in significant increases in credit related
issues. As of May 31, 2004 and 2003, $6.5 million and $5.4 million, respectively, has been reserved for losses associated with merchant card processing and is included as a component of the settlement processing receivable, net. The expense
associated with the valuation allowance is included in cost of service in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Expenses of $12.5 million, $15.6 million and $9.8 million were recorded for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, for
these losses.

The reserve for operating losses is comprised of
known losses and a historical analysis based on a percentage of credit card sales volumes processed. This estimation process has been materially accurate and reflects the approximate fair value of the obligation under FIN 45. Due to the nature of
our business and the level of exposure varying upon the type of merchant, we are unable to reasonably estimate the maximum exposure we would be liable for.

We also have a check guarantee business. Similar to the credit card business, we charge our merchants a percentage of the gross amount of the check and
guarantee payment of the check to the merchant in the event the



check is not honored by the checkwriter’s bank. We have the right to collect the full amount of the check from the checkwriter but have not historically
recovered 100% of the guaranteed checks. Our check guarantee reserve is based on historical and projected loss experiences. As of May 31, 2004 and 2003, we had a check guarantee reserve of $4.3 million and $3.2 million, respectively, which is
included in claims receivable, net, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Expenses of $12.0 million, $10.4 million and $12.4 million were recorded for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, for these losses and are included in cost of
service in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to the risk that actual amounts returned and recovered in the future may differ significantly from estimates used in
calculating the valuation allowance. In addition, we defer the revenue representing the fair value of the guarantee, until the guarantee is satisfied. The adoption of FIN 45 had no impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Goodwill and long-lived asset valuations

—Goodwill
and certain other intangible assets are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”

. We regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amounts
of goodwill, property and equipment, and other intangible assets may warrant revision or may not be recoverable. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment by applying a fair value based test. When factors indicate that these long-lived assets should be
evaluated for possible impairment, we assess the recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such long-lived assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted cash flows expected from use of the asset and its eventual
disposition. In our opinion, the long-lived assets, including goodwill, property and equipment, and other intangible assets are appropriately valued at May 31, 2004 and May 31, 2003.

ITEM 7A—QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Based on analyses completed and described below, we do not believe that we are exposed to material market risk from changes in interest rates and/or
foreign currency rates.

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates from our
liabilities (debt). This includes two notes payable issued by MUZO that were acquired. One bears interest at a fixed rate and the second bears interest at a three month floating PRIBOR (Prague InterBank Offered Rate) rate plus 2.55%. We also have a
credit facility with CIBC for up to $175 million to cover the prefunding of Canadian merchants. Our credit facility with CIBC carries an interest rate primarily based on the CIBC offered rate plus 40 basis points. The CIBC offered rate is a rate
determined at the sole discretion of CIBC that they are able to obtain short-term deposits of Canadian dollars in the New York interbank eurocurrency market. Our $350 million U.S. revolving line of credit has a variable interest rate based on the
London Interbank Offered Rates, or LIBOR. Accordingly, we are exposed to the impact of interest rate fluctuations.

We have performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis over the near term with a 10% change in interest rates. A 10% proportionate increase in interest
rates would have resulted in a decrease in net income of $0.1 million in fiscal 2004 and an immaterial impact on net income in fiscal 2003.

Foreign Currency Risk

We generate a percentage of our net income from foreign operations and, as a result, we are vulnerable to fluctuations in the Canadian dollar, Czech
Koruna, Mexican peso and British pound against the United States dollar. We have performed a foreign exchange sensitivity analysis over the near term, using a 10% change in foreign exchange rates. A 10% appreciation or depreciation in exchange rate
of the British pound, Czech Koruna, Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar would result in net increase or decrease of $3.4 million in net income. This analysis does not take into effect the change in revenue that may result from such a change in
exchange rate.

DolEx provides money transfer services between
the U.S. and Latin America. Foreign exchange risk is monitored through the business model and an aggressive risk management process. DolEx transactions are



received in U.S. dollars, which require the Latin American settlement houses to obtain the foreign currency for distribution to recipients. DolEx has limited
foreign exchange exposure because a majority of the transactions are settled shortly after they are initiated. Since a majority of these transactions are in different currencies, DolEx generates revenue on the foreign currency spread between the
wholesale rate DolEx pays for the currency and the retail rate charged to consumers. We believe our risk management processes coupled with the short timeframe to settle the transactions after they are initiated, mitigates any risk due to foreign
currency fluctuations in the money transfer offering. DolEx can also quickly engage in foreign currency purchases, as necessary, to cover its payables.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Historically, we have not entered into derivative financial instruments to mitigate interest rate fluctuation risk or foreign currency exchange rate risk,
as it has not been cost effective. We may use derivative financial instruments in the future if we deem it useful in mitigating our exposure to interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.



ITEM 8—FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Board of Directors and Shareholders

Global Payments Inc.:

We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Global Payments Inc. (a Georgia corporation) and subsidiaries (“the Company”) as of May 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in
shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2004. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Global Payments Inc. and subsidiaries as of May 31, 2004 and 2003, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2002 the Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill and other
intangible assets to conform to Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142 and recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on June 1, 2001. Also as discussed in Note 10 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
in 2003 the Company changed its method of accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities to conform to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business, Consolidation and Presentation

—

Global Payments Inc. (“Global Payments” or the
“Company”) is a high-volume payments processor of electronic transactions to merchants, multinational corporations, financial institutions, consumers, government agencies and other profit and non-profit business enterprises to facilitate
payments to purchase goods and services or further other economic goals. The Company’s role is to serve as an intermediary in the exchange of information and funds that must occur between parties so that a transaction can be completed.
Including the Company’s time as part of National Data Corporation, now known as NDCHealth, or NDC, the Company has provided transaction processing services since 1967. The Company was incorporated in Georgia as Global Payments Inc. in September
2000.

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and present the
Company’s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The prior year presentation of the line of credit with related party on the consolidated balance sheet has
been changed to conform to the current year presentation.

Use of estimates

—

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

Revenue
recognition—

Merchant Services Offering.

The Company’s merchant services offerings provide
merchants and financial institutions with credit and debit card transaction processing, check services and terminal management. Merchant services revenue is primarily based on a percentage of transaction value or on a specified amount per
transaction. This revenue is recognized as such services are performed. Revenue for processing services provided directly to merchants is recorded net of interchange fees charged by credit card associations.

Check guarantee services include the process of electronically verifying the
check being presented to the Company’s merchant customer through extensive databases. The Company generally guarantees the face value of the verified and guaranteed check to the merchant customer. If a verified and guaranteed check is
dishonored, the Company reimburses the merchant for the check’s guaranteed value and pursues collection from the delinquent checkwriter. The Company has the right to collect the full amount of the check from the checkwriter but has historically
recovered approximately 50% to 55% of the guaranteed, dishonored checks’ face value. The Company establishes a claims receivable from the delinquent checkwriter for the full amount of the guaranteed check and it establishes a valuation
allowance for this activity based on historical and projected loss experience. See

Reserve for operating losses

below.

Revenue for the check guarantee offering is primarily derived from a percentage of the face value of each guaranteed check. The Company recognizes revenue
upon satisfaction of its guarantee obligation to the merchant customer either through the check being honored or, in the case of a dishonored check, the Company paying the merchant. The check guarantee offering also earns revenue based on fees
collected from delinquent checkwriters which is recognized when collected, as collectibility is not reasonably assured until that point.

Check verification services are similar to the services provided in the check guarantee offering, except the Company does not guarantee the verified
checks. In addition, the Company provides collection services to the



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

merchant in the event that a check is dishonored. Revenue for this offering is primarily derived from fees collected from delinquent checkwriters and is
recognized when collected, as collectibility is not reasonably assured until that point. This offering also earns revenue based on a fixed amount each merchant pays for each check that is verified. This revenue is recognized when earned, which
occurs when the transaction is processed.

Terminal management
products and services consist of electronic transaction payment processing terminal sales and rentals, terminal set-up, telephone training and technical support. Revenue associated with the terminal sale is considered a multiple element transaction
which includes set-up and telephone training. However, terminal sale revenue is considered a single unit of accounting and is recognized when the set-up and telephone training is completed, and the merchant customer can begin processing
transactions. Terminal rental revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the operating lease term. Revenue associated with technical support is considered a single unit of accounting and is recognized based on either a maintenance
agreement, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the maintenance contract term, or based on time and materials when the support is completed.

Money Transfer Offering.

Consumer-to-consumer money transfer revenue is earned on fees charged to customers based on the nature and amount of the transaction performed on the
customers’ behalf and is recognized at the time of sale. The Company also earns consumer-to-consumer money transfer revenue on the difference between the retail exchange rate quoted at the time when the money transfer transaction is requested
and the wholesale exchange rate at the time when the currency is purchased. This revenue is recognized when the money transfer transaction is processed through the settlement system and the funds are available to the beneficiary.

Cash and cash equivalents

—

Cash and cash equivalents
include cash on hand and all liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or less when purchased.

Inventory

—

Inventory, which includes computer hardware and peripheral equipment, and electronic point of sale terminals, is stated at
the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by using the average cost method.

Settlement processing receivable, net

—

The settlement processing receivable results from timing differences in the Company’s settlement process for direct merchants. These timing differences are
primarily due to the fluctuations in volume, the timing of credit and debit card sales volume funded to merchants and the settlement received from the card associations and debit networks. This balance includes cash deposits from merchant customers
held as collateral to minimize contingent liabilities associated with charges properly reversed by a cardholder. See

Reserve for operating losses

below. As of May 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had cash deposits of $65.9 million and $63.5
million, respectively. This balance also reflects amounts payable to beneficiaries through the Company’s money transfer offering that have not been claimed at a settlement location as of the balance sheet date.

Reserve for operating losses

—

The Company processes credit
card transactions for direct merchants and recognizes revenue based on a percentage of the gross amount charged. The Company’s merchant customers have the liability for any charges properly reversed by the cardholder. In the event, however,
that the Company is not able to collect such amount from the merchants, due to merchant fraud, insolvency, bankruptcy or any other reason, the Company may be liable for any such reversed charges. The Company requires cash deposits, guarantees,
letters of credit and other types of collateral by certain merchants to minimize any such contingent liability. The Company also utilizes a number of systems and procedures to manage merchant risk. The Company has, however, historically experienced
losses due to merchant defaults.

During fiscal 2003, the
Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Indebtedness of Others” referred to as FIN 45. The Company believes that its potential liability for the full amount of the charge is a guarantee under
FIN 45. The Company’s liability is represented by an allowance for operational losses that is based primarily on historical experience and other relevant factors. The adoption of FIN 45 did not have a material impact on the allowance, partially
due to the risk management procedures described in the preceding paragraphs, as the carrying value approximates fair value. Economic downturns or increases in merchant fraud may result in significant increases in credit related issues. As of May 31,
2004 and 2003, $6.5 million and $5.4 million, respectively, has been reserved for losses associated with merchant card processing and is included as a component of the settlement processing receivable, net. The expense associated with the valuation
allowance is included in cost of service in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Expenses of $12.5 million, $15.6 million and $9.8 million were recorded for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, for these losses.

The reserve for operating losses is comprised of known losses and a
historical analysis based on a percentage of credit card sales volumes processed. This estimation process has been materially accurate and reflects the approximate fair value of the obligation under FIN 45. Due to the nature of the Company’s
business and the level of exposure varying upon the type of merchant, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the maximum exposure the Company would be liable for.

The Company also has a check guarantee business. Similar to the credit card business, the Company charges its merchants a
percentage of the gross amount of the check and guarantees payment of the check to the merchant in the event the check is not honored by the checkwriter’s bank. The Company has the right to collect the full amount of the check from the
checkwriter but has not historically recovered 100% of the guaranteed checks. The Company’s check guarantee reserve is based on historical and projected loss experiences. As of May 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had a check guarantee reserve of
$4.3 million and $3.2 million, respectively, which is included in claims receivable, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Expenses of $12.0 million, $10.4 million and $12.4 million were recorded for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, for these losses and are included in cost of service in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to the risk that actual amounts returned and recovered in the
future may differ significantly from estimates used in calculating the valuation allowance. In addition, the Company defers the revenue representing the fair value of the guarantee, until the guarantee is satisfied. The adoption of FIN 45 had no
impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

Property and equipment

—

Property and equipment, including equipment under capital leases, are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method. Equipment is
depreciated over 2 to 5 year lives. Leasehold improvements and property acquired under capital leases are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the term of the lease. The Company capitalizes the costs related to the
development of computer software developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 98-1, “Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained
for Internal Use”. The costs of purchased and internally developed software used to provide services to customers or internal administrative services are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, not
to exceed 7 years. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.

Goodwill and Other Intangibles Assets

—

On July 20, 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, “

Business Combinations

”
(“SFAS No. 141”) and No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”

(“SFAS No. 142”). SFAS No. 141 requires that all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for under the purchase
method. SFAS No. 142 eliminates the amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets and requires that goodwill be evaluated for impairment by applying a fair value-based test. Global Payments adopted SFAS No. 142 in the first quarter of
fiscal 2002. In accordance with this standard, the Company discontinued the amortization of goodwill and certain intangible assets that were determined to have an indefinite life.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Global Payments completed the testing for impairment of goodwill as of June 1, 2002 using the present
value of expected future cash flows and determined that the fair value of the merchant services reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount of the net assets, including goodwill of the merchant services reporting unit. The Company completed its
annual goodwill impairment review as of June 1, 2003 and determined that no impairment charge to goodwill was required. No other changes in amortization periods were required for other intangible assets. See Note 4 in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information.

Other
intangible assets primarily represent customer-related intangible assets, such as customer lists and merchant contracts, and trademarks associated with acquisitions. Customer-related intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method
over their estimated useful lives of 3 to 30 years. The useful lives for customer-related intangible assets are determined based primarily on information concerning start/stop dates and yearly attrition. The trademarks were determined to have an
indefinite life and are not being amortized. The Company evaluated the remaining useful lives for other intangible assets as of June 1, 2003 and determined them to be appropriate.

At June 1, 2001, the Company had one indefinite life intangible asset, a trademark with a carrying value of $24.6 million.
The trademark was acquired on April 1, 1996 in connection with the purchase of a 92.5% ownership interest in MasterCard International’s Merchant Automated Point-of-Sale Program, or MAPP. The value of the trademark related to the use of the MAPP
name and logo. In connection with the spin-off from NDC, the Company launched a significant rebranding effort under the Global Payments Inc. name and logo. In addition, effective June 1, 2001, the Company purchased MasterCard’s remaining
minority interest, ending all existing marketing alliances with MasterCard under the MAPP brand and conducted a study related to the future use of the trademark.

In fiscal 2002, the Company obtained an appraisal from an independent valuation firm of the fair value of the trademark as
of June 1, 2001, the implementation date of SFAS No. 142. Based on the lack of continuing use of the MAPP trademark as of June 1, 2001, the fair value of the trademark was determined to be zero. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, $24.6 million ($16.0
million, net of tax) was written off as of June 1, 2001 and was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.

Impairment of long-lived assets

—

The Company regularly evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the
carrying amount of property and equipment and other intangible assets may warrant revision or may not be recoverable. When factors indicate that these long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, the Company assesses the
recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such long-lived assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted cash flows expected from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. In management’s opinion, the long-lived
assets, including property and equipment and other intangible assets, are appropriately valued at May 31, 2004 and May 31, 2003.

Income taxes

—

Deferred income taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and
liabilities using enacted tax laws and rates (see Note 7).

Fair value of financial instruments

—

Management considers that the carrying amounts of financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables, line of credit, notes payable, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities approximate fair value.

Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities

—

Global Payments has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 133, “

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

” (“SFAS No. 133”) and
Statement No. 149, “

Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

” (“SFAS No. 149”). SFAS No. 133 requires that a company recognize derivatives as assets or liabilities on its balance sheet,
and also requires that the gain or loss related to the effective portion of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges be recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. SFAS No. 149



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities
under SFAS No. 133. The Company has not used any derivative instruments and the adoption of these statements was not significant.

Foreign currency translation

—

The Company has foreign subsidiaries operating in Canada, Czech Republic, Mexico and the United Kingdom.
The local currency of these subsidiaries is the functional currency, except for the subsidiary in Mexico whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Gains and losses on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies
are included in determining net income for the period in which exchange rates change. Exchange gains or losses were not significant. The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional currency is a foreign currency are translated at the
year-end rate of exchange, and income statement items are translated at the average rates prevailing during the year. The resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a component of shareholders’ equity. Translation gains and losses on
intercompany balances of a long-term investment nature are also recorded as a component of shareholders’ equity. The effects of foreign currency gains and losses arising from these translations of assets and liabilities are included as a
component of other comprehensive income.

Segment
disclosure

—

Operating segments are defined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, “

Disclosure About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information

” (“SFAS No. 131”). The Company’s
chief operating decision maker group currently operates one reportable segment—electronic transaction payment processing—therefore the majority of the disclosures required by SFAS No. 131 do not apply to the Company. The Company’s
measure of segment profit is consolidated operating income. The Company’s results of operations and its financial condition are not significantly reliant upon any single customer. Revenues from external customers from the Company’s service
offerings are as follows:

The Company’s
operations are provided in the United States, Canada and Europe. The following is a breakdown of revenues by geographic region:

The following is a
breakdown of long-lived assets by geographic region:

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Earnings per share

—

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing reported
earnings available to common shareholders by weighted average shares outstanding during the period. Earnings available to common shareholders are the same as reported net income for all periods presented.

Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing reported earnings
available to common shareholders by weighted average shares outstanding during the period and the impact of securities that, if exercised, would have a dilutive effect on earnings per share. All options with an exercise price less than the average
market share price for the period generally are assumed to have a dilutive effect on earning per share. The dilutive effect of stock options and restricted share grants was 1.4 million, 0.9 million shares and 1.4 million shares in fiscal 2004, 2003,
and 2002, respectively. The diluted share base for the years ended May 31, 2004 and 2003 excludes incremental shares of 0.1 million and 0.7 million, respectively, related to employee stock options. These shares were excluded due to their
anti-dilutive effect as a result of their option exercise prices being greater than the average market price of the common shares. No shares had an anti-dilutive effect in fiscal 2002. No additional securities were outstanding that could potentially
dilute basic earnings per share that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share.

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended May 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002:

Effective March 1,
2003, Global Payments adopted Statements of Financial Accounting Standard No. 148, “

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure

” (“SFAS No. 148”). SFAS No. 148 addresses alternative methods of
transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of Statements of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123,
“

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

” (“SFAS No. 123”) to require prominent disclosure in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the
effect of the method used on reported results.

At May 31,
2004, the Company has two stock-based employee compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note 9. The Company accounts for these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, “

Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees,”

and related interpretations. Employee

stock-based compensation is reflected in net income for restricted stock expense recognized in the period and for stock options that have been remeasured.
During fiscal year 2004, the Company recognized $3.6 million in stock-based compensation expense related to accelerated vesting of options under FIN 44, “

Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation—an interpretation
of APB Opinion No. 25”.

This expense is reflected in restructuring costs incurred in fiscal year 2004 (See Note 10). The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to stock-based employee compensation.

Impact of new
accounting pronouncements

—

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 150, “

Accounting For Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both

Liabilities and Equity

” (“SFAS No. 150”) which establishes
standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability (or an asset in
some circumstances). SFAS No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The Company has evaluated
the potential impact of SFAS No. 150 and has concluded that there was not a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, “

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research
Bulletin No. 51

(“FIN 46”). FIN 46 addresses how to determine if an entity qualifies as a variable interest entity and how such entities should be consolidated. In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46R, which replaces FIN 46 and
provides additional clarification of Variable Interest Entities through controlling financial interests and voting rights and when FIN 46 should not be applied. The Company has evaluated the potential impact of FIN 46R and has determined that there
is no material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

NOTE 2—BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS

During fiscal 2003, the Company did not acquire any material businesses. In fiscal years 2004 and 2002, the Company acquired
the following businesses:

(1)

As a result of the May 14, 2004 acquisition, the Company acquired an aggregate of 98.3% of
the outstanding voting shares of MUZO, a.s.

These acquisitions have been recorded using the purchase method of accounting, and accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value as of the date of
acquisition. The operating results are included in the Company’s consolidated statements of income from the date of the acquisition.

Fiscal 2004

Latin America Money Services, LLC

On November 12, 2003, Global Payments completed the acquisition of Latin America Money Services, LLC (“LAMS”), a Delaware limited liability company which owned a majority of the outstanding equity interests
in DolEx Dollar Express, Inc. (“DolEx”), a Texas corporation, and all but one share of the outstanding equity interests in DolEx Envios, S.A. de C.V. (“DolEx Envios”), a Mexican subsidiary of DolEx. The transaction was structured
as a merger of GP Ventures (Texas), Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Global Payments, into LAMS, with LAMS remaining as the surviving entity in the merger. Global Payments also acquired the remaining equity interests in
DolEx that were not already owned by LAMS.

As a result of the
transaction, LAMS, a holding company, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Global Payments. DolEx, the operating company, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of LAMS and DolEx Envios is a majority-owned subsidiary of DolEx because one share of DolEx Envios is
owned by GP Finance, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Global Payments. The Company frequently refers to this transaction as the DolEx acquisition, since DolEx is the primary operating company within the LAMS group.

Under the terms of the merger and related agreements, the Company gave
consideration of approximately $190.4 million for LAMS, DolEx and DolEx Envios through a combination of $59.7 million in cash, net of cash acquired of $8.7 million, the issuance of $114.2 million in promissory notes payable to the order of the
sellers, and the issuance of common stock with an approximate fair value of $7.8 million based on the closing price of Global Payments Inc. common stock on the date the acquisition closed. On December 1, 2003, the Company repaid the promissory notes
in full using its U.S. credit facility.

Global Payments’
interest in DolEx was primarily based on a desire to establish a presence in the United States to Latin America money transfer market. The key factors that contributed to the decision to acquire DolEx include historical and prospective financial
statement analysis, market share and level of competition from other

MUZO, a.s.

On February
18, 2004, the Company, through an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired 52.6% of the outstanding voting shares of MUZO, a.s. (“MUZO”) from Komerční banka, a.s. (“KB”), for $34.7 million in cash.

Based in Prague, MUZO has served financial institutions since 1992 with a
comprehensive package of payment services including credit and debit card transaction processing, sales, installation and servicing of ATM and POS terminals, as well as card issuing services (such as card database management and card
personalization). MUZO has approximately 250 employees. The Company believes that MUZO is the largest indirect payment processor in the Czech Republic.

Pursuant to Czech law, the Company completed a public tender offer on May 14, 2004 for the remaining shares of MUZO that were not already acquired from
KB. The public tender offer resulted in Global Payments obtaining 46,576 additional shares of MUZO for the equivalent of approximately $28.8 million in cash, bringing the Company’s ownership to 98.3% of the outstanding voting shares of MUZO.
The Company’s acquisition of shares of MUZO was primarily based on a desire to establish a presence in the Czech Republic and the surrounding Central and Eastern European markets, which the Company believes will have superior growth potential.
The key factors that contributed to the decision to acquire MUZO include historical and prospective financial statement analysis, terms of major customer contracts, market share, technological sophistication, quality of the management team and
previous business development activity by other companies in the European market.

The Company has a noncontributory defined benefit pension
plan covering substantially all of its United States employees who have met the eligibility provisions. The defined benefit pension plan was closed to new participants beginning June 1, 1998. Benefits are based on years of service and the
employee’s compensation during the highest five consecutive years of earnings out of the last ten years of service. Plan provisions and funding meet the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. Beginning
May 31, 2004, the Company ceased benefit accruals for increases in compensation levels. Expenses for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 were actuarially determined. The Company uses May 31 as the measurement date for its plan.

The consolidated pension plan weighted-average asset allocations at May 31, 2004 and 2003, by asset category are as follows:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The Company’s investment policy and strategies for plan assets involve a balanced approach to
achieving its long-term investment objectives. The Company selected a blended investment approach to diversify the asset pool while reducing the risk of wide swings in the market from year-to-year. The pension plan’s investment goals are to
generate a return in excess of 8.0% over a full market cycle. The investment portfolio contains enough diversification of investments to reduce risk and provide growth of capital and income. The securities investment guideline details the categories
of investments that are not eligible for investment without specific approval. These include: short sales, margin transactions, commodities or other commodity contracts, unregistered securities, investment in companies that have filed a petition for
bankruptcy or investments for the purpose of exercising control of management.

Cash Flows

Contributions

The Company expects to contribute $0.5 million to the Global Payments Plan

Employee Retirement Savings Plan

The Company has a deferred compensation 401(k) Plan. The plan provides tax
deferred amounts for each participant consisting of employee elective contributions and matching Company contributions. The Company contributed $1.4 million, $1.3 million and $1.2 million to the Global Payments Inc. 401(k) Plan in fiscal 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively.

NOTE 7—INCOME TAXES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The Company’s effective tax rates differ from federal statutory rates as follows:

Deferred income taxes
as of May 31, 2004 and May 31, 2003 reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial accounting and income tax purposes. The Company’s investments in certain foreign subsidiaries are
permanently invested abroad and will not be repatriated to the U.S. in the foreseeable future. In accordance with

APB Opinion No. 23

, because those earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested, no U.S. federal and state deferred
income taxes have been provided thereon. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to both U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes
payable to the various foreign countries. Because of the availability of U.S. foreign tax credits, it is not practicable to determine the U.S. federal income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely. As
of May 31, 2004 and 2003, principal components of deferred tax items were as follows:

A valuation allowance
is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company has not established valuation allowances for these tax assets.

Restricted
Stock

—Shares awarded under the restricted stock program are held in escrow and released to the grantee upon the grantee’s satisfaction of conditions of the grantee’s restricted stock agreement. Awards are recorded as deferred
compensation, a reduction of shareholders’ equity based on the quoted fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the award date. Compensation expense is recognized ratably during the escrow period of the award. The compensation
cost that was charged against income for restricted stock was $1.9 million, $1.3 million and $1.1 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

—The Company has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under which the sale of 1,200,000 shares of its common stock have
been authorized. Employees may designate up to the lesser of $25,000 or 20% of their annual compensation for the purchase of stock. The price for shares purchased under the plan is the lower of 85% of market value on the first day or the last day of
the quarterly purchase period. At May 31, 2004, 194,727 shares had been issued under this plan, with 1,005,273 shares reserved for future issuance.

The weighted-average grant-date fair value per share granted in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 under the
Employee Stock Purchase Plan is $6.83, $4.96 and $6.90, respectively.

The fair value of each share granted under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model using the following assumptions:

NOTE 10—RESTRUCTURING AND
OTHER

Effective December 31, 2002, the Company began
accounting for its restructuring activities under SFAS No. 146,

“Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities”.

The following schedule details the restructuring activities from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2004.

(1)

This amount includes $2.7 million associated with the termination of an executive officer,
and it reflects the Company’s decision to eliminate the position and consolidate its functions under existing executive officer functions.

Fiscal 2003 Restructuring Activities

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company, consistent with its strategy to leverage infrastructure and consolidate operations, committed to a
plan to close three locations and consolidate these and other functions into existing locations. The plan required associated management and staff reductions, contract termination and other facility closure costs. The Company started execution in
April 2003 and completed the plan in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. The major components of the restructuring charge associated with these activities were as follows:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The charge incurred for the year ended May 31, 2004 is reflected in the accompanying Consolidated
Statement of Income under the caption “Restructuring and other”.

Fiscal 2002 Restructuring Activities

During
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company completed plans for the closing of four locations, including associated management and staff reductions. The Company categorized total charges of approximately $11.0 million for the year ended May 31,
2002 as follows:

The charges related to
locations that were either already closed or had management approved plans to be closed within twelve months of incurring the charges. These charges included future minimum lease and operating payments, commencing on the planned exit timing, for all
noncancelable leases under remaining terms of the locations identified, net of current and estimated future sublease income. The charges also included facility exit costs. Normal lease payments, operating costs and depreciation continued to be
charged to operating expenses prior to actually vacating the specific facilities.

The severance and related costs arose from the Company’s actions to reduce personnel in areas of redundant operations and activities. These operations were those that related to the facility consolidation, recent
acquisitions and integration of acquisition functions. The charges reflect specifically identified employees whose employment was terminated and who were informed by the time the charges were incurred. The non-cash costs associated with the
severance and related costs reflect compensation expense due to the acceleration of the vesting of certain stock options for those employees that were terminated and had options outstanding.

The other costs incurred in the year ended May 31, 2002 related to the book
value of certain current assets that were deemed to be unrecoverable after the purchase of MasterCard’s remaining minority interest in Global Payment Systems LLC.

The cash items were accrued at the time the charges were incurred. The reversals during the fiscal year were due to changes
in estimates described above. As of May 31, 2004, none of the cash portion of the restructuring charges from fiscal 2002 remains accrued as a current liability in the accrued liabilities section of the balance sheet.

NOTE 11—RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

As of May 31, 2004, CIBC holds approximately 16% of the Company’s
outstanding common stock, which it acquired in connection with the Company’s purchase of CIBC’s merchant acquiring business in fiscal 2001. After the acquisition, CIBC provided transitional services under an agreement to provide various
support services to the merchant acquiring business for a 24-month period commencing on the acquisition date of March 20, 2001. The purpose of the agreement was to facilitate the integration into the Company’s existing operations. These
services included customer service, credit and debit card processing and settlement functions. Although the CIBC back-end conversion was completed in November 2001, CIBC has continued to provide certain



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

transitional services subsequent to the 24-month period based on an informal arrangement. In fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 the Company incurred expenses of
approximately $0.4 million, $1.9 million and $20.7 million, respectively, related to these services.

In addition, the Company has a credit facility from CIBC that provides a line of credit up to $175.0 million (Canadian dollars), approximately $128.0
million U.S. dollars based on exchange rates in effect on May 31, 2004. See Note 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

NOTE 12—COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Leases

The Company conducts a major part of its operations using leased facilities and equipment. Many of these leases have renewal and purchase options and
provide that the Company pay the cost of property taxes, insurance and maintenance.

Rent expense on all operating leases for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $13.1 million, $7.8 million and $7.6 million, respectively.

Future minimum lease payments for all noncancelable leases at May 31, 2004 were as follows:

Legal

The Company currently processes card transactions for Air Canada, the single
largest airline in Canada. Revenue from the Air Canada relationship represents less than 1% of the Company’s consolidated revenue. On April 1, 2003, Air Canada filed for and obtained protection from the court under the Companies’ Creditors
Arrangement Act, which generally allows a company to reorganize while it continues normal operations with the assistance of a court-appointed Monitor. The court order provides for a general stay that precludes Air Canada’s creditors and others
from taking any action against Air Canada. The purpose of the stay is to provide Air Canada with relief designed to stabilize operations and business relationships with customers, vendors, employees and creditors. The court order also provides that
Air Canada shall honor all airline tickets in the usual and ordinary course of business.

In the event that Air Canada’s restructuring is not successful and it is liquidated, there will likely be limited assets available from which to pay creditor claims. If the restructuring is not successful and any
of Air Canada’s liability for deferred ticket sales is unfunded and such charges are properly reversed by VISA and MasterCard



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

cardholders, the Company may be liable for such reversed charges under the chargeback rules of these card associations. The Company maintains a reserve for
such reversed charges, as described under

Reserve for operating losses

in Note 1 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, but has not made any specific adjustment to that allowance as a result of the Air Canada situation.
According to the Twenty-Sixth Report of the Monitor dated May 20, 2004, deferred ticket revenues for Air Canada as of March 31, 2004, representing advance ticket sales collected, were approximately $557.2 million (Canadian), or $426.2 million
(U.S.), based on then existing exchange rates.

In connection
with the acquisition of the merchant acquiring business of CIBC in March 2001, CIBC agreed to reimburse Global Payments for certain chargeback and credit loss exposure, and on March 20, 2004, this reimbursement obligation expired. According to a
March 2003 affidavit of an Air Canada officer, 80% of Air Canada customers elect to pay using credit cards and, of those credit card users, 29.3% use VISA cards and 8.4% use MasterCard cards. As a result of the expiration of CIBC’s
reimbursement obligation, the Company estimates that its maximum potential chargeback liability exposure relative to Air Canada as of March 31, 2004 was $168-$178 million (Canadian), or $128-$138 million (U.S.), based on exchange rates in existence
on March 31, 2004. This estimate is based on the information contained in the Air Canada affidavit and the information contained in the Twenty-Sixth Report of the Monitor. The Company believes that maximum potential chargeback liability exposure as
of May 31, 2004 is not materially different than the exposure as of March 31, 2004, which is the latest date for publicly available information necessary to determine the Company’s exposure.

Management is continuing to monitor Air Canada’s restructuring. Based on
information currently available, which primarily consists of publicly available information, management believes a material loss to the Company is unlikely as long as Air Canada continues to honor all airline tickets in the ordinary course of
business.

The Company is party to a number of other claims and
lawsuits incidental to its business. In the opinion of management, the reasonably possible outcome of such matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, liquidity or
results of operations.

Line of Credit

On November 25, 2003, the Company entered into a three-year, $350 million
revolving credit facility agreement with a syndicate of U.S. banks. The credit agreement contains certain financial and non-financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this nature. The facility expires in November 2006 and
has a variable interest rate based on a market short-term floating rate plus a margin that varies according to the Company’s leverage position.

In addition, the facility allows us to expand the facility size to $500 million by requesting additional commitments from existing or new lenders. The
Company plans to use the credit facility to fund future strategic acquisitions and to provide a source of working capital for general corporate purposes. This agreement replaces the Company’s prior credit facilities with U.S. banks, which had
an aggregate capacity of $150 million. As of May 31, 2004 the Company had approximately $122 million outstanding on its U.S. credit facility at an interest rate of 1.85%. Unless the Company has additional acquisitions or other capital needs, the
Company intends to pay off this amount in fiscal year 2005. As of May 31, 2003, there were no amounts outstanding on the Company’s U.S. credit facilities.

Line of Credit with Related Party

The Company also has a credit facility from CIBC that provides a line of credit up to $175 million (Canadian), approximately $128 million (U.S.) based on
exchange rates existing on May 31, 2004, with an additional overdraft facility available to cover larger advances during periods of peak usage of credit cards. This line has a variable interest rate based on the CIBC offered rate and it contains
certain financial and non-financial



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

covenants and events of default customary for financings of this nature. The CIBC offered rate is a rate determined at the sole discretion of CIBC that they
are able to obtain short-term deposits of Canadian dollars in the New York interbank Eurocurrency market. This credit facility is secured by a first priority security interest in the Company’s accounts receivable from VISA Canada/International,
and has been guaranteed by certain of the Company’s subsidiaries. This guarantee is subordinate to the Company’s U.S. credit facility. The credit facility was originally scheduled to expire on December 9, 2003 but its expiration date has
been extended until October 31, 2004. The Company is currently negotiating the syndication of this facility among CIBC and a group of U.S. lenders and expects to receive future periodic extensions (if necessary) until the Company completes the
syndication.

The third amendment of the CIBC credit facility,
executed in December 2002, provides for the incurrence of interest costs in connection with offering merchants “same day value” for their deposits. Same day value, which has been an accepted industry practice in Canada for several years,
is the practice of giving merchants same day value for their sales transactions, even though their deposits are made at a later date. Essentially, merchants’ deposits are backdated to the date of the applicable sales transaction. In order to
continue offering “same day value” to the Company’s merchants in Canada after the execution of the third amendment to the CIBC credit facility, the Company has been required to draw on its CIBC credit facility to pay merchants in
advance of the date the Company receives the corresponding funds from VISA Canada/International resulting in a net merchant processing receivable. At May 31, 2004 and 2003, there was $113.2 million and $46.3 million (Canadian), or approximately
$83.1 million and $33.9 million (U.S.), respectively, outstanding on this credit facility, based on then existing exchange rates. The amount borrowed is restricted in use to pay merchants and is generally received from VISA Canada/International on
the following day. The interest rate on the CIBC credit facility at May 31, 2004 was 2.125%.

BIN/ICA Agreements

In
connection with the Company’s acquisition of merchant credit card operations of banks, the Company has also entered into sponsorship or depository and processing agreements (the “Agreements”) with certain of the banks. These
Agreements allow the Company to use the banks’ identification numbers (“BIN/ICA”) to clear credit card transactions through VISA and MasterCard. Certain agreements contain financial covenants, and the Company was in compliance with
all such covenants as of May 31, 2004. In management’s opinion, the Company would be able to obtain alternative BIN/ICA agreements without material impact to the Company in the event of the termination of any one of these Agreements.
