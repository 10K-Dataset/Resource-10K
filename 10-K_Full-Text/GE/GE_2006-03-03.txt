Part
        I

Item
        1. Business

General

Unless
        otherwise indicated by the context, we use the terms “GE,” “GECS” and “GE
        Capital” on the basis of consolidation described in note 1 to the consolidated
        financial statements on page 70 of the 2005 Annual Report to Shareowners
        of
        General Electric Company (the Company). The financial section of such Annual
        Report to Shareowners (pages 41 through 109 of that document) is described
        in
        Part IV Item 15(a)(1) and set forth in Exhibit 13 of this 10-K Report and
        is an integral part hereof. References in Parts I and II of this 10-K Report
        are
        to the page numbers of the 2005 Annual Report to Shareowners. Also, unless
        otherwise indicated by the context, “General Electric” means the parent company,
        General Electric Company.

General
        Electric’s address is 1 River Road, Schenectady, NY 12345-6999; we also maintain
        executive offices at 3135 Easton Turnpike, Fairfield, CT
        06828-0001.

GE
        is one of the largest and most diversified industrial corporations in the
        world.
        We have engaged in developing, manufacturing and marketing a wide variety
        of
        products for the generation, transmission, distribution, control and utilization
        of electricity since our incorporation in 1892. Over the years, we have
        developed or acquired new technologies and services that have broadened
        considerably the scope of our activities.

Our
        products include major appliances; lighting products; industrial automation
        products; medical diagnostic imaging systems; bioscience assays and separation
        technology products; electrical distribution and control equipment; locomotives;
        power generation and delivery products; nuclear power support services and
        fuel
        assemblies; commercial and military aircraft jet engines; chemicals and
        equipment for treatment of water and process systems; security equipment
        and
        systems; and engineered materials, such as plastics and silicones.

Our
        services include product services; electrical product supply houses; electrical
        apparatus installation, engineering, and repair and rebuilding services.
        Through
        our affiliate, NBC Universal, Inc., we produce and deliver network television
        services, operate television stations, produce and distribute motion pictures,
        operate cable/satellite networks, operate theme parks, and program activities
        in
        multimedia and the Internet. Through another affiliate, General Electric
        Capital
        Services, Inc., we offer a broad array of financial and other services including
        consumer financing, commercial and industrial financing, real estate financing,
        asset management and leasing, mortgage services, consumer savings and insurance
        services, and reinsurance.

In
        virtually all of our global business activities, we encounter aggressive
        and
        able competition. In many instances, the competitive climate is characterized
        by
        changing technology that requires continuing research and development, as
        well
        as customer commitments. With respect to manufacturing operations, we believe
        that, in general, we are one of the leading firms in most of the major
        industries in which we participate. The NBC Television Network is one of
        four
        major U.S. commercial broadcast television networks. We also compete with
        syndicated broadcast television programming, cable and satellite television
        programming activities and in the motion picture industry. The businesses
        in
        which GECS engages are subject to competition from various types of financial
        institutions, including commercial banks, thrifts, investment banks,
        broker-dealers, credit unions, leasing companies, consumer loan companies,
        independent finance companies, finance companies associated with manufacturers,
        and insurance and reinsurance companies.

This
        document contains “forward-looking statements”

-

that is, statements related to future, not past, events. In this context,
        forward-looking statements often address our expected future business and
        financial performance, and often contain words such as “expects,” “anticipates,”
“intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” or “will.” Forward-looking statements
        by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain.
        For
        us, particular uncertainties which could adversely or positively affect our
        future results include: the behavior of financial markets, including
        fluctuations in interest rates and commodity prices; strategic actions,
        including dispositions; future integration of acquired businesses; future
        financial performance of major industries which we serve, including, without
        limitation, the air and rail transportation, energy generation, media, real
        estate and healthcare industries; unanticipated loss development in our
        insurance businesses; and numerous other matters of national, regional and
        global scale, including those of a political, economic, business, competitive
        and regulatory nature. These uncertainties may cause our actual future results
        to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking
        statements. We do not undertake to update our forward-looking
        statements.

Our
        consolidated global revenues increased to $77.9 billion in 2005, compared
        with
        $66.9 billion in 2004 and $54.3 billion in 2003. For additional information
        about our global operations, see pages 52 and 53 of the 2005 Annual Report
        to
        Shareowners.

Operating
        Segments

Segment
        revenue and profit information is presented on page 49 of the 2005 Annual
        Report
        to Shareowners. Additional financial data and commentary on recent financial
        results for operating segments are provided on pages 48-52 of that report
        and in
        note 26 (page 97) to the consolidated financial statements.

In
        the fourth quarter of 2005, we announced the planned sale of the property
        and
        casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses and the European life and health
        operations of GE Insurance Solutions Corporation (GE Insurance Solutions)
        and
        completed a Genworth Financial, Inc. (Genworth) secondary public offering,
        which
        reduced our ownership in Genworth to 18%. We have reported both GE Insurance
        Solutions and Genworth as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
        These businesses were previously reported in the Commercial Finance segment.
        Also, during the fourth quarter of 2005, our insurance activities, previously
        reported in the Commercial Finance segment, were transferred to corporate
        items
        and eliminations for all periods presented.

Operating
        businesses that are reported as segments include Infrastructure, Industrial,
        Healthcare, NBC Universal, Commercial Finance and Consumer Finance. There
        is
        appropriate elimination of the net earnings of GECS and the immaterial effect
        of
        transactions between segments to arrive at total consolidated data. A summary
        description of each of our operating segments follows.

We
        will also continue our longstanding practice of providing supplemental
        information for certain businesses within the segments.

Infrastructure

Infrastructure
        (27.9%, 27.8% and 32.4% of consolidated revenues in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
        respectively) produces, sells, finances and services equipment for the air
        transportation and energy generation industries. We also produce, sell and
        service equipment for the rail transportation and water treatment industries.
        During 2005, we made a number of acquisitions, the most significant of which
        was
        Ionics, Inc.

Our
        operations are located in North America, Europe, Asia and South
        America.

Aviation
        and Aviation Financial Services

Aviation
        produces, sells and services jet engines, turboprop and turbo shaft engines,
        and
        related replacement parts for use in military and commercial aircraft. Our
        military engines are used in a wide variety of aircraft including fighters,
        bombers, tankers, helicopters and surveillance aircraft and our commercial
        engines power aircraft in all categories of range: short/medium, intermediate
        and long-range, as well as executive and regional aircraft. We also produce
        engines through CFM International, a company jointly owned by GE and Snecma
        Moteurs of France; and a new engine is being designed and marketed in a joint
        venture with the Pratt & Whitney division of United Technologies
        Corporation.

We
        provide maintenance, component repair and overhaul services (MRO), including
        sales of replacement parts, for many models of engines, including repair
        and
        overhaul of engines manufactured by competitors.

The
        worldwide competition in aircraft jet engines and MRO (including parts sales)
        is
        intense. Both U.S. and export markets are important. Product development
        cycles
        are long and product quality and efficiency are critical to success. Research
        and development expenditures, both customer-financed and internally funded,
        are
        important in this business, as are focused intellectual property strategies
        and
        protection of key aircraft engine design, manufacture, repair and product
        upgrade technologies.

Potential
        sales for any engine are limited by, among other things, its technological
        lifetime, which may vary considerably depending upon the rate of advance
        in
        technology, the small number of potential customers and the limited number
        of
        relevant airframe applications. Aircraft engine orders tend to follow military
        and airline procurement cycles, although these cycles differ from each
        other.

Aviation
        Financial Services is a global commercial aviation financial services business
        that offers a broad range of financial products to airlines, aircraft operators,
        owners, lenders, investors and airport developers. Financial products include
        leases, aircraft purchasing and trading, loans, engine/spare parts financing,
        pilot training, fleet planning and financial advisory services. We operate
        in a
        highly competitive environment. Our competitors include aircraft manufacturers,
        banks, financial institutions, and other finance and leasing companies.
        Competition is based on lease rates and terms, as well as aircraft delivery
        dates, condition and availability.

The
        U.S. commercial aviation industry continues to face challenges and financial
        pressure that affect a portion of our commercial aviation business. Many
        carriers are experiencing major restructuring and reorganization, including
        bankruptcies. These companies have experienced marginal returns and in some
        cases losses resulting from competitive pressures and increased fuel costs.

Energy
        and Energy Financial Services

Energy
        serves power generation, industrial, government and other customers worldwide
        with products and services related to energy production, distribution and
        management. We offer wind turbines as part of our renewable energy portfolio,
        which also includes hydropower, solar, and geothermal technology. We also
        sell
        aircraft engine derivatives for use as industrial power sources. Gas turbines
        and generators are used principally in power plants for generation of
        electricity and for industrial cogeneration and mechanical drive applications.
        We are a worldwide supplier of gas turbines for Integrated Gasification Combined
        Cycle (IGCC) applications, having provided gas turbines for a significant
        number
        of the world's operating IGCC plants. IGCC systems convert coal and other
        hydrocarbons into synthetic gas which, after cleanup, is used as the primary
        fuel for gas turbines in combined-cycle systems. IGCC systems produce fewer
        air
        pollutants compared with traditional pulverized coal power plants. We sell
        steam
        turbines and generators to the electric utility industry and to private
        industrial customers for cogeneration applications. Products also include
        portable and rental power plants. Nuclear reactors, fuel and support services
        for both new and installed boiling water reactors are also a part of this
        segment. We provide our customers with total solutions to meet their needs
        through a complete portfolio of aftermarket services, including equipment
        upgrades, contractual services agreements, repairs, equipment installation,
        monitoring and diagnostics, asset management and performance optimization
        tools,
        remote performance testing and Dry Low NOx (DLN) tuning. We continue to invest
        in advanced technology development that will provide more value to our customers
        and more efficient solutions that comply with today’s strict environmental
        regulations.

Worldwide
        competition for power generation products and services is intense. Demand
        for
        most power generation products and services is global and, as a result, is
        sensitive to the economic and political environment of each country in which
        we
        do business. Regional load growth requirements and demand side management
        are
        important factors. The availability of fuels and related prices have a large
        impact on demand.

Energy
        Financial Services offers structured equity, leveraged leasing, partnerships,
        project finance and broad-based commercial finance to the global energy and
        water industries. We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our
        competitors include banks, financial institutions, energy companies, and
        other
        finance and leasing companies. Competition is based on price, that is interest
        rates and fees, as well as deal structure and terms. As we compete globally,
        our
        success is sensitive to the economic and political environment of each country
        in which we do business.

Oil
        & Gas

Oil
        & Gas offers advanced technology turbomachinery products and services for
        the production, transportation, storage, refining, and distribution of oil

        diesel-electric locomotives as well as parts and services for locomotives,
        including locomotives manufactured by competitors.

(6)

With
        the launch of the Evolution Series™ locomotive, we created our most
        technologically advanced, most fuel-efficient, diesel locomotive, while meeting
        or exceeding the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Tier II requirements.
        Commercial production of the Evolution Series™ locomotive began in January
        2005.

The
        GE suite of locomotive services offerings, designed to improve fleet efficiency
        and reduce operating expenses, includes repair services, locomotive
        enhancements, modernizations, and information-based services like remote
        monitoring and diagnostics. We provide train control products, railway
        management services, and signaling systems to increase service levels, optimize
        asset utilization, and streamline operations for railroad owners and operators.
        We deliver leading edge tools that improve asset availability and reliability,
        optimize network planning, and control network execution to plan. We also
        offer
        leading drive technology solutions to the mining, transit, marine and
        stationary, and drilling industries. Our motors operate in thousands of
        applications, from electrical drive systems for large haulage trucks used
        in the
        mining industry to transit cars and drilling rigs, and our engines are used
        for
        marine power as well as stationary power generation applications. We also
        provide gearing technology for critical applications such as wind
        turbines.

        offers productivity solutions for pure water including the supply of specialty
        chemicals, pumps, valves, filters and fluid handling equipment for improving
        the
        performance of water, wastewater and process systems including mobile treatment
        systems and desalination processes.

For
        information about orders and backlog, see page 50 of the 2005 Annual Report
        to
        Shareholders.

Industrial

Industrial
        (21.8%, 22.8% and 22.1% of consolidated revenues in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
        respectively) produces and sells products including consumer appliances,
        industrial equipment and plastics, and related services. We also finance
        business equipment for a wide variety of customer applications. During 2005,
        we
        made a number of acquisitions, the most significant of which was Edwards
        Systems
        Technology.

Our
        operations are located in North America, Europe, Asia and South
        America.

Consumer
        & Industrial

Consumer
        & Industrial sells products characterized by high volume and relatively low
        unit prices. Our products share several characteristics

-

competitive design, efficient manufacturing and effective distribution and
        service. Strong global competition rarely permits premium pricing, so cost
        control, including productivity, is key. Despite pricing pressures on many
        of
        our products, we also invest in the development of differentiated, premium
        products that are more profitable. While some Consumer & Industrial products
        are primarily directed to consumer applications (major appliances, for example),
        and some primarily to industrial applications (switchgear, for example),
        others
        are directed to both markets (lighting, for example).

We
        sell and service major home appliances including refrigerators, freezers,
        electric and gas ranges, cooktops, dishwashers, clothes washers and dryers,
        microwave ovens, room air conditioners, and residential water systems for
        filtration, softening and heating. Brands are Monogram®, GE Profile™, GE®, and
        Hotpoint®.

(7)

We
        manufacture certain products, and also source finished product and component
        parts from third-party global manufacturers. A large portion of our appliances
        sales are through a variety of retail outlets for replacement of installed
        units. Residential building contractors installing units in new construction
        are
        our second major U.S. channel. We offer the largest manufacturer’s service
        organization in the appliances industry, providing in-home repair, extended
        service plans, warranty administration and risk management services. We also
        manufacture and sell approximately 6,000 different lamp products for commercial,
        industrial and consumer markets, including full lines of incandescent, halogen,
        fluorescent, high-intensity discharge, light-emitting diode, automotive and
        miniature products.

Consumer
        & Industrial also provides integrated electrical equipment and systems used
        to distribute, protect and control energy and equipment. We manufacture and
        distribute electrical distribution and control products including transformers,
        meters, relays, circuit breakers, panel boards and general purpose controls
        that
        are used to distribute and manage power in a variety of residential, commercial,
        consumer and industrial applications. In addition, we design and manufacture
        motors and control systems used in end-industrial and consumer products such
        as
        heating, ventilation and air conditioning, dishwashers, and clothes washers
        and
        dryers. We also provide customer-focused solutions centered on the delivery
        and
        control of electric power, and market a wide variety of commercial lighting
        systems and lighting for aircraft, automotive and other transportation
        applications, front and rear video projection, medical, architectural, fiber
        optic, stage, studio, nightclub and theater applications.

The
        aggregate level of economic activity in markets for such products and services
        generally lags overall economic slowdowns as well as subsequent recoveries.
        In
        the United States, industrial markets are undergoing significant structural
        changes reflecting, among other factors, increased international competition
        and
        pressures to modernize productive capacity.

We
        also have a network of electrical product supply houses selling electrical
        products and parts, fasteners, voice and datacom parts, lighting equipment
        and
        supplies from GE and other leading manufacturers. Our business serves electrical
        contractors, industrial and commercial users, engineer constructors, original
        equipment manufacturers, utilities and the aerospace industry.

Equipment
        Services

Equipment
        Services helps customers manage, finance and operate a wide variety of business
        equipment worldwide. We provide rentals, leases, sales and asset management
        services of commercial and transportation equipment, including tractors,
        trailers, railroad rolling stock, modular space units, intermodal shipping
        containers and, primarily through an associated company, marine containers.
        Our
        operations are conducted in highly competitive markets. Economic conditions,
        geographic location, pricing and equipment availability are important factors
        in
        this business. Future success will depend upon our ability to maintain a
        large
        and diverse customer portfolio, optimize asset mix, maximize asset utilization
        and manage credit risk. In addition, we seek to understand our customers
        and to
        meet their needs with unique, efficient and cost effective product and service
        offerings.

Plastics

Plastics
        manufactures and sells high-performance plastics used by compounders, molders,
        and major original equipment manufacturers for use in a variety of applications,
        including fabrication of automotive parts, computer enclosures, compact disks
        and optical-quality media, major appliance parts, telecommunications equipment
        and construction materials. Our business has a significant operating presence
        around the world and we participate in numerous manufacturing and distribution
        joint ventures.

Our
        business environment is characterized by technological innovation and heavy
        capital investment. To remain competitive we must maintain emphasis on efficient
        manufacturing process implementation and devote significant resources to
        market
        and application development. Our competitors include large, technology-driven
        suppliers of the same, as well as other functionally similar, materials.
        Our
        business is cyclical and is sensitive to variations in price and to the effects
        of supply/demand factors on the cost of raw materials such as benzene, cumene
        and methanol. Competition is affected by availability of manufacturing capacity
        and anticipation of new product or material performance requirements. Our
        application development, often in association with our existing or potential
        customers, and associated technology assistance have added additional market
        demand. Product and manufacturing process patents establish barriers to entry
        in
        many product lines.

Other

Our
        Industrial business sells structured products, silicones and high-purity
        quartzware. Market opportunities are created by substituting many of these

        the
        same, as well as other functionally equivalent products and
        services.

Healthcare

Healthcare
        (10.1%, 10.0% and 9.0% of consolidated revenues in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
        respectively) manufactures, sells and services a wide range of medical equipment
        including equipment for magnetic resonance (MR), computed tomography (CT),

        the
        key factors affecting competition for these products and services. Throughout
        the world, we play a critical role in delivering new technology to improve
        patient outcomes and productivity tools to help control healthcare costs.

NBC
        Universal

NBC
        Universal, Inc. (NBC Universal) (9.8%, 9.6% and 6.1% of consolidated revenues
        in
        2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively) was formed in May 2004 upon the combination
        of NBC with Vivendi Universal Entertainment LLLP and certain related assets.
        NBC
        Universal is principally engaged in the broadcast of network television services
        to affiliated television stations within the United States; the production
        of
        live and recorded television programs; the production and distribution of
        motion
        pictures; the operation, under licenses from the U.S. Federal Communications
        Commission (FCC), of television broadcasting stations; the ownership of several
        cable/satellite networks around the world; the operation of theme parks;
        and
        investment and programming activities in multimedia and the Internet. The
        NBC
        Television Network is one of four major U.S. commercial broadcast television
        networks and serves 230 affiliated stations within the United States. Telemundo
        is a leading U.S. Spanish-language commercial broadcast television network.
        At
        December 31, 2005, we owned and/or operated 30 VHF and UHF television stations
        including those located in Birmingham, AL; Los Angeles, CA; San Diego, CA;
        Hartford, CT; Miami, FL; Chicago, IL; New York, NY; Raleigh-Durham, NC;
        Columbus, OH; Philadelphia, PA; Providence, RI; Dallas, TX; and Washington,
        DC.
        Broadcasting operations of the NBC Television Network, the Telemundo network,
        and the company’s owned stations are subject to FCC regulation. Our operations
        include investment and programming activities in cable television, principally
        through USA Network, Bravo, CNBC, Sci Fi Channel, MSNBC, CNBC Europe, CNBC
        Asia
        Pacific, and entertainment channels across Europe and Latin America; equity
        investments in Arts and Entertainment, The History Channel, the Sundance
        Channel, ValueVision Media, Inc.; and a non-voting interest in Paxson
        Communications Corporation. We have secured exclusive United States television
        rights to the 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2012 Olympic Games.

NBC
        Universal’s broadcast ratings and advertising revenue are affected by viewer
        demographics and the availability of other entertainment choices. In addition,
        recent technological advances like personal video recorders offer personal
        entertainment through new media, introducing additional uncertainty to future
        revenue sources. Other technologies enable copying content, increasing the
        risk
        of content piracy, particularly in international markets where the intellectual
        property laws may not be clear or strictly applied.

Our
        headquarters are in New York, New York and our operations are located in
        North
        America, Europe and Asia.

Commercial
        Finance

Commercial
        Finance (13.8%, 14.5% and 15.0% of consolidated revenues in 2005, 2004 and
        2003,
        respectively) offers a broad range of financial services worldwide. We have
        particular mid-market expertise and offer loans, leases and other financial
        services to customers, including manufacturers, distributors and end-users
        for a
        variety of equipment and major capital assets. These assets include
        industrial-related facilities and equipment; commercial and residential real
        estate; vehicles; corporate aircraft; and equipment used in many industries,
        including the construction, manufacturing, telecommunications and healthcare
        industries.

During
        2005, we made a number of acquisitions, the most significant of which were
        the
        Transportation Financial Services Group of CitiCapital; the Inventory Finance
        division of Bombardier Capital; Antares Capital Corp., a unit of Massachusetts
        Mutual Life Insurance Co.; and ING’s portion of Heller AG.

(11)

We
        operate in a highly competitive environment. Our competitors include commercial
        banks, investment banks, leasing companies, financing companies associated
        with
        manufacturers, and independent finance companies. Competition related to
        our
        lending and leasing operations is based on price, that is interest rates
        and
        fees, as well as deal structure and terms. Profitability is affected not
        only by
        broad economic conditions that affect customer credit quality and the
        availability and cost of capital, but also by successful management of credit
        risk, operating risk and market risks such as interest rate and currency
        exchange risks. Success requires high quality risk management systems, customer
        and industry specific knowledge, diversification, service and distribution
        channels, strong collateral and asset management knowledge, deal structuring
        expertise and the ability to reduce costs through technology and productivity.

Our
        headquarters are in Stamford, Connecticut with offices throughout North America,
        South America, Europe, Australia and Asia.

Capital
        Solutions

Capital
        Solutions offers a broad range of financial services worldwide, and has
        particular mid-market expertise, offering loans, leases, inventory finance
        and
        other financial services to customers, including manufacturers, dealers and
        end-users for a variety of equipment and major capital assets. These assets
        include retail facilities; vehicles; corporate aircraft; and equipment used
        in
        many industries, including the construction, transportation, technology,
        and
        manufacturing industries.

Real
        Estate

Real
        Estate operates globally, both directly and through joint ventures. Our Real
        Estate business finances, with both equity and loan structures, the acquisition,
        refinancing and renovation of office buildings, apartment buildings, retail
        facilities, industrial properties, parking facilities and franchise properties.
        Our typical Real Estate loans are intermediate term, may be either senior
        or
        subordinated, fixed or floating-rate, and are secured by existing
        income-producing commercial properties. Our originations of low loan-to-value
        loans are conducted for term securitization within one year. We invest in,
        and
        provide restructuring financing for, portfolios of mortgage loans, limited
        partnerships and tax-exempt bonds.

Consumer
        Finance

Consumer
        Finance (13.0%, 11.7% and 11.4% of consolidated revenues in 2005, 2004 and
        2003,
        respectively) offers credit and deposit products and services to consumers,
        retailers, brokers and auto dealers in over 50 countries. We offer a broad
        range
        of financial products, including private-label credit cards; bank cards;
        Dual
        Cards™; corporate travel and purchasing cards; personal loans; auto loans;
        leases and inventory financing; residential mortgages; home equity loans;
        debt
        consolidation loans; current and savings accounts and insurance products
        related
        to consumer finance offerings for customers on a global basis.

In
        2005, as part of our continued global expansion, we made a number of
        acquisitions, the most significant of which was a 25.5 percent voting stake
        in
        Garanti Bank, a full service bank in Turkey.

(12)

Our
        operations are subject to a variety of bank and consumer protection regulations,
        including regulations controlling data privacy. Further, a number of countries
        have ceilings on rates chargeable to consumers in financial service
        transactions. We are subject to competition from various types of financial
        institutions including commercial banks, leasing companies, consumer loan
        companies, independent finance companies, manufacturers’ captive finance
        companies, and insurance companies. Industry participants compete on the
        basis
        of price, servicing capability, promotional marketing, risk management, and
        cross selling. The markets in which we operate are also subject to the risks
        from fluctuations in retail sales, interest and currency exchange rates,
        and the
        consumer’s capacity to repay debt.

Our
        headquarters are in Stamford, Connecticut and our operations are located
        in
        North America, South America, Europe, Australia and Asia.

Discontinued
        Operations

On
        November 18, 2005, we announced that we had entered into an agreement with
        Swiss
        Reinsurance Company (Swiss Re) to sell the property and casualty insurance
        and
        reinsurance businesses and the European life and health operations of GE
        Insurance Solutions. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter
        of 2006, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing
        conditions.

In
        May 2004, we completed the initial public offering of Genworth, our formerly
        wholly-owned subsidiary that conducted most of our consumer insurance business,
        including life and mortgage insurance operations. Throughout 2005, we continued
        to reduce our ownership in Genworth, currently at 18%. We intend to continue
        to
        dispose of our remaining shares in 2006, subject to market
        conditions.

We
        reported both the portions of GE Insurance Solutions described above and
        Genworth as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

Research
        and Development

Total
        expenditures for research and development were $3,425 million in 2005. Total
        expenditures were $3,091 million in 2004 and $2,656 million in 2003. Of these
        amounts, $2,741 million in 2005 was GE-funded ($2,443 million in 2004 and
        $2,103
        million in 2003); and $684 million in 2005 was funded by customers ($648
        million
        in 2004 and $553 million in 2003), principally the U.S. government.
        Infrastructure’s Aviation business accounts for the largest share of GE’s
        research and development expenditures from both GE and customer funds.
        Healthcare and Infrastructure’s Energy business also made significant
        expenditures of GE and customer research and development funds.

Environmental
        Matters

Our
        operations, like operations of other companies engaged in similar businesses,
        involve the use, disposal and cleanup of substances regulated under
        environmental protection laws.

We
        are involved in a sizable number of remediation actions to clean up hazardous
        wastes as required by federal and state laws. Such statutes require that
        responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault, legality
        of
        original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. Expenditures for site
        remediation actions amounted to $0.1 billion in each of the last two years.
        We
        presently expect that such remediation actions will require average annual
        expenditures in the range of $0.2 billion to $0.3 billion over the next two
        years.

The
        U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ruled in February 2002 that
        approximately 150,000 pounds of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) must be
        dredged
        from a 40-mile stretch of the upper Hudson River in New York State. On October
        6, 2005, GE and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) entered into
        and
        filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York a
        consent
        decree that, subject to approval of that court, represents a comprehensive
        framework for implementation of the EPA’s 2002 decision to dredge PCB-containing
        sediments in the upper Hudson River. The dredging will be performed in two
        phases with an intervening peer review of performance after phase 1. Under
        this
        consent decree, we have committed up to $0.1 billion to reimburse the EPA
        for
        its past and future project oversight costs and agreed to perform the first
        phase of dredging. We further committed that, subject to future agreement
        with
        the EPA about completion of dredging after completion of phase 1 and the
        peer
        review, we will be responsible for further costs, including costs of phase
        dredging. Our Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2005 and
        2004,
        included liabilities for the estimated costs of this remediation.

See
        page 92 of the 2005 Annual Report to Shareowners for additional discussion
        of
        environmental matters.

Employee
        Relations

At
        year-end 2005, General Electric Company and consolidated affiliates employed
        approximately 316,000 persons, of whom approximately 161,000 were employed
        in
        the United States. For further information about employees, see page 61 of
        the
        2005 Annual Report to Shareowners.

Approximately
        22,650 GE manufacturing and service employees in the United States are
        represented for collective bargaining purposes by a total of approximately
        different local collective bargaining groups. A majority of such employees
        are
        represented by union locals that are affiliated with, and bargain in conjunction
        with, the International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine
        and
        Furniture Workers (IUE/CWA-AFL-CIO). During 2003, General Electric Company
        negotiated four-year contracts with unions representing a substantial majority
        of those United States employees who are represented by unions. Most of these
        contracts will terminate in June 2007. NBC Universal is party to approximately
        160 labor agreements covering about 3,500 staff employees (and a large number
        of
        freelance employees) in the United States. These agreements are with various
        labor unions, expire at various dates and are generally for a term ranging
        from
        three to five years.

Other

Because
        of the diversity of our products and services, as well as the wide geographic
        dispersion of our production facilities, we use numerous sources for the
        wide
        variety of raw materials needed for our operations. We have not been adversely
        affected by the inability to obtain raw materials.

We
        own, or hold licenses to use, numerous patents. New patents are continuously
        being obtained through our research and development activities as existing
        patents expire. Patented inventions are used both within the Company and
        are
        licensed to others, but no operating segment is substantially dependent on
        any
        single patent or group of related patents.

Agencies
        of the U.S. Government constitute our largest single customer. An analysis
        of
        sales of goods and services as a percentage of revenues follows:

GE
        is a trademark and service mark of General Electric Company; NBC is a trademark

Item
        1A.

Risk
        Factors

The
        following discussion of risk factors contains “forward-looking statements,” as
        discussed in Item 1. These risk factors may be important to understanding
        any
        statement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following
        information should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and
        Analysis (MD&A), and the consolidated financial statements and related notes
        incorporated by reference in this report.

Our
        businesses routinely encounter and address risks, some of which will cause
        our
        future results to be different

-

sometimes materially different

-

than we presently anticipate. Discussion about the important operational
        risks
        that our businesses encounter can be found in the MD&A section of our 2005
        Annual Report to Shareowners and in the business descriptions in Item 1.
        of this
        Form 10-K. Below, we have described our present view of certain important
        strategic risks. Our reactions to material future developments as well as
        our
        competitors’ reactions to those developments will determine our future results.

Our
        global growth is subject to a number of economic, political and regulatory
        risks

We
        conduct our operations in virtually every part of the world. Global economic
        and
        regulatory developments affect businesses such as ours in many ways. Operations
        are subject to the effects of global competition. Particular local jurisdiction
        risks include regulatory risks arising from local laws and from local liquidity
        regulations, including risks of not being able to retrieve assets. Our global
        business is affected by local economic environments, including inflation,
        recession and currency volatility. Political changes, some of which may be
        disruptive, can interfere with our supply chain, our customers and all of
        our
        activities in a particular location. While some of these risks can be hedged
        using derivatives or other financial instruments and some are insurable,
        such
        attempts to mitigate these risks are costly and not always successful.

Our
        credit ratings are important to our cost of capital

The
        major debt agencies routinely evaluate our debt and have given their highest
        debt ratings to us. One of our strategic objectives is to maintain these
“Triple
        A” ratings as they serve to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate our access
        to a variety of lenders. Failure to maintain our Triple A debt rating could
        adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins.

The
        disposition of businesses that do not fit with our evolving strategy can
        be
        highly uncertain

We
        will continue to evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses
        that may no longer help us meet our objectives. Our decisions to sell
        Genworth and GE Insurance Solutions are recent examples of disposition
        decisions. When we decide to sell assets or a business, we may encounter
        difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable
        terms
        in a timely manner, which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic
        objectives, or we may dispose of a business at a price or on terms which
        are
        less than we had anticipated. In addition, there is a risk that we sell a
        business whose subsequent performance exceeds our expectations, in which
        case
        our decision would have potentially sacrificed enterprise value.
        Correspondingly, we may be too optimistic about a particular business’s
        prospects, in which case we may be unable to find a buyer at a price acceptable
        to us and therefore may have potentially sacrificed enterprise
        value.

Item
        3. Legal Proceedings

In
        January 2005, the Boston District Office of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
        Commission (SEC) informed us that it had commenced an investigation and
        requested that GE and GE Capital voluntarily provide certain documents and
        information with respect to the use of hedge accounting for derivatives by
        us
        and GE Capital. The SEC Staff advised us in August 2005 that the SEC had
        issued
        a formal order of investigation in connection with this matter, which we
        believe
        to be a common step in the process in such matters. We and GE Capital have
        continued to voluntarily provide documents and information to the SEC Staff
        and
        we are cooperating fully with its investigation.

On
        June 14, 2005, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the
        Southern District of New York seeking documents relating to finite risk
        insurance. The subpoena is general in nature. GE received a similar subpoena
        from the Northeast Regional Office of the SEC on April 29, 2005. We are
        cooperating fully with the SEC and the U.S. Attorney’s Office.

On
        October 6, 2005, GE and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) entered
        into and filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New
        York
        a consent decree that, subject to approval of that court, represents a
        comprehensive framework for implementation of the EPA’s 2002 decision to dredge
        PCB-containing sediments in the upper Hudson River. The dredging will be
        performed in two phases with an intervening peer review of performance after
        phase 1. Under this consent decree, we have committed up to $111 million
        to
        reimburse the EPA for its past and future project oversight costs and agreed
        to
        perform the first phase of dredging. We further committed that, subject to
        future agreement with the EPA about completion of dredging after completion
        of
        phase 1 and the peer review, we will be responsible for further costs, including
        costs of phase 2 dredging. Our Statement of Financial Position as of December
        31, 2005, included liabilities for our estimates of the future costs of this
        remediation.

With
        respect to “Market Information”, in the United States, GE common stock is listed
        on the New York Stock Exchange (its principal market) and on the Boston Stock
        Exchange. GE common stock also is listed on The London Stock Exchange and
        on
        Euronext Paris. Trading prices, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange,
        Inc., Composite Transactions Tape, and dividend information follow:

As
        of January 31, 2006, there were about 646,000 shareowner accounts of record.

(a)

Information
                  is presented on a fiscal calendar basis, consistent with our quarterly
                  financial reporting.

(b)

This
                  category includes 14,653 thousand shares repurchased from our various
                  benefit plans, primarily the GE Savings and Security Program (the
                  S&SP). Through the S&SP, a defined contribution plan with 401(k)
                  features, we repurchase shares resulting from changes in investment
                  options by plan participants.

(c)

This
                  balance represents the number of shares that were repurchased through
                  the
                  2004 GE Share Repurchase Program as modified by the GE Board in
                  November
                  2005 (the Program) under which we were authorized to repurchase
                  up to $25
                  billion of Company common stock through 2008. The Program is flexible
                  and
                  shares are acquired with a combination of borrowings and free cash
                  flow
                  from the public markets and other sources, including GE Stock Direct,
                  a
                  stock purchase plan that is available to the public. As major acquisitions
                  or other circumstances warrant, we modify the frequency and amount
                  of
                  share repurchases under the Program.
