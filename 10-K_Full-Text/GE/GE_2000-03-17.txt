Part I

Item 1. Business

General

Unless otherwise indicated by the context, the terms "GE," "GECS" and "GE
Capital Services" are used on the basis of consolidation described in note
1 to the consolidated financial statements on page 56 of the 1999 Annual
Report to Share Owners of General Electric Company. The financial section
of such Annual Report to Share Owners (pages 33 through 76 of that document)
is set forth in Part IV Item 14(a)(1) of this 10-K Report and is an integral
part hereof. References in Parts I and II of this 10-K Report are to the
page numbers of the 1999 Annual Report to Share Owners included in Part
IV of this 10-K Report. Also, unless otherwise indicated by the context,
"General Electric" means the parent company, General Electric Company.

General Electric's address is 1 River Road, Schenectady, NY 12345-6999;
the Company also maintains executive offices at 3135 Easton Turnpike, Fairfield,
CT 06431-0001.

GE is one of the largest and most diversified industrial corporations in
the world. GE has engaged in developing, manufacturing and marketing a
wide variety of products for the generation, transmission, distribution,
control and utilization of electricity since its incorporation in 1892.
Over the years, GE has developed or acquired new technologies and services
that have broadened considerably the scope of its activities.

GE's products include major appliances; lighting products; industrial automation
products; medical diagnostic imaging equipment; motors; electrical distribution
and control equipment; locomotives; power generation and delivery products;
nuclear power support services and fuel assemblies; commercial and military
aircraft jet engines; and engineered materials, such as plastics, silicones
and superabrasive industrial diamonds.

GE's services include product services; electrical product supply houses;
electrical apparatus installation, engineering, repair and rebuilding services;
and computer-related information services. Through its affiliate, the National
Broadcasting Company, Inc., GE delivers network television services, operates
television stations, and provides cable, Internet and multimedia programming
and distribution services. Through another affiliate, General Electric
Capital Services, Inc., GE offers a broad array of financial and other
services including consumer financing, commercial and industrial financing,
real estate financing, asset management and leasing, mortgage services,
consumer savings and insurance services, specialty insurance and reinsurance,
and satellite communications.

In virtually all of its global business activities, the Company encounters
aggressive and able competition. In many instances, the competitive climate
is characterized by changing technology that requires continuing research
and development commitments, and by capital-intensive needs to meet customer
requirements. With respect to manufacturing operations, management believes
that, in general, GE is one of the leading firms in most of the major industries
in which it participates. The NBC Television Network is one of four major
U.S. commercial broadcast television networks. It also competes with two
relatively new commercial broadcast networks, syndicated broadcast television
programming and cable and satellite television programming activities.
The businesses in which GE Capital Services engages are subject to competition
from various types of financial institutions, including commercial banks,
thrifts, investment banks, broker-dealers, credit unions, leasing companies,
consumer loan companies, independent finance companies, finance companies
associated with manufacturers, and insurance and reinsurance companies.

GE has substantial export sales from the United States. In addition, the
Company has expanded significantly its non-U.S. activities through majority,
minority or other joint venture interests in companies engaged primarily
in manufacturing and distributing products and providing nonfinancial services
similar to those sold within the United States. GECS financial services
operations outside the United States also have expanded considerably over
the past several years.

Operating Segments

Revenue and segment profit information about the Company's operating segments
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.

, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information

,
is presented on page 44 of the 1999 Annual Report to Share Owners. Additional
financial data and commentary on recent financial results for operating
segments are provided on pages 43-48 of that Report and in note 28 (pages
72 and 73) to the consolidated financial statements.

Operating businesses that are reported as segments under SFAS No. 131 include
Aircraft Engines, Appliances, GECS, Power Systems, Plastics and NBC. The
remaining key businesses do not meet the definition of a reportable segment
and have been aggregated into two operating segments based on common characteristics
of their activities (Industrial Products and Systems, and Technical Products
and Services). For the GECS segment, revenues and net earnings are presented
and analyzed on pages 46-48 of the 1999 Annual Report to Shares Owners
by the five major operating activities in which it conducts its business
(consumer services, equipment management, mid-market financing, specialized
financing and specialty insurance). There is appropriate elimination of
the net earnings of GECS and the immaterial effect of transactions between
GE and GECS segments to arrive at total consolidated data. A summary description
of each of the Company's operating segments follows.

Aircraft Engines

Aircraft Engines (9.5%, 10.2% and 8.6% of consolidated revenues in 1999,
1998 and 1997, respectively) produces, sells and services jet engines,
turboprop and turboshaft engines, and related replacement parts for use
in military and commercial aircraft. GE's military engines are used in
a wide variety of aircraft that includes fighters, bombers, tankers, helicopters
and surveillance aircraft. The CFM56, produced by CFMI, a company jointly
owned by GE and Snecma of France, and GE's CF6 engines power aircraft in
all categories of large commercial aircraft: short/medium, intermediate
and long-range. Applications for the CFM56 engine include: Boeing's 737-300/-400/-500
series, the next generation 737-600X/-700/-800/-900 series, and the 737
business jet; Airbus Industrie's A318, A319, A320, A321 and A340 series;
and military aircraft such as the KC-135R, E/KE-3 and E-6. The CF6 family
of engines powers intermediate and long-range aircraft such as Boeing's
747, 767, DC-10 and MD-11 series, as well as Airbus Industrie's A300, A310
and A330 series. The GE90 engine is used to power Boeing's 777 series twin-engine
aircraft. The business also produces jet engines for executive aircraft
and regional commuter aircraft and aircraft engine derivatives used for
marine propulsion, mechanical drives and industrial power generation sources.
These aircraft engine derivatives are also reported as part of the Power
Systems segment. Maintenance, overhaul and component repair services are
provided for many models of engines, including engines manufactured by
competitors. The business further expanded its product services operations
through acquisitions of the overhaul operations of Varig Airlines in 1998
and Greenwich Air Services/UNC in 1997.

The worldwide competition in aircraft jet engines is intense. Both U.S.
and export markets are important. Product development cycles are long and
product quality and efficiency are critical to success. Research and development
expenditures, both customer-financed and internally funded, are also important
in this segment. Potential sales for any engine are limited by, among other
things, its technological lifetime, which may vary considerably depending
upon the rate of advance in the state of the art, by the small number of
potential customers and by the limited number of applicable airframe applications.
Sales of product services (replacement parts and services) are an important
part of the business. Aircraft engine orders tend to follow military and
airline procurement cycles, although cycles for military and commercial
engine procurement are different. Procurements of military jet engines
are affected by changes in global political and economic factors.

In line with industry practice, sales of commercial jet aircraft engines
often involve long-term financing commitments to customers. In making such
commitments, it is GE's general practice to require that it have or be
able to establish a secured position in the aircraft being financed. Under
such airline financing programs, GE had issued loans and guarantees (principally
guarantees) amounting to $1.5 billion at year-end 1999, and had entered
into commitments totaling $1.8 billion to provide financial assistance
on future aircraft engine sales. Estimated fair values of the aircraft
securing these receivables and associated guarantees exceeded the related
account balances and guaranteed amounts at December 31, 1999.

For current information about Aircraft Engines orders and backlog, see
page 45 of the 1999 Annual Report to Share Owners.

Appliances

Appliances (5.1%, 5.6% and 6.4% of consolidated revenues in 1999, 1998
and 1997, respectively) manufactures and/or markets a single class of product
- -- major appliances -- that includes refrigerators, electric and gas ranges,
microwave ovens, freezers, dishwashers, clothes washers and dryers, water-softening
and filtering products, and room air conditioning equipment. These are
sold under GE, Hotpoint, Monogram, Profile and Profile Performance
brands as well as under private brands for retailers and others. GE microwave
ovens, room air conditioners, water softening and filtering products, and
freezers are sourced from suppliers while investment in Company-owned facilities
is focused on refrigerators, dishwashers, ranges (primarily electric, but
some gas) and home laundry equipment. A large portion of appliance sales
is for replacement of installed units. Such sales are through a variety
of retail outlets. The other principal channel consists of residential
building contractors who install appliances in new dwellings. GE has an
extensive U.S. product services network that provides repair services,
expanded service plans, warranty administration and risk management services.

Demand for appliances is influenced by economic trends such as increases
or decreases in consumer disposable income, availability of credit and
housing construction. Competition is very active in all products and comes
from a number of principal manufacturers and suppliers. An important factor
is innovation and new product features. GE Appliances continued to use
its Six Sigma new product introduction process to bring new, exciting products
to the consumer. In 1999 we launched the revolutionary Advantium™ speedcooking
oven which cooks oven quality food in one-fourth the time of a conventional
oven. Highlighting this revolutionary advance in cooking technology were
best new product of the year awards from

Business Week

and

Popular
Science

. We also introduced the Triton™ Dishwasher, Spectra™ Electric
Range and CustomStyle™ Refrigerator. Quality is also a key element to
success in the appliance market. Our Six Sigma quality initiative continues
to enable the business to improve the quality of products to record levels,
reduce waste and provide better product services. Other significant factors
include product cost, brand recognition, customer responsiveness and appliance
service capability.

GE Appliances aggressively added to its e-commerce capabilities in 1999.
During the year the business sold more than $2 billion of appliances electronically
and more than $500 million using its state-of-the-art CustomerNet website.
In addition, the business formed strategic partnerships with BuildNet.com,
ImproveNet.com and JG Sullivan Interactive to further enable GE Appliances
to utilize the Internet to serve its customers.

Industrial Products and Systems

Industrial Products and Systems (10.4%, 11.2% and 12.1% of consolidated
revenues in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively) encompasses the following
businesses: Lighting, Transportation Systems, Industrial Systems, and GE
Supply. Products and services provided by each of the businesses in this
segment are sold primarily to industrial customers, including original
equipment manufacturers, industrial end users, utilities, electrical contractors,
as well as to distributors. These businesses compete against a variety
of both U.S. and non-U.S. manufacturers and service providers. Markets
for industrial products and services are diverse, global and highly price
competitive. The aggregate level of economic activity in markets for such
products and services generally lag overall economic slowdowns as well
as subsequent recoveries. In the United States, industrial markets are
undergoing significant structural changes reflecting, among other factors,
increased international competition and pressures to modernize productive
capacity. A description of products and services provided by each of the
businesses in this segment follows.

Lighting includes a wide variety of lamps -- incandescent, fluorescent,
high intensity discharge, halogen and specialty -- as well as outdoor lighting
fixtures, wiring devices and quartz products. Customers for lighting products
are diverse, ranging from household consumers to commercial and industrial
end users and original equipment manufacturers. Markets and customers are
global. In early 1999, the business formed GELcore LLC, a joint venture
with Emcore Corporation, focusing on the technology and market development
of "white light" LEDs (light-emitting diodes). Additionally, its industrial
fixtures business acquired a majority interest in Hadasa, a Spanish company
specializing in the manufacture and sale of high-intensity discharge lighting
fixtures. In 1997, the business acquired certain assets of Flame Electrical
Ltd., a lighting products distributor in South Africa, and entered into
an agreement with MagneTek, Inc. that provides GE exclusive sales responsibility
for electronic ballasts in North America.

Transportation Systems includes locomotives, transit propulsion and control
equipment, motorized wheels for off-highway vehicles such as those used
in mining operations, motors for drilling devices, and parts and product
services for the foregoing. Locomotives are sold worldwide, principally
to railroads, while customers for other products include state and urban
transit authorities and industrial users. An increasingly important product
line is the alternating current (AC) locomotive, which was first introduced
at 4,400 horsepower. In 1998, the business began delivering a new 6,000
horsepower AC unit. Product services include maintenance and repair of
locomotives and communications and logistics systems for locomotive, train
and fleet control provided through GE-Harris Railway Electronics, L.L.C.,
a joint venture with Harris Corporation. Information about Transportation
Systems orders and backlog is provided on page 45 of the 1999 Annual Report
to Share Owners.

Industrial Systems includes electric motors and related products and services
for the appliance, commercial, industrial, heating, air conditioning, automotive
and utility markets; power delivery and control products such as circuit
breakers, transformers, electricity meters, relays, capacitors and arresters
sold for installation in commercial, industrial and residential facilities;
electrical and electronic industrial automation products, including drive
systems, for metal and paper processing, mining, utilities and marine applications.
Product services include engineering, management and technical expertise
for power plants and other large projects; maintenance, inspection, repair
and rebuilding of electrical apparatus produced by GE and others; and on-site
engineering and upgrading of already installed products sold by GE and
others. Other product services include the integration of software with
hardware (principally motors, drives and programmable controls) into customized
systems solutions for customers in the semiconductor, water treatment,
pulp and paper, and petroleum industries. In 1999, the business strengthened
its position in the equipment market by acquiring the GEC Alstom Low Voltage
business in the United Kingdom and the GEC Alstom and AEG-NGEF Ltd. businesses
in India. In 1997, the business expanded its presence in this emerging
market segment through several small acquisitions. Motor products are used
within GE and also are sold externally. Industrial automation products
cover a broad range of electrical and electronic products with emphasis
on manufacturing and advanced engineering automation applications. Through
a 50-50 joint venture (GE Fanuc Automation Corporation) which has two operating
subsidiaries (one in North America and the other in Europe), the business
offers a wide range of high-technology industrial automation systems and
equipment, including computer numerical controls and programmable logic
controls. In 1998, GE Fanuc acquired Total Control Products, Inc., strengthening
its position in the emerging market for open control systems.

GE Supply operates a U.S. network of electrical supply houses and, through
its affiliates, has operations in Mexico, Brazil and Ireland. GE Supply
offers products of General Electric and other manufacturers to electrical
contractors and to industrial, commercial and utility customers.

NBC

NBC (5.2%, 5.2% and 5.7% of consolidated revenues in 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively) is principally engaged in the broadcast of network television
services to affiliated television stations within the United States; the
production of live and recorded television programs; the operation, under
licenses from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), of television
broadcasting stations; the ownership of four cable/satellite networks around
the world, and investment and programming activities in multimedia, the
Internet and cable television. The NBC Television Network is one of four
major U.S. commercial broadcast television networks and serves more than
220 affiliated stations within the United States. At December 31, 1999,
NBC owned and/or operated 13 VHF and UHF television stations located in
Birmingham, AL; Los Angeles, CA; San Diego, CA; Hartford, CT; Miami, FL;
Chicago, IL; Columbus, OH; New York, NY; Raleigh-Durham, NC; Philadelphia,
PA; Providence, RI; Dallas, TX; and Washington, DC. Broadcasting operations,
including the NBC Television Network and owned stations, are subject to
FCC regulation. NBC's operations include investment and programming activities
in cable television, principally through CNBC, MSNBC, CNBC Europe, and
CNBC Asia, as well as equity investments in Arts and Entertainment, The
History Channel, ValueVision, Inc. and Rainbow Media Holdings, Inc. in
the United States. In 1999, NBC contributed NBC.com, NBC-IN.com and VideoSeeker,
its interest in Snap, an Internet directory and search services business,
plus a 10% interest in CNBC.com, to NBC Internet, Inc. (NBCi), a newly-formed
entity combining NBC's contributed Internet assets with the businesses
of Xoom.com, a community services Internet site, and Snap.com in exchange
for a non-controlling interest of approximately 47.3% in NBCi. Also in
1999, NBC launched CNBC.com, an Internet financial information service
developed in connection with its CNBC cable television channel. NBC also
acquired $415 million in convertible preferred stock of Paxson Communications
Corporation, which, if converted, would represent approximately 32% of
common stock of Paxson, together with the right to acquire up to a total
of approximately 49% of the common stock of Paxson (including Chairman
Lowell Paxson's controlling stock) after February 1, 2002 if FCC rules
then permit. NBC entered into long-term arrangements with Triple Crown
Productions and the National Association For Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR)
that give NBC exclusive American broadcast rights to the Kentucky Derby,
the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes beginning in 2001 through 2005
and, in conjunction with Turner Broadcasting System, Inc., to the exclusive
television rights to 20 NASCAR races per network per year beginning in
2001 through 2006. In 1998, NBC acquired a majority ownership position
in KXAS, a television station in Dallas, and an equity stake in Snap. 1998
marked the end of a 33-year affiliation with the National Football League.
In 1997, the business entered into a strategic alliance with Dow Jones
that merged the European and Asian business news services of Dow Jones
with those of CNBC and uses Dow Jones editorial resources in the United
States. The business also entered into long-term arrangements with the
National Basketball Association (NBA) and the United States Golf Association
(USGA) that give NBC exclusive national over-the-air broadcast rights to
NBA games through the 2002 season and to the USGA's major golf championships
through the year 2003. NBC also has secured United States television rights
to the 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008 Olympic Games.

Plastics

Plastics (6.2%, 6.6% and 7.4% of consolidated revenues in 1999, 1998 and
1997, respectively) includes high-performance plastics used by compounders,
molders and major original equipment manufacturers for use in a variety
of applications, including fabrication of automotive parts, computer enclosures,
compact disks and optical-quality media, major appliance parts and construction
materials. Products also include ABS resins, silicones, superabrasive industrial
diamonds and laminates. Market opportunities for many of these products
are created by substituting resins for other materials, which provides
customers with productivity through improved material performance at lower
cost. These materials are sold to a diverse worldwide customer base, mainly
manufacturers. The business has a significant operating presence around
the world and participates in numerous manufacturing and distribution joint
ventures. During 1999, in addition to its polycarbonate plant in Cartagena,
Spain the business announced plans to build new compounding plants in both
Thailand and China. Also in 1999, Plastics moved forward with its e-commerce
initiative, growing internet sales from essentially zero in January 1999
to more than $5 million per week today. During 1998, the business established
two joint ventures with Bayer of Germany. The first venture, Exatec, is
developing polycarbonate automotive glazing technology and manufacturing
systems. The second venture, GE-Bayer Silicones Europe, strengthens the
position of the silicones business in the European region.

The materials business environment is characterized by technological innovation
and heavy capital investment. Being competitive requires emphasis on efficient
manufacturing process implementation and significant resources devoted
to market and application development. Competitors include large, technology-driven
suppliers of the same, as well as other functionally equivalent, materials.
The business is cyclical and is subject to variations in price and in the
availability of raw materials, such as cumene, benzene and methanol. Adequate
capacity to satisfy growing demand and anticipation of new product or material
performance requirements are key factors affecting competition.

Power Systems

Power Systems (9.0%, 8.4% and 8.7% of consolidated revenues in 1999, 1998
and 1997, respectively) serves utility, industrial and governmental customers
worldwide with electricity generating products, services and energy management
systems. Gas turbines are used principally in power plants for generation
of electricity and for industrial cogeneration and mechanical drive applications.
In 1999, the business acquired the heavy duty gas turbine division at Alstom
with manufacturing facilities in France and Germany. In 1998, the business
acquired the gas turbine division of Stewart and Stevenson Services, Inc.,
which further expands its product and product services offerings to the
industrial power generation market. Power Systems also packages aircraft
engine derivatives for use as industrial power sources. This activity is
also reported in the Aircraft Engines segment. Centrifugal compressors
are sold for application in gas reinjection, pipeline services and such
process applications as refineries and ammonia plants. Steam turbine-generators
are sold to the electric utility industry and to private industrial customers
for cogeneration applications. Nuclear reactors, fuel and support services
for both new and installed boiling water reactors are also a part of this
segment. There have been no nuclear power plant orders in the United States
since the mid-1970's. However, the business is currently participating
in the construction of nuclear power plants in Japan and Taiwan. The business
continues to invest in advanced technology development and to focus its
resources in refueling and servicing its installed boiling-water reactors.

Worldwide competition for power generation products and services is intense.
Demand for most power generation products and services is worldwide and
as a result is sensitive to the economic and political environment of each
country in which the business participates. In the United States, demand
for power generation equipment is sensitive to the financial condition
of the electric utility industry as well as the electric power conservation
efforts by power users. Internationally, the influence of petroleum and
related prices has a large impact on demand. For information about orders
and backlog, see page 45 of the 1999 Annual Report to Share Owners.

Technical Products and Services

Technical Products and Services (6.1%, 5.3% and 5.4% of consolidated revenues
in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively) consists of technology operations
providing products, systems and services to a variety of customers. Principal
businesses included in this segment are Medical Systems and Information
Services.

Medical Systems includes magnetic resonance (MR) scanners, computed tomography
(CT) scanners, x-ray, nuclear imaging, ultrasound, and other diagnostic
and therapy equipment, and product services sold to hospitals and medical
facilities worldwide. Product services include remote diagnostic and repair
services for medical equipment manufactured by GE and by others, as well
as computerized data management and customer productivity services. GE
Medical Systems has a significant operating presence in Europe and Asia,
including the operations of its affiliates, GE Medical Systems S.A. (France),
GE Yokogawa Medical Systems (Japan) and WIPRO GE Medical Systems (India).
Acquisitions in 1999 included OEC Medical Systems, a leader in mobile and
surgical x-ray systems, and Applicare, a leading supplier of web-based
archiving and imaging services. In addition, we announced our agreement
to acquire MECON, a leader in healthcare data mining. In 1998, the business
completed three strategic acquisitions: Marquette Medical Systems, a global
leader in diagnostic cardiology and patient monitoring devices, Diasonics
Vingmed Ultrasound, a leading maker of cardiac ultrasound systems, and
Elscint Ltd., which enhances Medical Systems' position in the nuclear imaging
and magnetic resonance imaging segments. In 1997, the business acquired
Lockheed Martin Medical Systems and a 20% stake in ALI, a leader in ultrasound
image archiving. See page 46 of the 1999 Annual Report to Share Owners
for information about orders and backlog of GE Medical Systems.

Business-to-business electronic commerce solutions are provided to over
100,000 trading partners around the world by GE Information Services (GEIS).
Its global network-based solutions include Electronic Data Interchange
and messaging services, Internet, extranet and systems integration services,
and a line of applications that help customers to lower their costs, reduce
cycle times, and improve quality in purchasing, logistics, and supplier
and distribution channel management.

Serving a range of customers with special needs (which are rapidly changing
in areas such as medical and information systems), businesses in this segment
compete against a variety of both U.S. and non-U.S. manufacturers or services
operations. Technological competence and innovation, excellence in design,
high product performance, quality of services and competitive pricing are
among the key factors affecting competition for these products and services.
Throughout the world, demands on health care providers to control costs
have become much more important.

GECS

GECS (49.9%, 48.5% and 44.0% of consolidated revenues in 1999, 1998 and
1997, respectively) consists of 28 businesses that, for purposes of analysis,
are grouped into five key operating activities: consumer services, equipment
management, mid-market financing, specialized financing and specialty insurance.
In addition, as discussed on page 48 of the 1999 GE Annual Report to Share
Owners, GECS acquired control of Montgomery Ward LLC ("Wards") on August
2, 1999. Further information about Wards is provided in the description
of GECS All Other operating activities. Very little of the financing provided
by GECS businesses involves products that are manufactured by GE.

GE Capital's activities are subject to a variety of federal and state regulations
including, at the federal level, the Consumer Credit Protection Act, the
Equal Credit Opportunity Act and certain regulations issued by the Federal
Trade Commission. A majority of states have ceilings on rates chargeable
to customers in retail time sales transactions, installment loans and revolving
credit financing. Common carrier services of GE Americom are subject to
regulation by the Federal Communications Commission. Certain GECS consolidated
affiliates are restricted from remitting funds to GECS in the form of dividends
or loans by a variety of regulations, the purpose of which is to protect
affected insurance policyholders, depositors or investors. GECS' international
operations are also subject to regulation in their respective jurisdictions.
To date, compliance with the regulations discussed above has not had a
material adverse effect on GE Capital's financial position or results of
operations.

On March 28, 1991, GE entered into an agreement to make payments to GE
Capital, constituting additions to pre-tax income, to the extent necessary
to cause the ratio of earnings to fixed charges of GE Capital and consolidated
affiliates (determined on a consolidated basis) to be not less than 1.10
for the period, as a single aggregation, of each GE Capital fiscal year
commencing with fiscal year 1991. The agreement can only be terminated
by written notice and termination is not effective until the third anniversary
of the date of such notice. GE Capital's ratios of earnings to fixed charges
for the years 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively, were 1.60, 1.50 and 1.48,
substantially above the level at which payments would be required. Under
a separate agreement, GE has committed to make a capital contribution to
GE Capital in the event certain GE Capital preferred stock is redeemed
and such redemption were to cause the GE Capital debt-to-equity ratio,
excluding from equity all net unrealized gains and losses on investment
securities, to exceed 8 to 1.

A description of principal businesses included in each of GECS operating
activities follows.

Consumer Services

GE Financial Assurance ("GEFA") provides consumers financial security solutions
by selling a wide variety of insurance, investment and retirement products,
primarily in the United States and Japan. These products help consumers
accumulate wealth, transfer wealth, and protect their lifestyles and assets
and are sold through a family of regulated insurance and annuity companies.
GEFA's principal product lines are annuities (deferred and immediate; either

Executive Officers

Other

Because of the diversity of the Company's products and services, as well
as the wide geographic dispersion of its production facilities, the Company
uses numerous sources for the wide variety of raw materials needed for
its operations. The Company has not been adversely affected by inability
to obtain raw materials.

The Company owns, or holds licenses to use, numerous patents. New patents
are continuously being obtained through the Company's research and development
activities as existing patents expire. Patented inventions are used both
within the Company and licensed to others, but no operating segment is
substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents.

Agencies of the U.S. Government constitute GE's largest single customer.
An analysis of sales of goods and services as a percentage of revenues
follows:

Item 2. Properties

Manufacturing operations are carried out at approximately 131 manufacturing
plants located in 33 states in the United States and Puerto Rico and at
some 154 manufacturing plants located in 31 other countries.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

General

As previously reported, on March 12, 1993, a complaint was filed in United
States District Court for the District of Connecticut by ten employees
of the Company's former Aerospace business, purportedly on behalf of all
GE Aerospace employees whose GE employment status is or was affected by
the then planned transfer of GE Aerospace to a new company controlled by
the stockholders of Martin Marietta Corporation. The complaint sought to
clarify and enforce the plaintiffs' claimed rights to pension benefits
in accordance with, and rights to assets then held in, the GE Pension Plan
(the "Plan"). The complaint named the Company, the trustees of the GE Pension
Trust ("Trust"), and Martin Marietta Corporation and one of its former
plan administrators as defendants. The complaint alleged primarily that
the Company's planned transfer of certain assets of the Trust to a Martin
Marietta pension trust, in connection with the transfer of the Aerospace
business, violated the rights of the plaintiffs under the Plan and applicable
provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the
Internal Revenue Code. The complaint sought equitable and declaratory relief,
including an injunction against transfer of the Plan assets except under
circumstances and protections, if any, approved by the court, an order
that the Company disgorge all profits allegedly received by it as a result
of any such transfer and the making of restitution to the Trust for alleged
investment losses resulting from the Company's treatment of Plan assets
in connection with the transaction or alternatively the transfer of additional
assets from the Trust to a new Martin Marietta pension trust, and an order
requiring Martin Marietta to continue to offer transferred employees all
accrued pension-related benefits for which they were eligible under the
Plan as of the closing date of the transfer of the GE Aerospace business
to Martin Marietta. On March 23, 1993, the Company and Martin Marietta
Corporation filed motions to dismiss the complaint on the basis that the
complaint does not state any claim upon which relief can be granted as
a matter of law. On April 2, 1993, the transfer of the Aerospace business
occurred, and on June 7, 1993, the court issued an order denying plaintiffs'
request for injunctive relief. On September 26, 1996, the District Court
granted defendants' motion to dismiss those claims which were based on
allegations that the transfer of plan assets was unlawful, and ordered
discovery on the remaining claims. On September 28, 1998, the class was
certified as to the remaining claims.

As previously reported, the directors (other than Messrs. Cash,
Fudge, Gonzalez, Jung, Langone, McNealy, Nunn, Opie, Penske and Warner)
and certain officers are defendants in a civil suit purportedly brought
on behalf of the Company as a shareholder derivative action by Leslie McNeil,
Harold Sachs, Arun Shingala and Paul and Harriet Luts (the McNeil action)
in New York State Supreme Court on November 19, 1991. The suit alleges
the Company was negligent and engaged in fraud in connection with the design
and construction of containment systems for nuclear power plants and contends
that, as a result, GE has incurred significant financial liabilities and
is potentially exposed to additional liabilities from claims brought by
the Company's customers. The suit alleges breach of fiduciary duty by the
defendants and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief.
On March 31, 1992, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the suit. On
September 28, 1992, the court denied the motions as premature but ruled
that they may be renewed after the completion of limited discovery. Defendants
moved for reconsideration of that order, and on April 3, 1993, the court
granted defendants' motion for reconsideration and directed that discovery
be stayed pending the filing of an amended complaint. Plaintiffs filed
an amended complaint on March 18, 1994, alleging breach of fiduciary duty,
waste and indemnification claims. The defendants have moved to dismiss
the amended complaint. The Company and the defendants believe the plaintiffs'
claims are without merit.

Environmental

As previously reported, in May 1999, the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation informed the company that it was seeking penalties of $325,000
for violations of the state's Clean Water Act at its Waterford, NY facility.
The state alleges discharges in excess of permitted limits as well as reporting
violations. The state has since reduced its penalty demand to $200,000.
The matter is still subject to negotiation.

For further information regarding environmental matters, see pages 54 and
68 of GE's 1999 Annual Report to Share Owners.

It is the view of management that none of the above described proceedings
will have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results
of operations, liquidity or competitive position.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

The financial data in this report, including the audited financial statements,
have been prepared by management using the best available information and
applying judgment. Accounting principles used in preparing the financial
statements are those that are generally accepted in the United States.

         Management believes that a sound, dynamic system of internal financial
controls that balances benefits and costs provides a vital ingredient for the
Company's Six Sigma quality program as well as the best safeguard for Company
assets. Professional financial managers are responsible for implementing and
overseeing the financial control system, reporting on management's stewardship
of the assets entrusted to it by share owners and maintaining accurate records.

         GE is dedicated to the highest standards of integrity, ethics and
social responsibility. This dedication is reflected in written policy statements
covering, among other subjects, environmental protection, potentially
conflicting outside interests of employees, compliance with antitrust laws,
proper business practices, and adherence to the highest standards of conduct and
practices in transactions with customers, including the U.S. government.
Management continually emphasizes to all employees that even the appearance of
impropriety can erode public confidence in the Company. Ongoing education and
communication programs and review activities, such as those conducted by the
Company's Policy Compliance Review Board, are designed to create a strong
compliance culture--one that encourages employees to raise their policy
questions and concerns and that prohibits retribution for doing so.

         KPMG LLP, independent auditors, provide an objective, independent
review of management's discharge of its obligations relating to the fairness of
reporting of operating results and financial condition. Their report for 1999
appears below.

         The Audit Committee of the Board (consisting solely of Directors from
outside GE) maintains an ongoing appraisal--on behalf of share owners--of the
activities and independence of the Company's independent auditors, the
activities of its audit staff, financial reporting process, internal financial
controls and compliance with key Company policies.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

TO SHARE OWNERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF
GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY

We have audited the financial statements of General Electric Company and
consolidated affiliates as listed in Item 14 (a)1 on page 22. These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the aforementioned financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of General Electric Company and
consolidated affiliates at December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

General Electric Company's consolidated financial statements represent the
combination of the Company's manufacturing and nonfinancial services businesses
("GE") and the accounts of General Electric Capital Services, Inc. ("GECS"). See
note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, which explains how the various
financial data are presented.

         Management's Discussion of Operations is presented in three parts:
Consolidated Operations, Segment Operations and International Operations.

CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS

GE achieved record revenues, earnings and cash generation in 1999, reflecting
continuing benefits of its globalization, product services, Six Sigma quality
and e-Business initiatives.

         Revenues rose 11% to a record $111.6 billion, as global activities and
product services continued to grow. Revenues were $100.5 billion in 1998, an 11%
increase from 1997 attributable primarily to increased global activities and
higher sales of product services.

         Earnings increased to a record $10,717 million, a 15% increase from
$9,296 million reported in 1998. Earnings per share increased to $3.22 during
1999, up 15% from the prior year's $2.80. (Except as otherwise noted, earnings
per share are presented on a diluted basis). Earnings in 1998 rose 13% from
$8,203 million reported in 1997. In 1998, earnings per share increased 14% from
$2.46 in 1997.

TWO CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS may affect future financial statements. The
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING
ACTIVITIES (STATEMENT 133), effective for GE and GECS on January 1, 2001. Upon
adoption, all derivative instruments (including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts) will be recognized in balance sheets at fair value,
and changes in such fair values must be recognized immediately in earnings
unless specific hedging criteria are met. Changes in the values of derivatives
meeting these hedging criteria will ultimately offset related earnings effects
of the hedged items; effects of qualifying changes in fair value are to be
recorded in equity pending recognition in earnings. Certain significant
refinements and interpretations of Statement 133 are being deliberated by the
FASB, and the effects on accounting for GE and GECS financial instruments will
depend to some degree on the results of such deliberations. Management has not
determined the total probable effects on its financial statements of adopting
Statement 133 and does not believe that an estimate of such effects would be
meaningful at this time.

         The FASB has also proposed new accounting for business combinations
that, among other things, would change the accounting for and display of
goodwill and other intangibles recorded in business acquisitions for
transactions after January 1, 2001. An important aspect of the proposal is that
goodwill amortization would be displayed as a separate element in the Statement
of Earnings, net of applicable income taxes, and related per-share effects could
be displayed. Management believes that this proposal represents a useful
approach to understanding financial performance but believes that the utility of
this information would be materially enhanced if the proposed approach for
goodwill were applied to all intangible assets acquired with a business. On this
preferred basis, GE would have reported earnings per share before amortization
of goodwill and acquired intangibles of $3.63 in 1999, an increase of 16% over
$3.14 in 1998, which was 15% higher than $2.73 in 1997.

DIVIDENDS DECLARED IN 1999 AMOUNTED TO $4,786 MILLION. Per-share dividends of
$1.46 were up 17% from 1998, following a 16% increase from the preceding year.
GE has rewarded its share owners with 24 consecutive years of dividend growth.
The chart above illustrates that GE's dividend growth for the past five years
has significantly outpaced dividend growth of companies in the Standard & Poor's
500 stock index.

RETURN ON AVERAGE SHARE OWNERS' EQUITY reached 26.8% in 1999, up from 25.7% and
25.0% in 1998 and 1997, respectively.

         Except as otherwise noted, the analysis in the remainder of this
section presents GE results with GECS on an equity basis.

ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 42

GE TOTAL REVENUES were $60.9 billion in 1999, compared with $56.0 billion in
1998 and $54.5 billion in 1997.

 *     GE sales of goods and services were $55.6 billion in 1999, an increase of
       8% from 1998, which in turn was 5% higher than in 1997. Volume was about
       10% higher in 1999, reflecting growth across all businesses during the
       year, led by strong double-digit increases at Medical Systems and Power
       Systems. While overall selling prices were down slightly in 1999, the
       effects of selling prices on sales in various businesses differed
       markedly. Revenues were also negatively affected by exchange rates for
       sales denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Volume in
       1998 was about 8% higher than in 1997, with selling price and currency
       effects both slightly negative.

                For purposes of the financial statement display of GE sales and
       costs of sales on pages 34 and 35, "goods" is required to include sales
       of tangible products, and "services" must include all other sales,
       including broadcasting and information services activities. An
       increasingly important element of GE sales includes both spare parts
       (goods) as well as repair services--sales referred to by management as
       "product services." Sales of product services were $14.4 billion in 1999,
       a 14% increase over 1998. All businesses reported increases in product
       services revenues, led by double-digit increases at Medical Systems,
       Aircraft Engines and Power Systems. Operating margin from product
       services was approximately $3.2 billion, up 16% from 1998. The increase
       reflected improvements in all product services businesses and was led by
       double-digit growth at Aircraft Engines and Medical Systems.

*      GE other income, earned from a wide variety of sources, was $0.9 billion
       in 1999, $0.7 billion in 1998 and $2.3 billion in 1997. Comparisons over
       the three-year period are affected by certain gains in 1999 and 1997. A
       pre-tax gain of $388 million was recognized in 1999 as a result of the
       contribution of certain of NBC's internet assets to NBC Internet (NBCi),
       a newly formed publicly traded Internet company, in exchange for a
       noncontrolling interest in NBCi. The gain was reduced by $62 million of
       related operating losses from the non-consolidated contributed Internet
       properties, resulting in incremental revenue of $326 million from the
       transaction. In 1997, a $1,538 million after-tax gain was realized from
       the exchange of preferred stock in Lockheed Martin Corporation for the
       stock of a newly formed subsidiary. See note 2 for further information.

*      Earnings of GECS were up 17% in 1999, following a 17% increase the year
       before. See page 46 for an analysis of these earnings.

PRINCIPAL COSTS AND EXPENSES FOR GE are those classified as costs of goods and
services sold, and selling, general and administrative expenses. The Six Sigma
quality initiative is an important factor affecting GE's cost structure. The
benefits of Six Sigma quality are reflected in both variable and base cost
productivity (discussed on page 43) as well as in lower direct material costs.
Another important initiative is e-Business, a broad-based program under which GE
is investing in Internet businesses, as well as internal infrastructure hardware
and software that will enable its businesses to conduct a growing portion of
their business over the Internet. The benefits expected from the e-Business
initiative include improved customer service, expanded product and service
offerings and increased operating efficiency for both GE and its customers.

         Principally because of the funding status of the GE Pension Plan
(described in note 5) and other benefit plans (described in note 6), principal
U.S. postemployment benefit plans contributed cost reductions of $1,062 million
and $703 million in 1999 and 1998, respectively. The present funding status
provides assurance of benefits for participating employees, but future effects
on operating results depend on economic conditions and investment performance.

         The discussion that follows provides additional information about
certain unusual charges that are included in costs and expenses for 1999 and
1997 and are relevant to comparisons of costs over the three-year period.

         Costs and expenses in 1999 included $326 million of unusual charges,
the largest of which resulted from fourth-quarter developments affecting
liabilities associated with past activities at former manufacturing sites that

are not part of any current business segment. Other significant components of
unusual charges included amounts described on page 45 for NBC and costs for
rationalizing certain operations and facilities of GE's worldwide industrial
businesses. Major elements of the restructuring program included costs for
employee severance, lease termination, dismantlement and site restoration.

         In 1997, restructuring charges were recognized amounting to $1,243
million that covered costs of plans to rationalize certain production, service
and administration activities of GE's worldwide industrial businesses. Principal
actions required under those plans were complete by the end of 1999. Other 1997
special charges, which amounted to $1,079 million, were principally associated
with strategic decisions that enhanced the long-term competitiveness of certain
industrial businesses and fourth-quarter 1997 developments affecting liabilities
associated with past activities at former manufacturing sites that were not part
of any current business segment.

OPERATING MARGIN is sales of goods and services less the costs of goods and
services sold, and selling, general and administrative expenses. GE's reported
operating margin was 17.3% in 1999, net of unusual charges discussed above. GE's
ongoing operating margin (before such charges) reached a record 17.8% of sales,
up from last year's 16.7% and 15.7% in 1997, on a comparable basis. GE reported
operating margin of 11.0% of sales in 1997. The improvement in ongoing operating
margin in 1999 was broad-based, with improvements in a majority of GE's
businesses reflecting the increasing benefits from GE's product services and Six
Sigma quality initiatives.

TOTAL COST PRODUCTIVITY (sales in relation to costs, both on a constant dollar
basis) has paralleled the significant improvement in GE's ongoing operating
margin. Total cost productivity in 1999 was 4.2%, reflecting benefits from
improvements in variable cost productivity achieved through the Six Sigma
quality initiative. Most businesses achieved improvements in variable cost
productivity in excess of 4%. Total cost productivity was 4.4% in 1998,
reflecting Six Sigma quality benefits as well as higher volume. In 1998, three
businesses--Medical Systems, Power Systems and NBC--achieved productivity in
excess of 5%. The total contribution of productivity in the last two years
offset not only the negative effects of total cost inflation, but also the
effects of selling price decreases.

GE INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL CHARGES in 1999 amounted to $810 million,
compared with $883 million in 1998 and $797 million in 1997. The decrease in
1999 was attributable to the combination of lower average interest rates on debt
and lower average levels of borrowings during the year. The increase in 1998
reflected higher average levels of borrowings and other financing activities,
which more than offset the effect of lower interest rates.

INCOME TAXES on a consolidated basis were 31.2% of pretax earnings in 1999,
compared with 31.0% in 1998 and 26.6% in 1997. The most significant factor
explaining the lower effective tax rate in 1997 was a 4.8% decrease attributable
to the realized gain on the tax-free exchange of Lockheed Martin Corporation
preferred stock. A more detailed analysis of the differences between the U.S.
federal statutory rate and the consolidated rate, as well as other information
about income tax provisions, is provided in note 7.

SEGMENT OPERATIONS

REVENUES AND SEGMENT PROFIT FOR OPERATING SEGMENTS are shown on page 44. For
additional information, including a description of the products and services
included in each segment, see note 28.

AIRCRAFT ENGINES reported a 3% increase in revenues in 1999, reflecting higher
volume in product services. Operating profit increased 19% in 1999 as a result
of productivity and growth in product services. Revenues, including
acquisitions, increased 32% in 1998 as volume in commercial engines and product
services increased. Operating profit increased 30% in 1998 with strong growth in
product services as well as good volume growth in commercial engines.

         In 1999, $1.6 billion of Aircraft Engines revenues were from sales to
the U.S. government, about the same as in 1998, which was $0.1 billion higher
than in 1997.

The notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 56-76 are an integral
part of this statement. "GE" means the basis of consolidation as described in
note 1 to the consolidated financial statements; "GECS" means General Electric
Capital Services, Inc. and all of its affiliates and associated companies. The
segment profit measure for GE's industrial businesses is operating profit
(earnings before interest and other financial charges, and income taxes). The
segment profit measure for GECS is net earnings, reflecting the importance of
financing and tax considerations to its operating activities.

(a)    Includes revenues of $944 million, $789 million and $796 million in 1997,
       1996 and 1995, respectively, from an appliance distribution affiliate
       that was deconsolidated in 1998. Also includes $1,538 million in 1997
       from an exchange of preferred stock in Lockheed Martin Corporation for
       the stock of a newly formed subsidiary.

(b)    Principally the elimination of GECS net earnings.

(c)    Includes income, principally from licensing activities, previously
       reported in the All Other segment of $62 million, $271 million, $310
       million, $282 million and $285 million in 1999, 1998, 1997, 1996 and
       1995, respectively.

(d)    1999 includes unusual charges amounting to $265 million. Of the total,
       amounts that relate to activities of operating segments were as follows:
       Aircraft Engines -- $42 million, Appliances -- $75 million, Industrial
       Products and Systems -- $12 million, Plastic -- $13 million and Technical
       Products and Services -- $34 million. 1997 includes unusual charges of
       $2,322 million. Of the total, amounts that relate to activities of GE
       operating segments were as follows: Aircraft Engine -- $342 million,
       Appliances--$330 million, Industrial Products and Systems -- $352
       million, NBC -- $161 million, Plastics -- $63 million, Power Systems --
       $437 million and Technical Products and Services -- $157 million. Also
       included in 1997 is $1,538 million associated with the Lockheed Martin
       Corporation transaction described in (a)  above.

ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 45

         Aircraft Engines received orders of $12.0 billion in 1999, compared
with $10.8 billion in 1998. The backlog at year-end 1999 was $10.0 billion ($9.7
billion at the end of 1998). Of the total, $7.6 billion related to products,
about 54% of which was scheduled for delivery in 2000; the remainder related to
2000 product services.

APPLIANCES revenues were 1% higher than a year ago, as volume increases offset
lower selling prices and adverse currency effects. Operating profit decreased
13%, reflecting lower selling prices and increased spending on programs for new
products and e-Business. Revenues in 1998 were 3% lower than in 1997, largely as
a result of selling price decreases and, to a lesser extent, lower volume.
Operating profit decreased 2% in 1998, as the decreases in selling prices and
volume more than offset productivity.

INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS AND SYSTEMS revenues increased 3% in 1999, largely as a
result of volume increases across all businesses in the segment (particularly at
Transportation Systems), which more than offset lower selling prices. Operating
profit increased 11%, as strong productivity at Industrial Systems and Lighting
more than offset the lower selling prices. Revenues rose 2% in 1998, primarily
as a result of volume increases at Transportation Systems and Industrial Systems
that were partially offset by lower selling prices across most businesses in the
segment. Operating profit increased 5% in 1998, reflecting productivity and the
improvement in volume, which more than offset the effects of selling price
decreases.

         Transportation Systems received orders of $1.4 billion in 1999,
compared with $2.4 billion in 1998. The backlog at year-end 1999 was $1.4
billion ($2.3 billion at the end of 1998). Of the total, $1.1 billion related to
products, of which 80% was scheduled for shipment in 2000; the remainder related
to 2000 product services.

NBC revenues increased 10% in 1999, reflecting higher revenues in NBC's
owned-and-operated stations and growth in cable operations. Operating profit was
17% higher in 1999, reflecting a strong advertising marketplace and improved
pricing at the network, excellent results in cable operations and continued cost
reductions across NBC, which more than offset higher license fees for certain
prime-time programs that were renewed. Operating profit in 1999 included $123
million of the gain from the NBCi transaction, described on page 42. That gain
was entirely offset by $62 million of operating losses from NBCi and predecessor
operations (recorded as a reduction of "other income"), as well as $61 million
of unusual costs recorded as "other costs and expenses" for entering into a loss
programming contract and for exiting CNBC's current facilities. In 1998,
revenues increased 2%, reflecting higher revenues in NBC's owned-and-operated
stations, including revenues from station acquisitions and growth in cable
operations, the combination of which more than offset lower network revenues.
Operating profit increased 11% in 1998 as improved results in international,
cable operations and owned-and-operated stations, as well as cost reductions
across NBC, more than offset higher license fees for certain prime-time programs
that were renewed.

PLASTICS revenues increased 5%, primarily as a result of improved volume across
all product lines, which more than offset the effects of lower selling prices.
Operating profit increased by 4% as productivity and the increase in volume more
than offset pricing. Revenues decreased by 1% in 1998, as pricing and adverse
currency exchange rates offset slightly higher volume. Operating profit in 1998
improved by 6%, as lower material costs and productivity more than offset

pricing.

POWER SYSTEMS revenues increased 19%, primarily as a result of strong
double-digit growth in gas turbine volume and in product services. Operating
profit rose 30%, reflecting productivity, growth in product services and the
increase in volume. Revenues in 1998 were 7% higher than in 1997, primarily as a
result of higher volume in product services, including acquisitions, which was
partially offset by lower selling prices. Operating profit increased 9% in 1998,
as growth in product services and productivity more than offset the effects of
lower selling prices.

         Power Systems orders were $14.0 billion for 1999, a 33% increase over
1998, reflecting very strong U.S. market growth. The backlog of unfilled orders
at year-end 1999 was $16.1 billion ($12.4 billion at the end of 1998). Of that
total, $14.8 billion related to products, of which 60% was scheduled for
delivery in 2000; the remainder related to 2000 product services.

TECHNICAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES revenues rose 29% in 1999, following a 10%
increase in 1998. The improvement in revenues in both years was primarily
attributable to growth at Medical Systems, the result of higher equipment
volume, including new products, and continued growth in product services,
partially offset by lower selling prices across the segment. Operating profit
increased 23% in 1999 as productivity and volume increases, particularly at
Medical Systems, more than offset lower selling prices. Operating profit
increased 12% in 1998 as productivity and volume increases more than offset the
effects of lower selling prices.

         Orders received by Medical Systems in 1999 were $6.4 billion, compared
with $4.8 billion in 1998. The backlog of unfilled orders at year-end 1999 was
$3.1 billion ($2.6 billion at the end of 1998). Of the total, $1.9 billion
related to products, of which 83% was scheduled for delivery in 2000; the
remainder related to 2000 product services.

GECS consists of 28 businesses grouped for management purposes into five
operating activities: consumer services, equipment management, mid-market
financing, specialized financing and specialty insurance.

         GECS net earnings were $4,443 million in 1999, up 17% from $3,796
million in 1998, with strong double-digit earnings growth in three of the five
operating activities. Net earnings in 1998 increased 17% from 1997. The earnings
improvement throughout the three-year period resulted from asset growth,
principally from acquisitions of businesses and portfolios, and origination
volume.

 *     GECS total revenues increased 14% to $55.7 billion in 1999, following a
       22% increase to $48.7 billion in 1998. The increases in both years
       reflected the contributions of businesses acquired as well as growth in
       origination volume.

 *     GECS cost of goods sold amounted to $8.0 billion in 1999, compared with
       $6.8 billion in 1998 and $4.1 billion in 1997, and relates to IT
       Solutions and Montgomery Ward LLC (Wards). The increase in 1999 primarily
       reflects the consolidation of Wards as discussed on page 48; the increase
       in 1998 is principally the result of acquisition-related growth at IT
       Solutions.

 *     GECS interest on borrowings in 1999 was $9.4 billion, up from $9.0
       billion in 1998 and $7.6 billion in 1997. In both 1999 and 1998, while
       average borrowings increased in order to finance asset growth, the
       associated higher interest costs were partially mitigated by lower
       average interest rates. The composite interest rate was 5.14% in 1999,
       compared with 5.92% in 1998 and 6.07% in 1997. See page 51 for a
       discussion of interest rate risk management.

*      GECS insurance losses and policyholder and annuity benefits increased to
       $11.0 billion in 1999, compared with $9.6 billion in 1998 and $8.3
       billion in 1997, reflecting effects of business acquisitions and growth
       in premium volume throughout the period. In addition, the increase in
       1999 reflected the higher loss ratio in the reinsurance business
       discussed on page 47.

*      GECS provision for losses on financing receivables increased to $1.7
       billion in 1999, compared with $1.6 billion in 1998 and $1.4 billion in
       1997. These provisions principally related to private-label credit cards,
       bank credit cards, auto loans and auto leases in the consumer services
       operations, all of which are discussed on page 48 under financing
       receivables. The provision throughout the three-year period reflected
       higher average receivable balances, a different mix of business, as well
       as the effects of lower delinquency rates, consistent with industry
       experience.

 *     GECS other costs and expenses were $19.4 billion in 1999, an increase
       from $16.4 billion in 1998 and $13.9 billion in 1997, principally because
       of increased costs associated with acquired businesses and portfolios,
       higher investment levels and increases in insurance commissions.

Financing spreads (the excess of yields over interest rates on borrowings) were
essentially flat throughout the three-year period, reflecting slightly lower
yields offset by slight decreases in borrowing rates.

         Revenues and net earnings from operating activities within the GECS
segment for the past three years are summarized and discussed below.

         CONSUMER SERVICES revenues increased 7% in 1999 and 18% in 1998, and
net earnings increased 35% in 1999 and 47% in 1998. The growth in revenues and
net earnings was led by Global Consumer Finance, with strong returns on
investments in Japan and other international growth. Additionally, revenues and
net earnings were increased by higher premium and investment income

PAGE F-15
ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 47

at GE Financial Assurance, the consumer savings and insurance business,
partially offset by the effects of asset reductions in Card Services and Auto
Financial Services. A higher provision for losses on financing receivables
because of higher average receivables balances also affected earnings in 1998.

         EQUIPMENT MANAGEMENT revenues grew 3% in 1999, following a 31% increase
in 1998. Growth in 1999 revenues was primarily the result of Japanese
acquisitions in the corporate auto fleet management operation, as well as higher
revenue from commercial aircraft management at GE Capital Aviation Services
(GECAS), largely offset by decreases in sales volume at the remaining equipment
management businesses. The 1998 increase reflected acquisitions by IT Solutions
and, to a lesser extent, asset growth. Net earnings decreased 14% in 1999,
following a 14% increase in 1998. In 1999, as market conditions became more
competitive, pricing at IT Solutions and utilization at the European equipment
management businesses declined, more than offsetting growth in GECAS and the
satellite service business, Americom. Net earnings increased in 1998, reflecting
higher volume in most businesses from both increased origination as well as
acquisitions of businesses and portfolios. These factors were partially offset
in 1998 by lower pricing and higher operating costs at IT Solutions and Modular
Space.

         MID-MARKET FINANCING revenues increased 25% in both 1999 and 1998,
while net earnings grew 26% and 22%, respectively. Asset growth from both
acquisitions and originations was the most significant contributing factor in
both years. Revenues and net earnings were also favorably affected in 1998 by
the disposition of certain assets.

         SPECIALIZED FINANCING revenues rose 37% and 19%, while net earnings
increased 67% and 26% in 1999 and 1998, respectively. Revenues principally
reflect increases in asset gains as well as origination growth, with GE Equity,
Commercial Finance and Real Estate accounting for most of the 1999 increase.
Revenue and net earnings growth in both years is principally the result of gains
on equity investments. Net earnings in 1998 also included the effects of certain
tax-advantaged transactions and higher tax credits.

         SPECIALTY INSURANCE revenues increased 17% and 20% in 1999 and 1998,
respectively, as premiums and investment income grew throughout the period.
Premiums earned increased in line with higher origination volume and
acquisitions. Investment income also grew, partially reflecting an increase in
net realized investment gains in GE Global Insurance, which amounted to $699
million, $432 million and $308 million in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

         Increases in property and casualty-related losses in GE Global
Insurance were directly related to the frequency and severity of large loss
events during the last three years. Large loss events are individual events
that, after specific reinsurance recoveries and related premium adjustments,
affect GE Global Insurance operations by $2 million or more, and include losses
from earthquakes, aviation or railroad accidents, fire damage, and
weather-related damage from hurricanes, tornadoes, wind and ice.

Large loss events for GE Global Insurance amounted to approximately $720
million, $230 million and $70 million in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. 1999
losses were partially recovered under aggregate risk coverage obtained in the
ordinary course of the reinsurance business. Overall losses for Specialty
Insurance were mitigated by favorable experience in the Mortgage Insurance
business, particularly in 1999.

         ALL OTHER GECS operating activities include the results of Wards
subsequent to August 2, 1999, when GECS acquired control of the formerly
bankrupt retailer. Wards had sales of $1,622 million and a net loss of $26
million for the period during which it was consolidated. Revenues and net
earnings in 1997 included asset gains, the largest of which was $284 million
(net of tax) from a transaction that included the reduction of the GECS
investment in the common stock of Paine Webber Group Inc.

         FINANCING RECEIVABLES is the largest category of assets for GECS and
represents one of its primary sources of revenues. The portfolio of financing
receivables, before allowance for losses, increased to $141.4 billion at the end
of 1999 from $124.9 billion at the end of 1998, principally reflecting higher
origination volume and acquisition growth partially offset by securitizations
and other sales of receivables. The related allowance for losses at the end of
1999 amounted to $3.8 billion ($3.3 billion at the end of 1998), representing
management's best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio.

         In GECS financing receivables, "nonearning" receivables are those that
are 90 days or more delinquent (or for which collection has otherwise become
doubtful) and "reduced-earning" receivables are commercial receivables whose
terms have been restructured to a below-market yield.

         Consumer financing receivables, primarily credit card and personal
loans and auto loans and leases, were $52.3 billion at year-end 1999, an
increase of $0.7 billion from year-end 1998. The credit card and personal
receivables increased $5.2 billion, primarily from acquisition growth and
origination volume, partially offset by sales and securitizations. Auto
receivables decreased $4.5 billion primarily as a result of reduced volume.
Nonearning receivables at year-end 1999 were $0.9 billion, about 1.8% of total
consumer financing receivables, compared with $1.3 billion, about 2.4% of total
consumer receivables at year-end 1998. Write-offs of consumer receivables
declined to $1.2 billion from $1.4 billion at year-end 1998, reflecting improved
delinquency trends.

         Other financing receivables, totaling $89.1 billion at December 31,
1999, consisted of a diverse commercial, industrial and equipment loan and lease
portfolio. This portfolio increased $15.8 billion during 1999, reflecting the
combination of acquisition growth and increased originations. Related nonearning
and reduced-earning receivables were $0.9 billion at year-end 1999, compared
with $0.4 billion at year-end 1998.

         GECS loans and leases to commercial airlines amounted to $11.8 billion
at the end of 1999, up from $10.2 billion at the end of 1998. GECS commercial
aircraft positions also included financial guarantees, funding commitments and
aircraft orders as discussed in note 17.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

Estimated results of international activities include the results of GE and GECS
operations located outside the United States, plus all U.S. exports. Certain
GECS operations that cannot meaningfully be associated with specific geographic
areas are classified as "other international" for this purpose.

         International revenues in 1999 were $45.7 billion (41% of consolidated
revenues), compared with $42.5 billion in 1998 and $38.2 billion in 1997. The
chart above left depicts the growth in international revenues over the past five
years.

         GE international revenues were $24.0 billion in 1999, compared with
$24.3 billion in 1998, which was $0.2 billion higher than in 1997. Over the
three-year period, international revenues were slightly less than half of total
revenues. The decrease in such revenues during 1999 was attributable to lower
U.S. exports which offset sales growth in operations based outside the United
States. Exports decreased 14%, largely as a result of lower exports in Power
Systems. Revenues from operations based outside the United States grew 6% to
$16.5 billion in 1999. European revenues were 3% higher in 1999, led by good
increases at Medical Systems and Aircraft Engines. Pacific Basin revenues were
11% higher in 1999, reflecting double-digit growth at Medical Systems and
Plastics. Revenues from the Americas (North and South America, except for the
United States) increased 5%, principally as a result of growth in Canadian
operations.

         GECS international revenues were $21.7 billion in 1999, an increase of
19% from $18.2 billion in 1998. Revenues in the Pacific Basin more than doubled
in 1999. Much of the increase was attributable to growth in Japan, the result of
several strategic acquisitions, the largest of which were the purchase of assets
and infrastructure of Japan Leasing and the acquisition of Lake. Revenues in
Europe increased 7% in 1999, reflecting a mix of acquisition and core growth
across all GECS operating activities. Overall, these increases reflect the
continued expansion of GECS as a global provider of a wide range of financial
services.

         Consolidated international operating profit was $5.4 billion in 1999,
an increase of 5% over 1998, which was 8% higher than in 1997. Additional
information is provided in note 29.

         Total assets of international operations were $141.3 billion in 1999
(35% of consolidated assets), an increase of 10% over 1998. The increase in 1999
reflected strong growth at GECS in the Pacific Basin, where current economic
conditions continue to provide a favorable environment for strategic
investments. GECS had a particularly large increase in Japan, reflecting a mix
of acquisitions, discussed previously, and strong core asset growth. GECS also
had significant asset growth at GECAS, its aviation services business, which is
classified as "other international."

         The activities of GE and GECS span all global regions and primarily
encompass manufacturing for local and export markets, import and sale of
products produced in other regions, leasing of aircraft, sourcing for GE plants
domiciled in other global regions and provision of financial services within
these regional economies. Thus, when countries or regions experience currency
and/or economic stress, GE may have increased exposure to certain risks but also
may have new profit opportunities. Potential increased risks include, among
other things, higher receivables delinquencies and bad debts, delays or
cancellation of sales and orders principally related to power and aircraft
equipment, higher local currency financing costs and a slowdown in established
financial services activities. New profit opportunities include, among other
things, lower costs of goods sourced from countries with weakened currencies,
more opportunities for lower cost outsourcing, expansion of industrial and
financial services activities through purchases of companies or assets at
reduced prices and lower U.S. debt financing costs.

         Financial results of GE's international activities reported in U.S.
dollars are affected by currency exchange. A number of techniques are used to
manage the effects of currency exchange, including selective borrowings in local
currencies and selective hedging of significant cross-currency transactions.
Principal currencies are the major European currencies, including the euro, as
well as the Japanese yen and the Canadian dollar.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

OVERVIEW

This discussion of financial resources and liquidity addresses the Statement of
Financial Position (page 36), Statement of Changes in Share Owners' Equity (page
34) and the Statement of Cash Flows (page 38).

         GECS is not a "captive finance company" or a vehicle for
"off-balance-sheet financing" for GE. Only a small portion of GECS business is
directly related to other GE operations. The fundamental differences between GE
and GECS are reflected in the measurements commonly used by investors, rating
agencies and financial analysts. These differences will become clearer in the
discussion that follows with respect to the more significant items in the
financial statements.

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION

Because GE and GECS share certain significant elements of their Statements of
Financial Position -- property, plant and equipment, and borrowings, for example
- -- the following discussion addresses significant captions in the "consolidated"
statement. Within the following discussions, however, distinction is drawn
between GE and GECS activities in order to permit meaningful analysis of each
individual statement.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES for each of the past two years comprised mainly
investment-grade debt securities held by GE Financial Assurance and the
specialty insurance businesses of GECS in support of obligations to annuitants
and policyholders. GE investment securities were $1.3 billion at year-end 1999,
an increase of $1.0 billion from 1998, reflecting increases in the fair value of
debt and equity investments as well as additional investments. The increase of
$2.0 billion at GECS during 1999 was principally related to investment of
premiums received and acquisitions, partially offset by decreases in the fair
value of debt securities associated with rising interest rates. See analysis of
the Statement of Changes in Share Owners' Equity on page 52 for further
information. A breakdown of the investment securities portfolio is provided in
note 9.

CURRENT RECEIVABLES for GE were $8.7 billion at the end of 1999, an increase of
$0.2 billion from year-end 1998, and included $5.8 billion due from customers at
the end of 1999, which was $0.4 billion higher than the amount due at the end of
1998. As a measure of asset management, turnover of customer receivables from
sales of goods and services was 9.4 in 1999, compared with 8.8 in 1998. Other
current receivables are primarily amounts that did not originate from sales of
GE goods or services, such as advances to suppliers in connection with large
contracts.

INVENTORIES for GE were $5.8 billion at December 31, 1999, up $0.5 billion from
the end of 1998. GE inventory turnover was 8.3 in 1999, about the same as in
1998. Acquisitions of inventories in business combinations more than offset the
positive effects of inventory management programs throughout the period.
Last-in, first-out (LIFO) revaluations decreased $84 million in 1999, compared
with decreases of $87 million in 1998 and $119 million in 1997. Included in
these changes were decreases of $4 million, $29 million and $59 million in 1999,
1998 and 1997, respectively, that resulted from lower LIFO inventory levels.
There were net cost decreases in each of the last three years.

         Inventories (at FIFO) and customer receivables from sales of goods or
services are two key components of GE's working capital turnover measurement.
Working capital turnover was 11.5 in 1999, compared with 9.2 in 1998. Working
capital also includes trade accounts payable and progress collections.

         GECS inventories were $1,209 million and $744 million at December 31,
1999 and 1998, respectively. The increase in 1999 primarily reflects the
consolidation of the retail operations of Wards.

FINANCING RECEIVABLES of GECS were $137.6 billion at year-end 1999, net of
allowance for doubtful accounts, up $16.1 billion over 1998. These receivables
are discussed on page 48 and in notes 12 and 13.

OTHER RECEIVABLES of GECS were $30.7 billion and $26.0 billion at December 31,
1999 and 1998, respectively. Of the 1999 increase, $3.6 billion was attributable
to acquisitions.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (including equipment leased to others) was $41.0
billion at December 31, 1999, up $5.3 billion from 1998. GE property, plant and
equipment consists of investments for its own productive use, whereas the
largest element for GECS is in equipment provided to third parties on operating
leases. Details by category of investment are presented in note 15.

         GE total expenditures for new plant and equipment during 1999 totaled
$2.0 billion, about the same as in 1998. Total expenditures for the past five
years were $10.6 billion, of which 39% was investment for growth through new
capacity and product development; 32% was investment in productivity through new
equipment and process improvements; and 29% was investment for such other
purposes as improvement of research and development facilities and safety and
environmental protection.

PAGE F-19
ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 51

         GECS additions to equipment leased to others, including business
acquisitions, were $13.4 billion during 1999 ($7.2 billion during 1998),
primarily reflecting acquisitions of transportation equipment.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS were $26.0 billion at year-end 1999, up from $23.6 billion at
year-end 1998. GE intangibles increased to $11.3 billion from $10.0 billion at
the end of 1998, principally as a result of goodwill related to acquisitions,
the largest of which was Marquette Medical Systems. The $1.1 billion increase in
GECS intangibles related to goodwill and other intangibles associated with
acquired companies, the largest of which were Signature Group and the Australian
consumer financial services business of AVCO.

ALL OTHER ASSETS totaled $65.0 billion at year-end 1999, an increase of $12.1
billion from the end of 1998. GE other assets increased $2.8 billion,
principally reflecting an increase in the prepaid pension asset and higher costs
associated with increased volume of long-term service agreements, as well as
additional investments in associated companies. The increase in GECS other
assets of $9.2 billion was principally attributable to increases in "separate
accounts" (see note 17) and additional investments in associated companies,
partially offset by decreases in assets acquired for resale, which reflected
sales and securitizations in excess of originations.

CONSOLIDATED BORROWINGS aggregated $201.8 billion at December 31, 1999, compared
with $175.0 billion at the end of 1998. The major debt-rating agencies evaluate
the financial condition of GE and of GE Capital (the major public borrowing
entity of GECS) differently because of their distinct business characteristics.
Using criteria appropriate to each and considering their combined strength,
those major rating agencies continue to give the highest ratings to debt of both
GE and GE Capital.

         GE has committed to contribute capital to GE Capital in the event of
either a decrease below a specified level in GE Capital's ratio of earnings to
fixed charges, or a failure to maintain a specified debt-to-equity ratio in the
event certain GE Capital preferred stock is redeemed. GE also has guaranteed
subordinated debt of GECS with a face amount of $1.0 billion at December 31,
1999 and 1998. Management believes the likelihood that GE will be required to
contribute capital under either the commitments or the guarantees is remote.

         GE total borrowings were $3.0 billion at year-end 1999 ($2.3 billion
short-term, $0.7 billion long-term), a decrease of $1.2 billion from year-end
1998. GE total debt at the end of 1999 equaled 6.4% of total capital, down from
9.5% at the end of 1998.

         GECS total borrowings were $200.0 billion at December 31, 1999, of
which $129.2 billion is due in 2000 and $70.8 billion is due in subsequent
years. Comparable amounts at the end of 1998 were $172.2 billion in total,
$113.2 billion due within one year and $59.0 billion due thereafter. A large
portion of GECS borrowings ($96.6 billion and $87.0 billion at the end of 1999
and 1998, respectively) was issued in active commercial paper markets that
management believes will continue to be a reliable source of short-term
financing. Most of this commercial paper was issued by GE Capital. The average
remaining terms and interest rates of GE Capital commercial paper were 53 days
and 5.82% at the end of 1999, compared with 45 days and 5.35% at the end of
1998.

          The GE Capital ratio of debt to equity was 8.44 to 1 at the end of
1999 and 7.86 to 1 at the end of 1998.

         INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT is important in the normal
operations of both GE and GECS. The following discussion presents an overview of
such management.

         GE and GECS use various financial instruments, particularly interest
rate and currency swaps, but also futures, options and currency forwards,
principally to manage their respective interest rate and currency risks. GE and
GECS are exclusively end users of these instruments, which are commonly referred
to as derivatives; neither GE nor GECS engages in trading, market-making or
other speculative activities in the derivatives markets. Management requires

PAGE F-20
ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 52

that derivative financial instruments relate to specific asset, liability or
equity transactions or to currency exposures. More detailed information about
these financial instruments, as well as the strategies and policies for their
use, is provided in notes 1, 19 and 30.

         The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requires that registrants
provide information about potential effects of changes in interest rates and
currency exchange. Although the rules offer alternatives for presenting this
information, none of the alternatives is without limitations. The following
discussion is based on so-called "shock tests," which model effects of interest
rate and currency shifts on the reporting company. Shock tests, while probably
the most meaningful analysis permitted, are constrained by several factors,
including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time
and by their inability to include the complex market reactions that normally
would arise from the market shifts modeled. While the following results of shock
tests for interest rates and currencies may have some limited use as benchmarks,
they should not be viewed as forecasts.

 *     One means of assessing exposure to interest rate changes is a
       duration-based analysis that measures the potential loss in net earnings
       resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis
       points across all maturities (sometimes referred to as a "parallel shift
       in the yield curve"). Under this model, it is estimated that, all else
       constant, such an increase, including repricing effects in the securities
       portfolio, would reduce the 2000 net earnings of GECS based on year-end
       1999 positions by approximately $105 million; the pro forma effect for GE
       was approximately $13 million. Based on positions at year-end 1998, the
       pro forma effect on 1999 net earnings of such an increase in interest
       rates was estimated to be approximately $111 million for GECS and $17
       million for GE.

*      As shown in the chart to the right, the geographic distribution of GE and
       GECS operations is diverse. One means of assessing exposure to changes in
       currency exchange rates is to model effects on reported earnings using a
       sensitivity analysis. Year-end 1999 consolidated currency exposures,
       including financial instruments designated and effective as hedges, were
       analyzed to identify GE and GECS assets and liabilities denominated in
       other than their relevant functional currency. Net unhedged exposures in
       each currency were then remeasured assuming a 10% decrease (substantially
       greater decreases for hyperinflationary currencies) in currency exchange
       rates compared with the U.S. dollar. Under this model, it is estimated
       that, all else constant, such a decrease would have an insignificant
       effect on the 2000 net earnings of GE and GECS based on year-end 1999
       positions. Based on conditions at year-end 1998, the effect on 1999 net
       earnings of such a decrease in exchange rates was estimated to be a
       reduction in net earnings of $11 million for GE and insignificant for
       GECS.

INSURANCE LIABILITIES, RESERVES AND ANNUITY BENEFITS were $86.8 billion, $9.5
billion higher than in 1998. The increase was primarily attributable to
increases in separate accounts, the addition of liabilities from acquired
companies and growth in guaranteed investment contracts. For additional
information on these liabilities, see note 20.

STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN SHARE OWNERS' EQUITY

Share owners' equity increased $3,677 million to $42,557 million at year-end
1999. The increase was largely attributable to net earnings during the period of
$10,717 million, partially offset by dividends of $4,786 million.

         Investment securities had unrealized losses of $1,776 million during
1999, principally as a result of decreases in fair value attributable to
increases in interest rates during 1999. A significant majority of the
unrealized losses are associated with debt securities held by insurance
businesses of GECS and are matched with insurance liabilities of similar

PAGE F-21
ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 53

duration. Accordingly, decreases in fair values of such investment securities
are directionally offset by corresponding decreases in fair values of associated
insurance liabilities. However, changes in the fair values of insurance
liabilities are difficult to measure and are appropriately not recognized under
generally accepted accounting principles.

         Currency translation adjustments reduced equity by $632 million in
1999. Changes in the currency translation adjustment reflect the effects of
changes in currency exchange rates on GE's net investment in non-U.S.
subsidiaries that have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The
decrease during 1999 largely reflected weakening in the European currencies,
partially offset by strengthening in Asian currencies. Such adjustments affect
earnings only when all or a portion of an affiliate is disposed of.

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS

Because cash management activities of GE and GECS are separate and distinct, it
is more useful to review their cash flows separately.

GE CASH AND EQUIVALENTS aggregated $2.0 billion at the end of 1999, up from $1.2
billion at year-end 1998. During 1999, GE generated a record $11.8 billion in
cash from operating activities, a 17% increase over 1998. The increase reflected
improvements in earnings and working capital, principally cash from progress
collections. The 1999 cash generation provided the necessary resources to
repurchase $1.9 billion of GE common stock under the share repurchase program,
to pay $4.6 billion in dividends to share owners, to invest $2.0 billion in new
plant and equipment and to make $1.6 billion in acquisitions.

         Operating activities are the principal source of GE's cash flows. Over
the past three years, operating activities have provided more than $31 billion
of cash. The principal application of this cash was distributions of
approximately $21 billion to share owners, both through payment of dividends
($11.9 billion) and through the share repurchase program ($9.0 billion)
described below. Other applications included investment in new plant and
equipment ($6.3 billion) and acquisitions ($4.5 billion).

         Under the share repurchase program initiated in December 1994, GE has
purchased more than $15 billion of GE stock -- over 300 million shares. In
December 1999, GE's Board of Directors increased the amount authorized from $17
billion to $22 billion. Funds used for the share repurchase are expected to be
generated largely from operating cash flow.

         Based on past performance and current expectations, in combination with
the financial flexibility that comes with a strong balance sheet and the highest
credit ratings, management believes that GE is in a sound position to complete
the share repurchase program, to grow dividends in line with earnings, and to
continue making selective investments for long-term growth. Expenditures for new
plant and equipment are expected to be about $2.5 billion in 2000, principally
for productivity and growth.

GECS CASH AND EQUIVALENTS aggregated $6.9 billion at the end of 1999, up from
$3.3 billion at year-end 1998 as management held short-term investments as
additional liquidity over year-end 1999. One of the primary sources of cash for
GECS is financing activities involving the continued rollover of short-term
borrowings and appropriate addition of borrowings with a reasonable balance of
maturities. Over the past three years, GECS borrowings with maturities of 90
days or less have increased by $37.2 billion. New borrowings of $109.9 billion
having maturities longer than 90 days were added during those years, while $80.7
billion of such longer-term borrowings were retired. GECS also generated $32.0
billion from operating activities.

         The principal use of cash by GECS has been investing in assets to grow
its businesses. Of the $91.0 billion that GECS invested over the past three
years, $21.3 billion was used for additions to financing receivables; $26.6
billion was used to invest in new equipment, principally for lease to others;
and $31.0 billion was used for acquisitions of new businesses, the largest of
which were Japan Leasing and the credit card operations of JC Penney, both in
1999.

         With the financial flexibility that comes with excellent credit
ratings, management believes that GECS should be well positioned to meet the
global needs of its customers for capital and to continue providing GE share
owners with good returns.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION OF SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA summarized on the following page are divided into three
sections: upper portion -- consolidated data; middle portion -- GE data that
reflect various conventional measurements for such enterprises; and lower
portion -- GECS data that reflect key information pertinent to financial
services businesses.

GE'S TOTAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT expenditures were $2,017 million in 1999, up
5% over 1998 and 1997. In 1999, expenditures from GE's own funds were $1,667
million, an increase of 8% over 1998, reflecting continuing research and
development work related to new product, service and process technologies.
Product technology efforts in 1999 included continuing development work on the
next generation of gas turbines, further advances in state-of-the-art diagnostic
imaging technologies, and development of more fuel-efficient, cost-effective
aircraft engine designs. Services technologies include advances in diagnostic
applications, including remote diagnostic capabilities related to repair and
maintenance of medical equipment, aircraft engines, power generation equipment
and locomotives. Process technologies provided improved product quality and
performance and increased capacity for manufacturing engineered materials.
Expenditures funded by customers (mainly the U.S. government) were $350 million
in 1999, down $43 million from 1998.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

GE'S TOTAL BACKLOG of firm unfilled orders at the end of 1999 was $32.4 billion,
an increase of 14% over 1998, reflecting strong double-digit growth at Power
Systems and Medical Systems. Of the total, $27.0 billion related to products, of
which 63% was scheduled for delivery in 2000. Services orders are included in
this reported backlog for only the succeeding 12 months and were $5.4 billion at
the end of 1999. Orders constituting this backlog may be canceled or deferred by
customers, subject in certain cases to cancellation penalties. See Segment
Operations beginning on page 43 for further information.

REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, GE's operations, like operations of other
companies engaged in similar businesses, involve the use, disposal and cleanup
of substances regulated under environmental protection laws.

         In 1999, GE expended about $66 million for capital projects related to
the environment. The comparable amount in 1998 was $81 million. These amounts
exclude expenditures for remediation actions, which are principally expensed and
are discussed below. Capital expenditures for environmental purposes have
included pollution control devices -- such as wastewater treatment plants,
groundwater monitoring devices, air strippers or separators, and
incinerators -- at new and existing facilities constructed or upgraded in the
normal course of business. Consistent with policies stressing environmental
responsibility, average annual capital expenditures other than for remediation
projects are presently expected to be about $65 million over the next two years.
This level is in line with existing levels for new or expanded programs to build
facilities or modify manufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce
emissions.

         GE also is involved in a sizable number of remediation actions to clean
up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws. Such statutes require
that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault, legality
of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. Expenditures for site
remediation actions amounted to approximately $114 million in 1999, compared
with $127 million in 1998. It is presently expected that such remediation
actions will require average annual expenditures in the range of $90 million to
$150 million over the next two years.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

CONSOLIDATION. The consolidated financial statements represent the adding
together of all affiliates -- companies that General Electric directly or
indirectly controls. Results of associated companies -- generally companies that
are 20% to 50% owned and over which GE, directly or indirectly, has significant
influence -- are included in the financial statements on a "one-line" basis.

FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. Financial data and related measurements are
presented in the following categories.

*    GE. This represents the adding together of all affiliates other than
     General Electric Capital Services, Inc. (GECS), whose operations are
     presented on a one-line basis.

*    GECS. This affiliate owns all of the common stock of General Electric
     Capital Corporation (GE Capital) and GE Global Insurance Holding
     Corporation (GE Global Insurance), the parent of Employers Reinsurance
     Corporation. GE Capital, GE Global Insurance and their respective
     affiliates are consolidated in the GECS columns and constitute its
     business.

*    CONSOLIDATED. This represents the adding together of GE and GECS.

The effects of transactions among related companies within and between each of
the above-mentioned groups are eliminated. Transactions between GE and GECS are
not material.

         Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
1999 presentation.

         The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

SALES OF GOODS AND SERVICES. A sale is recorded when title passes to the
customer or when services are performed in accordance with contracts.

GECS REVENUES FROM SERVICES (EARNED INCOME). Income on all loans is recognized
on the interest method. Accrual of interest income is suspended at the earlier
of the time at which collection of an account becomes doubtful or the account
becomes 90 days delinquent. Interest income on impaired loans is recognized
either as cash is collected or on a cost-recovery basis as conditions warrant.

         Financing lease income is recorded on the interest method so as to
produce a level yield on funds not yet recovered. Estimated unguaranteed
residual values of leased assets are based primarily on periodic independent
appraisals of the values of leased assets remaining at expiration of the lease
terms.

         Operating lease income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
terms of underlying leases.

         Origination, commitment and other nonrefundable fees related to
fundings are deferred and recorded in earned income on the interest method.
Commitment fees related to loans not expected to be funded and line-of-credit
fees are deferred and recorded in earned income on a straight-line basis over
the period to which the fees relate. Syndication fees are recorded in earned
income at the time related services are performed unless significant
contingencies exist.

         Income from investment and insurance activities is discussed on
page 57.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. The cost of most of GE's manufacturing plant and
equipment is depreciated using an accelerated method based primarily on a
sum-of-the-years digits formula.

         The cost of GECS equipment leased to others on operating leases is
amortized, principally on a straight-line basis, to estimated residual value
over the lease term or over the estimated economic life of the equipment.
Depreciation of property and equipment used by GECS is recorded on either a
sum-of-the-years digits formula or a straight-line basis over the lives of the
assets.

RECOGNITION OF LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND INVESTMENTS. The allowance
for losses on small-balance receivables reflects management's best estimate of
probable losses inherent in the portfolio determined principally on the basis of
historical experience. For other receivables, principally the larger loans and
leases, the allowance for losses is determined primarily on the basis of
management's best estimate of probable losses, including specific allowances for
known troubled accounts.

         All accounts or portions thereof deemed to be uncollectible or to
require an excessive collection cost are written off to the allowance for
losses. Small-balance accounts generally are written off when 6 to 12 months
delinquent, although any such balance judged to be uncollectible, such as an
account in bankruptcy, is written down immediately to estimated realizable
value. Large-balance accounts are reviewed at least quarterly, and those
accounts with amounts that are judged to be uncollectible are written down to
estimated realizable value.

         When collateral is repossessed in satisfaction of a loan, the
receivable is written down against the allowance for losses to estimated fair
value of the asset less costs to sell, transferred to other assets and
subsequently carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less costs to
sell. This accounting method has been employed principally for specialized
financing transactions.

PAGE F-25
ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 57

CASH AND EQUIVALENTS. Debt securities with original maturities of three months
or less are included in cash equivalents unless designated as available for sale
and classified as investment securities.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES. Investments in debt and marketable equity securities are
reported at fair value based primarily on quoted market prices or, if quoted
prices are not available, discounted expected cash flows using market rates
commensurate with credit quality and maturity of the investment. Substantially
all investment securities are designated as available for sale, with unrealized
gains and losses included in share owners' equity, net of applicable taxes and
other adjustments. Unrealized losses that are other than temporary are
recognized in earnings. Realized gains and losses are accounted for on the
specific identification method.

INVENTORIES. All inventories are stated at the lower of cost or realizable
values. Cost for virtually all of GE's U.S. inventories is determined on a
last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. Cost of other GE inventories is primarily
determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.

         GECS inventories consist primarily of finished products held for sale.
Cost is primarily determined on a FIFO basis.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS. Goodwill is amortized over its estimated period of benefit on
a straight-line basis; other intangible assets are amortized on appropriate
bases over their estimated lives. No amortization period exceeds 40 years. When
an intangible asset exceeds associated expected operating cash flows, it is
considered to be impaired and is written down to fair value, which is determined
based on either discounted future cash flows or appraised values.

INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT. As a matter of policy, neither GE
nor GECS engages in derivatives trading, derivatives market-making or other
speculative activities.

         GE and GECS use swaps primarily to optimize funding costs. To a lesser
degree, and in combination with options and limit contracts, GECS uses swaps to
stabilize cash flows from mortgage-related assets.

         Designated interest rate and currency swaps that modify borrowings or
certain assets, including swaps associated with forecasted commercial paper
renewals, are accounted for on an accrual basis. Both GE and GECS require all
other swaps, as well as futures, options and currency forwards, to be designated
and accounted for as hedges of specific assets, liabilities or committed
transactions; resulting payments and receipts are recognized contemporaneously
with effects of hedged transactions. A payment or receipt arising from early
termination of an effective hedge is accounted for as an adjustment to the basis
of the hedged transaction.

         Instruments used as hedges must be effective at reducing the risk
associated with the exposure being hedged and must be designated as a hedge at
the inception of the contract. Accordingly, changes in market values of hedge
instruments must be highly correlated with changes in market values of
underlying hedged items, both at inception of the hedge and over the life of the
hedge contract.

         As a matter of policy, any derivative that is either not designated as
a hedge, or is so designated but is ineffective, is marked to market and
recognized in operations immediately.

GECS INSURANCE ACCOUNTING POLICIES. Accounting policies for GECS insurance
businesses follow.

PREMIUM INCOME. Insurance premiums are reported as earned income as follows:

*    For short-duration insurance contracts (including property and casualty,
     accident and health, and financial guaranty insurance), premiums are
     reported as earned income, generally on a pro rata basis, over the terms of
     the related agreements. For retrospectively rated reinsurance contracts,
     premium adjustments are recorded based on estimated losses and loss
     expenses, taking into consideration both case and incurred-but-not-reported
     reserves.

*    For traditional long-duration insurance contracts (including term and whole
     life contracts and annuities payable for the life of the annuitant),
     premiums are reported as earned income when due.

*    For investment contracts and universal life contracts, premiums received
     are reported as liabilities, not as revenues. Universal life contracts are
     long-duration insurance contracts with terms that are not fixed and
     guaranteed; for these contracts, revenues are recognized for assessments
     against the policyholder's account, mostly for mortality, contract
     initiation, administration and surrender. Investment contracts are
     contracts that have neither significant mortality nor significant morbidity
     risk, including annuities payable for a determined period; for these
     contracts, revenues are recognized on the associated investments and
     amounts credited to policyholder accounts are charged to expense.

DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS. Costs that vary with and are primarily
related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance and investment contracts
are deferred and amortized over the respective policy terms. For short-duration
insurance contracts, acquisition costs consist primarily of commissions,
brokerage expenses and premium taxes.

PAGE F-26
ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 58

For long-duration insurance contracts, these costs consist primarily of
first-year commissions in excess of recurring renewal commissions, certain
variable sales expenses and certain support costs such as underwriting and
policy issue expenses.

*    For short-duration insurance contracts, these costs are amortized pro rata
     over the contract periods in which the related premiums are earned.

*    For traditional long-duration insurance contracts, these costs are
     amortized over the respective contract periods in proportion to either
     anticipated premium income or, in the case of limited-payment contracts,
     estimated benefit payments.

*    For investment contracts and universal life contracts, these costs are
     amortized on the basis of anticipated gross profits.

Periodically, deferred policy acquisition costs are reviewed for recoverability;
anticipated investment income is considered in recoverability evaluations.

PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE PROFITS. The actuarially determined present value of
anticipated net cash flows to be realized from insurance, annuity and investment
contracts in force at the date of acquisition of life insurance enterprises is
recorded as the present value of future profits and is amortized over the
respective policy terms in a manner similar to deferred policy acquisition
costs. Unamortized balances are adjusted to reflect experience and impairment,
if any.

         Effective January 1, 1999, GE transferred certain licenses and
intellectual property pursuant to an agreement to sell the former RCA Consumer
Electronics business. Licensing income from these assets is shown under the
caption "RCA Licensing" in the table above.

         Other income in 1999 includes $326 million from NBC Internet (NBCi), an
amount that appears in two categories in the above table. "Other items" includes
a gain of $388 million related to the contribution of certain of NBC's Internet
assets to NBCi, a newly formed publicly traded Internet company, in exchange for
a noncontrolling interest in NBCi. Assets contributed by NBC include its 100%
interest in three Internet properties: NBC.com, NBC-IN.com and VideoSeeker.com
and a 10% interest in a fourth Internet property, CNBC.com. Also included in the
"associated companies" caption for 1999 is $62 million of operating losses
related to NBCi and predecessor operations.

         Included in the "Other items" caption for 1997 is a gain of $1,538
million related to a tax-free exchange between GE and Lockheed Martin
Corporation (Lockheed Martin). In exchange for its investment in Lockheed Martin
Series A preferred stock, GE acquired a Lockheed Martin subsidiary containing
two businesses, an equity interest and cash to the extent necessary to equalize
the value of the exchange, a portion of which was subsequently loaned to
Lockheed Martin.

5 PENSION BENEFITS

GE and its affiliates sponsor a number of pension plans. Principal pension plans
are discussed below; other pension plans are not significant individually or in
the aggregate.

PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS are the GE Pension Plan and the GE Supplementary Pension
Plan.

         The GE Pension Plan provides benefits to certain U.S. employees based
on the greater of a formula recognizing career earnings or a formula recognizing
length of service and final average earnings. Benefit provisions are subject to
collective bargaining. At the end of 1999, the GE Pension Plan covered
approximately 470,000 participants, including 124,000 employees, 153,000 former
employees with vested rights to future benefits, and 193,000 retirees and
beneficiaries receiving benefits.

         The GE Supplementary Pension Plan is a pay-as-you-go plan providing
supplementary retirement benefits primarily to higher-level, longer-service U.S.
employees.

         The effect on operations of principal pension plans is as follows:

FUNDING POLICY for the GE Pension Plan is to contribute amounts sufficient to
meet minimum funding requirements as set forth in employee benefit and tax laws
plus such additional amounts as GE may determine to be appropriate. GE has not
made contributions since 1987 because the fully funded status of the GE Pension
Plan precludes current tax deduction and because any GE contribution would
require payment of excise taxes.

6 RETIREE HEALTH AND LIFE BENEFITS

GE and its affiliates sponsor a number of retiree health and life insurance
benefit plans. Principal retiree benefit plans are discussed below; other such
plans are not significant individually or in the aggregate.

PRINCIPAL RETIREE BENEFIT PLANS generally provide health and life insurance
benefits to employees who retire under the GE Pension Plan (see note 5) with 10
or more years of service. Retirees share in the cost of health care benefits.
Benefit provisions are subject to collective bargaining. At the end of 1999,
these plans covered approximately 250,000 retirees and dependents.

         The effect on operations of principal retiree benefit plans is shown in
the following table.

         Plan assets are held in trust and consist mainly of common stock and
fixed-income investments. GE common stock represented 6.2% and 4.5% of trust
assets at year-end 1999 and 1998, respectively.

         GE recorded assets and liabilities for retiree benefit plans as

         Increasing or decreasing the health care cost trend rates by one
percentage point would have had an insignificant effect on the December 31,
1999, accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and the annual cost of
retiree health plans.

         Experience gains and losses, as well as the effects of changes in
actuarial assumptions and plan provisions, are amortized over the average future
service period of employees.

   GE includes GECS in filing a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. The
GECS provision for estimated taxes payable includes its effect on the
consolidated return.

         Estimated consolidated amounts payable includes amounts applicable to
U.S. federal income taxes of $1,632 million, $1,459 million and $1,176 million
in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively, and amounts applicable to non-U.S.
jurisdictions of $1,399 million, $1,335 million and $1,298 million in 1999, 1998
and 1997, respectively. Deferred tax expense related to U.S. federal income
taxes was $1,475 million, $971 million and $354 million in 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively.

         Deferred income tax balances reflect the impact of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax
bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes
are actually paid or recovered. See note 22 for details.

         Except for certain earnings that GE intends to reinvest indefinitely,
provision has been made for the estimated U.S. federal income tax liabilities
applicable to undistributed earnings of affiliates and associated companies. It
is not practicable to determine the U.S. federal income tax liability, if any,
that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely.

         Consolidated U.S. income before taxes was $11.3 billion in 1999, $9.7
billion in 1998 and $8.2 billion in 1997. The corresponding amounts for
non-U.S.-based operations were $4.3 billion in 1999, $3.8 billion in 1998 and
$3.0 billion in 1997.

tax rate is provided on the following page.

         Receivables balances at December 31, 1999 and 1998, before allowance
for losses, included $5,832 million and $5,447 million, respectively, from sales
of goods and services to customers, and $296 million and $350 million,
respectively, from transactions with associated companies.

         Current receivables of $203 million at year-end 1999 and $305 million
at year-end 1998 arose from sales, principally of aircraft engine goods and
services, on open account to various agencies of the U.S. government, which is
GE's largest single customer. About 4% of GE's sales of goods and services were
to the U.S. government in 1999, 1998 and 1997.

were net cost decreases in each of the last three years. As of December 31,
1999, GE is obligated to acquire certain raw materials at market prices through

         Time sales and loans represents transactions in a variety of forms,
including time sales, revolving charge and credit, mortgages, installment loans,
intermediate-term loans and revolving loans secured by business assets. The
portfolio includes time sales and loans carried at the principal amount on which
finance charges are billed periodically, and time sales and loans carried at
gross book value, which includes finance charges. At year-end 1999 and 1998,
financing receivables included $15,782 million and $14,452 million,
respectively, for commercial real estate loans and leases. Note 17 contains
information on airline loans and leases.

         Investment in financing leases consists of direct financing and
leveraged leases of aircraft, railroad rolling stock, autos, other
transportation equipment, data processing equipment and medical equipment, as
well as other manufacturing, power generation, commercial real estate, and
commercial equipment and facilities.

         As the sole owner of assets under direct financing leases and as the
equity participant in leveraged leases, GECS is taxed on total lease payments
received and is entitled to tax deductions based on the cost of leased assets
and tax deductions for interest paid to third-party participants. GECS generally
is entitled to any residual value of leased assets.

         Investment in direct financing and leveraged leases represents net
unpaid rentals and estimated unguaranteed residual values of leased equipment,
less related deferred income. GECS has no general obligation for principal and
interest on notes and other instruments representing third-party participation
related to leveraged leases; such notes and other instruments have not been
included in liabilities but have been offset against the related rentals
receivable. The GECS share of rentals receivable on leveraged leases is
subordinate to the share of other participants who also have security interests
in the leased equipment.

         Nonearning consumer receivables were $930 million and $1,250 million at
December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively, a substantial amount of which were
private-label credit card loans. Nonearning and reduced-earning receivables
other than consumer receivables were $932 million and $354 million at year-end
1999 and 1998, respectively.

         "Impaired" loans are defined by generally accepted accounting
principles as loans for which it is probable that the lender will be unable to
collect all amounts due according to original contractual terms of the loan
agreement. That definition excludes, among other things, leases or large groups
of smaller-balance homogenous loans and therefore applies principally to
commercial loans held by GECS. An analysis of impaired loans follows.

         In line with industry practice, sales of commercial jet aircraft
engines often involve long-term customer financing commitments. In making such
commitments, it is GE's general practice to require that it have or be able to
establish a secured position in the aircraft being financed. Under such airline
financing programs, GE had issued loans and guarantees (principally guarantees)
amounting to $1,453 million at year-end 1999 and $1,473 million at year-end
1998; and it had entered into commitments totaling $1,843 million and $1,519
million at year-end 1999 and 1998, respectively, to provide financial assistance
on future aircraft engine sales. Estimated fair values of the aircraft securing
these receivables and associated guarantees exceeded the related account
balances and guaranteed amounts at December 31, 1999. GECS acts as a lender and
lessor to the commercial airline industry. At December 31, 1999 and 1998, the
balance of such GECS loans, leases and equipment leased to others was $11,772
million and $10,170 million, respectively. In addition, at December 31, 1999,
GECS had issued financial guarantees and funding commitments of $59 million ($74
million at year-end 1998) and had placed multi-year orders for various Boeing
and Airbus aircraft with list prices of approximately $9.9 billion ($9.4 billion
at year-end 1998).

         At year-end 1999, the National Broadcasting Company had $8,843 million
of commitments to acquire broadcast material and the rights to broadcast
television programs, including U.S. television rights to future Olympic Games,
and commitments under long-term television station affiliation agreements that
require payments through the year 2010.

         In connection with numerous projects, primarily power generation bids
and contracts, GE had issued various bid and performance bonds and guarantees
totaling $3,794 million at year-end 1999 and $3,740 million at year-end 1998.

         Separate accounts represent investments controlled by policyholders and
are associated with identical amounts reported as insurance liabilities in note
20.

18 GE ALL OTHER CURRENT COSTS AND EXPENSES ACCRUED

At year-end 1999 and 1998, this account included taxes accrued of $3,940 million
and $3,415 million and compensation and benefit accruals of $1,648 million and
$1,487 million, respectively. Also included are amounts for product warranties,
estimated costs on shipments billed to customers and a variety of sundry items.

         Borrowings of GE and GECS are addressed below from two perspectives --
liquidity and interest rate management. Additional information about borrowings
and associated swaps can be found in note 30.

LIQUIDITY requirements of GE and GECS are principally met through the credit
markets. Maturities of long-term borrowings (including the current portion)
during the next five years follow.

         Committed credit lines of $4.2 billion had been extended to GE by 24
banks at year-end 1999. Substantially all of GE's credit lines are available to
GECS and its affiliates in addition to their own credit lines.

         At year-end 1999, GECS and its affiliates held committed lines of
credit aggregating $32.5 billion, including $12.0 billion of revolving credit
agreements pursuant to which it has the right to borrow funds for periods
exceeding one year. Amounts drawn by GECS under these lines at December 31,
1999, were not significant. A total of $7.7 billion of GE Capital credit lines
is available for use by GE. Both GE and GECS compensate certain banks for credit
facilities in the form of fees, which were insignificant in each of the past
three years.

INTEREST RATES ARE MANAGED by GECS in light of the anticipated behavior,
including prepayment behavior, of assets in which debt proceeds are invested. A
variety of instruments, including interest rate and currency swaps and currency
forwards, are employed to achieve management's interest rate objectives.
Effective interest rates are lower under these "synthetic" positions than could
have been achieved by issuing debt directly.

         The following table shows GECS borrowing positions considering the
effects of swaps.

(a)  Life insurance benefits are accounted for mainly by a net-level-premium
     method using estimated yields generally ranging from 5% to 9% in both 1999
     and 1998.

(b)  Principally property and casualty reserves; includes amounts for both
     reported and incurred-but-not-reported claims, reduced by anticipated
     salvage and subrogation recoveries. Estimates of liabilities are reviewed
     and updated continually, with changes in estimated losses reflected in
     operations.
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         When GECS cedes insurance to third parties, it is not relieved of its
primary obligation to policyholders. Losses on ceded risks give rise to claims
for recovery; allowances are established for such receivables from reinsurers.

         The insurance liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment
expenses related to policies that may cover environmental and asbestos exposures
is based on known facts and an assessment of applicable law and coverage
litigation. Liabilities are recognized for both known and unasserted claims
(including the cost of related litigation) when sufficient information has been
developed to indicate that a claim has been incurred and a range of potential
losses can be reasonably estimated. Developed case law and adequate claim
history do not exist for certain claims principally due to significant
uncertainties as to both the level of ultimate losses that will occur and what
portion, if any, will be deemed to be insured amounts.

         A summary of activity affecting unpaid claims and claims adjustment
expenses follows.

21 GE ALL OTHER LIABILITIES

This account includes noncurrent compensation and benefit accruals at year-end
1999 and 1998 of $5,839 million and $5,594 million, respectively. Also included
are amounts for deferred incentive compensation, deferred income, product
warranties and a variety of sundry items.

         GE is involved in numerous remediation actions to clean up hazardous
wastes as required by federal and state laws. Liabilities for remediation costs
at each site are based on management's best estimate of undiscounted future
costs, excluding possible insurance recoveries. When there appears to be a range
of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the lower end
of such range. Uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, technology
and information related to individual sites make it difficult to develop a
meaningful estimate of the reasonably possible aggregate environmental
remediation exposure. However, even in the unlikely event that remediation costs
amounted to the high end of the range of costs for each site, the resulting
additional liability would not be material to GE's financial position, results
of operations or liquidity.

         The Proxy Statement for the 2000 Annual Meeting of Share Owners will
include a proposal recommended by the Board of Directors on December 17, 1999,
which, if approved by share owners, would (a) increase the number of authorized
shares of common stock from 4,400,000,000 shares each with a par value of $0.16
to 13,200,000,000 shares each with a par value of $0.06 and (b) split each
unissued and issued common share, including shares held in treasury, into three
shares of common stock each with a par value of $0.06.

         GE has 50 million authorized shares of preferred stock ($1.00 par
value), but no such shares have been issued.

         The effects of translating to U.S. dollars the financial statements of
non-U.S. affiliates whose functional currency is the local currency are included
in share owners' equity. Asset and liability accounts are translated at year-end
exchange rates, while revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for
the period.

average exercise price of $23.54. There were 8.9 million restricted stock shares
and restricted stock units outstanding at year-end 1999.

becomes available for granting awards in such year. Any unused portion, in
addition to shares allocated to awards that are canceled or forfeited, is
available for later years.

         Outstanding options and SARs expire on various dates through December
15, 2009. Restricted stock grants vest on various dates up to normal retirement

30 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

This note contains estimated fair values of certain financial instruments to
which GE and GECS are parties. Apart from borrowings by GE and GECS and certain
marketable securities, relatively few of these instruments are actively traded.
Thus, fair values must often be determined by using one or more models that
indicate value based on estimates of quantifiable characteristics as of a
particular date. Because this undertaking is, by its nature, difficult and
highly judgmental, for a limited number of instruments, alternative valuation
techniques may have produced disclosed values different from those that could
have been realized at December 31, 1999 or 1998. Assets and liabilities that, as
a matter of accounting policy, are reflected in the accompanying financial
statements at fair value are not included in the following disclosures; such
items include cash and equivalents, investment securities and separate accounts.

         A description of how values are estimated follows.

BORROWINGS. Based on quoted market prices or market comparables. Fair values of
interest rate and currency swaps on borrowings are based on quoted market prices
and include the effects of counterparty creditworthiness.

TIME SALES AND LOANS. Based on quoted market prices, recent transactions and/or
discounted future cash flows, using rates at which similar loans would have been
made to similar borrowers.

INVESTMENT CONTRACT BENEFITS. Based on expected future cash flows, discounted at
currently offered discount rates for immediate annuity contracts or cash
surrender values for single premium deferred annuities.

FINANCIAL GUARANTEES AND CREDIT LIFE. Based on future cash flows, considering
expected renewal premiums, claims, refunds and servicing costs, discounted at a
market rate.

ALL OTHER INSTRUMENTS. Based on comparable transactions, market comparables,
discounted future cash flows, quoted market prices, and/or estimates of the cost
to terminate or otherwise settle obligations to counterparties.

         Additional information about certain financial instruments in the table
above follows.

CURRENCY FORWARDS AND OPTIONS are employed by GE and GECS to manage exposures to
changes in currency exchange rates associated with commercial purchase and sale
transactions and by GECS to optimize borrowing costs as discussed in note 19.
These financial instruments generally are used to fix the local currency cost of
purchased goods or services or selling prices denominated in currencies other
than the functional currency. Currency exposures that result from net
investments in affiliates are managed principally by funding assets denominated
in local currency with debt denominated in those same currencies. In certain
circumstances, net investment exposures are managed using currency forwards and
currency swaps.

PAGE F-44
ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 76

OPTIONS AND INSTRUMENTS CONTAINING OPTION FEATURES that behave based on limits
("caps," "floors" or "collars") on interest rate movement are used primarily to
hedge prepayment risk in certain GECS business activities, such as mortgage
servicing and annuities.

SWAPS OF INTEREST RATES AND CURRENCIES are used by GE and GECS to optimize
funding costs for a particular funding strategy (see note 19). A cancelable
interest rate swap was used by GE to hedge an investment position. Interest rate
and currency swaps, along with purchased options and futures, are used by GECS
to establish specific hedges of mortgage-related assets and to manage net
investment exposures. Credit risk of these positions is evaluated by management
under the credit criteria discussed below. As part of its ongoing customer
activities, GECS also enters into swaps that are integrated into investments in
or loans to particular customers and do not involve assumption of third-party
credit risk. Such integrated swaps are evaluated and monitored like their
associated investments or loans and are not therefore subject to the same credit
criteria that would apply to a stand-alone position.

COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK -- risk that counterparties will be financially unable
to make payments according to the terms of the agreements -- is the principal
risk associated with swaps, purchased options and forwards. Gross market value
of probable future receipts is one way to measure this risk, but is meaningful
only in the context of net credit exposure to individual counter-parties. At
December 31, 1999 and 1998, this gross market risk amounted to $2.0 billion and
$2.3 billion, respectively. Aggregate fair values that represent associated
probable future obligations, normally associated with a right of offset against
probable future receipts, amounted to $3.6 billion at both year-end 1999 and
1998.

         Except as noted above for positions that are integrated into
financings, all swaps, purchased options and forwards are carried out within the
following credit policy constraints.

*    Once a counterparty exceeds credit exposure limits (see table below), no
     additional transactions are permitted until the exposure with that
     counterparty is reduced to an amount that is within the established limit.
     Open contracts remain in force.

- --------------------------------------------------------------

*    All swaps are executed under master swap agreements containing mutual
     credit downgrade provisions that provide the ability to require assignment
     or termination in the event either party is downgraded below A3 or A-.

More credit latitude is permitted for transactions having original maturities
shorter than one year because of their lower risk.

         For GE, gross profit from sales is sales of goods and services less
costs of goods and services sold. For GECS, operating profit is "Earnings before
income taxes."

         Earnings-per-share amounts for each quarter are required to be computed
independently. As a result, their sum does not equal the total year
earnings-per-share amounts for diluted earnings per share in 1999 and basic
earnings per share in 1998.
