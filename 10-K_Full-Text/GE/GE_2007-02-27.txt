Part
      I

Item
      1. Business

General

Unless
      otherwise indicated by the context, we use the terms “GE,” “GECS” and “GE
      Capital” on the basis of consolidation described in note 1 to the consolidated
      financial statements on page 74 of the 2006 Annual Report to Shareowners of
      General Electric Company (the Company). The financial section of such Annual
      Report to Shareowners (pages 45 through 113 of that document) is described
      in Part IV Item 15(a)(1) and set forth in Exhibit 13 of this 10-K Report
      and is an integral part hereof. References in Parts I and II of this 10-K Report
      are to the page numbers of the 2006 Annual Report to Shareowners. Also, unless
      otherwise indicated by the context, “General Electric” means the parent company,
      General Electric Company.

General
      Electric’s address is 1 River Road, Schenectady, NY 12345-6999; we also maintain
      executive offices at 3135 Easton Turnpike, Fairfield, CT
      06828-0001.

GE
      is one of the largest and most diversified industrial corporations in the world.
      We have engaged in developing, manufacturing and marketing a wide variety of
      products for the generation, transmission, distribution, control and utilization
      of electricity since our incorporation in 1892. Over the years, we have
      developed or acquired new technologies and services that have broadened
      considerably the scope of our activities.

Our
      products include major appliances; lighting products; industrial automation
      products; medical diagnostic imaging systems; bioscience assays and separation
      technology products; electrical distribution and control equipment; locomotives;
      power generation and delivery products; nuclear power support services and
      fuel
      assemblies; commercial and military aircraft jet engines; chemicals and
      equipment for treatment of water and process systems; security equipment and
      systems; and engineered materials, such as plastics.

Our
      services include product services; electrical apparatus installation,
      engineering, and repair and rebuilding services. Through our affiliate, NBC
      Universal, Inc., we produce and deliver network television services, operate
      television stations, produce and distribute motion pictures, operate
      cable/satellite networks, operate theme parks, and program activities in
      multimedia and the Internet. Through another affiliate, General Electric Capital
      Services, Inc., we offer a broad array of financial and other services including
      consumer financing, commercial and industrial financing, real estate financing,
      asset management and leasing, mortgage services and consumer
      savings.

In
      virtually all of our global business activities, we encounter aggressive and
      able competition. In many instances, the competitive climate is characterized
      by
      changing technology that requires continuing research and development, as well
      as customer commitments. With respect to manufacturing operations, we believe
      that, in general, we are one of the leading firms in most of the major
      industries in which we participate. The NBC Television Network is one of four
      major U.S. commercial broadcast television networks. We also compete with
      syndicated broadcast television programming, cable and satellite television
      programming activities and in the motion picture industry. The businesses in
      which GECS engages are subject to competition from various types of financial
      institutions, including commercial banks, thrifts, investment banks,
      broker-dealers, credit unions, leasing companies, consumer loan companies,
      independent finance companies and finance companies associated with
      manufacturers.

This document contains “forward-looking statements”- that is, statements related
        to future, not past, events. In this context, forward-looking statements
        often
        address our expected future business and financial performance, and often
        contain words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,”
“seek,” or “will.” Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters
        that are, to different degrees, uncertain. For us, particular uncertainties
        that
        could adversely or positively affect our future results include: the behavior
        of
        financial markets, including fluctuations in interest and exchange rates
        and
        commodity and equity prices; the commercial and consumer credit environment;
        the
        impact of regulation and regulatory, investigative and legal actions; strategic
        actions, including acquisitions and dispositions; future integration of acquired
        businesses; future financial performance of major industries which we serve,
        including, without limitation, the air and rail transportation, energy
        generation, media, real estate and healthcare industries; and numerous other
        matters of national, regional and global scale, including those of a political,
        economic, business and competitive nature. These uncertainties may cause
        our
        actual future results to be materially different than those expressed in
        our
        forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update our forward-looking
        statements.

Our
      consolidated global revenues increased to $87.4 billion in 2006, compared with
      $75.6 billion in 2005 and $66.2 billion in 2004. For additional information
      about our global operations, see page 57 of the 2006 Annual Report to
      Shareowners.

Operating
      Segments

Segment
      revenue and profit information is presented on page 53 of the 2006 Annual Report
      to Shareowners. Additional financial data and commentary on recent financial
      results for operating segments are provided on pages

52-56
      of
      that report and in note 26 (page 100) to the consolidated financial
      statements.

In
      January 2007, we announced the planned acquisitions of Smiths Aerospace and
      Vetco-Gray by Infrastructure and Abbott’s primary

in
      vitro

diagnostics businesses and Abbott Point-of-Care diagnostics business by
      Healthcare. Also during January 2007, we announced that we were reviewing the
      potential disposition of our Plastics business by Industrial. In the fourth
      quarter of 2006, we completed the sales of our Advanced Materials business
      by
      Industrial and GE Life, our U.K.-based life insurance business. We have reported
      GE Life as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.

Operating
      businesses that are reported as segments include Infrastructure, Commercial
      Finance, GE Money (formerly Consumer Finance), Healthcare, NBC Universal and
      Industrial. There is appropriate elimination of the net earnings of GECS and
      the
      immaterial effect of transactions between segments to arrive at total
      consolidated data. A summary description of each of our operating segments
      follows.

We
      will
      also continue our longstanding practice of providing supplemental information
      for certain businesses within the segments.

Infrastructure

Infrastructure
      (29.0%, 28.3% and 27.8% of consolidated revenues in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
      respectively) produces, sells, finances and services equipment for the air
      transportation and energy generation industries. We also produce, sell and
      service equipment for the rail transportation and water treatment industries.

Our
      operations are located in North America, Europe, Asia and South
      America.

Aviation
      and Aviation Financial Services

Aviation
      produces, sells and services jet engines, turboprop and turbo shaft engines,
      and
      related replacement parts for use in military and commercial aircraft. Our
      military engines are used in a wide variety of aircraft including fighters,
      bombers, tankers, helicopters and surveillance aircraft, as well as marine
      applications, and our commercial engines power aircraft in all categories of
      range: short/medium, intermediate and long-range, as well as executive and
      regional aircraft. We also produce engines through CFM International, a company
      jointly owned by GE and Snecma, a subsidiary of SAFRAN of France; and new
      engines are being designed and marketed in joint ventures with the Pratt &
Whitney division of United Technologies Corporation and Honda Aero, Inc., a
      division of Honda Motor Co., Ltd.

We
      provide maintenance, component repair and overhaul services (MRO), including
      sales of replacement parts, for many models of engines, including repair and
      overhaul of engines manufactured by competitors.

The
      worldwide competition in aircraft jet engines and MRO (including parts sales)
      is
      intense. Both U.S. and export markets are important. Product development cycles
      are long and product quality and efficiency are critical to success. Research
      and development expenditures are important in this business, as are focused
      intellectual property strategies and protection of key aircraft engine design,
      manufacture, repair and product upgrade technologies.

Potential
      sales for any engine are limited by, among other things, its technological
      lifetime, which may vary considerably depending upon the rate of advance in
      technology, the small number of potential customers and the limited number
      of
      relevant airframe applications. Aircraft engine orders tend to follow military
      and airline procurement cycles, although these cycles differ from each
      other.

On
      January 15, 2007, Aviation announced the acquisition of Smiths Aerospace from
      Smiths Group plc for approximately $4.8 billion in cash. Smiths Aerospace is
      a
      $2.4 billion (sales) global aerospace systems and equipment company that
      includes innovative flight management systems, airborne platform computing
      systems, power generation, conversion and distribution products, actuation
      products and systems for flight control, thrust reversers and landing gear
      applications, various engine components and a global customer services
      organization to military and commercial airframe manufacturers. The acquisition
      is subject to regulatory approvals in the U.S. and abroad.

Aviation
      Financial Services is a global commercial aviation financial services business
      that offers a broad range of financial products to airlines, aircraft operators,
      owners, lenders, investors and airport developers. Financial products include
      leases, aircraft purchasing and trading, loans, engine/spare parts financing,
      pilot training, fleet planning and financial advisory services. We operate
      in a
      highly competitive environment. Our competitors include aircraft manufacturers,
      banks, financial institutions, and other finance and leasing companies.
      Competition is based on lease rates and terms, as well as aircraft delivery
      dates, condition and availability.

(5)

The
      North American commercial aviation industry improved during 2006 because of
      a
      strong revenue environment and continued cost reduction efforts by the airlines,
      despite rising fuel prices. Although these conditions have improved the overall
      industry outlook, the airlines continue to face challenges and financial
      pressure that affect a portion of our commercial aviation business. Several
      airlines are experiencing major restructuring and reorganization, including
      those who remain in, or recently emerged from, bankruptcy, while others could
      be
      candidates for further industry consolidation.

Energy
      and Energy Financial Services

Energy
      serves power generation, industrial, government and other customers worldwide
      with products and services related to energy production, distribution and
      management. We offer wind turbines as part of our renewable energy portfolio,
      which also includes solar and geothermal technology. We also sell aircraft
      engine derivatives for use as industrial power sources. Gas turbines and
      generators are used principally in power plants for generation of electricity
      and for industrial cogeneration and mechanical drive applications. We are a
      worldwide supplier of gas turbines for Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle
      (IGCC) applications, having provided gas turbines for a significant number
      of
      the world’s operating IGCC plants. IGCC systems convert coal and other
      hydrocarbons into synthetic gas that, after cleanup, is used as the primary
      fuel
      for gas turbines in combined-cycle systems. IGCC systems produce fewer air
      pollutants compared with traditional pulverized coal power plants. We sell
      steam
      turbines and generators to the electric utility industry and to private
      industrial customers for cogeneration applications. Nuclear reactors, fuel
      and
      support services for both new and installed boiling water reactors are also
      a
      part of this segment. We provide our customers with total solutions to meet
      their needs through a complete portfolio of aftermarket services, including
      equipment upgrades, long-term maintenance service agreements, repairs, equipment
      installation, monitoring and diagnostics, asset management and performance
      optimization tools, remote performance testing and Dry Low NOx (DLN) tuning.
      We
      continue to invest in advanced technology development that will provide more
      value to our customers and more efficient solutions that comply with today’s
      strict environmental regulations.

Worldwide
      competition for power generation products and services is intense. Demand for
      most power generation products and services is global and, as a result, is
      sensitive to the economic and political environment of each country in which
      we
      do business. Regional load growth requirements and demand side management are
      important factors. The availability of fuels and related prices have a large
      impact on demand.

Energy
      Financial Services offers structured equity, debt, leasing, partnership
      financing, project finance and broad-based commercial finance to the global
      energy and water industries and invests in operating assets in these industries.
      We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our competitors include banks,
      financial institutions, energy and water companies, and other finance and
      leasing companies. Competition is primarily based on price, that is interest
      rates and fees, as well as deal structure and terms. As we compete globally,
      our
      success is sensitive to the economic and political environment of each country
      in which we do business.

Oil
      & Gas

Oil
      & Gas supplies advanced technology turbomachinery, principally compressors
      and turbines, and services (including pipeline inspection and integrity
      solutions) for the production, transportation and refining of oil and natural
      gas. A truly global business, Oil & Gas supports the world’s leading
      national and international oil companies with latest technology products and
      services that drive improvements in productivity, efficiency and environmental
      performance.

Signaling
      a major expansion of its footprint in the industry,

on
      February 23, 2007, Oil & Gas acquired Vetco Gray, one of the world’s leading
      suppliers of drilling, completion and production equipment for onshore and
      subsea applications in oil and gas fields. The business supplies flow control
      valves (known as “Christmas trees”), control systems, wellheads, manifolds,
      risers and associated after-market services.

The
      global demand for oil and gas, coupled with a geographic imbalance between
      supply and demand is promoting investment in the exploration, production,
      transportation and processing segments of the industry.

Transportation

Transportation
      provides technology solutions for customers in a variety of industries including
      railroad, transit, mining, oil and gas, power generation, and marine. We serve
      customers in more than 100 countries. Our products include high horsepower
      diesel-electric locomotives as well as parts and services for locomotives,
      including locomotives manufactured by competitors.

With
      the launch of the Evolution Series™ locomotive, we created our most
      technologically advanced, most fuel-efficient, diesel locomotive, while meeting
      or exceeding the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Tier II requirements.
      Commercial production of the Evolution Series™ locomotive began in January
      2005.

The
      GE suite of locomotive services offerings, designed to improve fleet efficiency
      and reduce operating expenses, includes repair services, locomotive
      enhancements, modernizations, and information-based services like remote
      monitoring and diagnostics. We provide train control products, railway
      management services, and signaling systems to increase service levels, optimize
      asset utilization, and streamline operations for railroad owners and operators.
      We deliver leading edge tools that improve asset availability and reliability,
      optimize network planning, and control network execution to plan. We also offer
      leading drive technology solutions to the mining, transit, marine and
      stationary, and drilling industries. Our motors operate in thousands of
      applications, from electrical drive systems for large haulage trucks used in
      the
      mining industry to transit cars and drilling rigs, and our engines are used
      for
      marine power as well as stationary power generation applications. We also
      provide gearing technology for critical applications such as wind
      turbines.

(7)

Water

Water
      offers productivity solutions for industrial and municipal water systems
      including the supply and related services of specialty chemicals, water
      purification systems, pumps, valves, filters and fluid handling equipment for
      improving the performance of water, wastewater and process systems including
      mobile treatment systems and desalination processes. During 2006, we acquired
      ZENON Environmental Inc., a global leader in advanced membranes for water
      purification and wastewater treatment

For
      information about orders and backlog, see page 54

of
      the 2006 Annual Report to Shareowners.

Commercial
      Finance

Commercial
      Finance (14.6 %, 14.0% and 14.5% of consolidated revenues in 2006, 2005 and
      2004, respectively) offers a broad range of financial services worldwide. We
      have particular mid-market expertise and offer loans, leases and other financial
      services to customers, including manufacturers, distributors and end-users
      for a
      variety of equipment and major capital assets. These assets include
      industrial-related facilities and equipment; commercial and residential real
      estate; vehicles; corporate aircraft; and equipment used in many industries,
      including the construction, manufacturing, telecommunications and healthcare
      industries.

During
      2006, we made a number of acquisitions, the most significant of which were
      Arden
      Realty, Inc., a commercial real estate company in the U.S.; Banque Artesia
      Nederland N.V., a subsidiary of Dexia Group; the custom fleet business of
      National Australia Bank Ltd.; and several senior housing portfolios from
      Formation Capital LLC.

We
      operate in a highly competitive environment. Our competitors include commercial
      banks, investment banks, leasing companies, financing companies associated
      with
      manufacturers, and independent finance companies. Competition related to our
      lending and leasing operations is based on price, that is interest rates and
      fees, as well as deal structure and terms. Profitability is affected not only
      by
      broad economic conditions that affect customer credit quality and the
      availability and cost of capital, but also by successful management of credit
      risk, operating risk and market risks such as interest rate and currency
      exchange risks. Success requires high quality risk management systems, customer
      and industry specific knowledge, diversification, service and distribution
      channels, strong collateral and asset management knowledge, deal structuring
      expertise and the ability to reduce costs through technology and productivity.

Our
      headquarters are in Norwalk, Connecticut with offices throughout North America,
      South America, Europe, Australia and Asia.

Capital
      Solutions

Capital
      Solutions offers a broad range of financial services worldwide, and has
      particular mid-market expertise, offering loans, leases, inventory finance
      and
      other financial services to customers, including manufacturers, dealers and
      end-users for a variety of equipment and major capital assets. These assets
      include retail facilities; vehicles; corporate aircraft; and equipment used
      in
      many industries, including the construction, transportation, technology, and
      manufacturing industries.

(8)

Real
      Estate

Real
      Estate offers a comprehensive range of capital and investment solutions,
      including equity capital for acquisition or development, as well as fixed and
      floating rate mortgages for new acquisitions or re-capitalizations of commercial
      real estate worldwide. Our business finances, with both equity and loan
      structures, the acquisition, refinancing and renovation of office buildings,
      apartment buildings, retail facilities, parking facilities and industrial
      properties. Our typical real estate loans are intermediate term, may be either
      senior or subordinated, fixed or floating-rate, and are secured by existing
      income-producing commercial properties. Certain of our originations of low
      loan-to-value loans are conducted for term securitization within one year;
      certain of our equity investments, including properties we acquire for
      investment, are sold under favorable market conditions. We invest in, and
      provide restructuring financing for, portfolios of mortgage loans, limited
      partnerships and tax-exempt bonds.

In
      the normal course of our business operations, we sell certain real estate equity
      investments when it is economically advantageous for us to do so. However,
      as
      real estate values are affected by certain forces beyond our control (e.g.,
      market fundamentals and demographic conditions), it is difficult to predict
      with
      certainty the level of future sales or sales prices. Rental income generally
      approximates operating expenses, which include depreciation and
      amortization.

GE
      Money

GE
      Money (13.3%, 13.1% and 11.7% of consolidated revenues in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
      respectively), formerly Consumer Finance, is a leading provider of financial
      services to consumers and retailers in over 50 countries around the world.
      We
      offer a full range of innovative financial products to suit customers’ needs.
      These products include private-label credit cards; personal loans; bank cards;
      auto loans and leases; mortgages; corporate travel and purchasing cards; debt
      consolidation; home equity loans; deposit and other savings products, and credit
      insurance on a global basis.

In
      2006, as part of our continued global expansion, we made a number of
      acquisitions, the most significant of which was the private-label credit card
      portfolio of Hudson’s Bay Company, the largest department store retailer in
      Canada.

Our
      operations are subject to a variety of bank and consumer protection regulations,
      including regulations controlling data privacy. Further, a number of countries
      have ceilings on rates chargeable to consumers in financial service
      transactions. We are subject to competition from various types of financial
      institutions including commercial banks, leasing companies, consumer loan
      companies, independent finance companies, manufacturers’ captive finance
      companies, and insurance companies. Industry participants compete on the basis
      of price, servicing capability, promotional marketing, risk management, and
      cross selling. The markets in which we operate are also subject to the risks
      from fluctuations in retail sales, interest and currency exchange rates, and
      the
      consumer’s capacity to repay debt.

Our
      headquarters are in Stamford, Connecticut and our operations are located in
      North America, South America, Europe, Australia and Asia.

Our
      headquarters are in Chalfont St. Giles, United Kingdom and our operations are
      located in North America, Europe, Asia, Australia and South
      America.

NBC
      Universal

NBC
      Universal, Inc. (NBC Universal) (9.9%, 9.9% and 9.6% of consolidated revenues
      in
      2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively) was formed in May 2004 upon the combination
      of NBC with Vivendi Universal Entertainment LLLP and certain related assets.
      NBC
      Universal is principally engaged in the broadcast of network television services
      to affiliated television stations within the United States; the production
      and
      distribution of television programs and motion pictures; the operation, under
      licenses from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC), of television
      broadcasting stations; the ownership of several cable/satellite networks around
      the world; the operation of theme parks; and investment and programming
      activities in multimedia and the internet. The NBC television network is one
      of
      four major U.S. commercial broadcast television networks and serves 230
      affiliated stations within the United States. Telemundo is a U.S.
      Spanish-language commercial broadcast television network. At December 31, 2006,
      we owned and operated 26 television stations including those located in Los
      Angeles, CA; Miami, FL; Chicago, IL; New York, NY; Philadelphia, PA and
      Washington, DC. Broadcasting operations of the NBC television network, the
      Telemundo network, and the company’s owned stations are subject to FCC
      regulation. Our operations include cable television networks, principally USA
      Network, Bravo, CNBC, SciFi Channel, MSNBC, the Sundance Channel and
      entertainment channels across Europe and Latin America. We have secured
      exclusive United States television rights to the 2008, 2010 and 2012 Olympic
      Games, National Football League Sunday Night Football and Super Bowls in 2009
      and 2012.

NBC
      Universal’s broadcast ratings and advertising revenue are affected by viewer
      demographics and the availability of other entertainment choices. In addition,
      recent technological advances like personal video recorders offer personal
      entertainment through new media, introducing additional uncertainty to future
      revenue sources. Other technologies enable copying content, increasing the
      risk
      of content piracy, particularly in international markets where the intellectual
      property laws may not be clear or strictly applied.

NBC
      Universal’s headquarters are in New York, New York and our operations are
      global.

Industrial

Industrial
      (20.5%, 22.1% and 22.9% of consolidated revenues in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
      respectively) produces and sells products including consumer appliances,
      industrial equipment and plastics, and related services. We also provide asset
      management services for the transportation industry.

Our
      operations are located in North America, Europe, Asia and South
      America.

Consumer
      & Industrial

Consumer
      & Industrial sells products that share several characteristics

-

competitive design, efficient manufacturing and effective distribution and
      service. Strong global competition rarely permits premium pricing, so cost
      control, including productivity, is key. Despite pricing pressures on many
      of
      our products, we also invest in the development of differentiated, premium
      products that are more profitable. While some Consumer & Industrial products
      are primarily directed to consumer applications (major appliances, for example),
      and some primarily to industrial applications (switchgear, for example), others
      are directed to both markets (lighting, for example).

We
      sell and service major home appliances including refrigerators, freezers,
      electric and gas ranges, cooktops, dishwashers, clothes washers and dryers,
      microwave ovens, room air conditioners, and residential water systems for
      filtration, softening and heating. Brands are Monogram®, GE Profile™, GE®, and
      Hotpoint®.

We
      manufacture certain products, and also source finished product and component
      parts from third-party global manufacturers. A large portion of our appliances
      sales are through a variety of retail outlets for replacement of installed
      units. Residential building contractors installing units in new construction
      are
      our second major U.S. channel. We offer the largest OEM service organization
      in
      the appliances industry, providing in-home repair, extended service plans,
      warranty administration and risk management services. We also manufacture and
      sell a variety of lamp products for commercial, industrial and consumer markets,
      including full lines of incandescent, halogen, fluorescent, high-intensity
      discharge, light-emitting diode, automotive and miniature products.

(11)

Consumer
      & Industrial also provides integrated electrical equipment and systems used
      to distribute, protect and control energy and equipment. We manufacture and
      distribute electrical distribution and control products including transformers,
      meters, relays, circuit breakers, panel boards and general purpose controls
      that
      are used to distribute and manage power in a variety of residential, commercial,
      consumer and industrial applications. In addition, we design and manufacture
      motors and control systems used in end-industrial and consumer products such
      as
      heating, ventilation and air conditioning, dishwashers, and clothes washers
      and
      dryers. We also provide customer-focused solutions centered on the delivery
      and
      control of electric power, and market a wide variety of commercial lighting
      systems and lighting for aircraft, automotive and other transportation
      applications, front and rear video projection, medical, architectural, fiber
      optic, stage, studio, nightclub and theater applications.

The
      aggregate level of economic activity in markets for such products and services
      generally lags overall economic slowdowns as well as subsequent recoveries.
      In
      the United States, industrial markets are undergoing significant structural
      changes reflecting, among other factors, increased international competition
      and
      pressures to modernize productive capacity.

Equipment
      Services

Equipment
      Services is a provider of transport solutions for domestic and international
      supply chains. We offer a wide range of equipment leasing and intelligence-based
      asset management and logistics services for commercial and transportation
      equipment, including tractors, trailers, railroad rolling stock, modular space
      units, and land and marine shipping containers. Our operations are conducted
      in
      highly competitive markets. Economic conditions, geographic location, pricing
      and equipment availability are important factors in this business. Future
      success will depend upon our ability to maintain a large and diverse customer
      portfolio, optimize asset mix, maximize asset utilization and manage credit
      risk
      as well as providing our customers with solutions to assist in asset and supply
      chain management.

Plastics

Plastics
      manufactures and sells high-performance plastics and structured products used
      by
      compounders, molders, and major original equipment manufacturers for use in
      a
      variety of applications, including fabrication of automotive parts, computer
      enclosures, compact disks and optical-quality media, major appliance parts,
      telecommunications equipment and construction materials. Our business has a
      significant operating presence around the world and we participate in numerous
      manufacturing and distribution joint ventures.

Our
      business environment is characterized by technological innovation and heavy
      capital investment. To remain competitive we must maintain emphasis on efficient
      manufacturing process implementation and devote significant resources to market
      and application development. Our competitors include large, technology-driven
      suppliers of the same, as well as other functionally similar, materials. Our
      business is cyclical and is sensitive to variations in price and to the effects
      of supply/demand factors on the cost of utilities and raw materials such as
      benzene, cumene and phenol. Competition is affected by availability of
      manufacturing capacity and anticipation of new product or material performance
      requirements. Our application development, often in association with our
      existing or potential customers, and associated technology assistance have
      added
      additional demand. Product and manufacturing process patents establish barriers
      to entry in many product lines. In January 2007, we announced that we are
      reviewing the potential disposition of our Plastics business.

(12)

Other

Prior
      to the sale of our Advanced Materials business in December 2006, our Industrial
      business also sold silicones and high-purity quartzware. We sold these materials
      to a diverse, worldwide customer base, mainly manufacturers. Our business had
      a
      significant operating presence around the world and we participated in numerous
      manufacturing and distribution joint ventures.

We
      also offer protection and productivity solutions to some of the most pressing
      issues that industries face: safe facilities, plant automation and sensing
      applications in the operating environment. From home to industry to national
      security, our technology covers the full spectrum of security solutions,
      including card access systems, high-tech video monitoring, intrusion and smoke
      detection, real estate and property control, and explosives and narcotics
      detection. We are an industry leader in the design and manufacture of
      measurement elements, equipment and systems that enable customers to monitor,
      protect, control and ensure the safety of their critical applications. These
      products include precision sensors for temperature, flow rate, pressure,
      humidity, gas, infrared and ultrasonic applications; high-quality handheld
      and
      portable field calibrators; equipment for detection of material defects;
      stand-alone measurement instrumentation; and systems that provide the end-to-end
      solutions necessary to validate or certify vital commercial and industrial
      processes. We deliver automation hardware and software designed to help users
      reduce costs, increase efficiency and enhance profitability through a diverse
      array of capabilities and products, including controllers, embedded systems,
      advanced software, motion control, computer numerical controls, operator
      interfaces, industrial computers, and lasers.

Our
      products and services are sold to a diverse worldwide commercial and residential
      customer base in the transportation, industrial, pharmaceutical and healthcare
      markets. Our business environment is characterized by technological innovation
      and market growth. Our competitors include technology-driven suppliers of the
      same, as well as other functionally equivalent products and
      services.

Discontinued
      Operations

Discontinued
      operations includes the results of GE Life, our U.K.-based life insurance
      operation; the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses and
      the European life and health operations of GE Insurance Solutions Corporation
      (GE Insurance Solutions); and Genworth Financial, Inc. (Genworth), our formerly
      wholly-owned subsidiary that conducted most of our consumer insurance business,

      data (based on the location of the Company operation supplying goods or services
      and including exports from the U.S. to unaffiliated customers) are reported
      in
      note 26 to the consolidated financial statements on page 100 of the 2006
      Annual Report to Shareowners.

      pages 54, 55 and 66 of the 2006 Annual Report to Shareowners for
      information about our backlog of unfilled orders.

Research
      and Development

Total
      expenditures for research and development were $3,659 million, $3,425 million
      and $3,091 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Of these amounts,
      $2,969 million in 2006 was GE-funded ($2,741 million in 2005 and $2,443 million
      in 2004); and $690 million in 2006 was funded by customers ($684 million in
      and $648 million in 2004), principally the U.S. government. Infrastructure’s
      Aviation business accounts for the largest share of GE’s research and
      development expenditures with funding from both GE and customer funds.
      Healthcare and Infrastructure’s Energy business also made significant
      expenditures funded primarily by GE.

Environmental
      Matters

Our
      operations, like operations of other companies engaged in similar businesses,
      involve the use, disposal and cleanup of substances regulated under
      environmental protection laws.

We
      are involved in a sizable number of remediation actions to clean up hazardous
      wastes as required by federal and state laws. Such statutes require that
      responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault, legality
      of
      original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. Expenditures for site
      remediation actions amounted to approximately $0.2 billion in 2006 and $0.1
      billion in 2005. We presently expect that such remediation actions will require
      average annual expenditures in the range of $0.2 billion to $0.3 billion over
      the next two years.

The
      U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ruled in February 2002 that
      approximately 150,000 pounds of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) must be dredged
      from a 40-mile stretch of the upper Hudson River in New York state. On
      November 2, 2006, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
      New York approved a consent decree entered into between GE and the EPA that
      represents a comprehensive framework for implementation of the EPA’s 2002
      decision to dredge PCB-containing sediments in the upper Hudson River. The
      dredging will be performed in two phases with an intervening peer review of
      performance after phase 1. Under this consent decree, we have committed up
      to $0.1 billion to reimburse the EPA for its past and future project oversight
      costs and agreed to perform the first phase of dredging. We further committed
      that, subject to future agreement with the EPA about completion of dredging
      after completion of phase 1 and the peer review, we will be responsible for
      further costs, including costs of phase 2 dredging. Our Statement of
      Financial Position as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, included
      liabilities for the estimated costs of this remediation.

Employee
      Relations

At
      year-end 2006, General Electric Company and consolidated affiliates employed
      approximately 319,000 persons, of whom approximately 155,000 were employed
      in
      the United States. For further information about employees, see page 67 of
      the 2006 Annual Report to Shareowners.

(14)

Approximately
      19,500 GE manufacturing and service employees in the United States are
      represented for collective bargaining purposes by a total of approximately
      different local collective bargaining groups. A majority of such employees
      are
      represented by union locals that are affiliated with, and bargain in conjunction
      with, the International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine
      and
      Furniture Workers (IUE/CWA-AFL-CIO). During 2003, General Electric Company
      negotiated four-year contracts with unions representing a substantial majority
      of those United States employees who are represented by unions. Most of these
      contracts will terminate in June 2007, and we will be engaged in negotiations
      to
      attain new agreements. While results of the 2007 union negotiations cannot
      be
      predicted, our recent past negotiations have resulted in agreements that
      increased costs.

Approximately
      3,500 staff employees (and a large number of freelance employees) in the United
      States are covered by about 160 labor agreements to which NBC Universal is
      a
      party. These agreements are with various labor unions, expire at various dates
      and are generally for a term ranging from three to five years.

Executive
      Officers

      Part III, Item 10 of this 10-K Report for information about Executive Officers
      of the Registrant.

Other

Because
      of the diversity of our products and services, as well as the wide geographic
      dispersion of our production facilities, we use numerous sources for the wide
      variety of raw materials needed for our operations. We have not been adversely
      affected by the inability to obtain raw materials.

We
      own, or hold licenses to use, numerous patents. New patents are continuously
      being obtained through our research and development activities as existing
      patents expire. Patented inventions are used both within the Company and are
      licensed to others, but no operating segment is substantially dependent on
      any
      single patent or group of related patents.

Agencies
      of the U.S. Government constitute our largest single customer. An analysis
      of
      sales of goods and services as a percentage of revenues follows:

GE
      is a trademark and service mark of General Electric Company; NBC is a trademark
      and service mark of NBC Universal, Inc.; and MSNBC is a trademark and service
      mark of MSNBC Cable, LLC.

Item
      1A. Risk Factors

The
      following discussion of risk factors contains “forward-looking statements,” as
      discussed in Item 1. These risk factors may be important to understanding any
      statement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following
      information should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and
      Analysis (MD&A), and the consolidated financial statements and related notes
      incorporated by reference in this report.

Our
      businesses routinely encounter and address risks, some of which will cause
      our
      future results to be different

-

sometimes materially different

-

than we presently anticipate.

Discussion
      about important operational risks that our businesses encounter can be found
      in
      the MD&A section of our 2006 Annual Report to Shareowners and in the
      business descriptions in Item 1. of this Form 10-K. Below, we have
      described certain important strategic risks. Our reactions to material future
      developments as well as our competitors’ reactions to those developments will
      determine our future results.

Our
      global growth is subject to a number of economic and political
      risks

We
      conduct our operations in virtually every part of the world. Global economic
      developments affect businesses such as ours in many ways. Operations are subject
      to the effects of global competition. Our global business is affected by local
      economic environments, including inflation, recession and currency volatility.
      Political changes, some of which may be disruptive, can interfere with our
      supply chain, our customers and all of our activities in a particular location.
      While some of these risks can be hedged using derivatives or other financial
      instruments and some are insurable, such attempts to mitigate these risks are
      costly and not always successful.

Our
      credit ratings are important to our cost of capital

The
      major debt agencies routinely evaluate our debt and have given their highest
      debt ratings to us. One of our strategic objectives is to maintain these “Triple
      A” ratings as they serve to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate our access
      to a variety of lenders. Failure to maintain our Triple A debt rating could
      adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins.

(16)

The
      success of our business depends on achieving our objectives for strategic
      acquisitions and dispositions

With
      respect to acquisitions and mergers, we may not be able to identify suitable
      candidates at terms acceptable to us, or may not achieve expected returns and
      other benefits as a result of integration challenges, such as personnel and
      technology. We will continue to evaluate the potential disposition of assets
      and
      businesses that may no longer help us meet our objectives. When we decide to
      sell assets or a business, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or
      alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, which could
      delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives, or we may dispose of
      a
      business at a price or on terms, which are less than we had anticipated. In
      addition, there is a risk that we sell a business whose subsequent performance
      exceeds our expectations, in which case our decision would have potentially
      sacrificed enterprise value. Correspondingly, we may be too optimistic about
      a
      particular business’s prospects, in which case we may be unable to find a buyer
      at a price acceptable to us and therefore may have potentially sacrificed
      enterprise value.

We
      are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations

Our
      businesses are subject to regulation by U.S. federal and state laws and foreign
      laws, regulations and policies. Changes to laws or regulations may even require
      us to modify our business objectives if existing practices become more
      restricted, subject to escalating costs or prohibited outright. Particular
      risks
      include regulatory risks arising from local laws, such as laws which reduce
      the
      allowable lending rate or limit consumer borrowing, and from local liquidity
      regulations, that may increase the risks of not being able to retrieve assets
      and changes to tax law which may affect our return on investments. Our business
      and the industries in which we operate are also at times being reviewed or
      investigated by regulators, which could lead to enforcement actions, fines
      and
      penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages.

Changes
      in the real estate markets are highly uncertain

We
      provide financing for the acquisition, refinancing and renovation of various
      types of properties. We also consider opportunities to buy and sell properties
      which may result in significant outlays or proceeds of cash, either individually
      or in the aggregate. The profitability of real estate investments is largely
      dependent upon the specific geographic market in which they are located and
      the
      perceived value of that market at the time of sale. We may have difficulty
      optimizing that mix and such activity may vary significantly from one year
      to
      the next.

Item
      1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

Not
      applicable.

Item
      2. Properties

Manufacturing
      operations are carried out at approximately 230 manufacturing plants located
      in
      37 states in the United States and Puerto Rico and at 274 manufacturing plants
      located in 43 other countries.

Item
      3. Legal Proceedings

As
        previously reported, since January 2005, the U.S. Securities and Exchange
        Commission (SEC) staff has been conducting an investigation of the use of
        hedge
        accounting for derivatives by us and General Electric Capital Corporation
        (GECC). In August 2005 the SEC staff advised us that the SEC had issued a
        formal
        order of investigation in the matter. The SEC staff has continued to subpoena
        documents and take testimony in this matter. We and GECC continue to cooperate
        fully with its investigation.

In
        the course of the SEC investigation, the SEC Enforcement staff raised certain
        concerns about our accounting for the use of interest rate swaps to fix certain
        otherwise variable interest costs in a portion of our commercial paper program
        at GECC. The SEC Enforcement staff referred such concerns to the Office of
        Chief
        Accountant (OCA). We and our auditors determined that our accounting for
        the
        commercial paper hedging program satisfied the requirements of Statement
        of
        Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 133,

Accounting
        for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

,
        as amended, and conveyed our views to the staff of OCA. Following our
        discussions, however, OCA communicated its view to us that our commercial
        paper
        hedging program as structured did not meet the SFAS 133 specificity requirement.
        Accordingly, we restated our previously reported financial results to eliminate
        hedge accounting for the interest rate swaps entered into as part of our
        commercial paper hedging program from January 1, 2001.

As
      previously disclosed, on April 16, 2004, the New York Department of
      Environmental Conservation (DEC) informed the company that it would be seeking
      $97,800 in penalties for violations of the state of New York’s water and
      hazardous waste laws at its Waterford, New York facility. In July 2004, DEC
      informed the company that it was dropping certain allegations and including
      others pertaining to the reporting of information and increasing its penalty
      demand to $117,000. The matter was settled in October 2006 and the company
      has
      paid a penalty of $90,000.

As
      previously disclosed, in April 2006, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
      (EPA) informed the company that it was contemplating seeking $990,000 in
      penalties for violations of the Clean Air Act at its Mt. Vernon, Indiana
      Plastics facility. EPA has asserted that the company failed to adequately
      control emissions from valves and inlet pipes in an underground piping system.
      We disagree with those assertions and EPA has already modified its position
      to
      reduce the number of potential violations based on conversations with us. The
      company continues to engage in settlement discussions with the Agency over
      both
      the nature and severity of the alleged violations.

As
      previously disclosed, in August 2006, the New Jersey Department of Environmental
      Protections (DEP) issued an Administrative Order seeking a penalty of $142,000
      for violations of the Clean Air Act at GECC’s Linden, New Jersey facility. The
      DEP has alleged that emissions from the facility exceeded thresholds established
      in the site’s permit. GECC has requested a hearing to contest the fine, and DEP
      has offered to settle the matter for 50% of the proposed penalty. GECC is
      continuing to discuss the matter with the state of New Jersey.

                to $25
                billion of Company common stock through 2008. The Program is flexible
                and

                share repurchases under the Program.

(a)
      Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under
      the direction of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we
      evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures as of
      December 31, 2006. We identified the following material weakness in
      our internal control over financial reporting

-

we did not have adequately designed procedures to designate each hedged
      commercial paper transaction with the specificity required by Statement of
      Financial Accounting Standards 133,

Accounting
      for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

,
      as amended. The restatement that resulted from this material weakness is
      discussed in (b) below. Solely as a result of this material weakness, we
      concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as
      of
      December 31, 2006. Other than with respect to the identification of this
      material weakness, there was no change in our internal control over financial
      reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2006, that materially affected,
      or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
      financial reporting.
