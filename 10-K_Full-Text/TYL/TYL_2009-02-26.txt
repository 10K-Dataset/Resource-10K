PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Tyler Technologies, Inc. (“Tyler”) is a major provider of integrated information management
solutions and services for local governments. We partner with clients to make local government
more accessible to the public, more responsive to the needs of citizens and more efficient in its
operations. We have a broad line of software solutions and services to address the information
technology (“IT”) needs of virtually every major area of operation for cities, counties, schools
and other local government entities. Most of our customers have our software installed in-house.
For customers who prefer not to physically acquire the software and hardware, we provide outsourced
hosting for some of our applications at our data centers through an applications service provider
(“ASP”) arrangement through our subscription-based services. We provide professional IT services
to our customers, including software and hardware installation, data conversion, training and, at
times, product modifications. In addition, we are the nation’s largest provider of outsourced
property appraisal services for taxing jurisdictions. We also provide continuing customer support
services to ensure proper product performance and reliability, which provides us with long-term
customer relationships and a significant base of recurring maintenance revenue.

Tyler was founded in 1966. Prior to 1998, we operated as a diversified industrial conglomerate,
with operations in various industrial, retail and distribution businesses, all of which have been
divested. In 1997, we embarked on a multi-phase growth plan focused on serving the specialized
information management needs of local governments nationwide. In 1998 and 1999, we entered the
local government IT market through a series of strategic acquisitions of companies in the local
government IT market.

MARKET OVERVIEW

The state and local government market is one of the largest and most decentralized IT markets in
the country, consisting of all 50 states, approximately 3,000 counties, 36,000 cities and towns and
14,200 school districts. This market is also comprised of approximately 35,000 special districts
and other agencies, each with specialized delegated responsibilities and unique information
management requirements.

Traditionally, local government bodies and agencies performed state-mandated duties, including
property assessment, record keeping, road maintenance, law enforcement, administration of election
and judicial functions, and the provision of welfare assistance. Today, a host of emerging and
urgent issues are confronting local governments, each of which demands a service response. These
areas include criminal justice and corrections, administration and finance, public safety, health
and human services, and public works. Transfers of responsibility from the federal and state
governments to county and municipal governments and agencies in these and other areas also place
additional service and financial requirements on these local government units. In addition,
constituents of local governments are increasingly demanding improved service and better access to
information from public entities. As a result, local governments recognize the increasing value of
information management systems and services to, among other things, improve revenue collection,
provide increased access to information, and streamline delivery of services to their constituents.
Local government bodies are now recognizing that “e-government” is an additional responsibility
for community development. From integrated tax systems to integrated civil and criminal justice
information systems, many counties and cities have benefited significantly from the implementation
of jurisdiction-wide systems that allow different agencies or government offices to share data and
provide a more comprehensive approach to information management. Many city and county governmental
agencies also have unique individual information management requirements, which must be tailored to
the specific functions of each particular office.

Many local governments also have difficulties attracting and retaining the staff necessary to
support their IT functions. As a result, they seek to establish long-term relationships with
reliable providers of high quality IT products and services such as Tyler.

Although local governments generally face budgetary constraints in their operations, their primary
revenue sources are usually property taxes, and to a lesser extent, utility billings, which tend to
be relatively stable. In addition, the acquisition of new technology typically enables local
governments to operate more efficiently, and often provides a measurable return on investment that
justifies the purchase of software and related services.



Gartner estimates that state and local government IT spending will grow from $51.2 billion in 2009
to $59.5 billion in 2012, with local government accounting for $26.1 billion of IT spending in 2009
and $30.3 billion in 2012. The external services and software segments of the market, where our
business is primarily focused, is expected to expand from $13.8 billion in 2009 to $16.9 billion in
2012.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

We provide a comprehensive and flexible suite of products and services that address the information
technology needs of cities, counties, schools and other local government entities. We derive our
revenues from five primary sources:

We design, develop and market a broad range of software solutions to serve mission-critical
“back-office” functions of local governments. Many of our software applications include
Internet-accessible solutions that allow for real-time public access to a variety of information or
that allow the public to transact business with local governments via the Internet. Our software
solutions and services are generally grouped in four major areas:

•

Financial Management and Education;

•

Courts and Justice;

•

Property Appraisal and Tax; and

•

Public Records and Content Management.

Each of our core software systems consists of several fully integrated application modules. For
customers who acquire the software for use in-house, we generally license our systems under
standard perpetual license agreements that provide the customer with a fully paid, nonexclusive,
nontransferable right to use the software. In some of the product areas, such as financial
management and education and property appraisal and tax, we offer multiple solutions designed to
meet the needs of different sized governments.

We also offer certain software solutions on a “software as a service” basis for customers who do
not wish to maintain, update and operate these systems or to make large up-front capital
expenditures to implement these advanced technologies. For these customers, we host the
applications and data at our data centers. Customers typically pay monthly fees under multi-year
contracts for these subscription-based services.

Historically, we have had a greater proportion of our annual revenues in the second half of our
fiscal year due to governmental budget and spending cycles and the timing of system implementations
for customers desiring to “go live” at the beginning of the calendar year.

A description of our suites of products and services follows:

Software Licenses

Financial Management and Education

Our financial management and education solutions are ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems for
local governments, which integrate information across all facets of a client organization. Our
financial management solutions include modular fund accounting systems that can be tailored to meet
the needs of virtually any government agency or not-for-profit entity. Our financial management
systems include modules for general ledger, budget preparation, fixed assets, requisitions,
purchase orders, bid management, accounts payable, contract management, accounts receivable,
investment management, inventory control, project and grant accounting, work orders, job costing,
GASB 34 reporting, payroll and human resources. All of our financial management systems are
intended to conform to government auditing and financial reporting requirements and generally
accepted accounting principles.



We sell utility billing systems that support the billing and collection of metered and non-metered
services, along with multiple billing cycles. Our Web-enabled utility billing solutions allow
customers to access information online such as average consumption and transaction history. In
addition, our systems can accept secured Internet payments via credit cards and checks.

We also offer specialized products that automate numerous city functions, including municipal
courts, parking tickets, equipment and project costing, animal licenses, business licenses, permits
and inspections, code enforcement, citizen complaint tracking, ambulance billing, fleet
maintenance, and cemetery records management.

In addition to providing financial management systems to K-12 schools, in 2006 we began offering a
student information system for K-12 schools, which manages such applications as scheduling, grades
and attendance. We also offer student transportation solutions to manage school bus routing
optimization, fleet management, field trips and other related functions. We also added software
applications to manage public sector pension funds.

Tyler’s financial management and education solutions include Web components that enhance local
governments’ service capabilities by facilitating online access to information for both employees
and citizens and enabling online transactions.

Courts and Justice

We offer a complete, fully integrated suite of judicial solutions with our Odyssey family of
products. Our solutions help eliminate duplicate data entry, promote more effective business
procedures and improve efficiency across the entire justice process. While the Odyssey suite is
designed to handle complex, multi-jurisdictional county or statewide implementations, it is equally
suited to manage single county systems.

Our unified court case management system is designed to automate the tracking and management of
information involved in all case types, including criminal, traffic, civil, family, probate and
juvenile courts. It also tracks the status of cases, processes fines and fees and generates the
specialized judgment and sentencing documents, notices and forms required in the court process.
Documents received by the court can be scanned into the electronic case file and easily retrieved
for viewing. Documents generated by the court can be electronically signed and automatically
attached to the electronic case file. Additional modules automate the management of court
calendars, coordinate judge’s schedules and generate court dockets. Our targeted courtroom
technologies allow courts to rapidly review calendars, cases and view documents in the courtroom.
Courts may also take advantage of our related jury management system.

Our law enforcement systems automate police and sheriff functions from dispatch and records
management through booking and jail management. Searching, reporting and tracking features are
integrated, allowing reliable, up-to-date access to current arrest and incarceration data,
including digital mug shots. Our systems also provide warrant checks for visitors or book-ins,
inmate classification and risk assessment, commissary, property and medical processing, and
automation of statistics and state and federal reporting. Our computer-aided dispatch/emergency 911
system tracks calls and the availability of emergency response vehicles, interfaces with local and
state searches, and assists dispatchers with processing emergency situations. The law enforcement
and jail management systems are fully integrated with the suite of Odyssey prosecution and court
products that manages the entire judicial process.

Our court and law enforcement systems allow the public to access, via the Internet, a variety of
information, including non-confidential criminal and civil court records, jail booking and release
information, bond and bondsmen information, and court calendars and dockets. In addition, our
systems allow cities and counties to accept payments for traffic and parking tickets over the
Internet, with a seamless and automatic interface to back-office justice and financial systems.

Our prosecutor system enables state attorney offices to track and manage criminal cases, including
detailed victim information and private case notes. Investigative reports and charging instrument
documents can be generated and stored for later viewing. Prosecutors can schedule and record the
outcome of grand jury hearings. When integrated with the court system, prosecutors can view the
electronic case file and related documents, as well as manage witness lists and subpoenas needed
for court hearings.

Our supervision system allows pre-trial and probation offices to manage offender caseloads.
Supervision officers can track busy contact schedules, risk/needs assessments and reassessments,
detailed drug test results, employment histories, compliance with conditions and payments of fees
and restitution. Documents and forms, like pre-sentence investigations or revocation orders, can be
generated and stored for easy viewing. When integrated with the jail and court systems, supervision
officers can have easy access and quick notification of offenders that have court hearings
scheduled, are arrested locally and have new warrants issued.



Developed using Microsoft’s .NET

™

framework and tools, Odyssey’s server suite includes
comprehensive support for service-oriented integrations, scheduled and offline job execution,
integrated content management, and role-based security and configuration. Our unique combination of
web-based and traditional smart client applications gives Odyssey a market-leading user experience.
Our multi-tier architecture is built on the Windows Server

®

and SQL Server

®

platforms, and scales to meet the needs of any enterprise environment. Odyssey employs replicated
OLTP/DSS databases and a variety of IP load balancing systems for optimal performance, clustered
installations for maximum fault tolerance, and Terminal Server/Citrix deployment options to
simplify management.

Property Appraisal and Tax

We provide systems and software that automate the appraisal and assessment of real and personal
property, including record keeping, mass appraisal, inquiry and protest tracking, appraisal and tax
roll generation, tax statement processing, and electronic state-level reporting. These systems are
image- and video-enabled to facilitate the storage of and access to the many property-related
documents and for the online storage of digital photographs of properties for use in defending
values in protest situations. Other related tax applications are available for agencies that bill
and collect taxes, including cities, counties, school tax offices, and special taxing and
collection agencies. These systems support billing, collections, lock box operations, mortgage
company electronic payments, and various reporting requirements.

Public Records and Content Management

We offer a number of specialized software applications designed to help county governments enhance
and automate courthouse operations. These systems record, scan and index information for the many
documents maintained at the courthouse, such as deeds, mortgages, liens, UCC financing statements
and vital records (birth, death and marriage certificates). These applications include fully
integrated imaging systems with batch and scan processing capabilities and fully integrated
receipting and cashiering systems as well as Web-enabled public access.

Subscription-Based Services

Subscription-based services revenue primarily consists of revenues derived from application service
provider (“ASP”) arrangements and other hosted service offerings, software subscriptions and
disaster recovery services. Our ASP arrangements and other hosted service offerings, provide
certain software solutions on a “software as a service” basis for customers who do not wish to
maintain, update and operate these systems or to make large up-front capital expenditures to
implement these advanced technologies.

ASP arrangements and other hosting services are typically for a period of three to six years and
automatically renew unless either party cancels the agreement. Other software subscriptions and
disaster recovery service arrangements are typically under annual contracts. The majority of the
ASP and other hosting services and software subscriptions also include professional services and
maintenance and support services. In certain ASP arrangements, the customer also acquires a
license to the software.

Software Services

We provide a variety of professional IT services to customers who utilize our software products.
Virtually all of our customers contract with us for installation, training, and data conversion
services in connection with their purchase of Tyler’s software solutions. The complete
implementation process for a typical system includes planning, design, data conversion, set-up and
testing. At the culmination of the implementation process, an installation team travels to the
customer’s facility to ensure the smooth transfer of data to the new system. Installation fees are
charged separately to customers on either a fixed-fee or hourly charge basis, depending on the
contract, with full pass-through to customers of travel and other out-of-pocket expenses.

Both in connection with the installation of new systems and on an ongoing basis, we provide
extensive training services and programs related to our products and services. Training can be
provided in our training centers, onsite at customers’ locations, or at meetings and conferences,
and can be customized to meet customers’ requirements. The vast majority of our customers contract
with us for training services, both to improve their employees’ proficiency and productivity and to
fully utilize the functionality of our systems. Training services are generally billed on an
hourly basis, along with travel and other expenses.



Maintenance and Support

Following the implementation of our software systems, we provide ongoing software support services
to assist our customers in operating the systems and to periodically update the software. Support
is provided over the phone to customers through help desks staffed by our customer support
representatives. For more complicated issues, our staff, with the customers’ permission, can log
on to customers’ systems remotely. We maintain our customers’ software largely through releases
that contain improvements and incremental additions, along with updates necessary because of
legislative or regulatory changes.

Virtually all of our software customers contract with us for maintenance and support, which
provides us with a significant source of recurring revenue. We generally provide maintenance and
support under annual contracts, with a typical fee based on a percentage of the software product’s
license fee. These fees can be increased annually and may also increase as new license fees
increase. Maintenance and support fees are generally paid in advance for the entire maintenance
contract period. Most maintenance contracts automatically renew unless the customer or Tyler gives
notice of termination prior to expiration. Similar support is provided to our ASP customers, and
is included in their overall monthly fees which are classified as subscription-based revenues.

Appraisal Services

We are the nation’s largest provider of property appraisal outsourcing services for local
government taxing authorities. These services include:

Local government taxing authorities normally reappraise properties from time to time to update
values for tax assessment purposes and to maintain equity in the taxing process. In some
jurisdictions, reassessment cycles are mandated by law; in others, they are discretionary. While
some taxing jurisdictions perform reappraisals in-house, many local governments outsource this
function because of its cyclical nature and because of the specialized knowledge and expertise
requirements associated with it. Our appraisal services business unit has been in this business
since 1938.

In some instances, we also sell property tax and/or appraisal software products in connection with
appraisal outsourcing projects, while other customers may only engage us to provide appraisal
services. Appraisal outsourcing services are somewhat seasonal in nature to the extent that winter
weather conditions reduce the productivity of data collection activities in connection with those
projects.

STRATEGY

Our objective is to grow our revenue and earnings internally, supplemented by focused strategic
acquisitions. The key components of our business strategy are to:

•

Provide high quality, value-added products and services to our clients.

We
compete on the basis of, among other things, delivering to customers our deep domain
expertise in local government operations through the highest value products and services in
the market. We believe we have achieved a reputation as a premium product and service
provider to the local government market.

•

Continue to expand our product and service offerings.

While we already have what
we believe to be the broadest line of software products for local governments, we
continually upgrade our core software applications and expand our complementary product and
service offerings to respond to technological advancements and the changing needs of our
clients. For example, we offer solutions that allow the public to access data and conduct
transactions with local governments, such as paying traffic tickets, property taxes and
utility bills, via the Internet. We believe that the addition of such features enhance the
market appeal of our core products. Since 2001, we have also offered certain of our
software products under an ASP or



o

products and services to complement our existing offerings;

o

entry into new markets related to local governments; and

o

new customers and/or geographic expansion.

•

Establish strategic alliances.

In January 2007 we announced a strategic alliance
with Microsoft Corporation to jointly develop core public sector functionality for Microsoft
Dynamics AX to address the unique accounting needs of public sector organizations worldwide.
As part of this alliance we are enhancing Microsoft Dynamics AX with public sector-specific
functionality. The co-development will broaden the functionality of Microsoft Dynamics AX,
providing both Tyler and Microsoft with a public sector accounting platform to support their
existing and prospective clients well into the future. Microsoft Dynamics AX with public
sector functionality will be sold in the United States and internationally through
Microsoft’s distribution channels and is expected to be released in late 2010. Tyler will
also become an authorized Microsoft reseller for the Microsoft Dynamics solutions developed
under this arrangement, and will sell the solutions directly into the government market.
Tyler will receive license and maintenance royalties on direct and indirect sales of the
solutions co-developed under this multi-year term relationship.

SALES, MARKETING, AND CUSTOMERS

We market our products and services through direct sales and marketing personnel located throughout
the United States. Other in-house sales staff focuses on add-on sales, professional services and
support.



Sales of new systems are typically generated from referrals from other government offices or
departments within a county or municipality, referrals from other local governments, relationships
established between sales representatives and county or local officials, contacts at trade shows,
direct mailings, and direct contact from prospects already familiar with us. We are active in
numerous national, state, county, and local government associations, and participate in annual
meetings, trade shows, and educational events.

Customers consist primarily of county and municipal agencies, school districts and other local
government offices. In counties, customers include the auditor, treasurer, tax assessor/collector,
county clerk, district clerk, county and district court judges, probation officers, sheriff, and
county appraiser. At municipal government sites, customers include directors from various
departments, including administration, finance, utilities, public works, code enforcement,
personnel, purchasing, taxation, municipal court, and police. Contracts for software products and
services are generally implemented over periods of three months to one year, with annually renewing
maintenance and support update agreements thereafter. Although either the customer or we can
terminate these agreements, historically almost all support and maintenance agreements are
automatically renewed annually. Contracts for appraisal outsourcing services are generally one to
three years in duration. During 2008, approximately 41% of our revenue was attributable to ongoing
support and maintenance agreements.

COMPETITION

We compete with numerous local, regional, and national firms that provide or offer some or many of
the same solutions and services that we provide. Most of these competitors are smaller companies
that may be able to offer less expensive solutions than ours. Many of these firms operate within a
specific geographic area and/or in a narrow product or service niche. We also compete with
national firms, some of which have greater financial and technical resources than we do, including
Oracle Corporation, Lawson Software, Inc., SAP AG, Affiliated Computer Services, Inc., SunGard Data
Systems, Inc., New World Systems, Constellation Software, Inc. and Manatron, Inc. In addition, we
sometimes compete with consulting and systems integration firms, such as BearingPoint, Inc., which
develop custom systems, primarily for larger governments. We also occasionally compete with
central internal information service departments of local governments, which require us to persuade
the end-user department to discontinue service by its own personnel and outsource the service to
us. We compete on a variety of factors, including price, service, name recognition, reputation,
technological capabilities, and the ability to modify existing products and services to accommodate
the individual requirements of the customer. Our ability to offer an integrated system of
applications for several offices or departments is often a competitive strength. Local
governmental units often are required to seek competitive proposals through a request for proposal
process.

SUPPLIERS

Substantially all of the computers, peripherals, printers, scanners, operating system software,
office automation software, and other equipment necessary for the implementation and provision of
our software systems and services are presently available from several third-party sources.
Hardware is purchased on original equipment manufacturer or distributor terms at discounts from
retail. We have not experienced any significant supply problems.

BACKLOG

At December 31, 2008, our estimated revenue backlog was approximately $243.4 million, compared to
$250.1 million at December 31, 2007. The backlog represents signed contracts under which the
products have not been delivered or the services have not been performed as of year-end.
Approximately $181.3 million of the backlog is expected to be recognized during 2009.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, AND LICENSES

We regard certain features of our internal operations, software, and documentation as confidential
and proprietary and rely on a combination of contractual restrictions, trade secret laws and other
measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property. We generally do not rely on patents. We
believe that, due to the rapid rate of technological change in the computer software industry,
trade secrets and copyright protection are less significant than factors such as knowledge, ability
and experience of our employees, frequent product enhancements, and timeliness and quality of
support services. We typically license our software products under non-exclusive license agreements
which are generally non-transferable and have a perpetual term.



EMPLOYEES

At December 31, 2008, we had 1,940 employees. Appraisal outsourcing projects are cyclical in
nature and can be widely dispersed geographically. We often hire temporary employees to assist in
these projects whose term of employment generally ends with the project’s completion. None of our
employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We
consider our relations with our employees to be positive.

INTERNET WEBSITE AND AVAILABILITY OF PUBLIC FILINGS

We file annual, quarterly, current and other reports, proxy statements and other information with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act. You may
read and copy any materials we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room by calling the
SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and other
information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including us, that file
electronically with the SEC. The address of this site is

http://www.sec.gov

.

We also maintain an Internet site at

www.tylertech.com

. We make available free of charge through
this site our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Forms 4 and 5, Current
Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a)
or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such
material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. In addition, copies of our annual report will be made
available, free of charge upon written request.

Our “Code of Business Conduct and Ethics” is also available on our Web site. We intend to satisfy
the disclosure requirements regarding amendments to, or waivers from, a provision of our Code of
Business Conduct and Ethics by posting such information on our Web site.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Investors evaluating our company
should carefully consider the factors described below and all other information contained in this
Annual Report. Any of the following factors could materially harm our business, operating results,
and financial condition. Additional factors and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we
currently consider immaterial could also harm our business, operating results, and financial
condition. This section should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and related
Notes and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
included in this Annual Report. We may make forward-looking statements from time to time, both
written and oral. We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any
revisions to these forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those
projected in any such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those set
forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Declining general economic conditions and uncertainties in the global credit crisis and equity
markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.

The financial market crisis has continued to disrupt credit and equity markets worldwide and has
led to continued weakening in the global economic environment during the first quarter of 2009.
Local and state governments may face financial pressures that could in turn affect our growth rate
in 2009. We cannot assure you local and state spending levels will be unaffected by the global
credit crisis and if budget shortfalls occur they may negatively impact local and state information
technology spending and could have a material adverse effect upon our business, operating results,
and financial condition.

A decline in information technology spending may result in a decrease in our revenues or lower our
growth rate.

A decline in the demand for information technology among our current and prospective customers may
result in decreased revenues or a lower growth rate for us because our sales depend, in part, on
our customers’ level of funding for new or additional information technology systems and services.
Moreover, demand for our solutions may be reduced by a decline in overall demand for computer
software and services. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase or
maintain our revenues.



Our products are complex and we run the risk of errors or defects with new product introductions or
enhancements.

Software products as complex as those developed by us may contain errors or defects, especially
when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. Although we have not
experienced material adverse effects resulting from any such defects or errors to date, we cannot
assure you that material defects and errors will not be found after commencement of product
shipments. Any such defects could result in loss of revenues or delay market acceptance.

Our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our
exposure to potential liability claims. It is possible, however, that we may not always be able to
negotiate such provisions in our contracts with customers or that the limitation of liability
provisions contained in our license agreements may not be effective as a result of existing or
future federal, state or local laws, ordinances, or judicial decisions. Although we maintain
errors and omissions and general liability insurance, and we try to structure our contracts to
include limitations on liability, we cannot assure you that a successful claim could not be made or
would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

We may experience fluctuations in quarterly revenue that could adversely impact our stock price and
our operating results.

Our actual revenues in a quarter could fall below expectations, which could lead to a decline in
our stock price. Our revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate
substantially from quarter to quarter. Revenues from license fees in any quarter depend
substantially upon our contracting activity and our ability to recognize revenues in that quarter
in accordance with our revenue recognition policies. Our quarterly revenue may fluctuate and may
be difficult to forecast for a variety of reasons, including the following:

Fluctuation in our quarterly revenues may adversely affect our operating results. In each fiscal
quarter our expense levels, operating costs, and hiring plans are based to some extent on
projections of future revenues and are relatively fixed. If our actual revenues fall below
expectations, we could experience a reduction in operating results.

As with other software vendors, we may be required to delay revenue recognition into future
periods, which could adversely impact our operating results.

We have in the past had to, and in the future may have to, defer revenue recognition for license
fees due to several factors, including whether:

Because of the factors listed above and other specific requirements under generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States for software revenue recognition, we must have very
precise terms in our license agreements in order to recognize revenue when we initially deliver and
install software or perform services. Negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions can
extend the sales
cycle, and sometimes we do not obtain terms and conditions that permit revenue recognition at the
time of delivery or even as work on the project is completed.



Compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in
additional expenses.

Changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure,
including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, new Securities and Exchange Commission regulations and
New York Stock Exchange rules, are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours. The costs
required to comply with such evolving laws are difficult to predict. To maintain high standards of
corporate governance and public disclosure, we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources
to comply with evolving standards. This investment may result in an unforeseen increase in general
and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from
revenue-generating activities, which may harm our business, financial condition, or results of
operations.

Increases in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues could decrease overall margins and
adversely affect our operating results.

We realize lower margins on software and appraisal service revenues than on license revenue. The
majority of our contracts include both software licenses and professional services. Therefore, an
increase in the percentage of software service and appraisal service revenue compared to license
revenue could have a detrimental impact on our overall gross margins and could adversely affect
operating results.

Selling products and services into the public sector poses unique challenges.

We derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of software and services to state, county
and city governments, other municipal agencies, and other public entities. We expect that sales to
public sector customers will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues in the
future. We face many risks and challenges associated with contracting with governmental entities,
including:

Each of these risks is outside our control. If we fail to adequately adapt to these risks and
uncertainties, our financial performance could be adversely affected.

The open bidding process for governmental contracts creates uncertainty in predicting future
contract awards.

Many governmental agencies purchase products and services through an open bidding process.
Generally, a governmental entity will publish an established list of requirements requesting
potential vendors to propose solutions for the established requirements. To respond successfully to
these requests for proposals, we must accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a
proposed contract, the time required to establish operations for the proposed client, and the
likely terms of any other third party proposals submitted. We cannot guarantee that we will win
any bids in the future through the request for proposal process, or that any winning bids will
ultimately result in contracts on favorable terms. Our failure to secure contracts through the
open bidding process, or to secure such contracts on favorable terms, may adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.



Fixed- price contracts may affect our profits.

Some of our present contracts are on a fixed-priced basis, which can lead to various risks,
including:

•

the failure to accurately estimate the resources and time required for an engagement;

•

the failure to effectively manage governmental agencies’ and other customers’
expectations regarding the scope of services to be delivered for an estimated price; and

•

the failure to timely complete fixed-price engagements within budget to the customers’
satisfaction.

If we do not adequately assess these and other risks, we may be subject to cost overruns and
penalties, which may harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

We face significant competition from other vendors and potential new entrants into our markets.

We believe we are a leading provider of integrated solutions for the public sector. However, we
face competition from a variety of software vendors that offer products and services similar to
those offered by us, as well as from companies offering to develop custom software. We compete on
the basis of a number of factors, including:

We believe the market is highly fragmented with a large number of competitors that vary in size,
primary computer platforms, and overall product scope. Our competitors include consulting firms,
publicly held companies that focus on selected segments of the public sector market, and a
significant number of smaller, privately held companies. Certain competitors have greater
technical, marketing, and financial resources than we do. We cannot assure you that such
competitors will not develop products or offer services that are superior to our products or
services or that achieve greater market acceptance.

We also compete with internal, centralized information service departments of governmental
entities, which require us to persuade the end-user to stop the internal service and outsource to
us. In addition, our customers may elect in the future to provide information management services
internally through new or existing departments, which could reduce the market for our services.

We could face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the public
sector software application market and new products and technologies are introduced. Increased
competition could result in pricing pressure, fewer customer orders, reduced gross margins, and
loss of market share. In addition, current and potential competitors may make strategic
acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third-parties, thereby
increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers. It is
possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly
gain significant market share. Further, competitive pressures could require us to reduce the price
of our software licenses and related services. We cannot assure you that we will be able to
compete successfully against current and future competitors, and the failure to do so would have
material adverse effect upon our business, operating results, and financial condition.

We must respond to rapid technological changes to be competitive.

The market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry
standards in computer hardware and software technology, changes in customer requirements, and
frequent new product introductions and enhancements. The introduction of products embodying new
technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and
unmarketable. As a result, our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to continue
to enhance existing products and develop and introduce in a timely manner or acquire new products
that keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer
requirements, and achieve market acceptance. We cannot assure you that we will successfully



identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and
cost-effective manner. Further, we cannot assure you that the products, capabilities, or
technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or
noncompetitive. If we are unable to develop or acquire on a timely and cost-effective basis new
software products or enhancements to existing products, or if such new products or enhancements do
not achieve market acceptance, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be
materially adversely affected.

Our failure to properly manage growth could adversely affect our business.

We have expanded our operations since February 1998, when we entered the business of providing
software solutions and services to the public sector. We intend to continue expansion in the
foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities. This growth places a
significant demand on management and operational resources. In order to manage growth effectively,
we must implement and improve our operational systems, procedures, and controls on a timely basis.
We must also identify, hire, train, and manage key managerial and technical personnel. If we fail
to implement these systems or employ and retain such qualified personnel, our business, financial
condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.

We may be unable to hire, integrate, and retain qualified personnel.

Our continued success will depend upon the availability and performance of our key management,
sales, marketing, customer support, and product development personnel. The loss of key management
or technical personnel could adversely affect us. We believe that our continued success will
depend in large part upon our ability to attract, integrate, and retain such personnel. We have at
times experienced and continue to experience difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel.
Competition for qualified software development, sales, and other personnel is intense, and we
cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel.

We may experience difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy.

In addition, a significant portion of our growth has resulted from strategic acquisitions in new
product and geographic markets. Although our future focus will be on internal growth, we will
continue to identify and pursue strategic acquisitions and alliances with suitable candidates. Our
future success will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully integrate future acquisitions
and other strategic alliances into our operations. Acquisitions may involve a number of special
risks, including diversion of management’s attention, failure to retain key acquired personnel,
unanticipated events or circumstances, legal liabilities, and amortization of certain acquired
intangible assets. Some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, and results of operations. Although we conduct due diligence
reviews of potential acquisition candidates, we may not identify all material liabilities or risks
related to acquisition candidates. There can be no assurance that any such strategic acquisitions
or alliances will be accomplished on favorable terms or will result in profitable operations.

We may be unable to protect our proprietary rights.

Many of our product and service offerings incorporate proprietary information, trade secrets,
know-how, and other intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of contracts,
copyrights, and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our
technology. We cannot be certain that we have taken all appropriate steps to deter
misappropriation of our intellectual property. In addition, there has been significant litigation
in the United States in recent years involving intellectual property rights. We are not currently
involved in any material intellectual property litigation. We may, however, be a party to
intellectual property litigation in the future to protect our proprietary information, trade
secrets, know-how, and other intellectual property rights. Further, we cannot assure you that
third parties will not assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us in the future with
respect to current or future products. Any claims or litigation, with or without merit, could be
time-consuming and result in costly litigation and diversion of management’s attention. Further,
any claims and litigation could cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty
or licensing arrangements. Such royalty or licensing arrangements, if required, may not be
available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Thus, litigation to defend and enforce our
intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, and results of operations, regardless of the final outcome of such litigation.



Changes in the insurance markets may affect our ability to win some contract awards and may lead to
increased expenses.

Some of our customers, primarily those for our property appraisal services, require that we secure
performance bonds before they will select us as their vendor. The number of qualified, high-rated
insurance companies that offer performance bonds has decreased in recent years, while the costs
associated with securing these bonds has increased dramatically. In addition, we are generally
required to issue a letter of credit as security for the issuance of a performance bond. We
periodically enter into long-term borrowing agreements and each letter of credit we issue without
corresponding cash collateral may reduce our borrowing capacity under the borrowing agreement. We
cannot guarantee that we will be able to secure such performance bonds in the future on terms that
are favorable to us, if at all. Our inability to obtain performance bonds on favorable terms or at
all could impact our future ability to win some contract awards, particularly large property
appraisal services contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

Recent volatility in the stock markets, increasing shareholder litigation, the adoption of
expansive legislation that redefines corporate controls (in particular, legislation adopted to
prevent future corporate and accounting scandals), as well as other factors have recently led to
significant increases in premiums for directors’ and officers’ liability insurance. The number of
insurers offering directors and officers insurance at competitive rates has also decreased in
recent years. Volatility of the insurance market may result in future increases in our general and
administrative expenses, which may adversely affect future operating results.

Our stock price may be volatile.

The market price of our common stock may be volatile and may be significantly affected by many
different factors. Some examples of factors that can have a significant impact on our stock price
include:

In addition, the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume
fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for the common stock of technology
companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common
stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company’s
securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. We
cannot assure you that similar litigation will not occur in the future with respect to us. Such
litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and
resources, which could have a material adverse effect upon our business, operating results, and
financial condition.

Historically, we have not paid dividends on our common stock.

We have not declared or paid a cash dividend since we entered the business of providing software
solutions and services to the public sector in February 1998. Additionally, our bank credit
agreement contains restrictions on the payment of cash dividends. We intend to retain earnings for
use in the operation and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends
on our common stock in the foreseeable future.

Provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, and Delaware law could deter takeover
attempts.

Our board of directors may issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock and may determine the
price, rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions, including voting and conversion rights,
of these shares of preferred stock. These determinations may be made without any further vote or
action by our stockholders. The rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to, and
may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued
in the future. The issuance of preferred stock may make it more difficult for a third party to
acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. In addition, some provisions of our
Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, and of the Delaware General Corporation Law could also delay,
prevent, or make more difficult a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest involving us.



Financial Outlook.

From time to time in press releases and otherwise, we may publish forecasts or other
forward-looking statements regarding our results, including estimated revenues or net earnings.
Any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions. These assumptions are subject
to significant uncertainties, and as a matter of course, any number of them may prove to be
incorrect. Further, the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors
(including those described in this discussion), many of which are beyond our control. As a result,
we cannot be certain that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that
the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse. Current and potential
stockholders are cautioned not to base their entire analysis of our business and prospects upon
isolated predictions, but instead are encouraged to utilize our entire publicly available mix of
historical and forward-looking information, as well as other available information regarding us,
our products and services, and the software industry when evaluating our prospective results of
operations.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.

Not applicable.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

We occupy a total of approximately 441,000 square feet of office space, 127,000 square feet of
which we own. One of the office buildings we own (approximately 84,000 square feet) has been
leased to third-party tenants. The lease agreements with respect to approximately 70% of this
leased space expire in July 2011 and the remaining agreement expires in June 2013. Upon expiration
of these agreements we expect to begin occupying the facility. We lease our principal executive
office located in Dallas, Texas, as well as other offices for our operations in Colorado, Iowa,
Maine, Ohio, Texas and Washington.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

On November 3, 2008, a putative collective action complaint was filed against us in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas on behalf of current and former “customer
support analysts,” “client liaisons,” “engineers,” “trainers,” and “education services
specialists.” The petition alleges that we misclassified these groups of employees as “exempt”
rather than “non-exempt” under the Fair Labor Standards Act; therefore, the petition alleges that
we failed to properly pay overtime wages. The suit was initiated by six former employees working
out of our Longview, Texas, office and seeks to recover damages in the form of lost overtime pay
since October 31, 2005, liquidated damages equal to the amount of lost overtime pay, interest,
costs, and attorneys’ fees. We intend to vigorously defend the action. Given the preliminary
nature of the alleged claims and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, we cannot at this
time estimate the possible outcome of any such action.

On June 27, 2008, we settled outstanding litigation related to two Stock Purchase Warrants (the
“Warrants”) owned by Bank of America, N. A. (“BANA”). As disclosed in prior SEC filings, the
Warrants entitled BANA to acquire 1.6 million shares of Tyler common stock at an exercise price of
$2.50 per share. The Warrants expired on September 10, 2007. Prior to their expiration, BANA
attempted to exercise the Warrants; however, the parties disputed whether or not BANA’s exercise
was effective. We filed suit for declaratory judgment seeking a court’s determination on the
matter, and BANA asserted numerous counterclaims against us, including breach of contract and
misrepresentation.

Following court-ordered mediation, in July 2008, BANA paid us $2.0 million and we issued to BANA
801,883 restricted shares of Tyler common stock. Accordingly, as a result of the settlement, we
recorded a non-cash legal settlement related to warrants charge of $9.0 million, which is not tax
deductible in 2008.

Other than ordinary course, routine litigation incidental to our business and except as described
in this Annual Report, there are no material legal proceedings pending to which we are party or to
which any of our properties are subject.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF
EQUITY SECURITIES.

Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “TYL.” At December 31,
2008, we had approximately 2,140 stockholders of record. A number of our stockholders hold their
shares in street name; therefore, there are substantially more than 2,140 beneficial owners of our
common stock.

The following table shows, for the calendar periods indicated, the high and low sales price per

We did not pay any cash dividends in 2008 or 2007. Our bank credit agreement contains
restrictions on the payment of cash dividends. We intend to retain earnings for use in the
operation and expansion of our business, and, therefore, we do not anticipate declaring a cash
dividend in the foreseeable future.

October 2008. Our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 2.0 million shares
on both May 15, 2008 and October 23, 2008. As of December 31, 2008, we had remaining authorization
to repurchase up to 1.5 million additional shares of our common stock. There is no expiration date
specified for the authorization and we intend to repurchase stock under the plan from time to time.
Our bank credit agreement contains restrictions on the amount of common stock we may purchase.

OVERVIEW

General

We provide integrated information management solutions and services for local governments. We
develop and market a broad line of software products and services to address the information
technology (“IT”) needs of cities, counties, schools and other local government entities. In
addition, we provide professional IT services to our customers, including software and hardware
installation, data conversion, training and for certain customers, product modifications, along
with continuing maintenance and support for customers using our systems. We also provide
subscription-based services such as application service provider arrangements and other hosting
services as well as property appraisal outsourcing services for taxing jurisdictions.

Our products are generally grouped into four major areas:

•

Financial Management and Education;

•

Courts and Justice;

•

Property Appraisal and Tax; and

•

Public Records and Content Management.

We monitor and analyze several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and
evaluate our financial and operating performance. These indicators include the following:

•

Revenues — We derive our revenues from five primary sources: sale of software licenses;
subscription-based services; software services; appraisal services; and maintenance and
support. Because the majority of the software we sell is “off-the-shelf,” increased sales
of software products generally result in incrementally higher gross margins. Thus, the
most significant driver to our business is the number and size of software license sales.
In addition, new software license sales generally generate implementation services revenues
as well as future maintenance and support revenues, which we view as a recurring revenue
source. We also monitor our customer base and churn since our maintenance and support
revenue should increase due to our historically low customer turnover.

•

Cost of Revenues and Gross Margins — Our primary cost component is personnel expenses in
connection with providing software implementation, subscription-based services, maintenance and
support, and appraisal services to our customers. We can improve gross margins by controlling
headcount and related costs and by expanding our revenue base, especially from those products and
services that produce incremental revenue with minimal incremental cost, such as software licenses,
subscription-based services, and maintenance and support. Our appraisal projects are seasonal in
nature, and we often employ appraisal personnel on a short-term basis to coincide with the life of
a project. As of December 31, 2008, our total full-time equivalent employee count increased to
1,940 from 1,627 at December 31, 2007. The majority of these additions were to our implementation
and support staff, including additions to our capacity to deliver our backlog. Our implementation



and support staff at December 31, 2008 includes 102 full-time equivalent employees added as
a result of three acquisitions completed in 2008.

•

Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Expenses — The primary components of SG&A
expense are administrative and sales personnel salaries and commissions, marketing expense,
rent and professional fees. Sales commissions generally fluctuate with revenues but other
administrative expenses tend to grow at a slower rate than revenues.

•

Liquidity and Cash Flows — The primary driver of our cash flows is net income. Uses of
cash include acquisitions, capital investments in property and equipment and software
development and the discretionary purchases of treasury stock. In 2008, we purchased 4.3
million shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of $59.0 million. Almost
half of our treasury stock purchases occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008. During 2008
we also used cash of $23.9 million to acquire three companies and invested $20.1 million in
property and equipment. Our investment in property and equipment included $16.0 million
for land, office buildings and a related tenant lease. Our working capital needs are
fairly stable throughout the year with the significant components of cash outflows being
payment of personnel expenses offset by cash inflows representing collection of accounts
receivable and cash receipts from customers in advance of revenue being earned.

•

Balance Sheet — Cash, accounts receivable and days sales outstanding and deferred
revenue balances are important indicators of our business.

Acquisitions

We completed the acquisitions of School Information Systems, Inc., VersaTrans Solutions Inc. and
certain assets of Olympia Computing Company, Inc. d/b/a Schoolmaster to expand our presence in the
education market. The combined purchase price, excluding cash acquired and including transaction
costs, was approximately $23.9 million in cash and approximately 196,000 shares of Tyler common
stock valued at $2.9 million. In connection with these transactions we acquired total tangible
assets of approximately $3.5 million and assumed total liabilities of approximately $8.2 million.

Outlook

The financial market crisis has continued to disrupt credit and equity markets worldwide and has
led to continued weakening in the global economic environment during the first quarter of 2009.
Local and state governments may face financial pressures that could in turn affect our growth rate
in the first quarter of 2009 and for the calendar year. Consistent with our historical trends, we
expect that first quarter 2009 earnings will not reach the level achieved in the fourth quarter of
2008; however, we currently do not anticipate a material negative impact for the 2009 first quarter
due to the current economic downturn.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires us
to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues, cost of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The
Notes to the Financial Statements included as part of this Annual Report describe our significant
accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements. Significant items subject
to such estimates and assumptions include the application of the percentage-of-completion and
proportionate performance methods of revenue recognition, the carrying amount and estimated useful
lives of intangible assets, determination of share-based compensation expense and valuation
allowance for receivables. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect significant judgments and estimates
used in the preparation of our financial statements.

Revenue Recognition

. We recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of Statement of
Position (“SOP”) 97-2, “Software Revenue Recognition,” as amended by SOP 98-4 and SOP 98-9, as well
as Technical Practice Aids issued from time to time by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, and in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 104 “Revenue Recognition.” We recognize revenue on our appraisal services contracts
using the proportionate performance method of accounting, with considerations for the provisions of
Emerging Issue Task Force (“EITF”) No. 00-21, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.”
Our revenues are derived from sales of software licenses, subscription-



based services, appraisal services, maintenance and support, and services that typically range from
installation, training and basic consulting to software modification and customization to meet
specific customer needs. For multiple element software arrangements, which do not entail the
performance of services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software, we
generally record revenue when the delivered products or performed services result in a legally
enforceable and non-refundable claim. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and sales
adjustments, which are provided at the time the revenue is recognized. Because most of our
customers are governmental entities, we rarely incur a loss resulting from the inability of a
customer to make required payments. In a limited number of cases, we encounter a customer who is
dissatisfied with some aspect of the software product or our service, and we may offer a
“concession” to such customer. In those limited situations where we grant a concession, we rarely
reduce the contract arrangement fee, but alternatively may perform additional services, such as
additional training or programming a minor feature the customer had in their prior software
solution. These amounts have historically been considered nominal. In connection with our
customer contracts and the adequacy of related allowances and measures of progress towards contract
completion, our project managers are charged with the responsibility to continually review the
status of each customer on a specific contract basis. Also, we review, on at least a quarterly
basis, significant past due accounts receivable and the adequacy of related reserves. Events or
changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount for the allowances for doubtful
accounts and sales adjustments may require revision, include, but are not limited to, deterioration
of a customer’s financial condition, failure to manage our customer’s expectations regarding the
scope of the services to be delivered, and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our
software products.

For those software arrangements that involve significant production, modification or customization
of the software, which is considered essential to its functionality, and for substantially all
property appraisal outsourcing projects, we recognize revenue and profit as the work progresses
using the percentage-of-completion method and the proportionate performance method of revenue
recognition. These methods rely on estimates of total expected contract revenue, billings and
collections and expected contract costs, as well as measures of progress toward completion. We
believe reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and costs and progress applicable to various
stages of a contract can be made. At times, we perform additional and/or non-contractual services
for little to no incremental fee to satisfy customer expectations. If changes occur in delivery,
productivity or other factors used in developing our estimates of expected costs or revenues, we
revise our cost and revenue estimates, and any revisions are charged to income in the period in
which the facts that give rise to that revision first become known.

We use contract accounting, primarily the percentage-of-completion method, and apply the provisions
of SOP No. 81-1 “Accounting for Performance of Construction — Type and Certain Production — Type
Contracts” for those software arrangements that involve significant production, modification or
customization of the software, or where our software services are otherwise considered essential to
the functionality of the software. In addition, we recognize revenue using the proportionate
performance method of revenue recognition for our property appraisal projects, some of which can
range up to three years. In connection with these and certain other contracts, we may perform the
work prior to when the services are billable and/or payable pursuant to the contract. The
termination clauses in most of our contracts provide for the payment for the fair value of products
delivered and services performed in the event of an early termination.

For subscription-based services such as application service provider arrangements and other hosting
arrangements, we evaluate whether each of the elements in these arrangements represents a separate
unit of accounting, as defined by EITF 00-21, using all applicable facts and circumstances,
including whether (i) we sell or could readily sell the element unaccompanied by the other
elements, (ii) the element has stand-alone value to the customer, (iii) there is objective reliable
evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item, and (iv) there is a general right of return.
We consider the applicability of EITF No. 00-03, “Application of SOP 97-2 to Arrangements That
Include the Right to Use Software Stored on Another Entity’s Hardware” on a contract-by-contract
basis. In hosted term-based agreements, where the customer does not have the contractual right to
take possession of the software, hosting fees are recognized on a monthly basis over the term of
the contract commencing when the customer has access to the software. For professional services
associated with hosting arrangements that we determine do not have stand-alone value to the
customer, we recognize the services revenue ratably over the remaining contractual period once
hosting has gone live and we may begin billing for the hosting services. We record amounts that
have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenues, depending on whether
the revenue recognition criteria have been met.

In connection with certain of our contracts, we have recorded retentions receivable or unbilled
receivables consisting of costs and estimated profit in excess of billings as of the balance sheet
date. Many of the contracts which give rise to unbilled receivables at a given balance sheet date
are subject to billings in the subsequent accounting period. Management reviews unbilled
receivables and related contract provisions to ensure we are justified in recognizing revenue prior
to billing the customer and that we have objective evidence which allows us to recognize such
revenue. In addition, we have a sizable amount of deferred revenue which represents billings in
excess of revenue earned. The majority of this liability consists of maintenance billings for
which payments are made in



advance and the revenue is ratably earned over the maintenance period, generally one year. We also
have deferred revenue for those contracts in which we receive a deposit and the conditions in which
to record revenue for the service or product has not been met. On a periodic basis, we review by
customer the detail components of our deferred revenue to ensure our accounting remains
appropriate.

Intangible Assets and Goodwill

. Our business acquisitions typically result in the creation of
goodwill and other intangible asset balances, and these balances affect the amount and timing of
future period amortization expense, as well as expense we could possibly incur as a result of an
impairment charge. The cost of acquired companies is allocated to identifiable tangible and
intangible assets based on estimated fair value, with the excess allocated to goodwill.
Accordingly, we have a significant balance of acquisition date intangible assets, including
software, customer related intangibles, trade name and goodwill. In addition, we capitalize
software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility.
These intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. All intangible assets
with definite and indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.

Recoverability of goodwill is generally measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset
to its fair value, generally determined by estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated
by the asset. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of April, or more frequently if
impairment indicators arise. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying
amount exceeds the asset’s fair value. The fair values calculated in our impairment tests are
determined using discounted cash flow models involving several assumptions. These assumptions
include, but are not limited to, anticipated operating income growth rates, our long-term
anticipated operating income growth rate and the discount rate. The assumptions that are used are
based upon what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair
value. We have identified two reporting units for impairment testing. The appraisal services and
appraisal software stand-alone business unit qualified as a reporting unit since it is one level
below an operating segment, discrete financial information exists for the business unit and the
executive management group directly reviews this business unit. The other software business units
were aggregated into the other single reporting unit. The appraisal services and appraisal
software stand-alone business unit is organized in such a manner that both of its revenue sources
are tightly integrated with each other and discrete financial information at the operating profit
level does not exist for this business unit’s respective revenue sources. Recoverability of other
intangible assets is generally measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated
undiscounted future cash flows.

The assessment of recoverability or of the estimated useful life for amortization purposes will be
affected if the timing or the amount of estimated future operating cash flows is not achieved.
Events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable
include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the market value of the business or
asset acquired, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the business or asset
acquired is used, or a significant adverse change in the business climate. In addition, products,
capabilities, or technologies developed by others may render our software products obsolete or
non-competitive.

Share-Based Compensation.

We have a stock option plan that provides for the grant of stock options
to key employees, directors and non-employee consultants. We estimate the fair value of
share-based awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model.
Share-based compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures, which will be
adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ, or are expected
to differ from such estimates. Changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of
change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods. Forfeiture
rate assumptions are derived from historical data. We estimate stock price volatility at the date
of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock. Estimated option life is
determined using the “simplified method” in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110.
Determining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the fair value of share-based awards
at the grant date requires considerable judgment, including estimating stock price volatility,
expected option life and forfeiture rates.

In 2008 we signed 72 material new contracts with average software license fees of approximately
$311,000, compared to 86 material new contracts signed in 2007 with average software license fees
of approximately $434,000. We consider contracts with a license fee component of $100,000 or
more to be material. Average software license fees in 2007 included the impact of one courts and
justice statewide contract that contained an unusually large amount of software license fees.
Although a contract is signed in a particular year, the year in which the revenue is recognized
may be different because we recognize revenue according to our revenue recognition policy as
described in Note 1 in the Notes to Financial Statements.

Changes in software license revenues consist of the following components:

•

Software license revenue related to our financial management and education solutions for
2008 increased 9% compared to the prior year. Revenue from student information management
solutions as well as student transportation management solutions acquired in the last twelve
months contributed substantially to the increase. The remaining increase was mainly due to
contract arrangements that included more software license revenue than in the past.

•

Software license revenue related to our courts and justice software solutions increased
69% for 2008 compared to the prior year. New statewide contracts in Indiana and New Mexico
contributed approximately two-thirds of the increase. The remaining increase was primarily due to an expanded presence in the markets for municipal
courts software solutions and public safety software solutions.

Subscriptions.

Subscription-based services revenue primarily consists of revenues derived from
ASP arrangements and other hosted service offerings, software subscriptions and disaster recovery
services. ASP and other software subscriptions agreements are typically for periods of three to
six years and automatically renew unless either party cancels the agreement. Disaster recovery



and miscellaneous other hosted service agreements are typically renewable annually. New ASP
customers and existing customers converting to ASP arrangements provided the majority of the
subscription revenue increase with the remaining increase due to new disaster recovery customers
and slightly higher rates for disaster recovery services.

Software services

. Changes in software services revenues consist of the following components:

•

Software services revenue related to financial management and education solutions, which
comprises approximately half of our software services revenue in the years presented,
increased substantially compared to 2007. This increase was driven in part by increased
capacity to deliver backlog following additions to our implementation and support staff
since 2007 and due to larger and more complex contracts, which include more programming and
project management services. In addition, we acquired a student transportation management
solution in January 2008 which contributed approximately $3.9 million to software service
revenues in 2008. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, we have added approximately 95
full-time equivalent employees to our financial management and education implementation and
training staff since 2007.

•

Software services revenue related to our courts and justice solutions experienced strong
increases compared to 2007, reflecting increased capacity to deliver backlog following
additions to our implementation and support staff since mid-2007. In addition, increased
contract volume for municipal courts software solutions and public safety software
solutions also generated higher related services revenue. We have added approximately 12
full-time equivalent employees to our courts and justice implementation and training staff
since 2007.

Maintenance

. We provide maintenance and support services for our software products and third
party software. Maintenance revenues increased 26% in 2008 compared to 2007. Maintenance
and support services grew 16% in 2008, excluding the impact of acquisitions completed in the
prior twelve months. This increase was due to growth in our installed customer base and
slightly higher maintenance rates on most of our product lines.

Appraisal services

. Appraisal services revenue declined 10% in 2008 compared to 2007. The
appraisal services business is driven in part by revaluation cycles in various states. In
late 2007, we substantially completed several projects related to the Ohio revaluation
cycle, which occurs every six years, as well as a few other large contracts. Appraisal
revenues for the first six months of 2008 were down 23% compared to the first six months of
2007. In mid-2008 we began a complete reappraisal of real property in Orleans Parish,
Louisiana. This contract is valued at approximately $12.0 million and consists of two
separate phases expected to be complete by late 2010. As a result of this contract and an
overall increase in contract volume, appraisal revenues for the last six months of 2008
increased 4% over the last six months of 2007. In 2009, we expect appraisal revenue to
increase over 2008 by a modest amount.

Software license

. Approximately one-half of our cost of software license revenues is amortization
expense for capitalized development costs on certain software products, with third party
software costs making up the balance. Once a product is released, we begin to amortize, over
the estimated useful life of the product, any capitalized costs associated with its
development. Amortization expense is determined on a product-by-product basis at an annual
rate not less than straight-line basis over the product’s estimated life, which is generally
five years. Development costs consist mainly of personnel costs, such as salary and benefits
paid to our developers, and rent for related office space.

In 2008, our software license gross margin percentage rose compared to the prior year mainly due
to strong license fee revenue increases. Because approximately one-half of our cost of
software license revenues is comprised of amortization of capitalized development costs,
increased license fee revenues inherently result in higher gross margins.

Software services, maintenance and subscription-based services

. Cost of software services,
maintenance and subscriptions primarily consists of personnel costs related to installation of
our software, conversion of customer data, training customer personnel and support activities
and various other services such as ASP and disaster recovery. In 2008, the software services,
maintenance and subscriptions gross margin increased compared to the prior year partly because
maintenance and various other services such as ASP and disaster recovery costs typically grow
at a slower rate than related revenues due to leverage in the utilization of our support and
maintenance staff and economies of scale. We have increased our implementation and support
staff by 215 full-time equivalent employees since 2007 in order to expand our capacity to
implement our contract backlog. This increase includes 102 full-time equivalent employees
related to acquisitions completed since 2007.

Appraisal services

. A high proportion of the costs of appraisal services revenue are variable, as
we often hire temporary employees to assist in appraisal projects whose term of employment
generally ends with the projects’ completion. Our appraisal gross margin for 2008 is higher than
the prior year due to cost savings associated with a significant complex reappraisal project.



Our blended gross margin in 2008 was higher than the prior year in large part due to leverage in
the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale, with resulting
increases in gross margin for each revenue category.

Research and development expense mainly consist of costs associated with the Microsoft Dynamics AX
project, in addition to costs associated with other new product development efforts. In January
2007, we entered into a strategic alliance with Microsoft Corporation to jointly develop core
public sector functionality for Microsoft Dynamics AX to address the accounting needs of public
sector organizations worldwide. Research and development costs increased over the prior year
because the Microsoft Dynamics AX development effort was not fully staffed until mid-2007. In 2008
and 2007, we offset our research and development expense by $1.8 million and $1.6 million,
respectively, which were the amounts earned under the terms of our research and development
agreement with Microsoft. We amended this agreement in September 2008 to define the scope of
reimbursable development through the balance of the project and now expect to offset research and
development expense by approximately $850,000 each quarter through the end of 2010. The actual
amount and timing of future research and development costs and related reimbursements and whether
they are capitalized or expensed may vary.

Non-Cash Legal Settlement Related to Warrants

On June 27, 2008, we settled outstanding litigation related to the Warrants owned by BANA. As
disclosed in prior SEC filings, the Warrants entitled BANA to acquire 1.6 million shares of Tyler
common stock at an exercise price of $2.50 per share. Following court-ordered mediation, in July
2008, BANA paid us $2.0 million and we issued to BANA 801,883 restricted shares of Tyler common
stock. Accordingly, we recorded a non-cash legal settlement related to warrants charge of $9.0
million, which is not tax deductible.



Amortization of Customer and Trade Name Intangibles

Acquisition intangibles are comprised of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of
net tangible assets acquired that is allocated to acquired software and customer and trade name
intangibles. The remaining excess purchase price is allocated to goodwill that is not subject to
amortization. Amortization expense related to acquired software is included with cost of revenues,
while amortization expense of customer and trade name intangibles is recorded as a non-operating
expense. The estimated useful lives of both customer and trade name intangibles are 5 to 25 years.

Interest income was the main component of other income in both 2008 and 2007. Other income in 2008
also includes non-usage and other fees associated with a credit agreement entered into in October
2008. Interest income in 2008 was $1.1 million compared to $1.8 million in 2007. Interest income
declined due to lower invested cash balances and slightly lower interest rates. Our invested cash
balances declined due to increased purchases of treasury stock and investments in office buildings
and land in 2008.

Our effective income tax rate increased approximately twelve points compared to the prior year due
to a non-cash legal settlement related to warrants charge of $9.0 million, which was not
deductible. The effective income tax rates were different from the statutory United States federal
income tax rate of 35% primarily due to non-cash legal settlement related to warrants charge which
was not deductible, as well as state income taxes, non-deductible share-based compensation expense,
the qualified manufacturing activities deduction, and non-deductible meals and entertainment costs.

Slightly less than half of our stock option awards qualify as an incentive stock option (“ISO”) for
income tax purposes. As such, a tax benefit is not recorded at the time the compensation cost
related to the options is recorded for book purposes due to the fact that an ISO does not
ordinarily result in a tax benefit unless there is a disqualifying disposition. Non-qualified
stock options result in the creation of a deferred tax asset, which is a temporary difference,
until the time that the option is exercised. Due to the treatment of ISOs for tax purposes,
our effective tax rate from year to year is subject to variability.

Changes in software license revenues consist of the following components:

•

Software license revenue related to our financial management and education solutions for
2007 decreased 8% compared to the prior year. Over half the decline was due to product mix
in 2007 that required less third party software. A portion of the remaining decline was
mainly due to a number of customers in 2007 choosing our subscription-based options, rather
than purchasing the software under a traditional perpetual software license arrangement.
Although these customers represented a relatively small percentage of new customers, the
size of those contracts was larger than in the prior year. Subscription-based arrangements
result in lower software license revenues in the initial year as compared to traditional
perpetual software license arrangement but generate higher overall subscription-based
services revenue over the term of the contract.

•

Software license revenue related to our courts and justice software solutions increased
26% for 2007 compared to the prior year. In the fourth quarter of 2007 we recorded software
license revenue of approximately $1.3 million from a contract which had been deferred in
accordance with the terms of the contract.

•

Appraisal and tax and other software license declined 21% in 2007 compared to the prior
year primarily due to the deferral of software license revenue on a customer arrangement
pending establishment of a revised timeline for the completion of certain development and
implementation services.

Subscriptions.

In 2007, new ASP customers provided approximately two-thirds of the subscription
revenue increase due to further expansion into existing markets and new markets such as
Pennsylvania and Texas.



Software services

. Changes in software services revenues consist of the following components:

•

Software services revenue related to financial management and education solutions, which
comprises approximately half of our software services revenue in the years presented,
experienced modest increases in 2007 compared to the prior year due to increased contract
volume and additions to implementation and training staff which enabled us to deliver our
backlog at a faster rate. Excluding the impact of acquisitions we added approximately 40
people to our financial management and education implementation and training staff during
2007.

•

Software services revenue related to our courts and justice solutions experienced
substantial increases in 2007 compared to the prior year, reflecting increased contract
volume. We had approximately 34 active Odyssey contracts in 2007 compared to approximately
25 active Odyssey contracts in 2006, primarily due to continued expansion in Texas and
Florida and a new contract with Indiana. We added approximately 50 people to our courts
and justice implementation and training staff during 2007.

•

Software services revenue related to appraisal and tax and other solutions, which
comprise approximately 25% of our software services revenue in the periods presented, had
moderate increases for 2007 compared to 2006. The majority of the increase is related to
one large appraisal and tax software implementation, which was substantially completed by
December 31, 2007.

Maintenance

. Maintenance revenues increased over the prior year due to growth in our installed
customer base and slightly higher maintenance rates on most of our solutions.

Appraisal services

. Appraisal services revenue for 2007 was 8% higher than 2006. The increase
was due to activity related to Ohio’s revaluation cycle, which occurs every six years, and a
$4.0 million contract with Fulton County, Georgia, which began late in 2006. The Ohio
revaluation projects began with smaller counties late in the first quarter of 2006 and
expanded to larger counties by the third quarter of 2006. A substantial portion of the Ohio
revaluation projects was complete by December 31, 2007.

Software license

. In 2007, our software license gross margin percentage increased slightly
compared to the prior year because our product mix in 2007 included less third party software,
which has higher associated costs than proprietary software. The gross margin also benefited
from lower amortization expense of software development costs because some products became
fully amortized during the first quarter of 2006.

Software services, maintenance and subscription-based services

. In 2007, the software services,
maintenance and subscription gross margin percentage increased 1.6% over the prior year
because maintenance and various other services such as ASP and disaster recovery costs
typically grow at a slower rate than related revenues due to leverage in the utilization of
our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale. We increased our implementation and
support staff by 162 full-time equivalent employees since December 31, 2006. This increase
includes 73 additional employees related to acquisitions completed in 2007. The remaining
additions were to increase our capacity to train and deliver our contract backlog,
particularly for our courts and justice solutions.

Appraisal services

. In 2007, higher revenues associated with increased activity on the Ohio
revaluation projects contributed to the slight appraisal services gross margin percentage
increase.

Our blended gross margin for 2007 was flat compared to the prior year due to a revenue mix that
included less software license and significant additions to our development and implementation
staff to deliver our growing backlog. Software license revenue inherently has higher gross margins
than other revenues such as professional services and hardware. Although the revenue mix for 2007
also included less software license than the prior year, the negative impact on the gross margin
was offset by lower third party software costs as well as lower amortization expense of software
development costs described above.

earned under the terms of our strategic alliance with Microsoft.

Other

In 2007 interest income was the main component of other income. Other income in 2006 also includes
non-usage and other fees associated with a credit agreement we terminated in January 2007 and gains
and losses on risk management liabilities and assets associated with a foreign exchange contract.
Interest income in 2007 was $1.8 million compared to $1.4 million in 2006. The increase in
interest income was due to higher invested cash balances as the result of positive cash flow in
2007.

The effective income tax rates were different from the statutory United States federal income tax

the qualified manufacturing activities deduction, and non-deductible meals and entertainment costs.

The effective rate for 2006 was lower than the 2007 effective tax rate mainly due to changes in
the Texas franchise tax law and rates enacted in the second quarter of 2006 and favorable
state income tax audit results.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

As of December 31, 2008, we had cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash equivalents)
of $6.8 million and current and non-current investments of $4.6 million, compared to cash and cash
equivalents (including restricted cash equivalents) of $14.1 million and short-term investments of
$41.6 million at December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2008, we had outstanding borrowings of $8.0
million and outstanding letters of credit totaling $5.1 million to secure surety bonds required by
some of our customer contracts.



The following table sets forth a summary of cash flows for the years ended December 31:

Net cash provided by operating activities continues to be our primary source of funds to finance
operating needs and capital expenditures. Other capital resources include cash on hand, public and
private issuances of debt and equity securities, and bank borrowings. The capital and credit
markets have become more volatile and tight as a result of adverse conditions that have caused the
failure and near failure of a number of large financial services companies. It is possible that
our ability to access the capital and credit markets may be limited by these or other factors.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at this time, we believe that cash provided by operating
activities, cash on hand and our revolving credit agreement are sufficient to fund our working
capital requirements, capital expenditures, income tax obligations, and share repurchases for the
foreseeable future.

In 2008, operating activities provided net cash of $47.8 million, primarily generated from net
income of $14.9 million, non-cash legal settlement related to warrants charge of $9.0 million,
non-cash depreciation and amortization charges of $12.6 million, non-cash share-based compensation
expense of $3.8 million, and a decrease in net operating assets of $8.5 million. Net operating
assets declined mainly due to several advance payments from customers offset somewhat by an
increase in annual maintenance billings processed in December.

Our short-term and non-current investments available-for-sale consist of auction rate municipal
securities (“ARS”) which are collateralized debt obligations supported by municipal and state
agencies and do not include mortgage-backed securities. Short-term investments available-for-sale
consist of ARS which were sold at par during the period January 1, 2009 through February 20, 2009.

All of our non-current ARS are reflected at estimated fair value in the balance sheet at December
31, 2008. In prior periods, due to the auction process which took place every 28 to 35 days for
most ARS, quoted market prices were readily available, which would have qualified as Level 1 under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.” However, due to
recent events in credit markets beginning during the first quarter of 2008, the auction events for
most of these securities failed. Therefore, quoted prices in active markets are no longer
available and we determined the estimated fair values of these securities as of December 31, 2008,
utilizing a discounted trinomial model.

In association with this estimate of fair value, we have recorded an after tax temporary unrealized
loss on our non-current ARS of $387,000, net of related tax effects of $209,000 in 2008, which is
included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our balance sheet. As of December 31, 2008,
we have continued to earn and collect interest on all of our ARS. We believe that this temporary
decline in fair value is due entirely to liquidity issues, because the underlying assets of these
securities are supported by municipal and state agencies and do not include mortgage-backed
securities, have redemption features which call for redemption at 100% of par value and have a
current credit rating of A or AAA. The ratings on the ARS take into account credit support through
insurance policies guaranteeing each of the bonds’ payment of principal and accrued interest, if it
becomes necessary. In addition, we do not plan to sell any of the ARS prior to maturity at an
amount below the original purchase value and, at this time, do not deem it probable that we will
receive less than 100% of the principal and accrued interest. Based on our cash and cash
equivalents balance of $6.8 million, expected operating cash flows and the liquidation of $775,000
of ARS subsequent to the period ending December 31, 2008, we do not believe a lack of liquidity
associated with our ARS will adversely affect our ability to conduct business, and believe we
have the ability to hold the securities throughout the currently estimated recovery period. We
have classified these securities as non-current because we believe the market for these securities
may take in excess of twelve months to fully recover. We will continue to evaluate any changes in
the market value of our non-current ARS and in the future, depending upon existing market
conditions, we may be required to record an other-than-temporary decline in market value.



At December 31, 2008, our days sales outstanding (“DSOs”) were 99 days compared to DSOs of 95 days
at December 31, 2007. DSOs are calculated based on accounts receivable (excluding long-term
receivables) divided by the quotient of annualized quarterly revenues divided by 360 days. The
increase in DSOs is primarily due to an increase in maintenance billings processed in December.

Investing activities used cash of $9.6 million in 2008 compared to $34.3 million in 2007. In 2008,
we liquidated $36.4 million of ARS investments for cash at par, and we completed the acquisitions
of School Information Systems, Inc., VersaTrans Solutions Inc. and certain assets of Olympia
Computing Company, Inc. d/b/a Schoolmaster to expand our presence in the education market. The
combined purchase price, excluding cash acquired and including transaction costs, was approximately
$23.9 million in cash and approximately 196,000 shares of Tyler common stock valued at $2.9
million. In connection with plans to consolidate workforces and support planned long-term growth,
we paid $3.3 million, which included $2.1 million for land, for an office development in Lubbock,
Texas. We also paid $12.7 million for an office building, land, and a related tenant lease in
Yarmouth, Maine. Capital expenditures and acquisitions were funded from cash generated from
operations.

Investing activities in 2007 included cash payments of $9.0 million for the acquisitions of EDP
Enterprises, Inc., Advanced Data Systems, Inc. and certain other software assets. Other investing
activities during 2007 were $22.1 million, net of sales, to purchase ARS investments and $3.7
million in property and equipment. The property and equipment expenditures were related to
computer hardware and software and other asset additions to support internal growth. Investing
activities in 2006 include cash payments of $12.2 million and 325,000 shares of Tyler common stock
for the acquisitions of MazikUSA, Inc. and TACS, Inc. and certain maintenance and support
agreements associated with one of our financial solutions. Other investing activities during 2006
were capital expenditures of $4.3 million, including $4.1 million for computer hardware and
purchased software for internal use, including a new enterprise-wide customer relationship
management system, and other asset additions to support internal growth.

Cash used in financing activities was primarily comprised of purchases of treasury shares, net of
proceeds from stock option exercises and contributions from our employee stock purchase plan.
During 2008, we purchased 4.3 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of
$59.0 million. Common stock purchases were funded primarily from cash from operations as well as
borrowings of $8.0 million under a revolving bank credit agreement entered into in late October.
At December 31, 2008, we had authorization to repurchase up to 1.5 million additional shares of
Tyler common stock.

During 2007, we purchased approximately 1.3 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate
purchase price of $16.2 million ($14.1 million in cash and $2.1 million in accrued liabilities at
December 31, 2007.) In 2006 we purchased approximately 1.0 million shares of our common stock for
an aggregate cash purchase price of $10.5 million.

In 2008 we received $1.8 million from the exercise of options to purchase approximately 379,000
shares of our common stock under our employee stock option plan. During 2007, we received $3.6
million from the exercise of options to purchase approximately 878,000 shares of our common stock
under our employee stock option plan and during 2006 we issued 623,000 shares of common stock and
received $2.9 million in aggregate proceeds upon exercise of stock options. In 2008 we received
$1.2 million from contributions to the Tyler Technologies, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(“ESPP”). In 2007 and 2006, we received $1.2 million and $1.0 million, respectively, from
contributions to the ESPP.

Subsequent to December 31, 2008 and through February 20, 2009 we purchased approximately 419,000
shares of our common stock for an aggregate cash purchase price of $5.1 million.

On October 20, 2008, we entered into a revolving bank credit agreement (the “Credit Facility”) and
a related pledge and security agreement. The Credit Facility matures October 19, 2009 and provides
for total borrowings of up to $25.0 million and a $6.0 million Letter of Credit facility under
which the bank will issue cash collateralized letters of credit. Borrowings under the Credit
Facility bear interest at a rate of either LIBOR plus 1% or prime rate minus 1.5%. As of December
31, 2008, our effective interest rate was 1.47% under the Credit Facility. The effective average
interest rate for borrowings during the period October 20 through December 31, 2008 was 2.1%. The
Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our personal property. The Credit Facility
requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and other financial conditions and prohibits us
from making certain investments, advances, cash dividends or loans, restricts the amount of our
common stock we may purchase and the limits incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens. We
expect borrowings to fund discretionary purchases of our common stock or fund acquisitions and
these covenants are not expected to impact our financial condition or operating performance. As of
December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with those covenants.

As of December 31, 2008, we had outstanding borrowings of $8.0 million and unused available
borrowing capacity of $17.0 million under the Credit Facility. In addition, as of December
31, 2008, our bank had issued outstanding letters of credit totaling $5.1 million



to secure
surety bonds required by some of our customer contracts. These letters of credit have been
collateralized by restricted cash balances invested in a certificate of deposit. These
letters of credit expire through mid-2009.

Excluding acquisitions, we anticipate that 2009 capital spending will be between $14.0 million and
$16.0 million. Approximately $11.0 million of these expenditures will be incurred to complete
the construction of an office development in Lubbock, Texas. The remainder of our 2009
expenditures are primarily related to computer equipment and software for infrastructure
expansions. We currently do not expect to capitalize significant amounts related to software
development in 2009, but the actual amount and timing of those costs, and whether they are
capitalized or expensed may result in additional capitalized software development. Capital
spending in 2009 is expected to be funded from existing cash balances and cash flows from
operations.

From time to time we engage in discussions with potential acquisition candidates. In order to
pursue such opportunities, which could require significant commitments of capital, we may be
required to incur debt or to issue additional potentially dilutive securities in the future. No
assurance can be given as to our future acquisition opportunities and how such opportunities will
be financed.

We lease office facilities, as well as transportation, computer and other equipment used in our
operations under non-cancelable operating lease agreements expiring at various dates through 2013.
Most leases contain renewal options and some contain purchase options. Following are the future
obligations under non-cancelable leases at December 31, 2008 (in thousands):

CAPITALIZATION

At December 31, 2008, our capitalization consisted of $8.0 million of short-term debt and $114.3 of
shareholders’ equity.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 141R “Business
Combinations.” SFAS No. 141R changes the accounting for business combinations including the
measurement of acquirer shares issued in consideration for a business combination, the recognition
of contingent consideration, the accounting for pre-acquisition gain and loss contingencies, the
recognition of capitalized in-process research and development, the accounting for
acquisition-related restructuring cost accruals, the treatment of acquisition related transaction
costs and the recognition of changes in the acquirer’s income tax valuation allowance. SFAS No.
141R is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, with early adoption
prohibited. The adoption of SFAS No. 141 R is not expected to have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.

In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) No. 142-3, “Determination of the Useful
Life of Intangible Assets.” FSP No. 142-3 amends the factors an entity should consider in
developing renewal or extension assumptions used in determining the useful life of recognized
intangible assets under FASB Statement No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” This new
guidance applies prospectively to intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group
of other assets in business combinations and asset acquisitions. FSP No. 142-3 is effective for
financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2008.
Early adoption is prohibited. The adoption of FSP No. 142-3 is not expected to have a material
impact on our financial statements or related disclosures.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

Market risk represents the risk of loss that may affect us due to adverse changes in financial
market prices and interest rates. Our short-term and non-current investments available-for-sale
consist of auction rate municipal securities (“ARS”) which are collateralized
debt obligations supported by municipal and state agencies and do not include mortgage-backed
securities. Short-term investments available-for-sale consist of ARS which were sold at par during
the period January 1, 2009 through February 20, 2009.

All of our non-current ARS are reflected at estimated fair value in the balance sheet at December
31, 2008. In prior periods, due to the auction process which took place every 28 to 35 days for
most ARS, quoted market prices were readily available, which would have qualified as Level 1 under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.” However, due to



recent events in credit markets beginning during the first quarter of 2008, the auction events for
most of these securities failed. Therefore, quoted prices in active markets are no longer
available and we determined the estimated fair values of these securities as of December 31, 2008,
utilizing a discounted trinomial model.

In association with this estimate of fair value, we have recorded an after tax temporary unrealized
loss on our non-current ARS of $387,000, net of related tax effects of $209,000 in 2008, which is
included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our balance sheet. As of December 31, 2008,
we have continued to earn and collect interest on all of our ARS. We believe that this temporary
decline in fair value is due entirely to liquidity issues, because the underlying assets of these
securities are supported by municipal and state agencies and do not include mortgage-backed
securities, have redemption features which call for redemption at 100% of par value and have a
current credit rating of A or AAA. The ratings on the ARS take into account credit support through
insurance policies guaranteeing each of the bonds’ payment of principal and accrued interest, if it
becomes necessary. In addition, we do not plan to sell any of the ARS prior to maturity at an
amount below the original purchase value and, at this time, do not deem it probable that we will
receive less than 100% of the principal and accrued interest. Based on our cash and cash
equivalents balance of $6.8 million, expected operating cash flows and the liquidation of $775,000
of ARS subsequent to the period ending December 31, 2008, we do not believe a lack of liquidity
associated with our ARS will adversely affect our ability to conduct business, and believe we have
the ability to hold the securities throughout the currently estimated recovery period. We have
classified these securities as non-current because we believe the market for these securities may
take in excess of twelve months to fully recover. We will continue to evaluate any changes in the
market value of our non-current ARS and in the future, depending upon existing market conditions,
we may be required to record an other-than-temporary decline in market value.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

— We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act) designed to provide reasonable
assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. These include controls and procedures designed to ensure
that this information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief
executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosures. Management, with the participation of the chief executive officer and chief
financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
December 31, 2008. Based on this evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial
officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December
31, 2008.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

— Tyler’s management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as
defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Tyler’s internal control over financial
reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to Tyler’s management and board of directors
regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Management assessed the effectiveness of Tyler’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2008. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control –
Integrated Framework

. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2008, Tyler’s
internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.



Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2008 has been audited by Ernst & Young, LLP, the independent registered public
accounting firm who also audited Tyler’s financial statements. Ernst & Young’s attestation report
on management’s assessment of Tyler’s internal control over financial reporting appears on page F-2

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Tyler Technologies, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Tyler Technologies, Inc. as of December 31, 2008
and 2007, and the related statements of operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Tyler Technologies, Inc. at December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), Tyler Technologies, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February
25, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Tyler Technologies, Inc.

We have audited Tyler Technologies, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Tyler
Technologies, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting included in the accompanying “Managements’ Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting.” Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Tyler Technologies, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the balance sheets of Tyler Technologies, Inc. as of December 31, 2008 and
2007, and the related statements of operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008 and our
report dated February 25, 2009
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Cash in excess of that necessary for operating requirements is invested in short-term, highly
liquid, income-producing investments. Investments with original maturities of three months or less
are classified as cash and cash equivalents, which primarily consist of money market funds. Cash
and cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates market value.

We maintain a $6.0 million Letter of Credit facility under which the bank issues cash
collateralized letters of credit. As of December 31, 2008, approximately $5.1 million of our cash
equivalents are restricted and designated as collateral for our letters of credit issued in
connection with our surety bond program. These letters of credit expire through mid 2009.

INVESTMENTS

Investments consist of auction rate municipal securities. These investments are classified as
available-for-sale securities and are stated at fair value in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.” Unrealized holding
gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, if any, are not reflected in earnings but are
reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income until realized. The cost basis of
securities sold is determined using the average cost method. We account for the transactions as
“Proceeds from sales of investments” for the security relinquished, and a “Purchase of investments”
for the security purchased, in the accompanying Statement of Cash Flows.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Software Arrangements:

We earn revenue from software licenses, subscriptions, software services, post-contract customer
support (“PCS” or “maintenance”), and hardware. PCS includes telephone support, bug fixes, and
rights to upgrades on a when-and-if available basis. We provide services that range from
installation, training, and basic consulting to software modification and customization to meet
specific customer needs. In software arrangements that include rights to multiple software
products, specified upgrades, PCS, and/or other services, we allocate the total arrangement fee
among each deliverable based on the relative fair value of each.

We typically enter into multiple element arrangements, which include software licenses, software
services, PCS and occasionally hardware. The majority of our software arrangements are multiple
element arrangements, but for those arrangements that involve significant production, modification
or customization of the software, or where software services are otherwise considered essential to
the functionality of the software in the customer’s environment, we use contract accounting and
apply the provisions of Statement of Position (“SOP”) 81-1 “Accounting for Performance of
Construction – Type and Certain Production – Type Contracts.”

F-7


If the arrangement does not require significant production, modification or customization or where
the software services are not considered essential to the functionality of the software, revenue is
recognized when all of the following conditions are met:

i.

persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;

ii.

delivery has occurred;

iii.

our fee is fixed or determinable; and

iv.

collectibility is probable.

For multiple element arrangements, each element of the arrangement is analyzed and we allocate a
portion of the total arrangement fee to the elements based on the fair value of the element using
vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”), regardless of any separate prices stated
within the contract for each element. Fair value is considered the price a customer would be
required to pay if the element was sold separately based on our historical experience of
stand-alone sales of these elements to third parties. For PCS, we use renewal rates for continued
support arrangements to determine fair value. For software services, we use the fair value we
charge our customers when those services are sold separately. We monitor our transactions to
insure we maintain and periodically revise VSOE to reflect fair value. In software arrangements
in which we have the fair value of all undelivered elements but not of a delivered element, we
apply the “residual method” as allowed under SOP 98-9 in accounting for any element of a multiple
element arrangement involving software that remains undelivered such that any discount inherent in
a contract is allocated to the delivered element. Under the residual method, if the fair value of
all undelivered elements is determinable, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred
and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered element(s) and is
recognized as revenue assuming the other revenue recognition criteria are met. In software
arrangements in which we do not have VSOE for all undelivered elements, revenue is deferred until
fair value is determined or all elements for which we do not have VSOE have been delivered.
Alternatively, if sufficient VSOE does not exist and the only undelivered element is services that
do not involve significant modification or customization of the software, the entire fee is
recognized over the period during which the services are expected to be performed.

Software Licenses

We recognize the revenue allocable to software licenses and specified upgrades upon delivery of the
software product or upgrade to the customer, unless the fee is not fixed or determinable or
collectibility is not probable. If the fee is not fixed or determinable, including new customers
whose payment terms are three months or more from shipment, revenue is generally recognized as
payments become due from the customer. If collectibility is not considered probable, revenue is
recognized when the fee is collected. Arrangements that include software services, such as
training or installation, are evaluated to determine whether those services are essential to the
product’s functionality.

A majority of our software arrangements involve “off-the-shelf” software. We consider software to
be off-the-shelf software if it can be added to an arrangement with minor changes in the underlying
code and it can be used by the customer for the customer’s purpose upon installation. For
off-the-shelf software arrangements, we recognize the software license fee as revenue after
delivery has occurred, customer acceptance is reasonably assured, that portion of the fee
represents a non-refundable enforceable claim and is probable of collection, and the remaining
services such as training are not considered essential to the product’s functionality.

For arrangements that involve significant production, modification or customization of the
software, or where software services are otherwise considered essential, we recognize revenue using
contract accounting. We generally use the percentage-of-completion method to recognize revenue
from these arrangements. We measure progress-to-completion primarily using labor hours incurred,
or value added. The percentage-of-completion method generally results in the recognition of
reasonably consistent profit margins over the life of a contract because we have the ability to
produce reasonably dependable estimates of contract billings and contract costs. We use the level
of profit margin that is most likely to occur on a contract. If the most likely profit margin
cannot be precisely determined, the lowest probable level of profit in the range of estimates is
used until the results can be estimated more precisely. These arrangements are often implemented
over an extended time period and occasionally require us to revise total cost estimates. Amounts
recognized in revenue are calculated using the progress-to-completion measurement after giving
effect to any changes in our cost estimates. Changes to total estimated contract costs, if any,
are recorded in the period they are determined. Estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are
recorded in the period in which we first determine that a loss is apparent.

For arrangements that include new product releases for which it is difficult to estimate final
profitability except to assume that no loss will ultimately be incurred, we recognize revenue under
the completed contract method. Under the completed contract method, revenue is recognized only
when a contract is completed or substantially complete. Historically these amounts have been
immaterial.

F-8


Subscription-Based Services

Subscription-based services primarily consist of revenues derived from application service provider
(“ASP”) arrangements and other hosted service offerings, software subscriptions and disaster
recovery services.

We recognize revenue for ASP and other hosting services, software subscriptions, term license
arrangements with renewal periods of twelve months or less and disaster recovery ratably over the
period of the applicable agreement as services are provided. Disaster recovery agreements and
other hosting services are typically renewable annually. ASP and software subscriptions are
typically for periods of three to six years and automatically renew unless either party cancels the
agreement. The majority of the ASP and other hosting services and software subscriptions also
include professional services as well as maintenance and support. In certain ASP arrangements, the
customer also acquires a license to the software.

For ASP and other hosting arrangements, we evaluate whether each of the elements in these
arrangements represents a separate unit of accounting, as defined by Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”) No. 00-21, using all applicable facts and circumstances, including whether (i) we sell or
could readily sell the element unaccompanied by the other elements, (ii) the element has
stand-alone value to the customer, (iii) there is objective reliable evidence of the fair value of
the undelivered item, and (iv) there is a general right of return. We consider the applicability
of EITF No. 00-03, “Application of SOP 97-2 to Arrangements That Include the Right to Use Software
Stored on Another Entity’s Hardware” on a contract-by-contract basis. In hosted term-based
agreements, where the customer does not have the contractual right to take possession of the
software, hosting fees are recognized on a monthly basis over the term of the contract commencing
when the customer has access to the software. For professional services associated with hosting
arrangements that we determine do not have stand-alone value to the customer, we recognize the
services revenue ratably over the remaining contractual period once hosting has gone live and we
may begin billing for the hosting services. We record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts
receivable and in deferred revenue or revenues, depending on whether the revenue recognition
criteria have been met.

If we determine that the customer has the contractual right to take possession of our software at
any time during the hosting period without significant penalty, and can feasibly maintain the
software on the customer’s hardware or enter into another arrangement with a third party to host
the software, we recognize the license, professional services and hosting services revenues
pursuant to SOP 97-2.

Software Services

Some of our software arrangements include services considered essential for the customer to use the
software for the customer’s purposes. For these software arrangements, both the software license
revenue and the services revenue are recognized as the services are performed using the
percentage-of-completion contract accounting method. When software services are not considered
essential, the fee allocable to the service element is recognized as revenue as we perform the
services.

Computer Hardware Equipment

Revenue allocable to computer hardware equipment, which is based on VSOE, is recognized when we
deliver the equipment and collection is probable.

Postcontract Customer Support

Our customers generally enter into PCS agreements when they purchase our software licenses. Our
PCS agreements are typically renewable annually. Revenue allocated to PCS is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the period the PCS is provided. All significant costs and expenses
associated with PCS are expensed as incurred. Fair value for the maintenance and support
obligations for software licenses is based upon the specific sale renewals to customers.

Allocation of Revenue in Statement of Operations

In our statements of operations, we allocate revenue to software licenses, software services,
maintenance and hardware and other based on the VSOE of fair value for elements in each revenue
arrangement and the application of the residual method for arrangements in which we have
established VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements. In arrangements where we are not able
to establish VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements, revenue is first allocated to any
undelivered elements for which VSOE of fair value has been established. We then allocate revenue
to any undelivered elements for which VSOE of fair value has not been established based upon
management’s best estimate of fair value of those undelivered elements and apply a residual method
to

F-9


determine the license fee. Management’s best estimate of fair value of undelivered elements for
which VSOE of fair value has not been established is based upon the VSOE of similar offerings and
other objective criteria.

Appraisal Services:

For our property appraisal projects, we recognize revenue using the proportionate performance
method of revenue recognition since many of these projects are implemented over one to three year
periods and consist of various unique activities. Under this method of revenue recognition, we
identify each activity for the appraisal project, with a typical project generally calling for
bonding, office set up, training, routing of map information, data entry, data collection, data
verification, informal hearings, appeals and project management. Each activity or act is
specifically identified and assigned an estimated cost. Costs which are considered to be
associated with indirect activities, such as bonding costs and office set up, are expensed as
incurred. These costs are typically billed as incurred and are recognized as revenue equal to
cost. Direct contract fulfillment activities and related supervisory costs such as data
collection, data entry and verification are expensed as incurred. The direct costs for these
activities are determined and the total contract value is then allocated to each activity based on
a consistent profit margin. Each activity is assigned a consistent unit of measure to determine
progress towards completion and revenue is recognized for each activity based upon the percentage
complete as applied to the estimated revenue for that activity. Progress for the fulfillment
activities is typically based on labor hours or an output measure such as the number of parcel
counts completed for that activity. Estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the
period in which we first determine that a loss is apparent.

Other:

The majority of deferred revenue consists of unearned support and maintenance revenue that has been
billed based on contractual terms in the underlying arrangement with the remaining balance
consisting of payments received in advance of revenue being earned under software licensing,
subscription-based services, software and appraisal services and hardware installation. Unbilled
revenue is not billable at the balance sheet date but is recoverable over the remaining life of the
contract through billings made in accordance with contractual agreements. The termination clauses
in most of our contracts provide for the payment for the fair value of products delivered and
services performed in the event of an early termination.

Prepaid expenses and other current assets include direct and incremental costs, consisting
primarily of commissions associated with arrangements for which revenue recognition has been
deferred and third party subcontractor payments. Such costs are expensed at the time the related
revenue is recognized.

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the
application of the percentage-of-completion and proportionate performance methods of revenue
recognition, the carrying amount and estimated useful lives of intangible assets, determination of
share-based compensation expense and valuation allowance for receivables. Actual results could
differ from estimates.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET

Property, equipment and purchased software are recorded at original cost and increased by the cost
of any significant improvements after purchase. We expense maintenance and repairs when incurred.
Depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the
asset’s estimated useful life or the term of the lease in the case of leasehold improvements. For
income tax purposes, we use accelerated depreciation methods as allowed by tax laws.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS

We expensed research and development costs of $7.3 million during 2008, $4.4 million during 2007
and $3.3 million during 2006. In 2008 and 2007, we reduced our research and development expense by approximately $1.8 million
and $1.6 million, respectively, which was the amount earned under the terms of our strategic
alliance with a development partner.

F-10


INCOME TAXES

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred taxes arise because
of different treatment between financial statement accounting and tax accounting, known as
“temporary differences.” We record the tax effect of these temporary differences as “deferred tax
assets” (generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the future periods) and
“deferred tax liabilities” (generally items that we received a tax deduction for, which have not
yet been recorded in the income statement). The deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rules and laws that are expected to be in effect when the temporary differences
are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance would be established to reduce
deferred tax assets if it is likely that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

We have a stock option plan that provides for the grant of stock options to key employees,
directors and non-employee consultants. Stock options vest after three to five years of continuous
service from the date of grant and have a contractual term of ten years. We account for
share-based compensation utilizing the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R,
“Share-Based Payment.” See Note 10 – “Share-Based Compensation” for further information.

SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION

Although we have a number of operating divisions, separate segment data has not been presented as
they meet the criteria for aggregation as permitted by SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures About Segments of
an Enterprise and Related Information.”

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

We have used the purchase method of accounting for all of our business combinations. Our business
acquisitions result in the allocation of the purchase price to goodwill and other intangible
assets. We first allocate the cost of acquired companies to identifiable assets based on estimated
fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired,
net of liabilities assumed, is recorded as goodwill.

Under SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” we evaluate goodwill for impairment
annually as of April, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. An impairment loss is
recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s fair value. The fair values
calculated in our impairment tests are determined using discounted cash flow models involving
several assumptions. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, anticipated operating
income growth rates, our long-term anticipated operating income growth rate and the discount rate.
The assumptions that are used are based upon what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant
would use in estimating fair value. In the implementation of SFAS No. 142, we identified two
reporting units for impairment testing. The appraisal services and appraisal software stand-alone
business unit qualified as a reporting unit since it is one level below an operating segment,
discrete financial information exists for the business unit and the executive management group
directly reviews this business unit. The other software business units were aggregated into the
other single reporting unit. The appraisal services and appraisal software stand-alone business
unit is organized in such a manner that both of its revenue sources are tightly integrated with
each other and discrete financial information at the operating profit level does not exist for this
business unit’s respective revenue sources. There have been no significant impairments of goodwill
or other intangibles.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

We periodically evaluate whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of
our property and equipment or other long-lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable.
If such circumstances are determined to exist, we measure the recoverability of assets to be held
and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset or appropriate grouping of assets and
the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If the
carrying amount of the assets exceeds their estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is
recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the
assets. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at
the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated.
The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented
separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet. There have been
no significant impairments of long-lived assets.

F-11


COSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE

Software development costs have been accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 86, “Accounting for
the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed.” Under SFAS No. 86,
capitalization of software development costs begins upon the establishment of technological
feasibility and prior to the availability of the product for general release to customers. We did
not capitalize any software development costs in 2008. We capitalized software development costs of
approximately $167,000 during 2007, and $236,000 during 2006. Software development costs primarily
consist of personnel costs and rent for related office space. We begin to amortize capitalized
costs when a product is available for general release to customers. Amortization expense is
determined on a product-by-product basis at a rate not less than straight-line basis over the
product’s remaining estimated economic life, but not to exceed five years. Amortization of software
development costs was approximately $4.7 million in 2008, $4.6 million in 2007, and $5.1 million in
2006 and is included in cost of software license revenue in the accompanying statements of
operations.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivables, accounts payables, short-term obligations,
deferred revenues and certain other assets at cost approximate fair value because of the short
maturity of these instruments. In accordance with SFAS No. 157 “Fair Value Measurements,” our
investments available-for-sale are recorded at fair value as of December 31, 2008 based upon the
level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value. See Note 3 – “Fair
Value of Financial Instruments” for further information.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK AND UNBILLED RECEIVABLES

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the size and
geographical diversity of our customer base. Historically, our credit losses have not been
significant. As a result, we do not believe we have any significant concentrations of credit risk
as of December 31, 2008.

We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments, which are provided at the time
the revenue is recognized. Since most of our customers are domestic governmental entities, we
rarely incur a loss resulting from the inability of a customer to make required payments. Events
or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount for the allowances for doubtful
accounts and sales adjustments may require revision, include, but are not limited to, deterioration
of a customer’s financial condition, failure to manage our customer’s expectations regarding the
scope of the services to be delivered, and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our
software products. The following table summarizes the changes in the allowances for doubtful
accounts and sales adjustments:

The termination clauses in most of our contracts provide for the payment for the fair value of
products delivered or services performed in the event of early termination. Our property appraisal
outsourcing service contracts can range up to three years and, in a few cases, as long as five
years in duration. In connection with these contracts, as well as certain software service
contracts, we may perform work prior to when the software and services are billable and/or payable
pursuant to the contract. We have historically recorded such unbilled receivables (costs and
estimated profit in excess of billings) in connection with (1) property appraisal services
contracts accounted for using proportionate performance accounting in which the revenue is earned
based upon activities performed in one accounting period but the billing normally occurs shortly
thereafter and may span another accounting period; (2) software services
contracts accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method of revenue recognition using
labor hours as a measure of progress towards completion in which the services are performed in one
accounting period but the billing for the software element of the arrangement may be based upon the
specific phase of the implementation; (3) software revenue for which we have objective evidence
that the customer-specified objective criteria has been met but the billing has not yet been
submitted to the customer; and (4) in a limited number of cases, we may grant extended payment
terms generally to existing customers with whom we have a long-term

F-12


relationship and favorable collection history. In addition, certain of our property appraisal outsourcing contracts are
required by law to have an amount withheld from a progress billing (generally a 10% retention)
until final and satisfactory project completion is achieved, typically upon the completion of
fieldwork or formal hearings.

In connection with this activity, we have recorded unbilled receivables of $13.7 million and $11.2
million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We also have recorded retention receivable of
$1.5 million and $3.9 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and these retentions
become payable upon the completion of the contract or completion of our field work and formal
hearings. Unbilled receivables and retention receivables expected to be collected in excess of one
year have been classified as accounts receivable, long-term portion in the accompanying balance
sheets.

INDEMNIFICATION

Most of our software license agreements indemnify our customers in the event that the software sold
infringes upon the intellectual property rights of a third party. These agreements typically
provide that in such event we will either modify or replace the software so that it becomes
non-infringing or procure for the customer the right to use the software. We have recorded no
liability associated with these indemnifications, as we are not aware of any pending or threatened
infringement actions that are possible losses. We believe the estimated fair value of these
intellectual property indemnification clauses is minimal.

We have also agreed to indemnify our officers and board members if they are named or threatened to
be named as a party to any proceeding by reason of the fact that they acted in such capacity. A
form of the indemnification agreement was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to our Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2002. We maintain directors’ and officers’ insurance coverage to protect against any
such losses. We have recorded no liability associated with these indemnifications. Because of our
insurance coverage, we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is
minimal.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 141R “Business
Combinations.” SFAS No. 141R changes the accounting for business combinations including the
measurement of acquirer shares issued in consideration for a business combination, the recognition
of contingent consideration, the accounting for pre-acquisition gain and loss contingencies, the
recognition of capitalized in-process research and development, the accounting for
acquisition-related restructuring cost accruals, the treatment of acquisition related transaction
costs and the recognition of changes in the acquirer’s income tax valuation allowance. SFAS No.
141R is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, with early adoption
prohibited. The adoption of SFAS No. 141 R is not expected to have a material impact on our
financial statements or related disclosures.

In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) No. 142-3, “Determination of the Useful
Life of Intangible Assets.” FSP No. 142-3 amends the factors an entity should consider in
developing renewal or extension assumptions used in determining the useful life of recognized
intangible assets under FASB Statement No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” This new
guidance applies prospectively to intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group
of other assets in business combinations and asset acquisitions. FSP No. 142-3 is effective for
financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2008.
Early adoption is prohibited. The adoption of FSP No. 142-3 is not expected to have a material
impact on our financial statements or related disclosures.

(2) ACQUISITIONS

In August 2008, we completed the acquisition of all the capital stock of School Information
Systems, Inc. (“SIS”) which develops and sells a full suite of student information and financial
management systems for K-12 schools. The purchase price, including transaction costs and excluding
cash balances acquired, was approximately $9.9 million in cash and approximately 70,000 shares of
Tyler common stock valued at $1.2 million.

In the first quarter of 2008, we completed the acquisitions of all of the capital stock of
VersaTrans Solutions Inc. (“VersaTrans”) and certain assets of Olympia Computing Company, Inc.
d/b/a Schoolmaster (“Schoolmaster”). VersaTrans is a provider of student
transportation management software solutions for school districts and school transportation
providers across North America, including solutions for school bus routing and planning,
redistricting, GPS fleet tracking, fleet maintenance and field trip planning. Schoolmaster
provides a full suite of student information systems, which manage such functions as grading,
attendance, scheduling, guidance, health, admissions and fund raising. The combined purchase price
for these transactions excluding cash acquired and

F-13


including transaction costs, was approximately $13.9 million in cash and approximately 126,000 shares of Tyler common stock valued at $1.7
million.

Our balance sheet as of December 31, 2008 reflects the allocation of the purchase price to the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of
acquisition. In connection with these three transactions we acquired total tangible assets of
approximately $3.5 million and assumed total liabilities of approximately $8.2 million. We recorded
goodwill of $17.1 million, $7.8 million of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes, and
other intangible assets of $14.3 million. The $14.3 million of intangible assets is attributable to
acquired software, customer relationships and trade name that will be amortized over a weighted
average period of approximately 10 years.

The operating results of these acquisitions are included in our results of operations since their
respective dates of acquisition. We believe these acquisitions will complement our business model
by expanding our presence in the education market and will give us additional opportunities to
provide our customers with solutions tailored specifically for local governments.

In September 2007, we completed the acquisition of all the capital stock of EDP Enterprises, Inc.
(“EDP”), which develops and sells financial and student information and management systems for
public school districts in Texas. In February 2007, we completed the acquisition of all of the
capital stock of Advanced Data Systems, Inc. (“ADS”), which develops and sells fund accounting
solutions, primarily in New England. The combined purchase price, including transaction costs
along with an office building used in ADS’s business and excluding cash balances acquired, for
these acquisitions as well as miscellaneous other software asset purchases was $9.0 million.

(3) FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

In 2006 the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.” SFAS No. 157 does not establish
requirements for any new fair value measurements, but it does apply to existing accounting
pronouncements in which fair value measurements are already required. SFAS No. 157 defines fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. We
adopted the principles of SFAS No. 157 as of January 1, 2008, for financial instruments.

SFAS No. 157 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritize the inputs used in
measuring fair value. These tiers include the following:

Level 1 — Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities at the measurement date;

Level 2 — Inputs other than Level 1 inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable;
and

Level 3 — Unobservable inputs, for which little or no market data exist, therefore requiring
an entity to develop its own assumptions.

As of December 31, 2008 we held certain items that are required to be measured at fair value on a
recurring basis. The fair value of these financial assets was determined using the following
inputs at December 31, 2008:

Quoted prices in

active markets for

Significant other

Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds with original maturity dates of
three months or less, for which we determine fair value through quoted market prices.

Investments available-for-sale consist of auction rate municipal securities (“ARS”) which are
collateralized debt obligations supported by municipal and state agencies and do not include
mortgage-backed securities. Short-term investments available-for-sale consists of ARS which were
sold at par during the period January 1, 2009 through February 20, 2009.

F-14


All of our non-current ARS are reflected at estimated fair value in the balance sheet at December
31, 2008. In prior periods, due to the auction process which took place every 28 to 35 days for
most ARS, quoted market prices were readily available, which would have qualified as Level 1 under
SFAS No. 157. However, due to recent events in credit markets beginning during the first quarter
of 2008, the auction events for most of these securities failed. Therefore, quoted prices in
active markets are no longer available and we determined the estimated fair values of these
securities utilizing a discounted trinomial model. The model considers the probability of three
potential occurrences for each auction event through the maturity date of each ARS. The three
potential outcomes for each auction are (i) successful auction/early redemption, (ii) failed
auction and (iii) issuer default. Inputs in determining the probabilities of the potential
outcomes include but are not limited to, the securities’ collateral, credit rating, insurance,
issuer’s financial standing, contractual restrictions on disposition and the liquidity in the
market. The fair value of each ARS is determined by summing the present value of the
probability-weighted future principal and interest payments determined by the model.

In association with this estimate of fair value, we have recorded an after tax temporary unrealized
loss on our non-current ARS of $387,000, net of related tax effects of $209,000 in 2008, which is
included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our balance sheet. As of December 31, 2008 we
have continued to earn and collect interest on all of our ARS. We believe that this temporary
decline in fair value is due entirely to liquidity issues, because the underlying assets of these
securities are supported by municipal and state agencies and do not include mortgage-backed
securities, have redemption features which call for redemption at 100% of par value and have a
current credit rating of A or AAA. The ratings on the ARS take into account credit support through
insurance policies guaranteeing each of the bonds’ payment of principal and accrued interest, if it
becomes necessary. In addition, we do not plan to sell any of the ARS prior to maturity at an
amount below the original purchase value and, at this time, do not deem it probable that we will
receive less than 100% of the principal and accrued interest. Based on our cash and cash
equivalents balance of $6.8 million, expected operating cash flows and the liquidation of $775,000
of ARS subsequent to the period ending December 31, 2008, we do not believe a lack of liquidity
associated with our ARS will adversely affect our ability to conduct business, and believe we have
the ability to hold the securities throughout the currently estimated recovery period. We have
classified these securities as non-current because we believe the market for these securities may
take in excess of twelve months to fully recover. We will continue to evaluate any changes in the
market value of our non-current ARS and in the future, depending upon existing market conditions,
we may be required to record an other-than-temporary decline in market value.

We purchased an office building in Yarmouth, Maine in mid-2008 which is leased to third-party
tenants. These leases expire between 2011 and 2013 and are expected to provide rental income of
approximately $1.3 million during both 2009 and 2010, $877,000 during 2011, $406,000 during 2012
and $169,000 during 2013. Upon expiration of these agreements we expect to begin occupying the
facility. Rental income associated with these leases in 2008 was $662,000 and was included as a
reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses.

(7) SHORT-TERM OBLIGATION

On October 20, 2008, we entered into a revolving bank credit agreement (the “Credit Facility”) and
a related pledge and security agreement. The Credit Facility matures October 19, 2009 and provides
for total borrowings of up to $25.0 million and a $6.0 million Letter of Credit facility under
which the bank will issue cash collateralized letters of credit. Borrowings under the Credit
Facility bear interest at a rate of either LIBOR plus 1% or prime rate minus 1.5%. As of December
31, 2008, our effective interest rate was 1.47% under the Credit Facility. The effective average
interest rate for borrowings during the period October 20 through December 31, 2008 was 2.1%. The
Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our personal property. The Credit Facility
requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and other financial conditions and prohibits us
from making certain investments, advances, cash dividends or loans, restricts the amount of our
common stock we may purchase and limits incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens. As of
December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with those covenants.

As of December 31, 2008, we had outstanding borrowings of $8.0 million and unused available
borrowing capacity of $17.0 million under the Credit Facility. In addition, as of December 31,
2008, our bank had issued outstanding letters of credit totaling $5.1 million to secure surety
bonds required by some of our customer contracts. These letters of credit have been collateralized
by restricted cash

F-17


balances invested in a certificate of deposit and expire through mid-2009. The
carrying amount of the Credit Facility approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the
instrument.

In 2008, non-deductible business expenses include the impact of a non-cash legal settlement related
to warrants charge of $9.0 million, which was not tax deductible. See Note 14 — “Commitments and
Contingencies” for more information.

Slightly less than half of our unvested stock option awards qualify as an incentive stock option
(“ISO”) for income tax purposes. As such, a tax benefit is not recorded at the time the
compensation cost related to the options is recorded for book purposes due to the fact that an ISO
does not ordinarily result in a tax benefit unless there is a disqualifying disposition. Stock
option grants of non-qualified options result in the creation of a deferred tax asset, which is a
temporary difference, until the time that the option is exercised. Due to the treatment of ISOs
for tax purposes, our effective tax rate from year to year is subject to variability.

The tax effects of the major items recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December
31 are:

Although realization is not assured, we believe it is more likely than not that all the deferred
tax assets at December 31, 2008 and 2007 will be realized. Accordingly, we believe no valuation
allowance is required for the deferred tax assets. However, the amount of the
deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted in the future if estimates of reversing
taxable temporary differences are revised.

No reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded pursuant to Financial Standards
Accounting Board Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.”

We are subject to U.S. federal tax as well as income tax of multiple state and local jurisdictions.
We are no longer subject to United States federal income tax examinations for years before 2006
and are no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for the
years before 2004.

We paid income taxes, net of refunds received, of $15.7 million in 2008, $8.7 million in 2007, and
$10.4 million in 2006.

Subsequent to December 31, 2008 and through February 20, 2009, we repurchased 419,000 shares for an
aggregate purchase price of $5.1 million. As of February 20, 2009 we had authorization from our
board of directors to repurchase up to 1.1 million additional shares of our common stock.

On June 27, 2008, we settled outstanding litigation related to two Stock Purchase Warrants owned by
Bank of America, N. A. (“BANA”). In July 2008, as a result of this settlement, BANA paid us $2.0
million and we issued to BANA 801,883 restricted shares of Tyler common stock. See Note 14 —
“Commitments and Contingencies” for further information.

(10) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

Share-Based Compensation Plan

We have a stock option plan that provides for the grant of stock options to key employees,
directors and non-employee consultants. Stock options vest after three to five years of continuous
service from the date of grant and have a contractual term of ten years. Once options become
exercisable, the employee can purchase shares of our common stock at the market price on the date
we granted the option. We account for share-based compensation utilizing the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment.”

As of December 31, 2008, there were 996,000 shares available for future grants under the plan from
the 11.0 million shares previously approved by the stockholders.

Determining Fair Value Under SFAS No. 123R

Valuation and Amortization Method. We estimate the fair value of share-based awards granted using
the Black-Scholes option valuation model. We amortize the fair value of all awards on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service periods, which are generally the vesting periods.

Expected Life. The expected life of awards granted represents the period of time that they are
expected to be outstanding. In

F-19


December 2007, Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 110 was
issued which extends the use of the “simplified” method for those companies that conclude that it
is not reasonable to base its estimate of expected life of options on its historical share option
exercise experience. We have used the “simplified” method to estimate expected life since adopting
SFAS No. 123R due to insufficient historical exercise data. In the late 1990s we made significant
changes to our business and growth strategy and as a result our current optionee group has not been
in place long enough to generate sufficient historical data to estimate the expected period of time
an option award would be expected to be outstanding.

Expected Volatility. Using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, we estimate the volatility of
our common stock at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock.

Risk-Free Interest Rate. We base the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes option
valuation model on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with
an equivalent remaining term equal to the expected life of the award.

Expected Dividend Yield. We have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock in the last ten
years and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently,
we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the Black-Scholes option valuation model.

Expected Forfeitures. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures. We record
stock-based compensation only for those awards that are expected to vest.

The following weighted average assumptions were used for options granted:

(12) LEASES

We lease office facilities for use in our operations, as well as transportation, computer and other
equipment. We also have an office facility lease agreement with a shareholder. Most of our
leases are noncancelable operating lease agreements and they expire at various dates through 2013.
In addition to rent, the leases generally require us to pay taxes, maintenance, insurance and
certain other operating expenses.

Rent expense was approximately $5.9 million in 2008, and $4.9 million in both 2007 and 2006, which
included rent expense associated with related party lease agreements of $1.8 million in both 2008
and in 2007, and $1.7 million in 2006.

Future minimum lease payments under all noncancelable leases at December 31, 2008 are as follows:

(13) EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

We provide a defined contribution plan for the majority of our employees meeting minimum service
requirements. The employees can contribute up to 30% of their current compensation to the plan
subject to certain statutory limitations. We contribute up to a maximum of 2.5% of an employee’s
compensation to the plan. We made contributions to the plan and charged operations $2.0 million
during 2008, $1.7 million during 2007, and $1.6 million during 2006.

F-22


(14) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

On November 3, 2008, a putative collective action complaint was filed against us in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas on behalf of current and former “customer
support analysts,” “client liaisons,” “engineers,” “trainers,” and “education services
specialists.” The petition alleges that we misclassified these groups of employees as “exempt”
rather than “non-exempt” under the Fair Labor Standards Act; therefore, the petition alleges that
we failed to properly pay overtime wages. The suit was initiated by six former employees working
out of our Longview, Texas, office and seeks to recover damages in the form of lost overtime pay
since October 31, 2005, liquidated damages equal to the amount of lost overtime pay, interest,
costs, and attorneys’ fees. We intend to vigorously defend the action. Given the preliminary
nature of the alleged claims and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, we cannot at this
time estimate the possible outcome of any such action.

On June 27, 2008, we settled outstanding litigation related to two Stock Purchase Warrants (the
“Warrants”) owned by Bank of America, N. A. (“BANA”). As disclosed in prior SEC filings, the
Warrants entitled BANA to acquire 1.6 million shares of Tyler common stock at an exercise price of
$2.50 per share. The Warrants expired on September 10, 2007. Prior to their expiration, BANA
attempted to exercise the Warrants; however, the parties disputed whether or not BANA’s exercise
was effective. We filed suit for declaratory judgment seeking a court’s determination on the
matter, and BANA asserted numerous counterclaims against us, including breach of contract and
misrepresentation.

Following court-ordered mediation, in July 2008, BANA paid us $2.0 million and we issued to BANA
801,883 restricted shares of Tyler common stock. Accordingly, as a result of the settlement, we
recorded a non-cash legal settlement related to warrants charge of $9.0 million, which is not tax
deductible.

Other than ordinary course, routine litigation incidental to our business and except as described
in this Annual Report, there are no material legal proceedings pending to which we are party or to
which any of our properties are subject.

On June 27, 2008, we settled outstanding litigation related to two Stock Purchase
Warrants (the “Warrants”) owned by Bank of America, N. A. (“BANA”). As disclosed in prior SEC
filings, the Warrants entitled BANA to acquire 1.6 million shares of Tyler common stock at an
exercise price of $2.50 per share. Following court-ordered mediation, in July 2008, BANA paid
us $2.0 million and we issued to BANA 801,883 restricted shares of Tyler common stock.
Accordingly, we recorded a non-cash legal settlement related to warrants charge of $9.0
million, which is not tax deductible, during the three months ended June 30, 2008.
