BUSINESS.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Tyler Technologies, Inc. (“Tyler”) is a major provider of integrated information management solutions and services for the public sector, with a focus on local governments. We partner with clients to make local government more accessible to the public, more responsive to the needs of citizens and more efficient in its operations. We have a broad line of software solutions and services to address the information technology (“IT”) needs of major areas of operations for cities, counties, schools and other local government entities. Most of our clients have our software installed in-house. For clients who prefer not to physically acquire the software and hardware, most of our software applications can be delivered as software as a service (“SaaS”), which utilize the Tyler private cloud. We provide professional IT services to our clients, including software and hardware installation, data conversion, training and, at times, product modifications. In addition, we are the nation’s largest provider of outsourced property appraisal services for taxing jurisdictions. We also provide continuing client support services to ensure product performance and reliability, which provides us with long-term client relationships and a significant base of recurring maintenance revenue. In addition, we provide electronic document filing solutions (“e-filing”), which simplify the filing and management of court related documents.

Tyler was founded in 1966. Prior to 1998, we operated as a diversified industrial conglomerate, with operations in various industrial, retail and distribution businesses, all of which have been divested. In 1997, we embarked on a multi-phase growth plan focused on serving the specialized information management needs of local governments nationwide. We entered the local government IT market through a series of strategic acquisitions in 1998 and 1999.

MARKET OVERVIEW

The state and local government market is one of the largest and most decentralized IT markets in the country, consisting of all 50 states, approximately 3,000 counties, 36,000 cities and towns and 13,900 school districts. This market is also comprised of approximately 37,000 special districts and other agencies, each with specialized delegated responsibilities and unique information management requirements.

Traditionally, local government bodies and agencies performed state-mandated duties, including property assessment, record keeping, road maintenance, law enforcement, administration of election and judicial functions, and the provision of welfare assistance. Today, a host of emerging and urgent issues are confronting local governments, each of which demands a service response. These areas include criminal justice and corrections, administration and finance, public safety, health and human services, planning, regulatory and maintenance and records and document management. Transfers of responsibility from the federal and state governments to county and municipal governments and agencies in these and other areas also place additional service and financial requirements on these local government units. In addition, constituents of local governments are increasingly demanding improved service and better access to information from public entities. As a result, local governments recognize the increasing value of information management systems and services to, among other things, improve revenue collection, provide increased access to information, and streamline delivery of services to their constituents. Local government bodies are now recognizing that “e-government” is an additional responsibility for community development. From integrated tax systems to integrated civil and criminal justice information systems, many counties and cities have benefited significantly from the implementation of jurisdiction-wide systems that allow different agencies or government offices to share data and provide a more comprehensive approach to information management. Many city and county governmental agencies also have unique individual information management requirements, which must be tailored to the specific functions of each particular office.

Many local governments also have difficulties attracting and retaining the staff necessary to support their IT functions. As a result, they seek to establish long-term relationships with reliable providers of high quality IT products and services such as Tyler.

Although local governments generally face budgetary constraints in their operations, their primary revenue sources are usually property taxes, and to a lesser extent, utility billings and other fees, which historically tend to be relatively stable. In addition, the acquisition of new technology typically enables local governments to operate more efficiently, and often provides a measurable return on investment that justifies the purchase of software and related services.

Gartner, Inc., a leading information technology research and advisory company, estimates that state and local government application and vertical specific software spending will grow from $11.6 billion in 2016 to $14.0 billion in 2019. The professional services and support segments of the market are expected to expand from $32.4 billion in 2016 to $35.6 billion in 2019. Application and vertical


specific software sales in the primary and secondary education segment

s of the market is expected to expand from $2.1 billion in 2016 to $2.6 billion in 2019 while professional services and support are expected to grow from $2.3 billion in 2016 to $2.6 billion in 2019.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

We provide a comprehensive and flexible suite of products and services that addresses the information technology needs of cities, counties, schools and other local government entities. We derive our revenues from five primary sources:

•

sales of software licenses and royalties;

•

subscr

iption-based arrangements;

•

software services;

•

maintenance and support; and

•

appraisal services.

We design, develop, market and support a broad range of software solutions to serve mission-critical “back-office” functions of local governments. Many of our software applications include Internet-accessible solutions that allow for real-time public access to a variety of information or that allow the public to transact business with local governments via the Internet. Our software solutions and services are generally grouped in six major areas:

•

Financial Management and Education;

•

Courts and Justice;

•

Public Safety:

•

Property Appraisal and Tax;

•

Planning, Regulatory and Maintenance; and

•

Land and Vital Records Management.

Each of our core software systems consists of several fully integrated applications. For clients who acquire software for use in-house, we generally license our systems under standard perpetual license agreements that provide the client with a fully paid, nonexclusive, nontransferable right to use the software. In some of the product areas, such as financial management and education and property appraisal and tax, we offer multiple solutions designed to meet the needs of different sized governments.

We also offer SaaS arrangements, which utilize the Tyler private cloud, for clients who do not wish to maintain, update and operate these systems or to make up-front capital expenditures to implement these advanced technologies. For these clients, we deliver our software using the SaaS model — the software and client data are hosted at our data centers or at third-party locations, and clients typically sign multi-year contracts for these subscription-based services.

Historically, we have had a greater proportion of our annual revenues in the second half of our fiscal year due to governmental budget and spending cycles and the timing of system implementations for clients desiring to “go live” at the beginning of the calendar year.


A description of our suites of products and servic

es follows:

Software Licenses

Financial Management and Education

Our financial management and education solutions are enterprise resource planning systems for local governments, which integrate information across all facets of a client organization. Our financial management solutions include modular fund accounting systems that can be tailored to meet the needs of virtually any government agency or not-for-profit entity. Our financial management systems include modules for general ledger, budget preparation, fixed assets, requisitions, purchase orders, bid management, accounts payable, contract management, accounts receivable, investment management, inventory control, project and grant accounting, work orders, job costing, GASB reporting, payroll and human resources. All of our financial management systems are intended to conform to government auditing and financial reporting requirements and generally accepted accounting principles.

We sell utility billing systems that support the billing and collection of metered and non-metered services, along with multiple billing cycles. Our Web-enabled utility billing solutions allow clients to access information online such as average consumption and transaction history. In addition, our systems can accept secured Internet payments via credit cards and checks.

We also offer specialized products that automate numerous city functions, including municipal courts, parking tickets, equipment and project costing, animal licenses, business licenses, permits and inspections, code enforcement, citizen complaint tracking, ambulance billing, fleet maintenance, and cemetery records management.

In addition to providing financial management systems to K-12 schools, we sell student information systems for K-12 schools, which manage such activities as scheduling, grades and attendance. We also offer student transportation solutions to manage school bus routing optimization, fleet management, field trips and other related functions.

Tyler’s financial management and education solutions include Web components that enhance local governments’ service capabilities by facilitating online access to information for both employees and citizens and enabling online transactions.

Courts and Justice

We offer a complete, fully integrated suite of judicial solutions designed to handle complex, multi-jurisdictional county or statewide implementations as well as single county systems. Our solutions help eliminate duplicate data entry, promote more effective business procedures and improve efficiency across the entire justice process.

Our unified court case management system is designed to automate the tracking and management of information involved in all case types, including criminal, traffic, civil, family, probate and juvenile courts. It also tracks the status of cases, processes fines and fees and generates the specialized judgment and sentencing documents, notices and forms required in the court process. Documents received by the court can be scanned into the electronic case file and easily retrieved for viewing. Documents generated by the court can be electronically signed and automatically attached to the electronic case file. Additional modules automate the management of court calendars, coordinate judge’s schedules and generate court dockets. Our targeted courtroom technologies allow courts to rapidly review calendars, cases and view documents in the courtroom. Courts may also take advantage of our related jury management system.

Our court and law enforcement systems allow the public to access, via the Internet, a variety of information, including non-confidential criminal and civil court records, jail booking and release information, bond and bondsmen information, and court calendars and dockets. In addition, our systems allow cities and counties to accept payments for traffic and parking tickets over the Internet, with a seamless and automatic interface to back-office justice and financial systems.

Our prosecutor system enables state attorney offices to track and manage criminal cases, including detailed victim information and private case notes. Investigative reports and charging instrument documents can be generated and stored for later viewing. Prosecutors can schedule and record the outcome of grand jury hearings. When integrated with the court system, prosecutors can view the electronic case file and related documents, as well as manage witness lists and subpoenas needed for court hearings.

Our supervision system allows pre-trial and probation offices to manage offender caseloads. Supervision officers can track contact schedules, risk/needs assessments and reassessments, detailed drug test results, employment histories, compliance with conditions and


payments of fees and restitution. Documents and forms, like pre-sentence investigations or revocation orders, can be generated and sto

red for easy viewing. When integrated with the jail and court systems, supervision officers can have easy access and quick notification of offenders that have court hearings scheduled, are arrested locally and have new warrants issued.

We also offer a court case management solution that automates and tracks all aspects of municipal courts and offices. It is a fully integrated, graphical application that provides effective case management, document processing and cash/bond management. This system complies with all state reporting and conviction reports and includes electronic reporting and also integrates with certain of our financial management solutions and public safety solutions.

Public Safety

Our public safety software is a fully unified and comprehensive solution for law enforcement, fire and EMS, including 911 / computer aided dispatch (“CAD”), records management, mobile computing, corrections management, Web-based information sharing and decision support. The modules are fully integrated, working off of a common database and providing full functionality between modules, reducing data entry. The software provides fast, efficient dispatching, and quick access to records, reports and actionable information from an agency’s database.

Our 911 / CAD solutions provide real-time, critical response dispatch functions in either single- or multi-jurisdictional environments. When integrated with our records management software, a vital link exists between dispatch and the most comprehensive records database available. Within seconds, the dispatch operator and the officer in the field can access critical information, such as prior incidents and outstanding warrants, increasing officer knowledge and safety. The solutions offer strong geographic information systems integration to help dispatchers quickly locate and send the best response during an emergency. Tyler’s 911 / CAD solutions dramatically improve performance, response time and unit safety.

Our records management solutions for law enforcement and fire track statistical, operational, investigative and management data for inquiry and reporting. The systems create an efficient case processing workflow and help solve crimes with an accessible database that maintains central files on people, places, property, vehicles and criminal activity. Tyler’s public safety records management solutions enable easy access to information and simplify reporting.

Our mobile computing solutions for law enforcement and fire provide instant access to local, state, regional and federal databases via mobile devices. Officers and firefighters can experience the benefits of obtaining critical, real-time information in the field, while saving time by preparing reports directly in their vehicles.

Our jail management systems document and manage information that meets the requirements of a modern jail facility. This includes the booking and housing of persons in custody, supervising defendants on a pre-trial release, maintaining offenders sentenced to local incarceration and billing other agencies for housing inmates. Searching, reporting and tracking features are integrated, allowing reliable, up-to-date access to current arrest and incarceration data, including digital mug shots. Our systems also provide warrant checks for visitors or book-ins, inmate classification and risk assessment, commissary, property and medical processing, automation of statistics, and state and federal reporting.

Our civil processing solutions manage civil process needs from document receipt through service, payment process and final closeout. We also have a mobile electronic citation solution through which law enforcement officers can easily enter citation information in a mobile device, which is automatically uploaded into the court or public safety records management systems, rather than hand-writing citations that must be re-entered into the systems.

We significantly expanded our presence in the public safety market with our acquisition of New World Systems Corporation in November 2015.

Property Appraisal and Tax

We provide systems and software that automate the appraisal and assessment of real and personal property, including record keeping, mass appraisal, inquiry and protest tracking, appraisal and tax roll generation, tax statement processing, and electronic state-level reporting. These systems are image and video-enabled to facilitate the storage of and access to the many property-related documents and for the online storage of digital photographs of properties for use in defending values in protest situations. Other related tax applications are available for agencies that bill and collect taxes, including cities, counties, school tax offices, and special taxing and


collection agencies. These systems support billing, collections, lock box operations, mortgage com

pany electronic payments, and various reporting requirements.

Planning, Regulatory and Maintenance

Our planning, regulatory and maintenance software solutions are designed for public sector agencies such as community development, planning, building, code enforcement, tax and revenues, public works, transportation, land control, environmental, fire safety, storm water management, regulatory controls and engineering.  These solutions help public sector agencies better manage their day-to-day business functions while streamlining and automating the many aspects of their land management, permitting and planning systems.  Our mobile solutions extend automation to the field and Web access brings online services to citizens 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

Land and Vital Records Managemen

t

We also offer a number of specialized software applications designed to help local governments enhance and automate operations involving records and document management. These systems record, scan and index information for the many documents maintained by local governments, such as deeds, mortgages, liens, UCC financing statements and vital records (birth, death and marriage certificates). These applications include fully integrated imaging systems with batch and scan processing capabilities and fully integrated receipting and cashiering systems, as well as, Web-enabled public access.

Our content management solutions allow state and local governments and school districts to capture, deliver, manage and archive electronic information. These solutions streamline the flow of digital information throughout the organization to increase efficiency by transforming paper forms and documents into electronic images that drive key business processes.

Subscription-Based Services

Subscription-based revenue is primarily derived from our SaaS arrangements, which utilize the Tyler private cloud, as well as our transaction based offerings such as e-filing solutions.

We are able to provide the majority of our software products through our SaaS model. The clients who choose this model typically do not wish to maintain, update and operate these systems or make up-front capital expenditures to implement these advanced technologies. The contract terms for these arrangements range from one to 10 years, but are typically contracted for initial periods of three to seven years. The majority of our SaaS or hosting arrangements include additional professional services as well as maintenance and support services. In certain arrangements, the client may also acquire a license to the software.

As part of our subscription-based services, we provide e-filing solutions that simplify the filing and management of court related documents for courts and law offices. Revenues for e-filing are included in subscription-based revenues and are derived from transaction fees and in some cases fixed fee arrangements.

Software Services

We provide a variety of professional IT services to clients who utilize our software products. Virtually all of our clients contract with us for installation, training, and data conversion services in connection with their purchase of Tyler’s software solutions. The complete implementation process for a typical system includes planning, design, data conversion, set-up and testing. At the culmination of the implementation process, an installation team travels to the client’s facility to ensure the smooth transfer of data to the new system. Installation fees are charged separately to clients on either a fixed-fee or hourly charge basis, depending on the contract.

Both in connection with the installation of new systems and on an ongoing basis, we provide extensive training services and programs related to our products and services. Training can be provided in our training centers, onsite at clients’ locations, or at meetings and conferences and can be customized to meet clients’ requirements. The vast majority of our clients contract with us for training services, both to improve their employees’ proficiency and productivity and to fully utilize the functionality of our systems. Training services are generally billed on an hourly or daily basis, along with travel and other expenses.

Maintenance and Support

Following the implementation of our software systems, we provide ongoing software support services to assist our clients in operating the systems and to periodically update the software. Support is provided to clients over the phone or via the Web through help desks


staffed by our client support representatives. For more complicated issue

s, our staff, with the client’s permission, can log on to clients’ systems remotely. We maintain our clients’ software largely through releases that contain improvements and incremental additions of features and functionality, along with updates necessary

because of legislative or regulatory changes.

Virtually all of our software clients contract with us for maintenance and support, which provides us with a significant source of recurring revenue. We generally provide maintenance and support for our on-premises clients under annual, or in some cases, multi-year contracts, with a typical fee based on a percentage of the software product’s license fee. These fees can generally be increased on renewal and may also increase as new license fees increase. Maintenance and support fees are generally paid annually in advance. Most maintenance contracts automatically renew unless the client or Tyler gives notice of termination prior to expiration. Similar support is provided to our SaaS clients and is included in their subscription fees, which are classified as subscription-based revenues.

Appraisal Services

We are the nation’s largest provider of property appraisal outsourcing services for local government taxing authorities. These services include:

•

the physical

inspection of commercial and residential properties;

•

data collection and processing;

•

sophisticated computer analyses for property valuation;

•

preparation of tax rolls;

•

community education regarding the assessment process; and

•

arbitration betw

een taxpayers and the assessing jurisdiction.

Local government taxing authorities normally reappraise properties from time to time to update values for tax assessment purposes and to maintain equity in the taxing process. In some jurisdictions, law mandates reassessment cycles; in others, they are discretionary. While some taxing jurisdictions perform reappraisals in-house, many local governments outsource this function because of its cyclical nature and because of the specialized knowledge and expertise requirements associated with it. Our appraisal services business unit has been in this business since 1938.

In some instances, we also sell property tax and/or appraisal software products in connection with appraisal outsourcing projects, while other clients may only engage us to provide appraisal services. Appraisal outsourcing services are somewhat seasonal in nature to the extent that winter weather conditions reduce the productivity of data collection activities in connection with those projects.

STRATEGY

Our objective is to grow our revenue and earnings organically, supplemented by focused strategic acquisitions. The key components of our business strategy are to:

•

Provide high quality, value–added products and services to our clients

. We compete on the basis of, among other things, delivering to clients our deep domain expertise in local government operations through the highest value products and services in the market. We believe we have achieved a reputation as a premium product and service provider to the local government market.

•

Continue to expand our product and service offerings

. While we already have what we believe to be the broadest line of software products for local governments, we continually upgrade our core software applications and expand our complementary product and service offerings to respond to technological advancements and the changing needs of our clients. In 2010, we began providing e-filing for courts and law offices, which simplifies the filing and management of court related documents. We believe revenue from e-filing solutions will continue to grow over time as more local and state governments mandate electronic document filings. We also offer solutions that allow the public to access data and conduct transactions with local governments, such as paying traffic tickets, property taxes and utility bills via the Internet. We believe that the addition of such features enhances the market appeal of our core products. We have also broadened our offerings of consulting and business process reengineering services. In November


2015, we significantly expanded our presence in the public s

afety software market through the acquisition of New World Systems Corporation.

•

Expand our client base

. We seek to establish long-term relationships with new clients primarily through our sales and marketing efforts. While we currently have clients in all 50 states, Canada, the Caribbean, the United Kingdom, and other international locations, not all of our solutions have achieved nationwide geographic penetration. We intend to continue to expand into new geographic markets by adding sales staff and targeting marketing efforts by solutions in those areas. We also intend to continue to expand our customer base to include more large governments. While our traditional market focus has primarily been on small and mid-sized governments, our increased size and market presence, together with the technological advances and improved scalability of certain of our solutions, are allowing us to achieve increasing success in selling to larger clients. We also expect to expand our presence in international markets by leveraging our leadership position in the United States through the disciplined pursuit of selected opportunities in other countries.

•

Expand our existing client relationships

. Our existing customer base offers significant opportunities for additional sales of solutions and services that we currently offer, but that existing clients do not fully utilize. Add-on sales to existing clients typically involve lower sales and marketing expenses than sales to new clients.

•

Grow recurring revenues

. We have a large recurring revenue base from maintenance and support and subscription-based services, which generated revenues of $357.5 million, or 60% of total revenues, in 2015. We have historically experienced very low customer turnover (approximately 3% annually) and recurring revenues continue to grow as the installed customer base increases. In addition, subscription-based revenues have been our fastest growing revenue category over the past five years, increasing from $31.2 million in 2011 to $111.9 million in 2015.

•

Maximize economies of scale and take advantage of financial leverage in our business

. We seek to build and maintain a large client base to create economies of scale, enabling us to provide value-added products and services to our clients while expanding our operating margins. Because we sell primarily “off-the-shelf” software, increased sales of the same solutions result in incrementally higher gross margins. In addition, we believe that we have a marketing and administrative infrastructure in place that can be leveraged to accommodate significant long-term growth without proportionately increasing selling, general and administrative expenses.

•

Attract and retain highly qualified employees

. We believe that the depth and quality of our operations management and staff is one of our significant strengths, and that the ability to retain such employees is crucial to our continued growth and success. We believe that our stable management team, financial strength and growth opportunities, as well as our leadership position in the local government market, enhance our attractiveness as an employer for highly skilled employees.

•

Pursue selected strategic acquisitions

. While we expect to primarily grow internally, from time to time we selectively pursue strategic acquisitions that provide us with one or more of the following:

•

new products and services to complement our existing offerings;

•

entry into new markets related to local governments; and

•

new clients and/or geographic expansion.

•

Establish strategic alliances

. In January 2007, we announced a strategic alliance with Microsoft Corporation to jointly develop core public sector functionality for Microsoft Dynamics AX to address the unique accounting needs of public sector organizations worldwide. As part of this alliance, we are enhancing Microsoft Dynamics AX with public sector-specific functionality. The arrangement has broadened the functionality of Microsoft Dynamics AX, providing both Tyler and Microsoft with a public sector accounting platform to support their existing and prospective clients well into the future. Microsoft Dynamics AX with public sector functionality was released to the market in August 2011 and is being sold in the United States and internationally through Microsoft’s distribution channels. Tyler is also an authorized Microsoft reseller for the Microsoft Dynamics solutions developed under this arrangement, and we are selling the solutions directly into the government market. Tyler receives license and maintenance royalties on direct and indirect public-sector sales worldwide of the solutions co-developed under this multi-year term relationship.

Our contractual research and development commitment to develop public sector functionality for Microsoft Dynamics AX expires with the release of Dynamics AX 7, which is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2016. We are currently discussing with Microsoft Corporation the possibility of additional research and development beyond Dynamics AX 7. If we cannot agree to terms of any future


commitments, we will continue to provide sustained engineering and technical support for the public sector functionality within Dynamics AX. License and maintenance royalties for all applicable domestic and international sales of Dynamics AX

to public sector entities will continue under the terms of the contract.

SALES, MARKETING, AND CLIENTS

We market our products and services through direct sales and marketing personnel located throughout the United States. Other in-house sales staff focus on add-on sales, professional services and support.

Sales of new systems are typically generated from referrals from other government offices or departments within a county or municipality, referrals from other local governments, relationships established between sales representatives and county or local officials, contacts at trade shows, direct mailings, and direct contact from prospects already familiar with us. We are active in numerous national, state, county, and local government associations, and participate in annual meetings, trade shows, and educational events.

Clients consist primarily of county and municipal agencies, school districts and other local government offices. In counties, clients include the auditor, treasurer, tax assessor/collector, county clerk, district clerk, county and district court judges, probation officers, sheriff, and county appraiser. At municipal government sites, clients include directors from various departments, including administration, finance, utilities, public works, code enforcement, personnel, purchasing, taxation, municipal court, and police. Contracts for software products and services are generally implemented over periods of three months to one year, although some complex implementations may span multiple years, with annually renewing maintenance and support update agreements thereafter. Although either the client or we can terminate these agreements, historically almost all support and maintenance agreements are automatically renewed annually. Contracts for appraisal outsourcing services are generally one to three years in duration. During 2015, approximately 42% of our revenue was attributable to ongoing support and maintenance agreements.

COMPETITION

We compete with numerous local, regional, and national firms that provide or offer some or many of the same solutions and services that we provide. Many of these competitors are smaller companies that may be able to offer less expensive solutions than ours. Many of these firms operate within a specific geographic area and/or in a narrow product or service niche. We also compete with national firms, some of which have greater financial and technical resources than we do, including Oracle Corporation, Infor Lawson, SAP AG, FIS (SunGard), Thomson Reuters Corporation, and Constellation Software, Inc. In addition, we sometimes compete with consulting and systems integration firms, which develop custom systems, primarily for larger governments. We also occasionally compete with central internal information service departments of local governments, which requires us to persuade the end-user department to discontinue service by its own personnel and outsource the service to us.

We compete on a variety of factors, including price, service, name recognition, reputation, technological capabilities, and the ability to modify existing products and services to accommodate the individual requirements of the client. Our ability to offer an integrated system of applications for several offices or departments is often a competitive advantage. Local governmental units often are required to seek competitive proposals through a request for proposal process and some prospective clients use consultants to assist them with the proposal and vendor selection process.

SUPPLIERS

Substantially all of the computers, peripherals, printers, scanners, operating system software, office automation software, and other equipment necessary for the implementation and provision of our software systems and services are presently available from several third-party sources. Hardware is purchased on original equipment manufacturer or distributor terms at discounts from retail. We have not experienced any significant supply problems.

BACKLOG

At December 31, 2015, our estimated revenue backlog was approximately $844.5 million, compared to $702.0 million at December 31, 2014. The backlog represents signed contracts under which the revenue has not been recognized as of year-end. Approximately $476.3 million, or 56%, of the backlog is expected to be recognized during 2016.


INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, AND LICENSES

We regard certain features of our internal operations, software, and documentation as confidential and proprietary and rely on a combination of contractual restrictions, trade secret laws and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property. We generally do not rely on patents. We believe that, due to the rapid rate of technological change in the computer software industry, trade secrets and copyright protection are less significant than factors such as knowledge, ability and experience of our employees, frequent product enhancements, and timeliness and quality of support services. We typically license our software products under non-exclusive license agreements, which are generally non-transferable and have a perpetual term.

EMPLOYEES

At December 31, 2015, we had 3,586 employees. Appraisal outsourcing projects are cyclical in nature and can be widely dispersed geographically. We often hire temporary employees to assist in these projects whose term of employment generally ends with the project’s completion. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relations with our employees to be positive.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS.

An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Investors evaluating our company should carefully consider the factors described below and all other information contained in this Annual Report. Any of the following factors could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Additional factors and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could also harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. This section should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and related Notes and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this Annual Report. We may make forward-looking statements from time to time, both written and oral. We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Risks Associated with Our Software Products

Cyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities can disrupt our business and harm our competitive position.

Threats to IT security can take a variety of forms. Individuals and groups of hackers, and sophisticated organizations including state-sponsored organizations, may take steps that pose threats to our clients and our IT. They may develop and deploy malicious software to attack our products and services and gain access to our networks and data centers, or act in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. Cyber threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and clients. Breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our clients and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to


improve technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our business. Our business policies and internal secu

rity controls may not keep pace with these evolving threats.

We cannot fully protect client information from security breaches.

As we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable and other confidential information of our clients. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improve security controls, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of client data that we store and manage. Improper disclosure could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to clients, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.

Hosting services for some of our products are dependent upon the uninterrupted operation of data centers.

A material portion of our business is provided through software hosting services. These hosting services depend on the uninterrupted operation of data centers and the ability to protect computer equipment and information stored in these data centers against damage that may be caused by natural disaster, fire, power loss, telecommunications or Internet failure, acts of terrorism, unauthorized intrusion, computer viruses, and other similar damaging events. If any of our data centers were to become inoperable for an extended period, we might be unable to fulfill our contractual commitments. Although we take what we believe to be reasonable precautions against such occurrences, we can give no assurance that damaging events such as these will not result in a prolonged interruption of our services, which could result in client dissatisfaction, loss of revenue, and damage to our business.

We run the risk of errors or defects with new products or enhancements to existing products.

Our software products are complex and may contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. Although we have not experienced material adverse effects from any such defects or errors to date, we cannot assure you that material defects and errors will not be found in the future. Any such defects could result in a loss of revenues or delay market acceptance. Our license agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability. However, it is possible we may not always successfully negotiate such provisions in our client contracts or the limitation of liability provisions may not be effective due to existing or future federal, state, or local laws, ordinances, or judicial decisions. Although we maintain errors and omissions and general liability insurance, and we try to structure contracts to limit liability, we cannot assure you that a successful claim could not be made or would not have a material adverse effect on our future operating results.

We must timely respond to technological changes to be competitive.

The market for our products is characterized by technological change, evolving industry standards in software technology, changes in client requirements, and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. The introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable. As a result, our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to enhance existing products and develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasingly sophisticated client requirements, and achieve market acceptance. We cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and cost-effective manner. The products, capabilities, or technologies developed by others could also render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. Our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to develop or acquire new software products or develop enhancements to existing products on a timely and cost-effective basis, or if such new products or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance.

We may be unable to protect our proprietary rights.

Many of our product and service offerings incorporate proprietary information, trade secrets, know-how, and other intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of contracts, copyrights, and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. We cannot be certain that we have taken all appropriate steps to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property. There has also been significant litigation recently involving intellectual property rights. We are not currently involved in any material intellectual property litigation; however, we may be a party to such litigation in the future to protect our proprietary information, trade secrets, know-how, and other intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that third-parties will not assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us with respect to current or future products. Any claims or litigation, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, costly, and a diversion to management. Any such claims and litigation could also cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements. Such royalty or licensing arrangements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Therefore, litigation to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, regardless of the final outcome of such litigation.


Clients may elect to terminate our maint

enance contracts and manage operations internally.

It is possible that our clients may elect to not renew maintenance contracts for our software, trying instead to maintain and operate the software themselves using their perpetual license rights (excluding software applications that we provide on a hosted or cloud basis). This could adversely affect our revenues and profits. Additionally, they may inadvertently allow our intellectual property or other information to fall into the hands of third-parties, including our competitors, which could adversely affect our business.

Material portions of our business require the Internet infrastructure to be further developed or adequately maintained.

Part of our future success depends on the use of the Internet as a means to access public information and perform transactions electronically, including, for example, electronic filing of court documents. This in part requires the further development and maintenance of the Internet infrastructure. Among other things, this further development and maintenance will require a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity, security, and timely development of complementary products for providing reliable Internet access and services. If this infrastructure fails to be further developed or be adequately maintained, our business would be harmed because users may not be able to access our government portals.

Risks Associated with Selling Products and Services into the Public Sector Marketplace

Selling products and services into the public sector poses unique challenges.

We derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of software and services to state, county, and city governments, other municipal agencies, and other public entities. We expect that sales to public sector clients will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues in the future. We face many risks and challenges associated with contracting with governmental entities, including:

•

resource limitations caused by budgetary constraints, which may provide for a termination of executed contracts due to a lack of future funding;

•

long and complex sales cycles;

•

contract payments at times being subject to achieving implementation milestones, and we may have differences with clients as to whether milestones have been achieved;

•

political resistance to the concept of contracting with third-parties to provide IT solutions;

•

legislative changes affecting local government’s authority to contract with third-parties;

•

varying bid procedures and internal processes for bid acceptance; and

•

various other political factors, including changes in governmental administrations and personnel.

Each of these risks is outside our control. If we fail to adequately adapt to these risks and uncertainties, our financial performance could be adversely affected.

A prolonged economic slowdown could harm our operations.

A prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce demand for our software products and services. Local and state governments may face financial pressures that could in turn affect our growth rate and profitability in the future. There is no assurance that local and state spending levels will be unaffected by declining or stagnant general economic conditions, and if budget shortfalls occur, they may negatively impact local and state IT spending and could adversely affect our business.

A decline in the demand for IT may result in a decrease in our revenues or lower our growth rate.

A decline in the demand for IT among our current and prospective clients may result in decreased revenues or a lower growth rate because our sales depend, in part, on our clients’ level of funding for new or additional IT systems and services. Moreover, demand for our solutions may be reduced by a decline in overall demand for computer software and services. We cannot assure you that we will be able to increase or maintain our revenues.

The open bidding process creates uncertainty in predicting future contract awards.

Many governmental agencies purchase products and services through an open bidding process. Generally, a governmental entity will publish an established list of requirements requesting potential vendors to propose solutions for the established requirements. To respond successfully to these requests for proposals, we must accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract, the time required to establish operations for the proposed client, and the likely terms of any other third-party proposals submitted. We cannot guarantee that we will win any bids in the future through the request for proposal process, or that any winning bids will


ultimately result in contracts on favorable terms. Our failure to secure contracts through the open bidding process, or to sec

ure such contracts on favorable terms, may adversely affect our revenue and gross margins.

We face significant competition from other vendors and potential new entrants into our markets.

We believe we are a leading provider of integrated solutions for the public sector. However, we face competition from a variety of software vendors that offer products and services similar to those offered by us, as well as from companies offering to develop custom software. We compete based on a number of factors, including:

•

the attractiveness of our “evergreen” business strategy;

•

the breadth, depth, and quality of our product and service offerings;

•

the ability to modify our offerings to accommoda

te particular clients’ needs;

•

technological innovation;

•

name recognition;

•

price; and

•

our financial strength and stability.

We believe the market is highly fragmented with a large number of competitors that vary in size, product platform, and product scope. Our competitors include consulting firms, publicly held companies that focus on selected segments of the public sector market, and a significant number of smaller, privately held companies. Certain competitors have greater technical, marketing, and financial resources than we do. We cannot assure you that such competitors will not develop products or offer services that are superior to our products or services or that achieve greater market acceptance.

We also compete with internal, centralized IT departments of governmental entities, which requires us to persuade the end-user to stop the internal service and outsource to us. In addition, our clients and prospective clients could elect to provide information management services internally through new or existing departments, which could reduce the market for our services.

We could face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the public sector software application market and new products and technologies are introduced. Increased competition could result in pricing pressure, fewer client orders, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share. Current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third-parties, thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective clients. It is possible that new competitors or alliances may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect upon our business.

Fixed-price contracts may affect our profits.

Some of our contracts are on a fixed-priced basis, which can lead to various risks, including:

•

the failure to accurately estimate t

he resources and time required for an engagement;

•

the failure to effectively manage our clients’ expectations regarding the scope of services delivered for a fixed fee; and

•

the failure to timely and satisfactorily complete fixed-price engagements wit

hin budget.

If we do not adequately assess these and other risks, we may be subject to cost overruns and penalties, which may harm our financial performance.

Changes in the insurance markets may affect our business.

Some of our clients, primarily those for our property appraisal services, require that we secure performance bonds before they will select us as their vendor. In addition, we have in the past been required to provide letters of credit as security for the issuance of a performance bond. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to secure such performance bonds in the future on terms that are favorable to us, if at all. Our inability to obtain performance bonds on favorable terms or at all could impact our future ability to win some contract awards, particularly large property appraisal services contracts, which could negatively impact revenues. In addition, the general insurance markets experience volatility, which may lead to future increases in our general and administrative expenses and negatively impact our operating results.


Risks Associated with Our Periodic Results and Stock Price

Software revenue recognition rules may require us to delay revenue recognition into future periods.

We have in the past had to, and may in the future be required to, defer revenue recognition for software license fees due to several factors, including whether:

•

license agreements include applications that are under development or other undelivered elements;

•

client contracts require the delivery of services considered essential to the functionality of the software, including significant modifications, customization, or complex interfaces, that could delay product delivery or acceptance;

•

the transaction involves acceptance criteria;

•

the transaction invo

lves contingent payment terms or fees;

•

we are required to accept a fixed-fee services contract; or

•

we are required to provide extended payment terms.

Because of these factors and other specific requirements for software revenue recognition under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, we must have very precise terms in our contracts to recognize revenue upon the delivery and installation of our software or performance of services. Negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions may extend the sales cycle. We are not always able to negotiate terms and conditions that permit revenue recognition at the time of delivery or even upon project completion.

Fluctuations in quarterly revenue could adversely impact our operating results and stock price.

Our revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter for a variety of reasons, including the following:

•

prospective clients’ contracting decisions are often made in

the last few weeks of a quarter;

•

the size of license transactions can vary significantly;

•

clients may unexpectedly postpone or cancel procurement processes due to changes in strategic priorities, project objectives, budget, or personnel;

•

client purchasing processes vary significantly and a client’s internal approval, expenditure authorization, and contract negotiation processes can be difficult and time consuming to complete, even after selection of a vendor;

•

the number, timing, and significance of software product enhancements and new software product announcements by us and our competitors may affect purchase decisions;

•

we may have to defer revenues under our revenue recognition policies; and

•

clients may elect subscription-based arrangements, which result in lower software license revenues in the initial year as compared to traditional, on-premise software license arrangements, but generate higher overall subscription-based revenues over the term of the contract.

In each fiscal quarter, our expense levels, operating costs, and hiring plans are based to some extent on projections of future revenues and are relatively fixed. If our actual revenues fall below expectations, we could experience a reduction in operating results. Also, if actual revenues or earnings for any given quarter fall below expectations, it may lead to a decline in our stock price.

Increases in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues could decrease overall margins.

We realize lower margins on software and appraisal service revenues than on license revenue. The majority of our contracts include both software licenses and software services. Therefore, an increase in the percentage of software service and appraisal service revenue compared to license revenue could have a detrimental impact on our overall gross margins and could adversely affect operating results.

Our stock price may be volatile.

The market price of our common stock may be volatile. Examples of factors that may significantly impact our stock price include:

•

actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;


•

announcements of technological innovations, new products, or new contracts by us or our competitors;

•

developments with respect to p

atents, copyrights, or other proprietary rights;

•

conditions and trends in the software and other technology industries;

•

adoption of new accounting standards affecting the software industry;

•

changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; an

d

•

general market conditions and other factors.

In addition, the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of technology company stocks and may in the future adversely affect the market price of our stock. Sometimes, securities class action litigation is filed following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company’s securities. We cannot assure you that similar litigation will not occur in the future with respect to us. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect upon our financial performance.

Financial Outlook.

From time to time, in press releases and otherwise, we may publish forecasts or other forward-looking statements regarding our results, including estimated revenues or earnings. Any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions. These assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties, and as a matter of course, any number of them may prove to be incorrect. Further, the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors (including those described in this discussion), many of which are beyond our control. As a result, we cannot be certain that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse. Current and potential stockholders are cautioned not to base their entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions, but instead are encouraged to utilize our entire publicly available mix of historical and forward-looking information, as well as other available information regarding us, our products and services, and the software industry when evaluating our prospective results of operations.

Risks Associated with Our Growth Strategy and Other General Corporate Risks

We may experience difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy.

A material portion of our historical growth has resulted from strategic acquisitions. Although our focus is on internal growth, we will continue to identify and pursue strategic acquisitions with suitable candidates. These transactions involve significant challenges and risks, including the transaction does not advance our business strategy, we get no satisfactory return on our investment, we have difficulty integrating business systems and technology, we have difficulty retaining or integrating new employees, the transactions distract management from our other businesses, we acquire unforeseen liabilities, and other unanticipated events. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully integrate future acquisitions into our operations. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits of these transactions, such as increased revenue, enhanced efficiencies, or increased market share, or the benefits may be ultimately smaller than we expected. Although we conduct due diligence reviews of potential acquisition candidates, we may not identify all material liabilities or risks related to acquisition candidates. There can be no assurance that any such strategic acquisitions will be accomplished on favorable terms or will result in profitable operations.

Our failure to properly manage growth could adversely affect our business.

We have expanded our operations significantly since 1998, when we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector. We intend to continue expansion in the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities. This growth places a significant demand on management and operational resources. In order to manage growth effectively, we must implement and improve our operational systems, procedures, and controls on a timely basis. If we fail to implement these systems, our business may be materially adversely affected.

We may be unable to hire, integrate, and retain qualified personnel.

Our continued success will depend upon the availability and performance of our key management, sales, marketing, client support, and product development personnel. The loss of key management or technical personnel could adversely affect us.  We believe that our continued success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract, integrate, and retain such personnel.  We have at times experienced and continue to experience difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel.  Competition for qualified software development, sales, and other personnel is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel.


Compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance may result in additional expenses.

Changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure can create uncertainty for public companies. The costs required to comply with such evolving laws are difficult to predict.  To maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards.  This investment may result in an unforeseen increase in general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities, which may harm our operating results.

We don’t foresee paying dividends on our common stock.

We have not declared or paid a cash dividend since we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector in 1998.  We intend to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business.  We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.

Provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, and Delaware law could deter takeover attempts.

Our board of directors may issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock and may determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions, including voting and conversion rights, of these preferred shares.  These determinations may be made without any further vote or action by our stockholders.  The rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future.  The issuance of preferred stock may make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock.  In addition, some provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, and the Delaware General Corporation Law could also delay, prevent, or make more difficult a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest involving us.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.

Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “TYL.” At December 31, 2015, we had approximately 1,585 stockholders of record. Most of our stockholders hold their shares in street name; therefore, there are substantially more than 1,585 beneficial owners of our common stock.

The following table shows, for the calendar periods indicated, the high and low sales price per share of our common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange.

We did not pay any cash dividends in 2015 or 2014. Our bank credit agreement contains restrictions on the payment of cash dividends. We intend to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business, and, therefore, we do not anticipate declaring a cash dividend in the foreseeable future.

The following table summarizes certain information related to our stock option plan and our employee stock purchase plan. There are no warrants or rights related to our equity compensation plans as of December 31, 2015.


As of December 31, 2015, we had authorization to repurchase up to 1.4 million additional shares of Tyler common stock

.

During 2015, we purchased approximately 5,400 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $645,000. A

summary of the repurchase activity during 2015 is as follows:

The repurchase program, which was approved by our board of directors, was announced in October 2002, and was amended at various times from 2003 through 2011. There is no expiration date specified for the authorization and we intend to repurchase stock under the plan from time to time.

Subsequent to December 31, 2015 and through February 22, 2016, we purchased approximately 241,000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate cash purchase price of $31.3 million.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This document contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are not historical in nature and typically address future or anticipated events, trends, expectations or beliefs with respect to our financial condition, results of operations or business. Forward-looking statements often contain words such as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “foresees,” “forecasts,” “estimates,” “plans,” “intends,” “continues,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “projects,” “might,” “could” or other similar words or phrases. Similarly, statements that describe our business strategy, outlook, objectives, plans, intentions or goals also are forward-looking statements. We believe there is a reasonable basis for our forward-looking statements, but they are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results could differ materially from the expectations and beliefs reflected in the forward-looking statements. We presently consider the following to be among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and beliefs: (1) changes in the budgets or regulatory environments of our clients, primarily local and state governments, that could negatively impact information technology spending; (2) our ability to protect client information from security breaches and provide uninterrupted operations of data centers; (3) our ability to successfully achieve growth or operational synergies through the integration of acquired businesses, while avoiding unanticipated costs and disruptions to existing operations; (4) material portions of our business require the Internet infrastructure to be adequately maintained; (5) our ability to achieve our financial forecasts due to various factors, including project delays by our clients, reductions in transaction size, fewer transactions, delays in delivery of new products or releases or a decline in our renewal rates for service agreements; (6) general economic, political and market conditions; (7) technological and market risks associated with the development of new products or services or of new versions of existing or acquired products or services; (8) competition in the industry in which we conduct business and the impact of competition on pricing, client retention and pressure


for new products or services; (9) the ability to attract and retain qualified

personnel and dealing with the loss or retirement of key members of management or other key personnel; and (10) costs of compliance and any failure to comply with government and stock exchange regulations. A detailed discussion of these factors and other r

isks that affect our business are described in Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements.

OVERVIEW

General

We provide integrated information management solutions and services for the public sector, with a focus on local governments. We develop and market a broad line of software products and services to address the IT needs of cities, counties, schools and other local government entities. In addition, we provide professional IT services to our clients, including software and hardware installation, data conversion, training and for certain clients, product modifications, along with continuing maintenance and support for clients using our systems. We also provide subscription-based services such as software as a service (“SaaS”), which utilizes the Tyler private cloud, and electronic document filing solutions (“e-filing”), which simplify the filing and management of court related documents. Revenues for e-filing are derived from transaction fees and in some cases fixed fee arrangements. We also provide property appraisal outsourcing services for taxing jurisdictions.

Our products generally automate six major functional areas: (1) financial management and education, (2) courts and justice,  (3) public safety (4) property appraisal and tax, (5) planning, regulatory and maintenance, and (6) land and vital records management.  We report our results in two segments. The Enterprise Software Solutions (“ESS”) segment provides municipal and county governments and schools with software systems and services to meet their information technology and automation needs for mission-critical “back-office” functions such as financial management; courts and justice processes; public safety; planning, regulatory and maintenance; and land and vital records management. The Appraisal and Tax Software Solutions and Services (“ATSS”) segment provides systems and software that automate the appraisal and assessment of real and personal property as well as property appraisal outsourcing services for local governments and taxing authorities. Property appraisal outsourcing services include: the physical inspection of commercial and residential properties; data collection and processing; computer analysis for property valuation; preparation of tax rolls; community education; and arbitration between taxpayers and the assessing jurisdiction.

Total organic revenues increased 17% in 2015 compared to 2014.

On November 16, 2015, we acquired all of the capital stock of New World Systems Corporation (“NWS”), which provides public safety and financial solutions for local governments.  The purchase price, net of cash acquired of $22.5 million, was $337.5 million in cash, of which $4.0 million was accrued at December 31, 2015, and 2.1 million shares of Tyler common stock valued at $362.8 million.

On May 29, 2015, we acquired all of the capital stock of Brazos Technology Corporation (“Brazos”), which provides mobile hand held solutions primarily to law enforcement agencies for field accident reporting and electronically issuing citations.  The purchase price, net of cash acquired and including debt assumed, was $6.1 million in cash and 12,500 shares of Tyler common stock valued at $1.5 million.

The operating results of NWS and Brazos are included with the operating results of the Enterprise Software Solutions segment since their respective dates of acquisition.

We monitor and analyze several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance. These indicators include the following:

·

Revenues – We derive our revenues from five primary sources: sale of software licenses and royalties; subscription-based arrangements; software services; maintenance and appraisal services. Subscriptions and maintenance are considered recurring revenue sources and comprised approximately 60% of our revenue in 2015. The number of new SaaS clients and the number of existing clients who convert from our traditional software arrangements to our SaaS model are a significant driver to our business, together with new software license sales and maintenance rate increases. In addition, we also monitor our customer base and churn as we historically have experienced very low customer turnover. During 2015, based on our number of customers, turnover was approximately 3%.

·

Cost of Revenues and Gross Margins – Our primary cost component is personnel expenses in connection with providing software implementation, subscription-based services, maintenance and support, and appraisal services to our clients. We can improve gross margins by controlling headcount and related costs and by expanding our revenue base, especially from those products and services that produce incremental revenue with minimal incremental cost, such as software licenses and royalties, subscription-based services, and maintenance and support. Our appraisal projects are cyclical in nature, and we often


employ appraisal personnel on a short-term basis to coincide with the life of a project. As of December 31, 2015, our total employee count increased to 3,586 from 2,856 at December 31, 2014. This increase includes 513 employees a

dded as a result of acquisitions completed in 2015

·

Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Expenses – The primary components of SG&A expenses are administrative and sales personnel salaries and commissions, share-based compensation expense, marketing expense, rent and professional fees. Sales commissions typically fluctuate with revenues and share-based compensation expense generally increases when the market price of our stock increases. Other administrative expenses tend to grow at a slower rate than revenues. In 2015, SG&A expenses include approximately $5.9 million for financial advisory, legal, accounting, due diligence, valuation and other various services necessary to complete the NWS acquisition.

·

Liquidity and Cash Flows – The primary driver of our cash flows is net income. Uses of cash include acquisitions, capital investments in property and equipment and discretionary purchases of treasury stock. Our working capital needs are fairly stable throughout the year with the significant components of cash outflows being payment of personnel expenses offset by cash inflows representing collection of accounts receivable and cash receipts from clients in advance of revenue being earned. In recent years, we have also received significant amounts of cash from employees exercising stock options and contributing to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

Balance Sheet – Cash, accounts receivable and days sales outstanding and deferred revenue balances are important indicators of our business.

New Accounting Pronouncements

On May 28, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.” This ASU is the result of a convergence project between the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board. The core principle behind ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for delivering those goods and services. This model involves a five-step process that includes identifying the contract with the customer, identifying the performance obligations in the contract, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction prices to the performance obligations in the contract and recognizing revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies the performance obligations. The guidance in the ASU supersedes existing revenue recognition guidance and is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with early application not permitted. The ASU allows two methods of adoption; a full retrospective approach where three years of financial information are presented in accordance with the new standard, and a modified retrospective approach where the ASU is applied to the most current period presented in the financial statements.

On August 12, 2015, the FASB voted for a one-year deferral of the effective date of the new standard and now requires application of the new standard no later than annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods therein. However, under the proposal, public entities would be permitted to elect to early adopt the new standard as of the original effective date.  We currently expect to adopt the new standard in fiscal year 2018 in accordance with the revised effective date.

Outlook

Activity in the local government software market continues to be good, and with the inclusion of NWS, our backlog at December 31, 2015 reached $844.5 million, a 20% increase from last year. With our strong financial position and cash flow, we plan to accelerate our investment in product development with expected research and development expense of approximately $47.0 million. We believe that increasing the investment in our products will better position us to continue to expand our competitive position in the public sector software market over the long term.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues, cost of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, and related disclosure of contingencies. The Notes to the Financial Statements included as part of this Annual Report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the application of the percentage-of-completion and proportional performance methods of revenue recognition, the carrying amount and estimated useful lives of intangible assets, determination of share-based compensation expense and valuation allowance


for receivables. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that w

e believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimate

s under different assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.

Revenue Recognition

. We recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 605, Revenue Recognition and ASC 985-605, Software Revenue Recognition. Our revenues are derived from sales of software licenses and royalties, subscription-based services, appraisal services, maintenance and support, and services that typically range from installation, training and basic consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer needs. For multiple element software arrangements, which do not entail the performance of services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software, we generally record revenue when the delivered products or performed services result in a legally enforceable and non-refundable claim. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments, which are provided at the time the revenue is recognized. Because most of our customers are governmental entities, we rarely incur a loss resulting from the inability of a customer to make required payments. In a limited number of cases, we encounter a customer who is dissatisfied with some aspect of the software product or our service, and we may offer a “concession” to such customer. In those limited situations where we grant a concession, we rarely reduce the contract arrangement fee, but alternatively may perform additional services, such as additional training or creating additional custom reports. These amounts have historically been nominal. In connection with our customer contracts and the adequacy of related allowances and measures of progress towards contract completion, our project managers are charged with the responsibility to continually review the status of each customer on a specific contract basis. Also, we review, on at least a quarterly basis, significant past due accounts receivable and the adequacy of related reserves. Events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount for the allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments may require revision, include, but are not limited to, deterioration of a customer’s financial condition, failure to manage our customer’s expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered, and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our software products.

We use contract accounting, primarily the percentage-of-completion method, as discussed in ASC 605-35, Construction – Type and Certain Production – Type Contracts, for those software arrangements that involve significant production, modification or customization of the software, or where our software services are otherwise considered essential to the functionality of the software. We measure progress-to-completion primarily using labor hours incurred, or value added. In addition, we recognize revenue using the proportional performance method of revenue recognition for our property appraisal projects, some of which can range up to five years. These methods rely on estimates of total expected contract revenue, billings and collections and expected contract costs, as well as measures of progress toward completion. We believe reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and costs and progress applicable to various stages of a contract can be made. At times, we perform additional and/or non-contractual services for little to no incremental fee to satisfy customer expectations. If changes occur in delivery, productivity or other factors used in developing our estimates of expected costs or revenues, we revise our cost and revenue estimates, and any revisions are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision first become known. In connection with these and certain other contracts, we may perform the work prior to when the services are billable and/or payable pursuant to the contract. The termination clauses in most of our contracts provide for the payment for the value of products delivered and services performed in the event of an early termination.

For SaaS arrangements, we evaluate whether the customer has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and whether the customer can feasibly maintain the software on the customer’s hardware or enter into another arrangement with a third-party to host the software. If we determine that the customer has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and can feasibly maintain the software on the customer’s hardware or enter into another arrangement with a third-party to host the software, we recognize the license, professional services and hosting services revenues pursuant to ASC 985-605, Software Revenue Recognition. For SaaS arrangements that do not meet the criteria for recognition under ASC 985-605, we account for the elements under ASC 605-25, Multiple Element Arrangements using all applicable facts and circumstances, including whether (i) the element has stand-alone value, (ii) there is a general right of return and (iii) the revenue is contingent on delivery of other elements. We allocate the contract value to each element of the arrangement that qualifies for treatment as a separate element based on vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”), and if VSOE is not available, third-party evidence, and if third-party evidence is unavailable, estimated selling price. For professional services associated with SaaS arrangements that we determine do not have stand-alone value to the customer or are contingent on delivery of other elements, we recognize the services revenue ratably over the remaining contractual period once hosting has gone live and we may begin billing for the hosting services. We record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenues, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.


In connection with certain of our contracts, we have recorded retentions receivable or unbilled receivables consisting of costs and estimated profit in excess of billings as of the balance s

heet date. Many of the contracts which give rise to unbilled receivables at a given balance sheet date are subject to billings in the subsequent accounting period. We review unbilled receivables and related contract provisions to ensure we are justified in

recognizing revenue prior to billing the customer and that we have objective evidence which allows us to recognize such revenue. In addition, we have a sizable amount of deferred revenue, which represents billings in excess of revenue earned. The majority

of this liability consists of maintenance billings for which payments are made in advance and the revenue is ratably earned over the maintenance period, generally one year. We also have deferred revenue for those contracts in which we receive a deposit an

d the conditions in which to record revenue for the service or product has not been met. On a periodic basis, we review by customer the detail components of our deferred revenue to ensure our accounting remains appropriate.

Intangible Assets and Goodwill

. Our business acquisitions typically result in the creation of goodwill and other intangible asset balances, and these balances affect the amount and timing of future period amortization expense, as well as expense we could possibly incur as a result of an impairment charge. The cost of acquired companies is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets based on estimated fair value, with the excess allocated to goodwill. Accordingly, we have a significant balance of acquisition date intangible assets, including software, customer related intangibles, trade name, leases and goodwill. These intangible assets (other than goodwill) are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We currently have no intangible assets with indefinite lives other than goodwill.

When testing goodwill for impairment quantitatively, we first compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a second step is performed to measure the amount of potential impairment. In the second step, we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized. The fair values calculated in our impairment tests are determined using discounted cash flow models involving several assumptions. The assumptions that are used are based upon what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. We evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value calculations of our reporting units by comparing the total of the fair value of all of our reporting units to our total market capitalization.

Our annual goodwill impairment analysis, which we performed quantitatively during the second quarter of 2015, did not result in an impairment charge. During 2015, we did not identify any triggering events that would require an update to our annual impairment review.

All intangible assets (other than goodwill) are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of other intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated undiscounted future cash flows. The assessment of recoverability or of the estimated useful life for amortization purposes will be affected if the timing or the amount of estimated future operating cash flows is not achieved. Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; and reductions in growth rates. In addition, products, capabilities, or technologies developed by others may render our software products obsolete or non-competitive. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets.

Share-Based Compensation.

We have a stock option plan that provides for the grant of stock options to key employees, directors and non-employee consultants. We estimate the fair value of share-based awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Share-based compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures, which will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ from such estimates. Changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods. Forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data. We estimate stock price volatility at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock. Estimated option life is determined using the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to be outstanding based primarily on the options’ vesting terms, remaining contractual life and the employees’ expected exercise based on historical patterns. Determining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment, including estimating stock price volatility, expected option life and forfeiture rates.


ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OTHER

The following discussion compares the historical results of operations on a basis consistent with GAAP for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

2015 Compared to 2014

Revenues

On November 16, 2015, we acquired NWS, which provides public safety and financial solutions for local governments and its operating results are included with the operating results of the ESS segment since the date of acquisition. The following table details revenue for NWS for the period from November 16, 2015 to December 31, 2015, which is included in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income:

In May 2015, we acquired a company which provides mobile hand-held solutions primarily to law enforcement agencies for field accident reporting and electronically issuing citations. In August 2014, we acquired a company which provides civil process management, typically to county sheriff departments. The impact of these acquisitions on our operating results are not considered


material an

d are not included in the table above.  The results of their operations are included in our ESS segment from their respective dates of acquisition.

Software licenses and royalties.

The following table sets forth a comparison of our software licenses and royalties revenue for the years ended December 31:

Excluding the results of acquisitions, software license revenue increased 15% compared to the prior year. The majority of this growth was due to a more active marketplace as the result of improvement in local government economic conditions, as well as our increasingly strong competitive position, which we attribute in part to our investment in product development in recent years. In addition, add-on sales to our existing customer base for courts and justice related solutions that assist and support the transition to a paperless environment increased approximately $1.3 million.

Although the mix of new contracts between subscription-based and perpetual license arrangements may vary from quarter to quarter and year to year,  we expect our longer-term software license growth rate to be negatively impacted by a growing number of customers choosing our subscription-based options, rather than purchasing the software under a traditional perpetual software license arrangement. Subscription-based arrangements result in lower software license revenue in the initial year as compared to perpetual software license arrangements but generate higher overall revenue over the term of the contract.  Our new client mix in 2015 was approximately 76% selecting perpetual software license arrangements and approximately 24%

selecting subscription-based arrangements compared to a client mix in 2014 of approximately 74% selecting perpetual software license arrangements and approximately 26% selecting subscription-based arrangements.  134 new clients entered into subscription-based software arrangements in 2015 compared to 138 new clients in 2014.

Subscriptions.

The following table sets forth a comparison of our subscriptions revenue for the years ended December 31:

Subscription-based services revenue primarily consists of revenue derived from our SaaS arrangements, which utilize the Tyler private cloud. As part of our subscription-based services, we also provide electronic document filing solutions (“e-filing”) that simplify the filing and management of court related documents for courts and law offices. E-filing revenue is derived from transaction fees and fixed fee arrangements.

Subscription-based services revenue increased 27% compared to 2014. E-filing services contributed approximately $7.7 million of the subscriptions revenue increase in 2015.  Most of the e-filing revenue increase related to several statewide contracts, several of which implemented mandatory electronic filing near the end of 2014 and throughout 2015.  New SaaS clients as well as existing clients who converted to our SaaS model provided the remainder of the subscriptions revenue increase.  In 2015, we added 134 new SaaS clients and 66 existing clients elected to convert to our SaaS model.  The average contract sizes in 2015 were 38% and 22% higher than 2014 for new clients and clients converting to our SaaS model, respectively.

Software services.

The following table sets forth a comparison of our software services revenue for the years ended December 31:


Software services revenue primarily consists of professional services billed in connection with implementing our software, converting client data, training client pe

rsonnel, custom development activities and consulting. New clients who purchase our proprietary software licenses generally also contract with us to provide for the related software services. Existing clients also periodically purchase additional training,

consulting and minor programming services. Excluding the results of acquisitions, software services revenue grew 20% compared to the prior year period. This growth is mainly due to much higher revenue from proprietary software arrangements, as well as add

itions to our implementation and support staff, which increased our capacity to deliver backlog.

Maintenance.

The following table sets forth a comparison of our maintenance revenue for the years ended December 31:

We provide maintenance and support services for our software products and certain third-party software. Excluding the results of acquisitions, maintenance revenue grew 12% compared to the prior year. Maintenance and support revenue increased mainly due to growth in our installed customer base from new software license sales as well as annual maintenance rate increases.

Appraisal services.

The following table sets forth a comparison of our appraisal services revenue for the years ended December 31:

The appraisal services business is somewhat cyclical and driven in part by statutory revaluation cycles in various states. Appraisal services revenue benefitted from the addition of several new revaluation contracts, including the City of Detroit, and the current appraisal cycle in Indiana, both of which began in mid-2014.  In mid-2015, Franklin County, Ohio began a full reappraisal cycle, which also contributed to appraisal services revenue.

Cost of Revenues and Gross Margins

The following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues for the years ended December 31:


The following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the years ended December 31:

Software licenses, royalties and acquired software

. Costs of software licenses, royalties and acquired software are primarily comprised of third-party software costs and amortization expense for acquired software. We do not have any direct costs associated with royalties. In 2015, our software licenses, royalties and acquired software gross margin percentage declined compared to the prior year due to much higher amortization expense for acquired software resulting from our acquisition of NWS.  Excluding the results of NWS, our software license, royalties and acquired software gross margin was 93.6% which increased 1.3% from the prior year period mainly due to higher revenues from proprietary software arrangements.

Software services, maintenance and subscriptions

.  Cost of software services, maintenance and subscriptions primarily consists of personnel costs related to installation of our software, conversion of client data, training client personnel and support activities and various other services such as custom client development and on-going operation of SaaS and e-filing arrangements. In 2015, the software services, maintenance and subscriptions gross margin percentage declined compared to the prior year mainly due to onboarding costs associated with accelerated hiring to ensure that we are well-positioned to deliver our current backlog and anticipated new business.  Excluding 285 employees added with acquisitions, our implementation and support staff has grown by 200 employees since December 31, 2014. In addition, in 2015, we incurred $1.4 million more in contract labor cost than 2014 in an effort to maintain flexibility to accommodate fluctuations in demand for professional services. The gross margin decline was somewhat offset  because costs related to maintenance and various other services such as SaaS and e-filing typically grow at a slower rate than related revenue due to leverage in the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale. Price increases also resulted in slightly higher rates on certain services.

Appraisal services

. Appraisal services revenue comprised approximately 4% of total revenue. The appraisal services gross margin increased  2% compared to 2014. A high proportion of the costs of appraisal services revenue are variable, as we often hire temporary employees to assist in appraisal projects, whose term of employment generally ends with the projects’ completion.  The appraisal services gross margin was favorably impacted by operational efficiencies associated with a large revaluation contract that began late 2014.

Our 2015 blended gross margin declined 0.4% compared to 2014.  The gross margin was negatively impacted by increased acquired software amortization expense associated with the NWS acquisition and expenses associated with increased hiring of implementation and development staff in order to expand our capacity to implement our contract backlog.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, travel, share-based compensation expense, commissions and related overhead costs for administrative and sales and marketing employees, as well as, professional fees, trade show activities, advertising costs and other marketing related costs. The following table sets forth a comparison of our SG&A expenses for the following years ended December 31:

SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 22.6% in 2015 compared to 22.0% in 2014. In 2015, our

SG&A expenses

include approximately $5.9 million for financial advisory, legal, ac

counting, due diligence, valuation and other various services necessary to complete the NWS acquisition.  In addition, our 2015 operating results include $4.0 million of SG&A expenses for NWS from the date of acquisition.

The remaining SG&A expense increas

e is mainly due to compensation cost related to increased staff levels, higher stock compensation expense and increased commission expense as a result of higher sales.  Excluding 140

employees added with acquisitions, we have added 16 employees mainly to o

ur sales and finance teams since December 31, 2014. In addition, our 2015 stock compensation expense rose $4.2

million, mainly due to increases in our stock price over the last few years.

Research and Development Expense

Research and development expense consists mainly of costs associated with development of new products and technologies from which we do not currently generate revenue, as well as costs related to the ongoing development efforts for Microsoft Dynamics AX. In February 2015, we announced that our contractual research and development commitment to develop public sector functionality for Microsoft Dynamics AX expires with the release of Dynamics AX 7, which is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2016. We are currently discussing with Microsoft Corporation the possibility of additional research and development beyond Dynamics AX 7. If we cannot agree to terms of any future commitments, we will continue to provide sustained engineering and technical support for the public sector functionality within Dynamics AX. License and maintenance royalties for all applicable domestic and international sales of Dynamics AX to public sector entities will continue under the terms of the contract.

Research and development expense in 2015 includes approximately $1.5 million related to NWS.  The remaining increase compared to 2014 was primarily due to increased staffing to maintain and enhance our competitive position and annual wage adjustments.

Amortization of Customer and Trade Name Intangibles

Acquisition intangibles are comprised of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired that is allocated to acquired software, leases and customer and trade name intangibles. The remaining excess purchase price is allocated to goodwill that is not subject to amortization. Amortization expense related to acquired software is included with cost of revenues, while amortization expense of customer and trade name intangibles is recorded as operating expense. The estimated useful lives of both customer and trade name intangibles range from five to 25 years. The following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of customer and trade name intangibles for the years ended December 31:

In 2015, we completed two acquisitions that increased amortizable customer and trade name intangibles by approximately $127.8 million.  This amount is being amortized over a weighted average period of 15 years. We also added approximately $3.7 million to acquisition related intangibles to reflect the fair value of acquired leases, which will be amortized over the weighted average life of 9 years.

Estimated annual amortization expense relating to customer and trade name acquisition intangibles, excluding acquired software for which the amortization expense is recorded as cost of revenues, for the next five years is as follows (in thousands):


Amortization expense relating to acquired leases will be recorded as a reduction to other income and is expected to be $444,000 in 2016, $444,000 in 2017, $426,000 in 2018, $372,000 in 2019, $313,000 in 2020 and $1.7 million thereafter.

Other income (expense) is comprised of interest income from invested cash, as well as interest expense and non-usage and other fees associated with our revolving credit agreement. Expenses in 2014 were comprised primarily of non-usage and other fees associated with a revolving debt agreement that terminated in August 2014, offset slightly by interest income from invested cash.  In 2015, we had significantly higher invested cash balances than 2014 until we completed the NWS acquisition on November 16, 2015.

Income Tax Provision

The following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the years ended December 31:

The effective income tax rates were different from the statutory United States federal income tax rate of 35% principally due to state income taxes, non-deductible share-based compensation expense, the qualified manufacturing activities deduction, disqualifying incentive stock option dispositions

,

non-deductible meals and entertainment costs and non-deductible transaction costs. A lower qualified manufacturing activities deduction and non-deductible transaction costs related to the NWS acquisition negatively impacted our 2015 effective tax rate.

In the past few years a relatively high amount of excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises have resulted in a reduction in our qualified manufacturing activities deduction.  The qualified manufacturing activities deduction can be limited to a certain level of taxable income on the tax return.  Therefore, any significant items that reduce taxable income, such as excess tax benefits on stock options, can reduce the amount of the qualified manufacturing activities deduction.  We experienced significant stock option exercise activity in 2015 and 2014 that generated excess tax benefits of $45.3 million and $19.4 million, respectively.

2014 Compared to 2013

Revenues

Software licenses and royalties.

The following table sets forth a comparison of our software licenses and royalties revenue for the years ended December 31:

Software license and royalties revenue growth was mainly due to a more active marketplace as the result of improvement in local government economic conditions, as well as our increasingly strong competitive position, which we attribute in part to our increased investments in product development over the past few years.  An increase in the number of larger contracts, in particular in the courts and justice market, also contributed to the growth in license revenue.


Software license revenue was reduced so

mewhat because of a growing number of clients choosing our subscription based options, rather than purchasing the software under a traditional perpetual software license arrangement. 138 new clients entered into subscription-based software arrangements in

2014 compared to 100 new clients in 2013.

Subscriptions.

The following table sets forth a comparison of our subscriptions revenue for the years ended December 31:

Subscription-based services revenue increased 42% compared to 2013. E-filing services contributed approximately $13.3 million of the subscriptions revenue increase in 2014.  Most of the e-filing revenue increase related to higher revenue from a contract with the Texas Office of Court Administration for our Odyssey File and Serve e-filing system for Texas courts (“eFileTexas.gov”) for civil court filings, which was implemented in September 2013.  The state of Texas mandated all counties use eFileTexas.gov.  This contract provided a recurring revenue stream that totaled $17.0 million in 2014.  New SaaS clients as well as existing clients who converted to our SaaS model provided the remainder of the subscriptions revenue increase.  In 2014, we added 138 new SaaS clients and 59 existing clients elected to convert to our SaaS model.

Software services

.

The following table sets forth a comparison of our software services revenue for the years ended December 31:

Software services grew 22% in 2014 mainly due to much higher revenue from new proprietary software arrangements, slightly higher rates on certain services and additions to our professional services staff which increased our capacity to deliver backlog.

Cost of Revenues and Gross Margins

The following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues for the years ended December 31:

The following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the years ended December 31:

Software licenses, royalties and acquired software

. In 2014, our software licenses, royalties and acquired software gross margin percentage increased compared to 2013 mainly due to higher revenues from proprietary software revenues, which have a higher gross margin than third-party software.

Software services, maintenance and subscription-based services

. The software services, maintenance and subscriptions gross margin percentage increased mainly due to revenue from a contract with the Texas Office of Court Administration for eFileTexas.gov to manage e-filing of court documents.  This contract began in September 2013, but we incurred initial startup costs in 2013 for which there were very limited related revenues.  The addition of revenue from this contract since 2013 accounted for most of the gross margin increase.  The gross margin increase was offset somewhat by costs related to accelerated hiring to ensure that we are well-positioned to deliver our current backlog and anticipated new business. Our implementation, development and support staff has increased in 2014 by 215 employees since 2013.

Appraisal services

. The appraisal services gross margin increased slightly compared to 2013. A high proportion of the costs of appraisal services revenue are variable, as we often hire temporary employees to assist in appraisal projects, whose term of employment generally ends with the projects’ completion.

Our blended gross margin for 2014 increased 0.9% from 2013. The gross margin increase was mainly due to a revenue mix that included more software license revenue and subscription revenue and in particular, increased revenue from e-filing in Texas.  This improvement in gross margin was offset somewhat by expenses associated with increased hiring of implementation, development and support staff in order to expand our capacity to implement our contract backlog.

SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 22.0% in 2014 compared to 23.6% in 2013. Approximately one-third of the SG&A expense increase was from higher commission expense due to sales growth.  Stock compensation expense contributed approximately one-


quarter of the increase primarily due to increases in our stock price.  The remaining increase consisted of higher bonuses related to operating results, annual wage adjustments and increased travel expenses.

Other expense, net was primarily comprised of interest expense, non-usage and other fees associated with a revolving line of credit agreement that matured in August 2014, offset somewhat by interest income associated with invested cash balances. Interest expense declined compared to the prior year because we repaid all borrowings under the revolving credit agreement in early 2013, and had no debt outstanding during 2014.

Income Tax Provision

The following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the years ended December 31:

The effective income tax rates were different from the statutory United States federal income tax rate of 35% due to state income taxes, non-deductible share-based compensation expense, the qualified manufacturing activities deduction, disqualifying incentive stock option dispositions and non-deductible meals and entertainment costs. The qualified manufacturing activities deduction increased in 2014, which contributed to a lower effective tax rate.

We experienced significant stock option exercise activity in 2014 and 2013 that generated excess tax benefits of $19.4 million and $28.2 million, respectively. Excess tax benefits reduce tax payments but do not significantly reduce the effective tax rate and can result in limitations on other deductions. In 2013, limitations resulting from excess tax benefits eliminated the qualified manufacturing activities deduction, which negatively impacted our effective tax rate.


FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

As of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $33.1 million compared to $206.2 million at December 31, 2014. We also had $30.9 million invested in investment grade corporate and municipal bonds as of December 31, 2015. These investments mature between 2016 and mid-2017 and we intend to hold these investments until maturity.  Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with several domestic banks and money market funds.  As of December 31, 2015, we had $66.0 million in outstanding borrowings and an outstanding letter of credit totaling $1.5 million in connection with one contract.  We do not believe this letter of credit will be required to be drawn upon.  This letter of credit expires in mid-2016.  We believe our revolving line of credit, cash from operating activities, cash on hand and access to the credit markets provides us with sufficient flexibility to meet our long-term financial needs.

The following table sets forth a summary of cash flows for the years ended December 31:

Net cash provided by operating activities continues to be our primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures. Other potential capital resources include cash on hand, public and private issuances of debt or equity securities, and bank borrowings. It is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets in the future may be limited by economic conditions or other factors. We currently believe that cash provided by operating activities, cash on hand and available credit are sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, income tax obligations, and share repurchases for at least the next twelve months.

In 2015, operating activities provided cash of $89.0 million. Operating activities that provided cash were primarily comprised of net income of $64.9 million, non-cash depreciation and amortization charges of $19.6 million and non-cash share-based compensation expense of $20.2 million. Cash provided by operating activities was negatively impacted in 2015 by tax payments that were $17.1 million higher than the prior year partly due to more taxable income and partly due to timing of stock option exercises and our ability to utilize related excess tax credits to determine estimated tax payments during the year. Our excess tax credit in 2015 was $45.3 million of which, over 70% was generated in the fourth quarter and as a result we recorded a $21.1 million income tax receivable at December 31, 2015. Accounts receivable also increased due to timing of annual maintenance and subscription billings due to growth in our customer base as well as normal maintenance billings of approximately $15.0 million associated with NWS. These negative impacts on operating cash were offset somewhat by growth in deferred maintenance revenue. In general, changes in the balance of deferred revenue are cyclical and primarily driven by the timing of our maintenance renewal billings. Our renewal dates occur throughout the year but our heaviest renewal cycles occur in the second and fourth quarters. In addition, deferred revenue included one unusually large customer deposit of $7.5 million at December 31, 2015.

Days sales outstanding in accounts receivable were 100 days at December 31, 2015, compared to 80 days at December 31, 2014, mainly due to the impact on the DSO calculation of having approximately seven weeks of post-acquisition revenues from NWS but included all of their outstanding accounts receivable at December 31, 2015.  DSOs are calculated based on accounts receivable (excluding long-term receivables, but including unbilled receivables) divided by the quotient of annualized quarterly revenues divided by 360 days. Excluding NWS, DSOs were 79 days at December 31, 2015.

Investing activities used cash of $398.5 million in 2015 compared to $11.6 million in 2014.  On November 16, 2015, we acquired all of the capital stock of NWS, which provides public safety and financial solutions for local governments.  The purchase price, net of cash acquired of $22.5 million, was $337.5 million in cash, of which $4.0 million was accrued at December 31, 2015, and 2.1 million shares of Tyler common stock valued at $362.8 million. On May 29, 2015, we acquired all of the capital stock of Brazos Technology Corporation, which provides mobile hand held solutions primarily to law enforcement agencies for field accident reporting and electronically issuing citations.  The purchase price, net of cash acquired and including debt assumed, was $6.1 million in cash and 12,500 shares of Tyler common stock valued at $1.5 million. On January 30, 2015, we made a $15.0 million investment in convertible preferred stock representing a 20% interest in Record Holdings Pty Limited. We also invested $30.9 million in investment grade corporate and municipal bonds maturing between 2016 and mid-2017. The remaining use of cash was for capital expenditures related to computer equipment, furniture and fixtures in support of internal growth, particularly with respect to growth in our cloud-based offerings. These expenditures were funded from cash generated from operations, cash on hand and bank borrowings.


In 2014, we completed the acquisition of SoftCode, Inc. for a purchase price of $3.5 million in cash, of which $325,000 was accrued at Decem

ber 31, 2014, and 16,540 shares of Tyler common stock valued at $1.5 million. The remaining use of cash in 2014 was comprised primarily of capital expenditures related to computer equipment, furniture and fixtures in support of internal growth. Investing a

ctivities in 2013 included $20.3 million paid in connection with the construction of an office building in Plano, Texas.

Financing activities provided cash of $136.4 million in 2015 compared to $15.4 million in 2014.  Financing activities were comprised of net borrowings of $66.0 million, collections of $27.8 million from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan activity and $45.3 million excess tax benefit from exercises of share-based arrangements. We purchased approximately 5,400 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $645,000 in 2015 and paid $2.1 million in debt issuance costs. Financing activities in 2014 were comprised of collections of $18.8 million from stock option exercises and contributions from the employee stock purchase plan and $19.4 million excess tax benefit from exercises of share-based arrangements.  These increases were offset somewhat by purchases of 294,000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $22.8 million.  Financing activities in 2013 were comprised of collections of $21.8 million from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan activity and $28.2 million excess tax benefit from exercises of share-based arrangements, offset partially by $18.0 million in net payments on our revolving line of credit.

The share repurchase program, which was approved by our board of directors, was announced in October 2002, and was amended at various times from 2003 through 2011.  As of December 31, 2015, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to 1.4 million additional shares of our common stock. Our share repurchase program allows us to repurchase shares at our discretion. Market conditions influence the timing of the buybacks and the number of shares repurchased, as well as the volume of employee stock option exercises. Share repurchases are generally funded using our existing cash balances and borrowings under our credit facility and may occur through open market purchases and transactions structured through investment banking institutions, privately negotiated transactions and/or other mechanisms. There is no expiration date specified for the authorization and we intend to repurchase stock under the plan from time to time.

Subsequent to December 31, 2015 and through February 22, 2016, we purchased approximately 241,000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate cash purchase price of $31.3 million.

On November 16, 2015 we entered into a $300.0 million Credit Agreement (the “Credit Facility”) with various lenders party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent.  The Credit Facility provides for a revolving credit line of $300.0 million with a $10.0 million sublimit for letters of credit.  The Credit Facility matures on November 16, 2020.  Borrowings under the Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital requirements, acquisitions and share repurchases.  In 2015, we paid $2.1 million in related debt issuance costs, which are included with other assets on the accompanying balance sheet.

Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate of either (1)  the Wells Fargo Bank prime rate (subject to certain higher rate determinations) plus a margin of 0.25% to 1.00% or (2) the 30, 60, 90 or 180-day LIBOR rate plus a margin of 1.25% to 2.00%.  In 2015, our effective average interest rate for borrowings was 1.8%.  As of December 31, 2015 our interest rate was 1.6%.  The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets.  The Credit Facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and other financial conditions and prohibits us from making certain investments, advances, cash dividends or loans, and limits incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens.  As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with those covenants.

At December 31, 2015, we had $66.0 million in outstanding borrowings and unused borrowing capacity of $234.0 million under the Credit Facility.

We paid income taxes, net of refunds received, of $27.3

million in 2015, $10.2 million in 2014, and $9.3 million in 2013. We experienced significant stock option exercise activity in 2015 that generated $45.3

million excess tax benefits. Excess tax benefits reduce tax payments but do not significantly reduce the effective tax rate and can result in limitations on other deductions. However, more than 70% of our 2015 excess tax benefit was generated in the fourth quarter of 2015 and as a result we recorded an income tax receivable of $21.1 million, which will reduce income tax payments in 2016. In 2014 and 2013, excess tax benefits were $19.4 million and $28.2 million, respectively.

Excluding acquisitions, we anticipate that 2016 capital spending will be between $31.0 million and $33.0 million. We expect the majority of this capital spending will consist of computer equipment and software for infrastructure replacements and expansion. We also expect to purchase a leased office building in Falmouth, Maine for approximately $10.0 million. We currently do not expect to capitalize significant amounts related to software development in 2016, but the actual amount and timing of those costs, and whether they are capitalized or expensed may result in additional capitalized software development. Capital spending is expected to be funded from existing cash balances, cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving line of credit.


From time to time we engage in discussions with potential acquisition candidates. In order to pursue such opportunities, which could require signifi

cant commitments of capital, we may be required to incur debt or to issue additional potentially dilutive securities in the future. No assurance can be given as to our future acquisition opportunities and how such opportunities will be financed.

We lease office facilities, as well as transportation, computer and other equipment used in our operations under non-cancelable operating lease agreements expiring at various dates through 2022. Most leases contain renewal options and some contain purchase options.

Summarized in the table below are our obligations to make future payments under our Credit Facility and lease obligations at December 31, 2015  (in thousands):

As of December 31, 2015, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, guarantees to third-parties or material purchase commitments, except for the operating lease commitments listed above.

CAPITALIZATION

At December 31, 2015, our capitalization consisted of $66.0 million of outstanding borrowings and $858.9 million of shareholders’ equity.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

Market risk represents the risk of loss that may affect us due to adverse changes in financial market prices and interest rates.

As of December 31, 2015, we had $66.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. Loans under the Credit Facility bear interest, at Tyler’s option, at a per annum rate of either (1)  the Wells Fargo Bank prime rate (subject to certain higher rate determinations) plus a margin of 0.25% to 1.00% or (2) the 30, 60, 90 or 180-day LIBOR rate plus a margin of 1.25% to 2.00%.

In 2015, our effective average interest rate for borrowings was 1.8%.  As of December 31, 2015 our interest rate was 1.6%.  The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets.

Assuming borrowings of $66.0 million, a hypothetical 10% increase in our interest rate at December 31, 2015 for a one year period would result in approximately $106,000 of additional interest rate expense.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

— We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act) designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.  These include controls and procedures designed to ensure that this information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.  Management, with the participation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2015.  Based on this evaluation, the chief


executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our

disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2015.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

— Tyler’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).  Tyler’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to Tyler’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Management assessed the effectiveness of Tyler’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015.  In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Based on our assessment, we concluded that, as of December 31, 2015,  Tyler’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.

Management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of NWS, which is included in our 2015 consolidated financial statements and constituted 57% of total assets as of December 31, 2015 and 2% of revenues for the year then ended.

Tyler’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm who also audited Tyler’s financial statements. Ernst & Young’s attestation report on Tyler’s internal control over financial reporting appears on page F-1 hereof.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

— During the quarter ended December 31, 2015, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f), that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Tyler Technologies, Inc.

We have audited Tyler Technologies, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Tyler Technologies, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.” Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of New World Systems Corporation, which is included in the 2015 consolidated financial statements of Tyler Technologies, Inc. and constituted 57% of total assets as of December 31, 2015 and 2% of revenues for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Tyler Technologies, Inc. also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of New World Systems Corporation.

In our opinion, Tyler Technologies, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Tyler Technologies, Inc. as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 and our report dated February 24, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

RT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Tyler Technologies, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tyler Technologies, Inc. as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Tyler Technologies, Inc. at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has adopted ASU 2015-17 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Tyler Technologies, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 24, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

We provide integrated software systems and related services for the public sector, with a focus on local governments. We develop and market a broad line of software solutions and services to address the information technology (“IT”) needs of cities, counties, schools and other local government entities. In addition, we provide professional IT services, including software and hardware installation, data conversion, training, and for certain customers, product modifications, along with continuing maintenance and support for customers using our systems. We also provide subscription-based services such as software as a service (“SaaS”) arrangements, which utilize the Tyler private cloud, and electronic document filing solutions (“e-filing”). In addition, we provide property appraisal outsourcing services for taxing jurisdictions.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements include our parent company and a subsidiary, which is wholly-owned. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash in excess of that necessary for operating requirements is invested in short-term, highly liquid, income-producing investments. Investments with original maturities of three months or less are classified as cash and cash equivalents, which primarily consist of cash on deposit with several banks and money market funds. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates market value.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

We earn revenue from software licenses, royalties, subscription-based services, software services, post-contract customer support (“PCS” or “maintenance”), hardware, and appraisal services.

Software Arrangements:

For the majority of our software arrangements, we provide services that range from installation, training, and basic consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer needs. If the arrangement does not require significant production, modification or customization or where the software services are not considered essential to the functionality of the software, revenue is recognized when all of the following conditions are met:

i.

persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;

ii.

delivery has occurred;

iii.

our fee is fixed or determinable; and

iv.

collectability is probable.

For multiple element arrangements, each element of the arrangement is analyzed and we allocate a portion of the total arrangement fee to the elements based on the relative fair value of the element using vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”), regardless of any separate prices stated within the contract for each element. Fair value is considered the price a customer would be required to pay if the element was sold separately based on our historical experience of stand-alone sales of these elements to third-parties. For PCS, we use renewal rates for continued support arrangements to determine fair value. For software services, we use the fair value we charge our customers when those services are sold separately. We monitor our transactions to determine that we maintain and periodically revise VSOE to reflect fair value. In software arrangements in which we have the fair value of all undelivered elements but not of a delivered element, we apply the “residual method,” in compliance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 985-605, Software Revenue Recognition. Under the residual method, if the fair value of all undelivered elements is determinable, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered element(s) and is recognized as revenue assuming the other revenue recognition criteria are met. In software arrangements in which we do not have VSOE for all undelivered elements, revenue is deferred until fair value is determined or all elements for which we do not have VSOE have been delivered. Alternatively, if sufficient VSOE does not exist and the only undelivered element is services that do not involve significant modification or customization of the software, the entire fee is recognized over the period during which the services are expected to be performed.

F-7

Software Licenses and Royalties

We recognize the revenue allocable to software licenses and specified upgrades upon delivery of the software product or upgrade to the customer, unless the fee is not fixed or determinable or collectability is not probable. If the fee is not fixed or determinable, software license revenue is generally recognized as payments become due from the customer. If collectability is not considered probable, revenue is recognized when the fee is collected. Arrangements that include software services, such as training or installation, are evaluated to determine whether those services are essential to the product’s functionality.

A majority of our software arrangements involve “off-the-shelf” software. We consider software to be off-the-shelf software if it can be added to an arrangement with minor changes in the underlying code and it can be used by the customer for the customer’s purpose upon installation. For off-the-shelf software arrangements, we recognize the software license fee as revenue after delivery has occurred, customer acceptance is reasonably assured, that portion of the fee represents a non-refundable enforceable claim and is probable of collection, and the remaining services such as training are not considered essential to the product’s functionality.

For arrangements that involve significant production, modification or customization of the software, or where software services are otherwise considered essential, we recognize revenue using contract accounting and apply the provisions of the Construction – Type and Production – Type Contracts as discussed in ASC 605-35, Multiple Elements Arrangements. We generally use the percentage-of-completion method to recognize revenue from these arrangements. We measure progress-to-completion primarily using labor hours incurred, or value added. The percentage-of-completion method generally results in the recognition of reasonably consistent profit margins over the life of a contract because we have the ability to produce reasonably dependable estimates of contract billings and contract costs. We use the level of profit margin that is most likely to occur on a contract. If the most likely profit margin cannot be precisely determined, the lowest probable level of profit in the range of estimates is used until the results can be estimated more precisely. These arrangements are often implemented over an extended time period and occasionally require us to revise total cost estimates. Amounts recognized in revenue are calculated using the progress-to-completion measurement after giving effect to any changes in our cost estimates. Changes to total estimated contract costs, if any, are recorded in the period they are determined. Estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which we first determine that a loss is apparent. For arrangements that include new product releases for which it is difficult to estimate final profitability except to assume that no loss will ultimately be incurred, we recognize revenue under the completed contract method. Under the completed contract method, revenue is recognized only when a contract is completed or substantially complete. Historically these amounts have been immaterial.

We recognize royalty revenue when earned under the terms of our third-party royalty arrangements, provided the fees are considered fixed or determinable and realization of payment is probable. Currently, our third-party royalties are variable in nature and such amounts are not considered fixed or determinable until we receive notice of amounts earned. Typically, we receive notice of royalty revenues earned on a quarterly basis in the quarter immediately following the royalty reporting period.

Software Services

Some of our software arrangements include services considered essential for the customer to use the software for the customer’s purposes. For these software arrangements, both the software license revenue and the services revenue are recognized as the services are performed using the percentage-of-completion contract accounting method. When software services are not considered essential, the fee allocable to the service element is recognized as revenue as we perform the services.

Computer Hardware Equipment

Revenue allocable to computer hardware equipment is recognized when we deliver the equipment and collection is probable.

Post Contract Customer Support

Our customers generally enter into PCS agreements when they purchase our software licenses. PCS includes telephone support, bug fixes, and rights to upgrades on a when-and-if available basis. Our PCS agreements are typically renewable annually. Revenue allocated to PCS is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period the PCS is provided. All significant costs and expenses associated with PCS are expensed as incurred.

Subscription-Based Services:

Subscription-based services consist of revenues derived from SaaS arrangements, which utilize the Tyler private cloud, and electronic filing transactions.

For SaaS arrangements, we evaluate whether the customer has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and whether the customer can feasibly maintain the software on the customer’s hardware or enter into another arrangement with a third-party to host the software. In cases where the customer has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and the customer can feasibly

F-8

maintain the software on the customer’s hardware or enter into another arrangement with a third-party to host the software, we recognize the license, professional services and hostin

g services revenues pursuant to ASC 985-605, Software Revenue Recognition.

For SaaS arrangements that do not meet the criteria for recognition under ASC 985-605, we account for the elements under ASC 605-25, Multiple Element Arrangements, using all applicable facts and circumstances, including whether (i) the element has stand-alone value, (ii) there is a general right of return and (iii) the revenue is contingent on delivery of other elements. We allocate contract value to each element of the arrangement that qualifies for treatment as a separate element based on VSOE, and if VSOE is not available, third-party evidence, and if third-party evidence is unavailable, estimated selling price. We recognize hosting services ratably over the term of the arrangement, which range from one to 10 years but are typically for a period of three to seven years. For professional services associated with SaaS arrangements that we determine do not have stand-alone value to the customer or are contingent on delivery of other elements, we recognize the services revenue ratably over the remaining contractual period once we have provided the customer access to the software and we may begin billing for hosting services. We record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenues, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.

Electronic filing transaction fees primarily pertain to documents filed with the courts by attorneys and other third-parties via our e-filing services and retrieval of filed documents via our access services. The elements for these arrangements are accounted for under ASC 605-25. For each document filed with a court, the filer generally pays a transaction fee and a court filing fee to us and we remit a portion of the transaction fee and the filing fee to the court. We record as revenue the transaction fee, while the portion of the transaction fee remitted to the courts is recorded as cost of sales as we are acting as a principal in the arrangement. Court filing fees collected on behalf of the courts and remitted to the courts are recorded on a net basis and thus do not affect the statement of comprehensive income. In some cases, we are paid on a fixed fee basis and recognize the revenue ratably over the contractual period.

Costs of performing services under subscription-based arrangements are expensed as incurred, except for certain direct and incremental contract origination and set-up costs associated with SaaS arrangements. Such direct and incremental costs are capitalized and amortized ratably over the related SaaS hosting term.

Appraisal Services:

For our property appraisal projects, we recognize revenue using the proportional performance method of revenue recognition since many of these projects are implemented over one to three year periods and consist of various unique activities. Under this method of revenue recognition, we identify each activity for the appraisal project, with a typical project generally calling for bonding, office set up, training, routing of map information, data entry, data collection, data verification, informal hearings, appeals and project management. Each activity or act is specifically identified and assigned an estimated cost. Costs which are considered to be associated with indirect activities, such as bonding costs and office set up, are expensed as incurred. These costs are typically billed as incurred and are recognized as revenue equal to cost. Direct contract fulfillment activities and related supervisory costs such as data collection, data entry and verification are expensed as incurred. The direct costs for these activities are determined and the total contract value is then allocated to each activity based on a consistent profit margin. Each activity is assigned a consistent unit of measure to determine progress towards completion and revenue is recognized for each activity based upon the percentage complete as applied to the estimated revenue for that activity. Progress for the fulfillment activities is typically based on labor hours or an output measure such as the number of parcel counts completed for that activity. Estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which we first determine that a loss is apparent.

Allocation of Revenue in Statements of Comprehensive Income

In our statements of comprehensive income, we allocate revenue to software licenses, software services, maintenance and hardware and other based on the VSOE of fair value for elements in each revenue arrangement and the application of the residual method for arrangements in which we have established VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements. In arrangements where we are not able to establish VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements, revenue is first allocated to any undelivered elements for which VSOE of fair value has been established. We then allocate revenue to any undelivered elements for which VSOE of fair value has not been established based upon management’s best estimate of fair value of those undelivered elements and apply a residual method to determine the license fee. Management’s best estimate of fair value of undelivered elements for which VSOE of fair value has not been established is based upon the VSOE of similar offerings and other objective criteria.

Other

The majority of deferred revenue consists of unearned support and maintenance revenue that has been billed based on contractual terms in the underlying arrangement with the remaining balance consisting of payments received in advance of revenue being earned under software licensing, subscription-based services, software and appraisal services and hardware installation. Unbilled revenue is not billable at the balance sheet date but is recoverable over the remaining life of the contract through billings made in accordance with contractual agreements. The termination clauses in our contracts generally provide for the payment for the value of products delivered and services performed in the event of an early termination.

F-9

Prepaid expenses and other current assets include direct and

incremental costs such as commissions associated with arrangements for which revenue recognition has been deferred. Such costs are expensed at the time the related revenue is recognized.

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the application of the percentage-of-completion and proportional performance methods of revenue recognition, the carrying amount and estimated useful lives of intangible assets, determination of share-based compensation expense and valuation allowance for receivables. Actual results could differ from estimates.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET

Property, equipment and purchased software are recorded at original cost and increased by the cost of any significant improvements after purchase. We expense maintenance and repairs when incurred. Depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the asset’s estimated useful life or the term of the lease in the case of leasehold improvements. For income tax purposes, we use accelerated depreciation methods as allowed by tax laws.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS

We expensed research and development costs of $29.9 million during 2015, $25.7 million during 2014, and $23.3 million during 2013.

INCOME TAXES

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred taxes arise because of different treatment between financial statement accounting and tax accounting, known as “temporary differences.” We record the tax effect of these temporary differences as “deferred tax assets” (generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the future periods) and “deferred tax liabilities” (generally items that we received a tax deduction for, which have not yet been recorded in the income statement). The deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rules and laws that are expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance would be established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.

On November 20, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2015-17,  Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. The standard amends the current requirement for entities to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Instead, entities will now be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We early adopted this standard during fourth quarter 2015, utilizing the retrospective application as permitted. As such, certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

We have a stock option plan that provides for the grant of stock options to key employees, directors and non-employee consultants. Stock options generally vest after three to six years of continuous service from the date of grant and have a contractual term of 10 years. We account for share-based compensation utilizing the fair value recognition pursuant to ASC 718, Stock Compensation. See Note 9 – “Share-Based Compensation” for further information.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, in connection with our business combinations. Upon acquisition, goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination, which is the reporting unit to which the related acquired technology is assigned. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business unit one level below that operating segment, for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by executive management. We assess goodwill for impairment annually as of April, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable.

When testing goodwill for impairment quantitatively, we first compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a second step is performed to measure the amount of potential

F-10

impairment. In the second step, we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of th

at goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized. The fair values calculated in our impairment tests are determined using discounted cash flow models involving several assumptions. The assumptions that are used are based upon what we believe a hypothetical ma

rketplace participant would use in estimating fair value. We evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value calculations of our reporting units by comparing the total of the fair value of all of our reporting units to our total market capitalization.

Our annual goodwill impairment analysis, which we performed quantitatively during the second quarter of 2015, did not result in an impairment charge.

Other Intangible Assets

We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets other than goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Customer base and acquired software each comprise approximately half of our purchased intangible assets other than goodwill. We review our customer turnover each year for indications of impairment. Our customer turnover has historically been very low. There have been no significant impairments of intangible assets in any of the periods presented.  If indications of impairment are determined to exist, we measure the recoverability of assets by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

We periodically evaluate whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our property and equipment or other long-lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to exist, we measure the recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset or appropriate grouping of assets and the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet. There have been no significant impairments of long-lived assets in any of the periods presented.

COSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE

We capitalize software development costs upon the establishment of technological feasibility and prior to the availability of the product for general release to customers. Software development costs primarily consist of personnel costs and rent for related office space. We begin to amortize capitalized costs when a product is available for general release to customers. Amortization expense is determined on a product-by-product basis at a rate not less than straight-line basis over the product’s remaining estimated economic life. We have not capitalized any internal software development costs in any of the periods presented.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivables, accounts payables, short-term obligations and certain other assets at cost approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. The fair value of our revolving line of credit approximates book value as of December 31, 2015, because our interest rates reset approximately every 30 days or less. See Note 6 – “Revolving Line of Credit” for further discussion.

As of December 2015, we have $30.9 million in investment grade corporate and municipal bonds with maturity dates ranging from 2016 through mid-2017.  We intend to hold these bonds to maturity and have classified them as such.  We believe cost approximates fair value because of the relatively short duration of these investments.  The fair values of these securities are considered Level II as they are based on inputs from quoted prices in markets that are not active or from other observable market data. These investments are included in short-term investments and non-current investments and other assets.

On January 30, 2015, we made a $15.0 million investment in convertible preferred stock representing a 20% interest in Record Holdings Pty Limited, a privately held Australian company specializing in digitizing the spoken word in court and legal proceedings. The fair value of this investment is based on valuations using Level III, unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market value activity and that are significant to the fair value of the investment.

F-11

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK AND UNBILLED RECEIVABLES

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable from trade customers, and investments in marketable securities. Our cash and cash equivalents primarily consists of operating account balances and money market funds, which are maintained at several major domestic financial institutions and the balances often exceed insured amounts. As of December 31, 2015 we had cash and cash equivalents of $33.1 million. We perform periodic evaluations of the credit standing of these financial institutions.

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the size and geographical diversity of our customer base. Historically, our credit losses have not been significant. As a result, we do not believe we have any significant concentrations of credit risk as of December 31, 2015.

We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments, which are provided at the time the revenue is recognized. Since most of our customers are domestic governmental entities, we rarely incur a loss resulting from the inability of a customer to make required payments. Events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount for the allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments may require revision, include, but are not limited to, deterioration of a customer’s financial condition, failure to manage our customer’s expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered, and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our software products.

The following table summarizes the changes in the allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments:

The termination clauses in most of our contracts provide for the payment for the value of products delivered or services performed in the event of early termination. Our property appraisal outsourcing service contracts can range up to three years and, in a few cases, as long as five years, in duration. In connection with these contracts, as well as certain software service contracts, we may perform work prior to when the software and services are billable and/or payable pursuant to the contract. We have historically recorded such unbilled receivables (costs and estimated profit in excess of billings) in connection with (1) property appraisal services contracts accounted for using proportional performance accounting in which the revenue is earned based upon activities performed in one accounting period but the billing normally occurs subsequently and may span another accounting period; (2) software services contracts accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method of revenue recognition using labor hours as a measure of progress towards completion in which the services are performed in one accounting period but the billing for the software element of the arrangement may be based upon the specific phase of the implementation; (3) software revenue for which we have objective evidence that the customer-specified objective criteria has been met but the billing has not yet been submitted to the customer; (4) some of our contracts provide for an amount to be withheld from a progress billing (generally between 5% and 20% retention) until final and satisfactory project completion is achieved; and (5) in a limited number of cases, we may grant extended payment terms, generally to existing customers with whom we have a long-term relationship and favorable collection history.

We have recorded unbilled receivables of $29.7 million and $14.8 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We also have recorded retention receivables of $4.7 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and these retentions become payable upon the completion of the contract or completion of our fieldwork and formal hearings. Unbilled receivables and retention receivables expected to be collected in excess of one year have been included with accounts receivable, long-term portion in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

INDEMNIFICATION

Most of our software license agreements indemnify our customers in the event that the software sold infringes upon the intellectual property rights of a third-party. These agreements typically provide that in such event we will either modify or replace the software so that it becomes non-infringing or procure for the customer the right to use the software. We have recorded no liability associated with these indemnifications, as we are not aware of any pending or threatened infringement actions that are possible losses. We believe the estimated fair value of these intellectual property indemnification clauses is minimal.

We have also agreed to indemnify our officers and board members if they are named or threatened to be named as a party to any proceeding by reason of the fact that they acted in such capacity. We maintain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage to

F-12

protect against any such losse

s. We have recorded no liability associated with these indemnifications. Because of our insurance coverage, we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Certain amounts for previous years have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

On May 28, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.” This ASU is the result of a convergence project between the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board. The core principle behind ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for delivering those goods and services. This model involves a five-step process that includes identifying the contract with the customer, identifying the performance obligations in the contract, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction prices to the performance obligations in the contract and recognizing revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies the performance obligations. The guidance in the ASU supersedes existing revenue recognition guidance and is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with early application not permitted. The ASU allows two methods of adoption; a full retrospective approach where three years of financial information are presented in accordance with the new standard, and a modified retrospective approach where the ASU is applied to the most current period presented in the financial statements.

On August 12, 2015, the FASB voted for a one-year deferral of the effective date of the new standard and now requires application of the new standard no later than annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods therein. However, under the proposal, public entities would be permitted to elect to early adopt the new standard as of the original effective date.  We currently expect to adopt the new standard in fiscal year 2018 in accordance with the revised effective date.

ACQUISITIONS


On November 16, 2015, we acquired all of the capital stock of New World Systems Corporation (“NWS”), which provides public safety and financial solutions for local governments.  The purchase price, net of cash acquired of $22.5 million, was $337.5 million in cash, of which $4.0 million was accrued at December 31, 2015, and 2.1 million shares of Tyler common stock valued at $362.8 million, which was based on the closing price on November 16, 2015. We also incurred fees of approximately $5.9 million for financial advisory, legal, accounting, due diligence, valuation and other various services necessary to complete the acquisition. These fees were expensed in 2015 and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.

Tyler has performed a preliminary valuation analysis of the fair market value of NWS’ assets and liabilities.  The following table summarizes the allocation of the preliminary purchase price as of the acquisition date.

In connection with this transaction we acquired total tangible assets of $70.1 million and assumed liabilities of approximately $61.8 million. We recorded goodwill of $527.6 million, none of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes, and other intangible assets of approximately $264.8 million. Approximately $261.1 million of intangible assets is attributable to customer relationships, acquired software and trade name and will be amortized over a weighted average period of approximately 11 years. Also included in other intangibles is an asset for approximately $3.7 million to reflect the fair value of existing lease agreements, and this intangible will be amortized over the weighted average life of these lease agreements of approximately 9 years and reduces other income. In

F-13

addition, we recorded deferred tax liabilities of $104.5 million related to estimated fair value allocations. We believe this transaction will broaden our courts

and justice software solutions and will create a unique end-to-end enterprise criminal justice solution. We believe that likely market participants for this transaction would be entities with a presence in the judicial and public safety markets. Therefore

, the goodwill of $527.6 million arising from this acquisition is primarily attributed to our ability to integrate NWS solutions with our existing portfolio and generate increased revenues, earnings and cash flow. As of December 31, 2015, the purchase pric

e allocation for NWS is not yet complete. The preliminary estimates of fair value assumed at the acquisition date for intangible assets, receivables and deferred revenue and related deferred taxes are subject to change as valuations are finalized.

The following unaudited pro forma information of the consolidated results of operations have been prepared as if the NWS acquisition had occurred at January 1, 2014, after giving effect to certain adjustments, including amortization of intangibles, interest, transaction costs and tax effects. The pro forma results of operations include compensation costs of $16.2 million and $16.0 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, for certain NWS executives whose employment terminated at the date of acquisition.

Pro forma information does not include acquisitions that are not considered material to our results of operations. The pro forma information does not purport to represent what our results of operations actually would have been had such transaction or event occurred on the dates specified, or to project our results of operations for any future period.

On May 29, 2015, we acquired all of the capital stock of Brazos Technology Corporation (“Brazos”), which provides mobile hand held solutions primarily to law enforcement agencies for field accident reporting and electronically issuing citations. The purchase price, net of cash acquired of $312,000 and including debt assumed of $733,000, was $6.1 million in cash and 12,500 shares of Tyler common stock valued at $1.5 million. As a result, we acquired total tangible assets of approximately $2.1  million and assumed liabilities of approximately $2.6 million. We have recorded total goodwill of approximately $1.9 million, all of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes, and other intangible assets of approximately $6.2 million. The $6.2 million of intangible assets is attributable to customer relationships, acquired software and trade name and will be amortized over a weighted average period of approximately ten years.

The operating results of NWS and Brazos are included with the operating results of the Enterprise Software Solutions segment since their dates of acquisition. Revenues from NWS  included in 2015 results of operations totaled approximately $10.0 million and net income was not significant. Our balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, reflects the allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired based on their fair value at the date of acquisition. The fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired are based on valuations using Level III, unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.


On August 29, 2014, we acquired all of the capital stock of SoftCode, Inc. (“SoftCode”), which develops and sells civil process management software, typically to county sheriff departments. The purchase price, net of cash acquired of $71,000, was $3.5 million in cash, of which $325,000 was accrued at December 31, 2014, and 16,540 shares of Tyler common stock valued at $1.5 million, based on the stock price on the acquisition date.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET

Property and equipment, net consists of the following at December 31:

Depreciation expense was $9.1 million during 2015, $7.9 million during 2014, and $6.4 million during 2013.

We own office buildings in Bangor and Yarmouth, Maine; Lubbock and Plano, Texas; Troy, Michigan; and Moraine, Ohio.  We lease some space in these buildings to third-party tenants.  These leases expire between 2016 and 2025 and are expected to provide rental income of approximately $1.7 million during 2016, $1.6 million during 2017, $1.6 million during 2018, $1.5 million during 2019, $1.3 million during 2020, and $6.6 million thereafter. Rental income from third-party tenants was $913,000 in 2015, $945,000 in 2014, and $704,000 in 2013.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Other intangible assets and related accumulated amortization consists of the following at December 31:

Total amortization expense for intangibles was $10.3 million in 2015, $6.4 million in 2014, and $6.8 million during 2013.

The allocation of acquisition intangible assets is summarized in the following table:

F-15

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the two years ended December 31, 2015 are as follows:

Estimated annual amortization expense relating to acquired leases will be recorded as a reduction to other income and is expected to be $444,000 in 2016, $444,000 in 2017, $426,000 in 2018, $372,000 in 2019, $313,000 in 2020 and $1.7 million thereafter

.

Estimated annual amortization expense relating to acquisition intangibles, including acquired software, for which the amortization expense is recorded as cost of revenues, for the next five years is as follows:

ACCRUED LIABILITIES

Accrued liabilities consist of the following at December 31:

(6)

REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT

On November 16, 2015, we entered into a $300.0 million Credit Agreement (the “Credit Facility”) with the various lenders party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent. The Credit Facility provides for a revolving credit line up to $300.0 million, including a $10.0 million sublimit for letters of credit. The Credit Facility matures on November 16, 2020. Borrowings under the Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital requirements, acquisitions and share repurchases.

Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate of either (1) Wells Fargo Bank’s  prime rate (subject to certain higher rate determinations) plus a margin of 0.25% to 1.00% or (2) the 30, 60, 90 or 180 day LIBOR rate plus a margin of 1.25% to 2.00%.   As of December 31, 2015, our interest rate was 1.6%. The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets. The Credit Facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and other financial conditions and prohibits us from making certain investments, advances, cash dividends or loans, and limits incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with those covenants

.

As of December 31, 2015, we had $66.0 million in outstanding borrowings and unused borrowing capacity of $234.0 million under the Credit Facility

.

In addition, as of December 31, 2015,

we had an outstanding $1.5 million letter of credit in favor of one of our clients. The letter of credit guarantees our performance under a software contract and expires in 2016.

We paid interest of $223,000 in 2015

INCOME TAX

The income tax provision (benefit) on income from operations consists of the following:

Reconciliation of the U.S. statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax expense rate for operations follows:

The tax effects of the major items recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31 are:

In 2014, we utilized approximately $650,000 of net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax reporting purposes.  The full amount of the net operating loss utilized was attributable to excess tax benefits related to share-based arrangements for which authoritative guidance prohibited the recognition of a deferred tax asset in 2013.  In 2014, this tax benefit was accounted for as an increase to shareholders’ equity and a reduction in income tax payable.  In total, we recognized approximately $45.3 million and $19.4 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based arrangements in 2015 and 2014, respectively, as a credit to shareholders’ equity and a reduction in income taxes payable.

Although realization is not assured, we believe it is more likely than not that all the deferred tax assets at December 31, 2015 and 2014 will be realized.  Accordingly, we believe no valuation allowance is required for the deferred tax assets. However, the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted in the future if estimates of reversing taxable temporary differences are revised.

The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) is examining our U.S. income tax return for the year 2012.  In addition, there is one open state audit for the year 2011.  As of February 22, 2016, no significant adjustments have been proposed by the IRS.  We are unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash settlements, if any, will occur.

We are subject to U.S. federal tax as well as income tax of multiple state and local jurisdictions. We are no longer su

bject to United States federal income tax examinations for years before 2012. We are no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years before 2011.

We paid income taxes, net of refunds received, of $27.3 million in 2015, $10.2 million in 2014, and $9.3 million in 2013.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

Share-Based Compensation Plan

We have a stock option plan that provides for the grant of stock options to key employees, directors and non-employee consultants. Stock options generally vest after three to six years of continuous service from the date of grant and have a contractual term of  10 years. Once options become exercisable, the employee can purchase shares of our common stock at the market price on the date we granted the option. We account for share-based compensation utilizing the fair value recognition pursuant to ASC 718, Stock Compensation.

As of December 31, 2015, there were 3.7 million shares available for future grants under the plan from the 20.0 million shares previously approved by the stockholders.

Determining Fair Value of Stock Compensation

Valuation and Amortization Method. We estimate the fair value of share-based awards granted using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. We amortize the fair value of all awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods, which are generally the vesting periods.

Expected Life. The expected life of awards granted represents the period of time that they are expected to be outstanding. The expected life represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to be outstanding based primarily on the options’ vesting terms, remaining contractual life and the employees’ expected exercise based on historical patterns.

Expected Volatility. Using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock.

Risk-Free Interest Rate. We base the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes option valuation model on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term equal to the expected life of the award.

Expected Dividend Yield. We have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock in more than ten years and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the Black-Scholes option valuation model.

Expected Forfeitures. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures. We record share-based compensation only for those awards that are expected to vest.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) participants may contribute up to 15% of their annual compensation to purchase common shares of Tyler. The purchase price of the shares is equal to 85% of the closing price of Tyler shares on the last day of each quarterly offering period. As of December 31, 2015, there were 899,000 shares available for future grants under the ESPP from the 2.0 million shares previously approved by the stockholders.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic earnings and diluted earnings per share data were computed as follows:

Stock options representing the right to purchase common stock of 417,000 shares in 2015, 481,000 shares in 2014, and 62,000 shares in 2013 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect.

LEASES

We lease office facilities for use in our operations, as well as transportation, computer and other equipment.  We also have an office facility lease agreement with an entity owned by an executive’s father and brother.  The executive does not have an interest in the entity that leases the property to us and the lease arrangement existed at the time we acquired the business unit that occupies this property.  Most of our leases are non-cancelable operating lease agreements and they expire at various dates through 2022.  In addition to rent, the leases generally require us to pay taxes, maintenance, insurance and certain other operating expenses.

Rent expense was approximately $7.2 million in 2015, $6.7 million in 2014, and $7.5 million in 2013, which included rent expense associated with related party lease agreements of $1.8 million in 2015, $1.7 million in 2014, and $1.7 million in 2013.

Future minimum lease payments under all non-cancelable leases at December 31, 2015 are as follows:

Included in future minimum lease payments are non-cancelable payments due to related parties of $1.9 million in 2016, $1.9 million in 2017 and $14,000 in 2018.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

We provide a defined contribution plan for the majority of our employees meeting minimum service requirements.  The employees can contribute up to 30% of their current compensation to the plan subject to certain statutory limitations.  We contribute up to a maximum of 3% of an employee’s compensation to the plan.  We made contributions to the plan and charged operating results $5.3 million during 2015, $4.3 million during 2014, and $3.8 million during 2013.

Property appraisal outsourcing services include: the physical inspection of commercial and residential properties; data collection and processing; computer analysis for property valuation; preparation of tax rolls; community education; and arbitration between taxpayers and the assessing jurisdiction.

We evaluate performance based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is business segment operating income.  We define segment operating income for our business units as income before noncash amortization of intangible assets associated with their acquisition, interest expense and income taxes.  Segment operating income includes intercompany transactions.  The majority of intercompany transactions relate to contracts involving more than one unit and are valued based on the contractual arrangement.  Segment operating income for corporate primarily consists of compensation costs for the executive management team and certain accounting and administrative staff and share-based compensation expense for the entire company.  Corporate segment operating income also includes revenues and expenses related to a company-wide user conference.  The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”
