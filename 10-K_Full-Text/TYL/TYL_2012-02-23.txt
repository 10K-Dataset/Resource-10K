PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Tyler Technologies, Inc. (“Tyler”) is a major provider of integrated information management solutions and services for the public sector, with
a focus on local governments. We partner with clients to make local government more accessible to the public, more responsive to the needs of citizens and more efficient in its operations. We have a broad line of software solutions and services to
address the information technology (“IT”) needs of virtually every major area of operation for cities, counties, schools and other local government entities. Most of our customers have our software installed in-house. For customers who
prefer not to physically acquire the software and hardware, we provide many of our applications under subscription-based applications service provider (“ASP”) arrangements. We provide professional IT services to our customers, including
software and hardware installation, data conversion, training and, at times, product modifications. In addition, we are the nation’s largest provider of outsourced property appraisal services for taxing jurisdictions. We also provide continuing
customer support services to ensure product performance and reliability, which provides us with long-term customer relationships and a significant base of recurring maintenance revenue.

Tyler was founded in 1966. Prior to 1998, we operated as a diversified industrial conglomerate, with operations in various industrial, retail and distribution businesses, all of which have been divested.
In 1997, we embarked on a multi-phase growth plan focused on serving the specialized information management needs of local governments nationwide. In 1998 and 1999, we entered the local government IT market through a series of strategic acquisitions
of companies in the local government IT market.

MARKET OVERVIEW

The state and local government market is one of the largest and most decentralized IT markets in the country, consisting of all 50 states, approximately 3,000 counties, 36,000 cities and towns and 13,900
school districts. This market is also comprised of approximately 37,000 special districts and other agencies, each with specialized delegated responsibilities and unique information management requirements.

Traditionally, local government bodies and agencies performed state-mandated duties, including property assessment, record keeping, road maintenance, law
enforcement, administration of election and judicial functions, and the provision of welfare assistance. Today, a host of emerging and urgent issues are confronting local governments, each of which demands a service response. These areas include
criminal justice and corrections, administration and finance, public safety, health and human services, and public works. Transfers of responsibility from the federal and state governments to county and municipal governments and agencies in these
and other areas also place additional service and financial requirements on these local government units. In addition, constituents of local governments are increasingly demanding improved service and better access to information from public
entities. As a result, local governments recognize the increasing value of information management systems and services to, among other things, improve revenue collection, provide increased access to information, and streamline delivery of services
to their constituents. Local government bodies are now recognizing that “e-government” is an additional responsibility for community development. From integrated tax systems to integrated civil and criminal justice information systems,
many counties and cities have benefited significantly from the implementation of jurisdiction-wide systems that allow different agencies or government offices to share data and provide a more comprehensive approach to information management. Many
city and county governmental agencies also have unique individual information management requirements, which must be tailored to the specific functions of each particular office.

Many local governments also have difficulties attracting and retaining the staff necessary to support their IT functions. As a result, they seek to establish long-term relationships with reliable
providers of high quality IT products and services such as Tyler.

Although local governments generally face budgetary constraints in their
operations, their primary revenue sources are usually property taxes, and to a lesser extent, utility billings and other fees, which historically tend to be relatively stable. In addition, the acquisition of new technology typically enables local
governments to operate more efficiently, and often provides a measurable return on investment that justifies the purchase of software and related services.

Gartner estimates that state and local government software applications and vertical specific software spending will grow from $12.5 billion in 2012 to $13.3 billion in 2015. The professional services and
support segments of the market, where our business is primarily focused, is expected to expand from $32.8 billion in 2012 to $36.2 billion in 2015. Software sales in the primary and secondary education segments of the market is expected to expand
from $2.2 billion in 2012 to $2.8 billion in 2015 while professional services and support are expected to grow from $2.3 billion in 2012 to $2.6 billion in 2015.



PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

We provide a comprehensive and flexible suite of products and services that addresses the information technology needs of cities, counties, schools and other local government entities. We derive our
revenues from five primary sources:

•

sales of software licenses;

•

subscription-based arrangements;

•

software services;

•

maintenance and support; and

•

appraisal services.

We
design, develop and market a broad range of software solutions to serve mission-critical “back-office” functions of local governments. Many of our software applications include Internet-accessible solutions that allow for real-time public
access to a variety of information or that allow the public to transact business with local governments via the Internet. Our software solutions and services are generally grouped in three major areas:

•

Financial Management and Education;

•

Courts and Justice; and

•

Property Appraisal and Tax and Other.

Each of our core software systems consists of several fully integrated application modules. For customers who acquire the software for use in-house, we generally license our systems under standard
perpetual license agreements that provide the customer with a fully paid, nonexclusive, nontransferable right to use the software. In some of the product areas, such as financial management and education and property appraisal and tax, we offer
multiple solutions designed to meet the needs of different sized governments.

We also offer certain software solutions on a “software as
a service” basis for customers who do not wish to maintain, update and operate these systems or to make large up-front capital expenditures to implement these advanced technologies. For these customers, we host the applications and data at our
data centers or at third-party locations. Customers typically sign multi-year contracts for these subscription-based services.

Historically,
we have had a greater proportion of our annual revenues in the second half of our fiscal year due to governmental budget and spending cycles and the timing of system implementations for customers desiring to “go live” at the beginning of
the calendar year.

A description of our suites of products and services follows:

Software Licenses

Financial Management and Education

Our financial management and education solutions are Enterprise Resource Planning systems for local governments, which integrate information across all
facets of a client organization. Our financial management solutions include modular fund accounting systems that can be tailored to meet the needs of virtually any government agency or not-for-profit entity. Our financial management systems include
modules for general ledger, budget preparation, fixed assets, requisitions, purchase orders, bid management, accounts payable, contract management, accounts receivable, investment management, inventory control, project and grant accounting, work
orders, job costing, GASB 34 reporting, payroll and human resources. All of our financial management systems are intended to conform to government auditing and financial reporting requirements and generally accepted accounting principles.

We sell utility billing systems that support the billing and collection of metered and non-metered services, along with multiple billing
cycles. Our Web-enabled utility billing solutions allow customers to access information online such as average consumption and transaction history. In addition, our systems can accept secured Internet payments via credit cards and checks.



We also offer specialized products that automate numerous city functions, including municipal courts,
parking tickets, equipment and project costing, animal licenses, business licenses, permits and inspections, code enforcement, citizen complaint tracking, ambulance billing, fleet maintenance, and cemetery records management.

In addition to providing financial management systems to K-12 schools, we sell student information systems for K-12 schools, which manage such activities
as scheduling, grades and attendance. We also offer student transportation solutions to manage school bus routing optimization, fleet management, field trips and other related functions. We also sell software applications to manage public sector
pension funds.

Tyler’s financial management and education solutions include Web components that enhance local governments’ service
capabilities by facilitating online access to information for both employees and citizens and enabling online transactions.

Courts and
Justice

We offer a complete, fully integrated suite of judicial solutions designed to handle complex, multi-jurisdictional county or
statewide implementations as well as single county systems. Our solutions help eliminate duplicate data entry, promote more effective business procedures and improve efficiency across the entire justice process.

Our unified court case management system is designed to automate the tracking and management of information involved in all case types, including
criminal, traffic, civil, family, probate and juvenile courts. It also tracks the status of cases, processes fines and fees and generates the specialized judgment and sentencing documents, notices and forms required in the court process. Documents
received by the court can be scanned into the electronic case file and easily retrieved for viewing. Documents generated by the court can be electronically signed and automatically attached to the electronic case file. Additional modules automate
the management of court calendars, coordinate judge’s schedules and generate court dockets. Our targeted courtroom technologies allow courts to rapidly review calendars, cases and view documents in the courtroom. Courts may also take advantage
of our related jury management system.

Our law enforcement systems automate police and sheriff functions from dispatch and records management
through booking and jail management. Searching, reporting and tracking features are integrated, allowing reliable, up-to-date access to current arrest and incarceration data, including digital mug shots. Our systems also provide warrant checks for
visitors or book-ins, inmate classification and risk assessment, commissary, property and medical processing, and automation of statistics and state and federal reporting. Our computer-aided dispatch/emergency 911 system tracks calls and the
availability of emergency response vehicles, interfaces with local and state searches, and assists dispatchers with processing emergency situations. The law enforcement and jail management systems are fully integrated with prosecution and other
court products that manage the entire judicial process.

Our court and law enforcement systems allow the public to access, via the Internet, a
variety of information, including non-confidential criminal and civil court records, jail booking and release information, bond and bondsmen information, and court calendars and dockets. In addition, our systems allow cities and counties to accept
payments for traffic and parking tickets over the Internet, with a seamless and automatic interface to back-office justice and financial systems.

Our prosecutor system enables state attorney offices to track and manage criminal cases, including detailed victim information and private case notes. Investigative reports and charging instrument
documents can be generated and stored for later viewing. Prosecutors can schedule and record the outcome of grand jury hearings. When integrated with the court system, prosecutors can view the electronic case file and related documents, as well as
manage witness lists and subpoenas needed for court hearings.

Our supervision system allows pre-trial and probation offices to manage
offender caseloads. Supervision officers can track contact schedules, risk/needs assessments and reassessments, detailed drug test results, employment histories, compliance with conditions and payments of fees and restitution. Documents and forms,
like pre-sentence investigations or revocation orders, can be generated and stored for easy viewing. When integrated with the jail and court systems, supervision officers can have easy access and quick notification of offenders that have court
hearings scheduled, are arrested locally and have new warrants issued.

We also offer a court case management solution that automates and
tracks all aspects of municipal courts and offices. It is a fully integrated, graphical application that provides effective case management, document processing and cash/bond management. This system complies with all state reporting and conviction
reports and includes electronic reporting and also integrates with certain of our financial management solutions and public safety solutions. Our public safety solution for municipalities includes more than thirty essential law enforcement, criminal
investigation, and administration record management modules. The public safety solution



manages information such as arrests and field interviews, traffic reports and citations, and incident and offense reports. It also supports multimedia files, photo lineups, multi-agency security
and incident workflow and streamlines mandatory reporting to local, state and federal offices.

Property Appraisal and Tax and Other

We provide systems and software that automate the appraisal and assessment of real and personal property, including record keeping, mass
appraisal, inquiry and protest tracking, appraisal and tax roll generation, tax statement processing, and electronic state-level reporting. These systems are image and video-enabled to facilitate the storage of and access to the many
property-related documents and for the online storage of digital photographs of properties for use in defending values in protest situations. Other related tax applications are available for agencies that bill and collect taxes, including cities,
counties, school tax offices, and special taxing and collection agencies. These systems support billing, collections, lock box operations, mortgage company electronic payments, and various reporting requirements.

We also offer a number of specialized software applications designed to help county governments enhance and automate courthouse operations. These systems
record, scan and index information for the many documents maintained at the courthouse, such as deeds, mortgages, liens, UCC financing statements and vital records (birth, death and marriage certificates). These applications include fully integrated
imaging systems with batch and scan processing capabilities and fully integrated receipting and cashiering systems as well as Web-enabled public access.

Subscription-Based Services

Subscription-based services revenue primarily consists of
revenues derived from application service provider (“ASP”) arrangements and other hosted service offerings, software subscriptions and disaster recovery services. Our ASP arrangements and other hosted service offerings provide certain
software solutions on a “software as a service” basis for customers who do not wish to maintain, update and operate these systems or to make large up-front capital expenditures to implement these advanced technologies.

ASP arrangements and other hosting services are typically contracted for a period of three to six years. Other software subscriptions and disaster
recovery service arrangements are typically under annual contracts. The majority of the ASP and other hosting services and software subscriptions also include professional services and maintenance and support services. In certain ASP arrangements,
the customer also acquires a license to the software.

We also provide electronic document filing solutions (e-filings) for courts and law
offices which simplify the filing and management of court related documents. Revenues for e-filings are included in subscription-based revenues and are generally derived from transaction fees.

Software Services

We provide a variety
of professional IT services to customers who utilize our software products. Virtually all of our customers contract with us for installation, training, and data conversion services in connection with their purchase of Tyler’s software
solutions. The complete implementation process for a typical system includes planning, design, data conversion, set-up and testing. At the culmination of the implementation process, an installation team travels to the customer’s facility to
ensure the smooth transfer of data to the new system. Installation fees are charged separately to customers on either a fixed-fee or hourly charge basis, depending on the contract.

Both in connection with the installation of new systems and on an ongoing basis, we provide extensive training services and programs related to our products and services. Training can be provided in our
training centers, onsite at customers’ locations, or at meetings and conferences, and can be customized to meet customers’ requirements. The vast majority of our customers contract with us for training services, both to improve their
employees’ proficiency and productivity and to fully utilize the functionality of our systems. Training services are generally billed on an hourly or daily basis, along with travel and other expenses.



Maintenance and Support

Following the implementation of our software systems, we provide ongoing software support services to assist our customers in operating the systems and to periodically update the software. Support is
provided over the phone to customers through help desks staffed by our customer support representatives. For more complicated issues, our staff, with the customers’ permission, can log on to customers’ systems remotely. We maintain our
customers’ software largely through releases that contain improvements and incremental additions, along with updates necessary because of legislative or regulatory changes.

Virtually all of our software customers contract with us for maintenance and support, which provides us with a significant source of recurring revenue. We generally provide maintenance and support under
annual contracts, with a typical fee based on a percentage of the software product’s license fee. These fees can be increased annually and may also increase as new license fees increase. Maintenance and support fees are generally paid in
advance for the entire maintenance contract period. Most maintenance contracts automatically renew unless the customer or Tyler gives notice of termination prior to expiration. Similar support is provided to our ASP customers, and is included in
their subscription fees which are classified as subscription-based revenues.

Appraisal Services

We are the nation’s largest provider of property appraisal outsourcing services for local government taxing authorities. These services include:

•

the physical inspection of commercial and residential properties;

•

data collection and processing;

•

sophisticated computer analyses for property valuation;

•

preparation of tax rolls;

•

community education regarding the assessment process; and

•

arbitration between taxpayers and the assessing jurisdiction.

Local government taxing authorities normally reappraise properties from time to time to update values for tax assessment purposes and to maintain equity in the taxing process. In some jurisdictions,
reassessment cycles are mandated by law; in others, they are discretionary. While some taxing jurisdictions perform reappraisals in-house, many local governments outsource this function because of its cyclical nature and because of the specialized
knowledge and expertise requirements associated with it. Our appraisal services business unit has been in this business since 1938.

In some
instances, we also sell property tax and/or appraisal software products in connection with appraisal outsourcing projects, while other customers may only engage us to provide appraisal services. Appraisal outsourcing services are somewhat seasonal
in nature to the extent that winter weather conditions reduce the productivity of data collection activities in connection with those projects.

STRATEGY

Our objective is to grow our revenue
and earnings internally, supplemented by focused strategic acquisitions. The key components of our business strategy are to:

•

Provide high quality, value–added products and services to our clients.

We compete on the basis of, among other things, delivering to
customers our deep domain expertise in local government operations through the highest value products and services in the market. We believe we have achieved a reputation as a premium product and service provider to the local government market.

•

Continue to expand our product and service offerings.

While we already have what we believe to be the broadest line of software products for
local governments, we continually upgrade our core software applications and expand our complementary product and service offerings to respond to technological advancements and the changing needs of our clients. For example, we offer solutions that
allow the public to access data and conduct transactions with local governments, such as paying traffic tickets, property taxes and utility bills, and filing court documents via the Internet. We believe that the addition of such features enhances
the market appeal of our core products. Since 2001, we have also offered many of our software products under an ASP or other software as a subscription-based service model which we believe will, over time, have increasing appeal to local governments
and will be expanded to include more applications. We have also broadened our offerings of consulting and business process reengineering services.



•

Expand our customer base.

We seek to establish long-term relationships with new customers primarily through our sales and marketing efforts.
While we currently have customers in all 50 states, Canada, the Caribbean, and the United Kingdom, not all of our solutions have achieved nationwide geographic penetration. We intend to continue to expand into new geographic markets by adding sales
staff and targeting marketing efforts by solutions in those areas. We also intend to continue to expand our customer base to include more large governments. While our traditional market focus has primarily been on small and mid-sized governments,
our increased size and market presence, together with the technological advances and improved scalability of certain of our solutions, are allowing us to achieve success in selling to larger customers.

•

Expand our existing customer relationships.

Our existing customer base offers significant opportunities for additional sales of solutions and
services that we currently offer, but that existing customers do not fully utilize. Add-on sales to existing customers typically involve lower sales and marketing expenses than sales to new customers.

•

Grow recurring revenues.

We have a large recurring revenue base from maintenance and support and subscription-based services, which generated
revenues of $177.7 million, or 57% of total revenues, in 2011. We have historically experienced very low customer turnover (approximately 2% annually) and recurring revenues continue to grow as the installed customer base increases. In addition,
subscription-based revenues has been our fastest growing revenue category over the past five years, increasing from $7.3 million in 2006 to $31.2 million in 2011.

•

Maximize economies of scale and take advantage of financial leverage in our business.

We seek to build and maintain a large client base to
create economies of scale, enabling us to provide value-added products and services to our customers while expanding our operating margins. Because we sell primarily “off-the-shelf” software, increased sales of the same solutions result in
incrementally higher gross margins. In addition, we believe that we have a marketing and administrative infrastructure in place that we can leverage to accommodate significant long-term growth without proportionately increasing selling, general and
administrative expenses.

•

Attract and retain highly qualified employees.

We believe that the depth and quality of our operating management and staff is one of our
significant strengths, and that the ability to retain such employees is crucial to our continued growth and success. We believe that our stable management team, financial strength and growth opportunities, as well as our leadership position in the
local government market, enhance our attractiveness as an employer for highly skilled employees.

•

Pursue selected strategic acquisitions.

While we expect to primarily grow internally, from time to time we selectively pursue strategic
acquisitions that provide us with one or more of the following:

•

new products and services to complement our existing offerings;

•

entry into new markets related to local governments; and

•

new customers and/or geographic expansion.

•

Establish strategic alliances.

In January 2007 we announced a strategic alliance with Microsoft Corporation to jointly develop core public
sector functionality for Microsoft Dynamics AX to address the unique accounting needs of public sector organizations worldwide. As part of this alliance we are enhancing Microsoft Dynamics AX with public sector-specific functionality. The
arrangement will broaden the functionality of Microsoft Dynamics AX, providing both Tyler and Microsoft with a public sector accounting platform to support their existing and prospective clients well into the future. In the fourth quarter of 2009 we
expanded our arrangement with Microsoft to include payroll, human resource and budget functionality. Microsoft Dynamics AX with public sector functionality was released to the market in August 2011 and is being sold in the United States and
internationally through Microsoft’s distribution channels. Tyler is also now an authorized Microsoft reseller for the Microsoft Dynamics solutions developed under this arrangement, and we are selling the solutions directly into the government
market. Tyler receives license and maintenance royalties on direct and indirect sales of the solutions co-developed under this multi-year term relationship.



SALES, MARKETING, AND CUSTOMERS

We market our products and services through direct sales and marketing personnel located throughout the United States. Other in-house sales staff focuses on add-on sales, professional services and
support.

Sales of new systems are typically generated from referrals from other government offices or departments within a county or
municipality, referrals from other local governments, relationships established between sales representatives and county or local officials, contacts at trade shows, direct mailings, and direct contact from prospects already familiar with us. We are
active in numerous national, state, county, and local government associations, and participate in annual meetings, trade shows, and educational events.

Customers consist primarily of county and municipal agencies, school districts and other local government offices. In counties, customers include the auditor, treasurer, tax assessor/collector, county
clerk, district clerk, county and district court judges, probation officers, sheriff, and county appraiser. At municipal government sites, customers include directors from various departments, including administration, finance, utilities, public
works, code enforcement, personnel, purchasing, taxation, municipal court, and police. Contracts for software products and services are generally implemented over periods of three months to one year, with annually renewing maintenance and support
update agreements thereafter. Although either the customer or we can terminate these agreements, historically almost all support and maintenance agreements are automatically renewed annually. Contracts for appraisal outsourcing services are
generally one to three years in duration. During 2011, approximately 47% of our revenue was attributable to ongoing support and maintenance agreements.

COMPETITION

We compete with numerous local, regional, and national firms that provide or offer
some or many of the same solutions and services that we provide. Many of these competitors are smaller companies that may be able to offer less expensive solutions than ours. Many of these firms operate within a specific geographic area and/or in a
narrow product or service niche. We also compete with national firms, some of which have greater financial and technical resources than we do, including Oracle Corporation, Lawson Software, Inc., SAP AG, Affiliated Computer Services, Inc. (a unit of
Xerox Corporation), SunGard Data Systems, Inc., New World Systems, American Cadastre, LLC (AmCad), Constellation Software, Inc. and Manatron, Inc. (a unit of Thomas Reuters Corporation). In addition, we sometimes compete with consulting and systems
integration firms, such as Deloitte LLP, which develop custom systems, primarily for larger governments. We also occasionally compete with central internal information service departments of local governments, which require us to persuade the
end-user department to discontinue service by its own personnel and outsource the service to us. We compete on a variety of factors, including price, service, name recognition, reputation, technological capabilities, and the ability to modify
existing products and services to accommodate the individual requirements of the customer. Our ability to offer an integrated system of applications for several offices or departments is often a competitive strength. Local governmental units often
are required to seek competitive proposals through a request for proposal process.

SUPPLIERS

Substantially all of the computers, peripherals, printers, scanners, operating system software, office automation software, and other equipment necessary
for the implementation and provision of our software systems and services are presently available from several third-party sources. Hardware is purchased on original equipment manufacturer or distributor terms at discounts from retail. We have not
experienced any significant supply problems.

BACKLOG

At December 31, 2011, our estimated revenue backlog was approximately $339.8 million, compared to $281.4 million at December 31, 2010. The backlog represents signed contracts under which the
revenue has not been recognized as of year-end. Approximately $228.4 million or 67%, of the backlog is expected to be recognized during 2012.



INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, AND LICENSES

We regard certain features of our internal operations, software, and documentation as confidential and proprietary and rely on a combination of
contractual restrictions, trade secret laws and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property. We generally do not rely on patents. We believe that, due to the rapid rate of technological change in the computer software industry,
trade secrets and copyright protection are less significant than factors such as knowledge, ability and experience of our employees, frequent product enhancements, and timeliness and quality of support services. We typically license our software
products under non-exclusive license agreements which are generally non-transferable and have a perpetual term.

EMPLOYEES

At December 31, 2011, we had 2,091 employees. Appraisal outsourcing projects are cyclical in nature and can be widely dispersed geographically. We
often hire temporary employees to assist in these projects whose term of employment generally ends with the project’s completion. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We
consider our relations with our employees to be positive.

INTERNET WEBSITE AND AVAILABILITY OF PUBLIC FILINGS

We file annual, quarterly, current and other reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, pursuant
to the Securities Exchange Act. You may read and copy any materials we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and other
information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including us, that file electronically with the SEC. The address of this site is

http://www.sec.gov

.

We also maintain an Internet site at

www.tylertech.com

. We make available free of charge through this site our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Forms 4 and 5, Current
Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. In
addition, copies of our annual report will be made available, free of charge upon written request.

Our “Code of Business Conduct and
Ethics” is also available on our Web site. We intend to satisfy the disclosure requirements regarding amendments to, or waivers from, a provision of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics by posting such information on our Web site.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Investors evaluating our company should carefully consider the factors described below and all other information contained in this Annual
Report. Any of the following factors could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Additional factors and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could also harm our
business, operating results, and financial condition. This section should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and related Notes and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included
in this Annual Report. We may make forward-looking statements from time to time, both written and oral. We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements. Our actual results may
differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Risks Associated with Selling Products and Services into the Public Sector Marketplace

Declining general economic conditions and uncertainties in the global credit crisis and equity markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.

The financial market crisis has continued to disrupt credit and equity markets worldwide. Local and state governments may face financial pressures that
could in turn affect our growth rate in 2012. We cannot assure you local and state spending levels will be unaffected by the global credit crisis and if budget shortfalls occur they may negatively impact local and state information technology
spending and could have a material adverse effect upon our business, operating results, and financial condition.



Selling products and services into the public sector poses unique challenges.

We derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of software and services to state, county and city governments, other municipal agencies, and other
public entities. We expect that sales to public sector customers will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues in the future. We face many risks and challenges associated with contracting with governmental entities, including:

•

limitations on governmental resources placed by budgetary constraints, which in some circumstances, may provide for a termination of executed contracts
because of a lack of future funding;

•

the sales cycle of governmental agencies may be complex and lengthy;

•

payments under some public sector contracts are subject to achieving implementation milestones, and we have had, and may in the future have,
differences with customers as to whether milestones have been achieved;

•

political resistance to the concept of government agencies contracting with third parties to provide information technology solutions;

•

changes in legislation authorizing government’s contracting with third parties;

•

the internal review process by governmental agencies for bid acceptance;

•

changes to the bidding procedures by governmental agencies;

•

changes in governmental administrations and personnel; and

•

the general effect of economic downturns and other changes on local governments’ ability to spend public funds on outsourcing arrangements.

Each of these risks is outside our control. If we fail to adequately adapt to these risks and uncertainties, our financial
performance could be adversely affected.

A decline in information technology spending may result in a decrease in our revenues or lower
our growth rate.

A decline in the demand for information technology among our current and prospective customers may result in decreased
revenues or a lower growth rate for us because our sales depend, in part, on our customers’ level of funding for new or additional information technology systems and services. Moreover, demand for our solutions may be reduced by a decline in
overall demand for computer software and services. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase or maintain our revenues.

The open bidding process for governmental contracts creates uncertainty in predicting future contract awards.

Many governmental agencies purchase products and services through an open bidding process. Generally, a governmental entity will publish an established
list of requirements requesting potential vendors to propose solutions for the established requirements. To respond successfully to these requests for proposals, we must accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract, the
time required to establish operations for the proposed client, and the likely terms of any other third party proposals submitted. We cannot guarantee that we will win any bids in the future through the request for proposal process, or that any
winning bids will ultimately result in contracts on favorable terms. Our failure to secure contracts through the open bidding process, or to secure such contracts on favorable terms, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and
results of operations.



We face significant competition from other vendors and potential new entrants into our markets.

We believe we are a leading provider of integrated solutions for the public sector. However, we face competition from a variety of
software vendors that offer products and services similar to those offered by us, as well as from companies offering to develop custom software. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including:

•

the attractiveness of the business strategy and services we offer;

•

the breadth of products and services we offer;

•

features and functionality of our software;

•

price;

•

quality of products and service;

•

technological innovation;

•

name recognition;

•

our ability to modify existing products and services to accommodate the particular needs of our customers; and

•

our financial strength and stability.

We believe the market is highly fragmented with a large number of competitors that vary in size, primary computer platforms, and overall product scope. Our competitors include consulting firms, publicly
held companies that focus on selected segments of the public sector market, and a significant number of smaller, privately held companies. Certain competitors have greater technical, marketing, and financial resources than we do. We cannot assure
you that such competitors will not develop products or offer services that are superior to our products or services or that achieve greater market acceptance.

We also compete with internal, centralized information service departments of governmental entities, which require us to persuade the end-user to stop the internal service and outsource to us. In
addition, our customers may elect in the future to provide information management services internally through new or existing departments, which could reduce the market for our services.

We could face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the public sector software application market and new products and technologies are introduced. Increased competition
could result in pricing pressure, fewer customer orders, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share. In addition, current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with
third-parties, thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers. It is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market
share. Further, competitive pressures could require us to reduce the price of our software licenses and related services. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and the failure to do
so would have a material adverse effect upon our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Fixed- price contracts may affect
our profits.

Some of our present contracts are on a fixed-priced basis, which can lead to various risks, including:

•

the failure to accurately estimate the resources and time required for an engagement;

•

the failure to effectively manage governmental agencies’ and other customers’ expectations regarding the scope of services to be delivered
for an estimated price; and

•

the failure to timely complete fixed-price engagements within budget to the customers’ satisfaction.

If we do not adequately assess these and other risks, we may be subject to cost overruns and penalties, which may harm our business, financial condition,
or results of operations.



Changes in the insurance markets may affect our ability to win some contract awards and may lead to
increased expenses.

Some of our customers, primarily those for our property appraisal services, require that we secure performance bonds
before they will select us as their vendor. In addition, we are generally required to provide letters of credit as security for the issuance of a performance bond. Our current credit facility contains a $25.0 million sublimit for letters of credit.
We cannot guarantee that we will be able to secure such performance bonds in the future on terms that are favorable to us, if at all. Our inability to obtain performance bonds on favorable terms or at all could impact our future ability to win some
contract awards, particularly large property appraisal services contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Recent volatility in the stock markets, increasing shareholder litigation, the adoption of expansive legislation that redefines corporate controls (in particular, legislation adopted to prevent future
corporate and accounting scandals), as well as other factors have recently led to volatility in premiums for directors’ and officers’ liability insurance. Volatility of the insurance market may result in future increases in our general and
administrative expenses, which may adversely affect future operating results.

Risks Associated with Our Periodic Results and Stock
Price

As with other software vendors, we may be required to delay revenue recognition into future periods, which could adversely
impact our operating results.

We have in the past had to, and in the future may have to, defer revenue recognition for license fees due to
several factors, including whether:

•

license agreements include applications that are under development or other undelivered elements;

•

we must deliver services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software, including significant modifications, customization, or
complex interfaces, which could delay product delivery or acceptance;

•

the transaction involves acceptance criteria;

•

the transaction involves contingent payment terms or fees;

•

we are required to accept a fixed-fee services contract; or

•

we are required to provide extended payment terms.

Because of the factors listed above and other specific requirements under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States for software revenue recognition, we must have very precise terms in
our license agreements in order to recognize revenue when we initially deliver and install software or perform services. Negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions can extend the sales cycle, and sometimes we do not obtain terms and
conditions that permit revenue recognition at the time of delivery or even as work on the project is completed.

We may experience
fluctuations in quarterly revenue that could adversely impact our stock price and our operating results.

Our actual revenues in a quarter
could fall below expectations, which could lead to a decline in our stock price. Our revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter. Revenues from license fees in any quarter depend
substantially upon our contracting activity and our ability to recognize revenues in that quarter in accordance with our revenue recognition policies. Our quarterly revenue may fluctuate and may be difficult to forecast for a variety of reasons,
including the following:

•

a significant number of our prospective customers’ decisions regarding whether to enter into license agreements with us may be made within the
last few weeks of each quarter;

•

the size of license transactions can vary significantly;

•

customers may unexpectedly postpone or cancel procurement processes due to changes in their strategic priorities, project objectives, budget or
personnel;

•

customer purchasing processes vary significantly and a customer’s internal approval, expenditure authorization and contract negotiation processes
can be difficult and time consuming to complete, even after selection of a vendor;

•

the number, timing, and significance of software product enhancements and new software product announcements by us and our competitors may affect
purchase decisions;

•

we may have to defer revenues under our revenue recognition policies; and



•

customers may choose our subscription-based arrangements which result in lower software license revenues in the initial year as compared to traditional
perpetual software license arrangements but generate higher overall subscription-based revenues over the term of the contract.

Fluctuation in our quarterly revenues may adversely affect our operating results. In each fiscal quarter our expense levels, operating costs, and hiring plans are based to some extent on projections of
future revenues and are relatively fixed. If our actual revenues fall below expectations, we could experience a reduction in operating results.

Increases in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues could decrease overall margins and adversely affect our operating results.

We realize lower margins on software and appraisal service revenues than on license revenue. The majority of our contracts include both
software licenses and professional services. Therefore, an increase in the percentage of software service and appraisal service revenue compared to license revenue could have a detrimental impact on our overall gross margins and could adversely
affect operating results.

Our stock price may be volatile.

The market price of our common stock may be volatile and may be significantly affected by many different factors. Some examples of factors that can have a significant impact on our stock price include:

•

actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;

•

announcements of technological innovations, new products, or new contracts by us or our competitors;

•

developments with respect to patents, copyrights, or other proprietary rights;

•

conditions and trends in the software and other technology industries;

•

adoption of new accounting standards affecting the software industry;

•

changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; and

•

general market conditions and other factors.

In addition, the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for the common stock of technology companies.
These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been
brought against that company. We cannot assure you that similar litigation will not occur in the future with respect to us. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could
have a material adverse effect upon our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Financial Outlook.

From time to time in press releases and otherwise, we may publish forecasts or other forward-looking statements regarding our results, including estimated
revenues or net earnings. Any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions. These assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties, and as a matter of course, any number of them may prove to be incorrect. Further, the
achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors (including those described in this discussion), many of which are beyond our control. As a result, we cannot be certain that our performance will be consistent with any
management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse. Current and potential stockholders are cautioned not to base their entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions, but instead
are encouraged to utilize our entire publicly available mix of historical and forward-looking information, as well as other available information regarding us, our products and services, and the software industry when evaluating our prospective
results of operations.



Risks Associated with Our Software Products

Our products are complex and we run the risk of errors or defects with new product introductions or enhancements.

Software products as complex as those developed by us may contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements
are released. Although we have not experienced material adverse effects resulting from any such defects or errors to date, we cannot assure you that material defects and errors will not be found after commencement of product shipments. Any such
defects could result in loss of revenues or delay market acceptance.

Our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions
designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims. It is possible, however, that we may not always be able to negotiate such provisions in our contracts with customers or that the limitation of liability provisions contained in our
license agreements may not be effective as a result of existing or future federal, state or local laws, ordinances, or judicial decisions. Although we maintain errors and omissions and general liability insurance, and we try to structure our
contracts to include limitations on liability, we cannot assure you that a successful claim could not be made or would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We must respond to rapid technological changes to be competitive.

The market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards in computer hardware and software technology, changes in customer requirements, and frequent new
product introductions and enhancements. The introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable. As a result, our future success will depend, in part,
upon our ability to continue to enhance existing products and develop and introduce in a timely manner or acquire new products that keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements, and achieve
market acceptance. We cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and cost-effective manner. Further, we cannot assure you that the products, capabilities,
or technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. If we are unable to develop or acquire on a timely and cost-effective basis new software products or enhancements to existing products, or
if such new products or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.

We may be unable to protect our proprietary rights.

Many of our product and service
offerings incorporate proprietary information, trade secrets, know-how, and other intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of contracts, copyrights, and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our
technology. We cannot be certain that we have taken all appropriate steps to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property. In addition, there has been significant litigation in the United States in recent years involving intellectual property
rights. We are not currently involved in any material intellectual property litigation. We may, however, be a party to intellectual property litigation in the future to protect our proprietary information, trade secrets, know-how, and other
intellectual property rights. Further, we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us in the future with respect to current or future products. Any claims or litigation, with or without
merit, could be time-consuming and result in costly litigation and diversion of management’s attention. Further, any claims and litigation could cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements. Such
royalty or licensing arrangements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Thus, litigation to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, and results of operations, regardless of the final outcome of such litigation.

Risks Associated with Our Growth Strategy and
Other General Corporate Risks

We may experience difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy.

A significant portion of our growth has resulted from strategic acquisitions in new product and geographic markets. Although our focus is on internal
growth, we will continue to identify and pursue strategic acquisitions and alliances with suitable candidates. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully integrate future acquisitions and other strategic alliances into
our operations. Acquisitions may involve a number of special risks, including diversion of management’s attention, failure to retain key acquired personnel, unanticipated events or circumstances, legal liabilities, and amortization of certain
acquired intangible assets. Some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Although we conduct due diligence reviews of potential acquisition candidates, we may not
identify all material liabilities or risks related to acquisition candidates. There can be no assurance that any such strategic acquisitions or alliances will be accomplished on favorable terms or will result in profitable operations.



Our failure to properly manage growth could adversely affect our business.

We have expanded our operations since 1998, when we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector. We intend to
continue expansion in the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities. This growth places a significant demand on management and operational resources. In order to manage growth effectively, we must implement and improve
our operational systems, procedures, and controls on a timely basis. We must also identify, hire, train, and manage key managerial and technical personnel. If we fail to implement these systems or employ and retain such qualified personnel, our
business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.

We may be unable to hire, integrate, and
retain qualified personnel.

Our continued success will depend upon the availability and performance of our key management, sales,
marketing, customer support, and product development personnel. The loss of key management or technical personnel could adversely affect us. We believe that our continued success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract, integrate, and
retain such personnel. We have at times experienced and continue to experience difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel. Competition for qualified software development, sales, and other personnel is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will
be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel.

Compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public
disclosure may result in additional expenses.

Changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public
disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, new Securities and Exchange Commission regulations and New York Stock Exchange rules, are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours. The costs required to comply with such evolving laws are
difficult to predict. To maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards. This investment may result in an unforeseen increase in general
and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities, which may harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

Historically, we have not paid dividends on our common stock.

We have not declared or paid a cash dividend since we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector in 1998. Additionally, our bank credit agreement contains
restrictions on the payment of cash dividends. We intend to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.

Provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, and Delaware law could deter takeover attempts.

Our board of directors may issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock and may determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions,
including voting and conversion rights, of these shares of preferred stock. These determinations may be made without any further vote or action by our stockholders. The rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to, and may be
adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. In
addition, some provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, and of the Delaware General Corporation Law could also delay, prevent, or make more difficult a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest involving us.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR
REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.

Our common stock is traded on the New
York Stock Exchange under the symbol “TYL.” At December 31, 2011, we had approximately 1,939 stockholders of record. A number of our stockholders hold their shares in street name; therefore, there are substantially more than 1,939
beneficial owners of our common stock.

The following table shows, for the calendar periods indicated, the high and low sales price per share
of our common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange.

We did not pay any cash dividends in 2011 or 2010. Our bank credit agreement contains restrictions on the payment of cash
dividends. We intend to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business, and, therefore, we do not anticipate declaring a cash dividend in the foreseeable future.



The following table summarizes certain information related to our stock option plan and our Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). There are no warrants or rights related to our equity compensation plans as of December 31, 2011.

During 2011, we purchased approximately 3.0 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of
$71.8 million. A summary of the repurchase activity during 2011 is as follows:

The repurchase program, which was approved by our board of directors, was announced in October 2002, and was amended in
April and July 2003, October 2004, October 2005, May 2007, May 2008, October 2008, May 2009, July 2010, October 2010 and September 2011. As of December 31, 2011, we had remaining authorization to
repurchase up to 1.7 million additional shares of our common stock. There is no expiration date specified for the authorization and we intend to repurchase stock under the plan from time to time.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This document contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are not
historical in nature and typically address future or anticipated events, trends, expectations or beliefs with respect to our financial condition, results of operations or business. Forward-looking statements often contain words such as
“believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “foresees,” “forecasts,” “estimates,” “plans,” “intends,” “continues,” “may,” “will,”
“should,” “projects,” “might,” “could” or other similar words or phrases. Similarly, statements that describe our business strategy, outlook, objectives, plans, intentions or goals also are forward-looking
statements. We believe there is a reasonable basis for our forward-looking statements, but they are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results could differ materially from the expectations and beliefs reflected in the
forward-looking statements. We presently consider the following to be among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and beliefs: (1) changes in the budgets or regulatory environments of
our customers, primarily local and state governments, that could negatively impact information technology spending; (2) our ability to achieve our financial forecasts due to various factors, including project delays by our customers, reductions
in transaction size, fewer transactions, delays in delivery of new products or releases or a decline in our renewal rates for service agreements; (3) economic, political and market conditions, including the global economic and financial crisis,
and the general tightening of access to debt or equity capital; (4) technological and market risks associated with the development of new products or services or of new versions of existing or acquired products or services; (5) our ability
to successfully complete acquisitions and achieve growth or operational synergies through the integration of acquired businesses, while avoiding unanticipated costs and disruptions to existing operations; (6) competition in the industry in
which we conduct business and the impact of competition on pricing, customer retention and pressure for new products or services; (7) the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and dealing with the loss or retirement of key members
of management or other key personnel; and (8) costs of compliance and any failure to comply with government and stock exchange regulations. A detailed discussion of these factors and other risks that affect our business are described in
Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements.

OVERVIEW

General

We provide integrated information management solutions and services for the public sector, with a focus on local and state governments. We develop and
market a broad line of software products and services to address the information technology (“IT”) needs of cities, counties, schools and other local government entities as well as state governments. In addition, we provide professional IT
services to our customers, including software and hardware installation, data conversion, training and for certain customers, product modifications, along with continuing maintenance and support for customers using our systems. We also provide
subscription-based services such as hosted solutions as well as property appraisal outsourcing services for taxing jurisdictions. In 2010 we began providing electronic document filing solutions (e-filings) for courts and law offices which simplify
the filing and management of court related documents. Revenues for e-filings are generally derived from transaction fees.

Our products
generally automate three major functional areas (1) financial management and education, (2) courts and justice and (3) property appraisal and tax and we report our results in two segments. The Enterprise Software Solutions
(“ESS”) segment provides municipal and county governments and schools with software systems and services to meet their information technology and automation needs for mission-critical “back-office” functions such as financial
management and courts and justice processes. The Appraisal and Tax Software Solutions and Services (“ATSS”) segment provides systems and software that automate the appraisal and assessment of real and personal property as well as property
appraisal outsourcing services for local governments and taxing authorities. Property appraisal outsourcing services include: the physical inspection of commercial and residential properties; data collection and processing; computer analysis for
property valuation; preparation of tax rolls; community education; and arbitration between taxpayers and the assessing jurisdiction.



We monitor and analyze several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our
financial and operating performance. These indicators include the following:

•

Revenues — We derive our revenues from five primary sources: sale of software licenses; subscription-based services; software services;
maintenance and support; and appraisal services. Subscription-based services and maintenance and support services are considered recurring revenue sources and comprised approximately 57% of our revenue in 2011. The number of new subscription-based
customers and the number of existing customers who convert from our traditional software arrangements to our subscription-based service arrangements are a significant driver to our business together with new software license sales and maintenance
rate increases. In addition, we also monitor our customer base and churn as we historically have experienced very low customer turnover. During 2011, our customer turnover was approximately 2%.

•

Cost of Revenues and Gross Margins — Our primary cost component is personnel expenses in connection with providing software implementation,
subscription-based services, maintenance and support, and appraisal services to our customers. We can improve gross margins by controlling headcount and related costs and by expanding our revenue base, especially from those products and services
that produce incremental revenue with minimal incremental cost, such as software licenses, subscription-based services, and maintenance and support. Our appraisal projects are cyclical in nature, and we often employ appraisal personnel on a
short-term basis to coincide with the life of a project. As of December 31, 2011, our total employee count increased to 2,091 from 2,054 at December 31, 2010. This increase includes 64 employees added as a result of an acquisition
completed in 2011.

•

Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Expenses — The primary components of SG&A expenses are administrative and sales
personnel salaries and commissions, marketing expense, share-based compensation expense, rent and professional fees. Sales commissions typically fluctuate with revenues and share-based compensation expense generally increases when the market price
of our stock increases. Other administrative expenses tend to grow at a slower rate than revenues.

•

Liquidity and Cash Flows — The primary driver of our cash flows is net income. Uses of cash include acquisitions, capital investments in property
and equipment and discretionary purchases of treasury stock. In 2011, we purchased 3.0 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $71.8 million. During 2011 we invested $12.3 million in property and equipment and paid
$16.4 million in cash for all of the capital stock of Windsor Management Group, L.L.C. Our investment in property and equipment included $6.6 million related to the purchase of approximately 27 acres of land and a building in Plano, Texas. We also
borrowed $60.7 million on our revolving line of credit mainly to assist in funding discretionary purchases of treasury stock. Our working capital needs are fairly stable throughout the year with the significant components of cash outflows being
payment of personnel expenses offset by cash inflows representing collection of accounts receivable and cash receipts from customers in advance of revenue being earned.

•

Balance Sheet — Cash, accounts receivable and days sales outstanding and deferred revenue balances are important indicators of our business.

In October 2011, we acquired all of the capital stock of Windsor Management Group, L.L.C. (“Windsor”) for a cash
purchase price of $16.4 million, net of cash acquired of $7.4 million. Windsor provides a suite of financial and human capital management software solutions to the K-12 education market, primarily in the Southwest.

In connection with this transaction we recorded customer relationship of approximately $5.6 million, acquired software of $2.4 million, deferred revenue
of $6.2 million and net assets of $1.5 million. We recorded goodwill of approximately $13.3 million, all of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Customer relationships and acquired software will be amortized over a weighted average
period of eight years. We believe likely market participants for this transaction would be software companies with a presence in the K-12 school market. Therefore, the goodwill of $13.3 million arising from the acquisition is primarily attributed to
our ability to maximize the value of the customer base through Tyler’s software product suite that targets the K-12 school market and to a much lesser extent, the assembled workforce of Windsor. Our balance sheet as of December 31, 2011
reflects the allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.

The
operating results of this acquisition are included in our results of operations since the date of acquisition.

Outlook

Consistent with 2011, we expect to continue to invest aggressively in product development in 2012. We believe that our competitive position is strong and
that we are well-positioned to take advantage of an eventual return to a stronger economic environment. However, until we see indications of sustained improvement, we are expecting that the new business environment in 2012 will continue to be both
challenging and unpredictable, and that the majority of our growth will again come from recurring revenues.



CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States (“GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the reported amounts
of revenues, cost of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, and related disclosure of contingencies. The Notes to the Financial Statements included as part of this Annual Report describe our significant accounting policies used in the
preparation of the financial statements. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the application of the percentage-of-completion and proportional performance methods of revenue recognition, the carrying amount and
estimated useful lives of intangible assets, determination of share-based compensation expense and valuation allowance for receivables. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates used in the
preparation of our financial statements.

Revenue Recognition

. We recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of Accounting
Standards Codification (“ASC”) 605, Revenue Recognition and ASC 985-605, Software Revenue Recognition. Our revenues are derived from sales of software licenses, subscription-based services, appraisal services, maintenance and support, and
services that typically range from installation, training and basic consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer needs. For multiple element software arrangements, which do not entail the performance of services
that are considered essential to the functionality of the software, we generally record revenue when the delivered products or performed services result in a legally enforceable and non-refundable claim. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts
and sales adjustments, which are provided at the time the revenue is recognized. Because most of our customers are governmental entities, we rarely incur a loss resulting from the inability of a customer to make required payments. In a limited
number of cases, we encounter a customer who is dissatisfied with some aspect of the software product or our service, and we may offer a “concession” to such customer. In those limited situations where we grant a concession, we rarely
reduce the contract arrangement fee, but alternatively may perform additional services, such as additional training or creating additional custom reports. These amounts have historically been nominal. In connection with our customer contracts and
the adequacy of related allowances and measures of progress towards contract completion, our project managers are charged with the responsibility to continually review the status of each customer on a specific contract basis. Also, we review, on at
least a quarterly basis, significant past due accounts receivable and the adequacy of related reserves. Events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount for the allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments may
require revision, include, but are not limited to, deterioration of a customer’s financial condition, failure to manage our customer’s expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered, and defects or errors in new versions
or enhancements of our software products.

We use contract accounting, primarily the percentage-of-completion method, as discussed in ASC
605-35, Construction — Type and Certain Production — Type Contracts, for those software arrangements that involve significant production, modification or customization of the software, or where our software services are otherwise
considered essential to the functionality of the software. We measure progress-to-completion primarily using labor hours incurred, or value added. In addition, we recognize revenue using the proportional performance method of revenue recognition for
our property appraisal projects, some of which can range up to five years. These methods rely on estimates of total expected contract revenue, billings and collections and expected contract costs, as well as measures of progress toward completion.
We believe reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and costs and progress applicable to various stages of a contract can be made. At times, we perform additional and/or non-contractual services for little to no incremental fee to satisfy customer
expectations. If changes occur in delivery, productivity or other factors used in developing our estimates of expected costs or revenues, we revise our cost and revenue estimates, and any revisions are charged to income in the period in which the
facts that give rise to that revision first become known. In connection with these and certain other contracts, we may perform the work prior to when the services are billable and/or payable pursuant to the contract. The termination clauses in most
of our contracts provide for the payment for the value of products delivered and services performed in the event of an early termination.

For
ASP and other hosting arrangements, we evaluate whether the customer has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and whether the customer can feasibly maintain the
software on the customer’s hardware or enter into another arrangement with a third party to host the software. If we determine that the



customer has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and can feasibly maintain the software on the
customer’s hardware or enter into another arrangement with a third party to host the software, we recognize the license, professional services and hosting services revenues pursuant to ASC 985-605, Software Revenue Recognition. For ASP and
other hosting arrangements that do not meet the criteria for recognition under ASC 985-605, we account for the elements under ASC 605-25, Multiple Element Arrangements using all applicable facts and circumstances, including whether (i) the
element has stand-alone value, (ii) there is a general right of return and (iii) the revenue is contingent on delivery of other elements. We allocate the contract value to each element of the arrangement that qualifies for treatment as a
separate element based on vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”), and if VSOE is not available, third party evidence, and if third party evidence is unavailable, estimated selling price. For professional services
associated with ASP and hosting arrangements that we determine do not have stand-alone value to the customer or are contingent on delivery of other elements, we recognize the services revenue ratably over the remaining contractual period once
hosting has gone live and we may begin billing for the hosting services. We record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenues, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.

In connection with certain of our contracts, we have recorded retentions receivable or unbilled receivables consisting of costs and estimated
profit in excess of billings as of the balance sheet date. Many of the contracts which give rise to unbilled receivables at a given balance sheet date are subject to billings in the subsequent accounting period. Management reviews unbilled
receivables and related contract provisions to ensure we are justified in recognizing revenue prior to billing the customer and that we have objective evidence which allows us to recognize such revenue. In addition, we have a sizable amount of
deferred revenue which represents billings in excess of revenue earned. The majority of this liability consists of maintenance billings for which payments are made in advance and the revenue is ratably earned over the maintenance period, generally
one year. We also have deferred revenue for those contracts in which we receive a deposit and the conditions in which to record revenue for the service or product has not been met. On a periodic basis, we review by customer the detail components of
our deferred revenue to ensure our accounting remains appropriate.

Intangible Assets and Goodwill

. Our business acquisitions typically
result in the creation of goodwill and other intangible asset balances, and these balances affect the amount and timing of future period amortization expense, as well as expense we could possibly incur as a result of an impairment charge. The cost
of acquired companies is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets based on estimated fair value, with the excess allocated to goodwill. Accordingly, we have a significant balance of acquisition date intangible assets, including
software, customer related intangibles, trade name and goodwill. In addition, we capitalize software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility. These intangible assets (other than goodwill) are amortized
over their estimated useful lives. We currently have no intangible assets with indefinite lives other than goodwill.

We evaluate goodwill for
impairment annually as of April, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We perform a two-step impairment test on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of
the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit
exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill
exceeds the asset’s implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. The fair values calculated in our impairment tests are determined using discounted cash flow models involving several assumptions. These
assumptions include, but are not limited to, anticipated operating income growth rates, our long-term anticipated operating income growth rate and the discount rate. Our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans
and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. The assumptions that are used are based upon what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value. Assets, liabilities and goodwill have been
assigned to reporting units based on assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. We evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value calculations of our reporting units by comparing the total of the fair value of all of our
reporting units to our total market capitalization. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Our annual goodwill impairment analysis, which we performed during
the second quarter of 2011, did not result in an impairment charge. During 2011 we did not identify any triggering events which would require an update to our annual impairment review.

All intangible assets with definite and indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. Recoverability of other intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated undiscounted future cash flows. The assessment of recoverability or of the estimated useful life for amortization purposes will be
affected if the timing or the amount of estimated future operating cash flows is not achieved. Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in stock price and market
capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate;



unanticipated competition; and reductions in growth rates. In addition, products, capabilities, or technologies developed by others may render our software products obsolete or non-competitive.
Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets.

Share-Based Compensation.

We have a stock option plan that provides for the grant of stock options to key employees, directors and non-employee
consultants. We estimate the fair value of share-based awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Share-based compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures, which will be adjusted over the
requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ from such estimates. Changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized
in future periods. Forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data. We estimate stock price volatility at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock. Estimated option life is determined using the
“simplified method” in accordance with ASC 718-10, Stock Compensation. Determining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment, including estimating
stock price volatility, expected option life and forfeiture rates.

ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OTHER

The following discussion compares the historical results of operations on a basis consistent with GAAP for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010
and 2009.



2011 Compared to 2010

Revenues

Software licenses.

The following table
sets forth a comparison of our software license revenues for the years ended December 31:

In October 2011, we acquired Windsor, which provides a suite of financial and human capital management software solutions
to the K-12 education market and is included in our ESS segment. Excluding the impact of this acquisition, total software license revenue declined by 8% and ESS software license revenue declined 9% compared to 2010. The decrease in software license
revenues is mainly attributable to longer sales cycles and postponements of customer purchasing decisions mainly due to budgetary constraints related to economic conditions. In addition, a portion of the decline was due to a growing number of
customers choosing our subscription-based options, rather than purchasing the software under a traditional perpetual software license arrangement. Subscription-based arrangements result in lower software license revenues in the initial year as
compared to traditional perpetual software license arrangements but generate higher overall subscription-based services revenue over the term of the contract. We had 47 new customers that entered into subscription-based arrangements in 2011 compared
to 19 new customers in 2010. We expect ESS software license revenues in 2012 to be higher than 2011 but the mix of software license arrangements and subscription-based arrangements may reduce the degree of the increase.

Subscriptions.

The following table sets
forth a comparison of our subscription revenues for the years ended December 31:

Subscription-based services revenue primarily consists of revenues derived from application service provider
(“ASP”) arrangements and other hosted service offerings, software subscriptions and disaster recovery services. We also provide electronic document filing solutions (“e-filings”) for courts and law offices which simplify the
filing and management of court related documents. Revenues from e-filings are generally derived from transaction fees. ASP and other software subscription agreements are typically for periods of three to six years. Disaster recovery and
miscellaneous other hosted service agreements are typically renewable annually. New customers for ASP and other hosted service offerings as well as existing customers who converted to our ASP model provided the majority of the subscription revenue
increase together with slightly higher rates for other hosted services. In 2011, we added 47 new customers and 40 existing customers elected to convert to our hosted offerings. E-filing services also contributed approximately $500,000 of the
subscription revenue increase as a result of several counties and one state adopting or expanding mandatory e-filing for court documents in the last half of 2011.



Software services

.

The following table sets forth a comparison of our software services revenues for the years ended December 31:

Software services revenues primarily consists of professional services billed in connection with the installation of our
software, conversion of customer data, training customer personnel and consulting. New customers who purchase our proprietary software licenses generally also contract with us to provide for the related software services. Existing customers also
periodically purchase additional training, consulting and minor programming services. Excluding the impact of the Windsor acquisition, software services increased 1%. In 2011 software services revenue included more third party vendor services to
build certain software interfaces associated with a state-wide contract, and reflected slightly higher billing rates.

Maintenance

.

The following table sets forth a comparison of our maintenance revenues for the years ended December 31:

We provide maintenance and support services for our software products and certain third party software. Excluding the
impact of the Windsor acquisition, maintenance revenue grew 7% from 2010. This increase was due to growth in our installed customer base and slightly higher maintenance rates on most of our product lines. Our annual maintenance revenue growth rate
has been reduced somewhat by the effect of existing installed customers converting to our hosted offering, which results in a loss of maintenance revenue offset by a larger increase in subscription revenue.

Appraisal services

.

The following table
sets forth a comparison of our appraisal service revenues for the years ended December 31:

Appraisal services revenue increased 13% in 2011 compared to 2010. The appraisal services business is somewhat cyclical
and driven in part by statutory revaluation cycles in various states. We began work on several new large revaluation contracts in late 2009 and mid-2010 which provided the majority of the increase in appraisal services revenues. Several of these
large contracts were completed in the last half of 2011 and we expect appraisal revenues for 2012 will decline slightly compared to 2011.



Cost of Revenues and Gross Margins

The following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues for the years ended December 31:

The following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the years ended
December 31:

Software license and acquired software

. Cost of software license and acquired software is comprised of third party
software costs, amortization of acquired software and amortization of capitalized development costs on certain software products. Cost of third party software comprised approximately 70% of our cost of software license revenues in 2011 compared to
approximately 60% of our cost of software license in 2010. Third party software sales were slightly higher than the prior year.

Costs
of acquired software, which is comprised of amortization expense for software acquired through acquisitions, was approximately 27% of our cost of software license revenues in 2011 compared to approximately 32% of our cost of software license in
2010. We completed several acquisitions in the period 2007 through 2011 and these costs are being amortized over a weighted average period of approximately five years. Cost of acquired software declined because several products became fully
amortized early 2011.

The remaining cost of software license balance relates to amortization expense for capitalized development cost which
is determined on a product-by-product basis at an annual rate not less than straight-line basis over the product’s estimated life, which is generally five years. These costs comprised less than 10% of total software license and acquired
software costs in 2011 and 2010. We did not capitalize any internal software development costs in 2011 or 2010.

In 2011, our software license
gross margin percentage increased compared to the prior year period because several acquired software solutions became fully amortized in early 2011.

Software services, maintenance and subscription-based services

. Cost of software services, maintenance and subscriptions primarily consists of personnel costs related to installation of our
software, conversion of customer data, training customer personnel and support activities and various other services such as ASP, e-filings and disaster recovery. Maintenance and various other services such as ASP and disaster recovery costs
typically grow at a slower rate than related revenues due to leverage in the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale. In 2011, the software services, maintenance and subscriptions gross margin increased compared to
the prior year partly because we improved our utilization of our support and maintenance staff and due to annual rate increases on certain services. We are managing costs and staff levels to ensure they are in line with demand for professional
services. Excluding 56 additional employees added with the Windsor acquisition, our implementation and support staff declined by 4 employees since December 31, 2010.



Appraisal services

. Our appraisal services gross margin was flat compared to 2010. A high proportion
of the costs of appraisal services revenue are variable, as we often hire temporary employees to assist in appraisal projects whose term of employment generally ends with the projects’ completion.

Our blended gross margin for 2011 increased 1.4% from 2010 mainly due to leverage in the utilization of our support, maintenance and subscription-based
services staff and economies of scale and slightly higher rates on certain services. The gross margin also benefited from lower acquired software amortization costs.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative
(“SG&A”) expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, travel, share-based compensation expense, commissions and related overhead costs for administrative and sales and marketing employees as well as, professional fees,
trade show activities, advertising costs and other marketing related costs. The following table sets forth a comparison of our SG&A expenses for the following years ended December 31:

Research and development expense consist mainly of costs associated with development of new products and new software
platforms from which we do not currently generate revenue. These include the Microsoft Dynamics AX project, as well as other new product development efforts related to our proprietary products. We increased our research and development staff by
seven employees during 2011. In January 2007, we entered into a Software Development and License Agreement, which provides for a strategic alliance with Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”) to jointly develop core public sector
functionality for Microsoft Dynamics AX to address the accounting needs of public sector organizations worldwide. In September 2007, Tyler and Microsoft signed an amendment to the Software Development and License Agreement, which grants Microsoft
intellectual property rights in and to certain portions of the software code provided and developed by Tyler into Microsoft Dynamics AX products to be marketed and sold outside of the public sector in exchange for reimbursement payments to partially
offset the research and development costs. In April 2011, Tyler and Microsoft entered into an amended and superseded Master Software Development and License Agreement, which among other things, grants Microsoft intellectual property rights in the
remaining portions of the software code developed by Tyler in exchange for certain other concessions. Under the new agreement, Tyler will continue to receive the previously agreed to reimbursement payments. In addition, Tyler has agreed to commit
certain resources to the development of the next version of Dynamics AX and will receive software and maintenance royalties on direct and indirect sales of the solutions co-developed under this arrangement.

Our research and development expense increased $2.4 million in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase is mainly due to lower reimbursements from Microsoft
in 2011. In 2011 we offset our research and development expense by $3.5 million, which were the amounts earned under the terms of our agreement with Microsoft, compared to $5.1 million in 2010. Prior to December 31, 2010, we received offsets
from Microsoft to our research and development expense of approximately $850,000 each quarter from mid-2008 through the end of 2010 as specified in a statement of work under the Amended Software Development and License Agreement with Microsoft. In
addition, in October 2009, the scope of the project was further expanded which will result in additional offsets to research and development expense, varying in amount from quarter to quarter through 2012 for a total of approximately $6.2 million.
As of December 31, 2011, we have recorded $5.2 million in cumulative offsets under this agreement from Microsoft and expect to record the remaining $1.0 million in the last half of 2012. The actual amount and timing of future research and
development costs and related reimbursements and whether they are capitalized or expensed are subject to change.



Amortization of Customer and Trade Name Intangibles

Acquisition intangibles are comprised of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired that is allocated to
acquired software and customer and trade name intangibles. The remaining excess purchase price is allocated to goodwill that is not subject to amortization. Amortization expense related to acquired software is included with cost of revenues, while
amortization expense of customer and trade name intangibles is recorded as other operating expense. The estimated useful lives of both customer and trade name intangibles are five to 25 years. The following table sets forth a comparison of
amortization of customer and trade name intangibles for the years ended December 31:

Other expense is primarily comprised of interest expense, non-usage and other fees associated with our revolving line of

Income Tax Provision

The following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the years ended December 31:

The effective income tax rates for both years were different from the statutory United States federal income tax rate of
35% due to state income taxes, non-deductible share-based compensation expense, the qualified manufacturing activities deduction, the research and development tax credit and non-deductible meals and entertainment costs.

Approximately 35% of our stock option expense is related to incentive stock options (“ISOs”). As such, a tax benefit is not recorded at the
time the compensation cost related to the options is recorded for book purposes due to the fact that an ISO does not ordinarily result in a tax benefit unless there is a disqualifying disposition. Non-qualified stock options result in the creation
of a deferred tax asset, which is a temporary difference, until the time that the option is exercised. Due to the treatment of ISOs for tax purposes, our effective tax rate from year to year is subject to variability.

2010 Compared to 2009

Revenues

Software licenses

.

The following table sets forth a comparison of our software license revenues for the years ended December 31:

In 2010, ESS software license revenues recognized declined substantially compared to the prior year period. The decrease
in software license revenues is mainly attributable to longer sales cycles and postponements of customer purchasing decisions mainly due to budgetary constraints related to economic conditions. In addition, a portion of the decline was due to a
number of customers choosing our subscription-based options, rather than purchasing the software under a traditional perpetual software license arrangement.



Subscriptions.

The following table sets forth a comparison of our subscription revenues for the years ended December 31:

In January 2010, we acquired Wiznet Inc., which provides primarily subscription-based electronic document filing
solutions for courts and law offices and is included in our ESS segment. Excluding the impact of this acquisition, ESS and total subscription revenues grew by 18% in 2010. Existing customers who converted to our ASP model as well as new customers
for ASP and other hosted service offerings provided the majority of the subscription revenue increase with the remaining increase due to slightly higher rates for disaster recovery services.

Software services

.

The following table sets forth a comparison of our software service
revenues for the years ended December 31:

The decline in software services revenues in 2010 is principally due to lower new software license contract activity in
recent quarters due to weak economic conditions. In addition, the increase in the mix of customers choosing our subscription-based solutions was a factor contributing to lower software services revenues.

Maintenance

.

The following table sets
forth a comparison of our maintenance revenues for the years ended December 31:

Maintenance revenues increased due to growth in our installed customer base and slightly higher maintenance rates on most
of our product lines. Our annual maintenance and support growth rate has declined compared to previous year’s growth rate due to a number of customers converting to ASP arrangements as well as new customers choosing our subscription-based
options, rather than purchasing the software under a traditional perpetual software license arrangement.



Appraisal services

.

The following table sets forth a comparison of our appraisal service revenues for the years ended December 31:

Appraisal services revenue increased 10% in 2010 compared to 2009. The appraisal services business is somewhat cyclical
and driven in part by statutory revaluation cycles in various states. We substantially completed several large appraisal projects mid-2009. We began several new revaluation contracts in late 2009 which contributed to the revenue growth in 2010.

Cost of Revenues and Gross Margin

The following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues for the years ended December 31:

The following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the years ended
December 31:

Software license and acquired software

. Cost of third party software comprised approximately 60% of our cost of
software license revenues in 2010 compared to approximately 69% of our cost of software license in 2009. Third party software sales declined due to lower proprietary software sales.

Costs of acquired software comprises approximately 32% of our cost of software license revenues in 2010 compared to approximately 21% of our cost of software license in 2009. Cost of acquired software
includes amortization expense for software acquired through acquisitions.

The balance is made up of amortization of capitalized development
costs on other software products. We did not capitalize any internal software development costs in 2010 or 2009.



In 2010, our software license gross margin percentage increased compared to the prior year period because
our product mix included less third party software.

Software services, maintenance and subscription-based services

. In 2010, the
software services, maintenance and subscriptions gross margin increased compared to the prior year partly because maintenance and various other services such as ASP and disaster recovery costs typically grow at a slower rate than related revenues
due to leverage in the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale, as well as annual rate increases on certain services.

Appraisal services

. Our appraisal services gross margin declined compared to 2009. Our appraisal services gross margin in 2009 included the positive impact of cost savings and operational
efficiencies experienced on an unusually complex reappraisal project that ended in mid-2009.

Our blended gross margin for 2010 increased
compared to 2009 due to lower third party software expense which offset the impact of a revenue mix that included less software license revenues. The gross margin also benefited from leverage in the utilization of our support, maintenance and
subscription-based service staff and economies of scale and slightly higher rates on certain services.

In addition the effective interest rate in 2010 was 3.4% compared to 1.8% in 2009.

Income Tax Provision

The following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the years ended December 31:

Our effective income tax rate declined compared to 2009 mainly due to a $579,000 research and development tax credit in
2010. In addition to the impact of the research and development tax credit in 2010, the effective income tax rates for both years were different from the statutory United States federal income tax rate of 35% due to state income taxes,
non-deductible share-based compensation expense, the qualified manufacturing activities deduction, and non-deductible meals and entertainment costs.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

As of December 31, 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents
of $1.3 million and investments available-for-sale of $2.0 million, compared to cash and cash equivalents of $2.1 million and investments available-for-sale of $2.2 million at December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2011, we had $60.7
million outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit totaling $8.3 million. Some of our customers, primarily those for our property appraisal services, require that we secure performance bonds before they will select us as a vendor. The
maximum potential amount of an outstanding performance bond would be the remaining cost of work to be performed under our contracts. The notional amount of performance guarantees outstanding as of December 31, 2011 was estimated to be $61.3
million. We provide letters of credit as security for the issuance of performance bonds. We do not believe these letters of credit will be required to be drawn upon. These letters of credit expire through mid-2012. We believe our $150.0 million
revolving line of credit provides us with sufficient flexibility to meet our long-term financial needs.

The following table sets forth a
summary of cash flows for the years ended December 31:

Net cash provided by operating activities continues to be our primary source of funds to finance operating needs and
capital expenditures. Other potential capital resources include cash on hand, public and private issuances of debt and equity securities, and bank borrowings. It is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets in the future may
be limited by economic conditions or other factors. We currently believe that cash provided by operating activities, cash on hand and available credit are sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, income tax
obligations, and share repurchases for at least the next twelve months.



In 2011, operating activities provided net cash of $56.4 million, primarily generated from net income of
$27.6 million, non-cash depreciation and amortization charges of $10.7 million and non-cash share-based compensation expense of $6.3 million. Working capital, excluding cash, declined $17.7 million mainly due to the timing of payments on income tax
liabilities and higher accrued bonus liabilities in 2011 compared to 2010 as a result of improved financial performance. Our accounts receivable and deferred revenue balances were also higher than 2010 due to an increase in annual software
maintenance billings as a result of growth in our installed customer base. In addition, our growth in subscription-based arrangements has also contributed to larger deferred revenue balances.

In general, changes in the balance of deferred revenue are cyclical and primarily driven by the timing of our maintenance renewal billings. Our renewal dates occur throughout the year but our heaviest
renewal cycles occur in the second and fourth quarters.

At December 31, 2011, our days sales outstanding (“DSOs”) were 99 days
compared to DSOs of 102 days at December 31, 2010. DSOs are calculated based on accounts receivable (excluding long-term receivables, but including unbilled receivables) divided by the quotient of annualized quarterly revenues divided by 360
days.

Investments available-for-sale consist of two auction rate municipal securities (“ARS”) which are collateralized debt
obligations supported by municipal agencies and do not include mortgage-backed securities. Short-term investments available-for-sale consists of a portion of one of these ARS which was partially redeemed at par during the period January 1, 2012
through February 23, 2012. These ARS are debt instruments with stated maturities of 20 to 30 years, for which the interest rate is designed to be reset through Dutch auctions approximately every 30 days. However, due to events in the credit
markets, auctions for these securities have not occurred since February 2008. Both of our ARS have had very small partial redemptions at par in the period from July 2009 through February 2012. As of December 31, 2011 we have continued to earn
and collect interest on both of our ARS. Because quoted prices in active markets are no longer available we determined the estimated fair values of these securities utilizing a discounted trinomial model. The model considers the probability of three
potential occurrences for each auction event through the maturity date of each ARS. The three potential outcomes for each auction are (i) successful auction/early redemption, (ii) failed auction and (iii) issuer default. Inputs in
determining the probabilities of the potential outcomes include but are not limited to, the securities’ collateral, credit rating, insurance, issuer’s financial standing, contractual restrictions on disposition and the liquidity in the
market. The fair value of each ARS is determined by summing the present value of the probability-weighted future principal and interest payments determined by the model. Since there can be no assurances that auctions for these securities will be
successful in the near future, we have classified our ARS as non-current investments.

In connection with this estimate of fair value, we have
recorded an after-tax temporary unrealized loss on our non-current ARS of $80,000, net of related tax effects of $43,000 in 2011, which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our balance sheet.

We consider the impairment in our ARS as temporary because we do not have the intent to sell, nor is it more-likely-than-not that we will be required to
sell these securities before recovery of their cost basis. We believe that this temporary decline in fair value is due entirely to liquidity issues, because the underlying assets of these securities are supported by municipal agencies and do not
include mortgage-backed securities, have redemption features which call for redemption at 100% of par value and have a current credit rating of A or AA. The ratings on the ARS take into account credit support through insurance policies guaranteeing
each of the bonds’ payment of principal and accrued interest, if it becomes necessary. In addition, both ARS have had very small partial redemptions at par in the period July 2009 through February 2012. Based on our cash and cash equivalents
balance of $1.3 million, expected operating cash flows and a $150.0 million revolving credit line, we do not believe a lack of liquidity associated with our ARS will adversely affect our ability to conduct business, and believe we have the ability
to hold the securities throughout the currently estimated recovery period. We will continue to evaluate any changes in the fair value of our ARS and in the future, depending upon existing market conditions, we may be required to record an
other-than-temporary decline in market value.

Investing activities used cash of $28.8 million in 2011 compared to $8.7 million in 2010. In
2011, we completed the acquisition of Windsor. The purchase price, net of cash acquired, was approximately $16.4 million. In March 2011 we paid $6.6 million for approximately 27 acres of land and a building in Plano, Texas. The acquisition and
capital expenditures were funded from cash generated from operations.



In January 2010, we completed the acquisition of the assets of Wiznet, Inc. for $9.5 million in cash. Also,
in connection with plans to consolidate workforces and support planned long-term growth, we paid $1.3 million in 2010 compared to $9.4 million in 2009 for construction of an office building in Lubbock, Texas. The impact of these investing activities
in 2010 was offset somewhat by the release of $6.0 million of restricted cash. In August 2010, we elected to replace our cash-collateralized letters of credit with ones issued under our revolving line of credit.

In 2009, we liquidated $2.5 million of investments in ARS for cash at par. In 2009 we also completed the acquisition of all of the capital stock of
Assessment Evaluation Services, Inc. for $1.1 million in cash, paid $700,000 in cash for certain assets of KPL, Inc. d/b/a Parker-Lowe & Associates and acquired various software assets for $1.1 million in cash

Cash used in financing activities was primarily comprised of purchases of treasury shares, net of proceeds from stock option exercises, borrowings and
payments on our revolving credit line and contributions from our employee stock purchase plan. During 2011, we purchased 3.0 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $71.8 million. These purchases were primarily
funded by borrowings under our revolving credit line and cash from operations.

The repurchase program, which was approved by our board of
directors, was announced in October 2002, and was amended in April and July 2003, October 2004, October 2005, May 2007, May 2008, October 2008, May 2009, July 2010, October 2010 and September 2011. As of
December 31, 2011, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to 1.7 million additional shares of our common stock. Our share repurchase program allows us to repurchase shares at our discretion and market conditions influence the
timing of the buybacks and the number of shares repurchased, as well as the volume of employee stock option exercises. These share repurchases are funded using our existing cash balances and borrowings under our revolving credit agreement and may
occur through open market purchases and transactions structured through investment banking institutions, privately negotiated transactions and/or other mechanisms. There is no expiration date specified for the authorization and we intend to
repurchase stock under the plan from time to time.

During 2010, we purchased 3.6 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate
purchase price of $65.8 million and during 2009, we purchased 1.2 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $17.0 million.

In 2011 we issued 582,000 shares of common stock and received $3.6 million in aggregate proceeds upon exercise of stock options. In 2010 we received $3.2 million from the exercise of options to purchase
approximately 615,000 shares of our common stock under our employee stock option plan and during 2009, we received $2.3 million from the exercise of options to purchase approximately 425,000 shares of our common stock under our employee stock option
plan. In 2011, 2010 and 2009 we received $2.0 million, $1.9 million and $1.5 million, respectively, from contributions to the Tyler Technologies, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

We have a $150.0 million Credit Agreement (the “Credit Facility”) and a related pledge and security agreement with a group of seven financial institutions, with Bank of America, N.A., as
Administrative Agent. The Credit Facility provides for a revolving credit line of $150.0 million (which may be increased up to $200.0 million subject to our obtaining commitments for such increase), with a $25.0 million sublimit for letters of
credit. The Credit Facility matures on August 11, 2014. Borrowings under the Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital requirements, acquisitions and share repurchases. In 2010 we paid $2.0 million in
related debt issuance costs.

Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate of either (1) the Bank of America’s prime
rate plus a margin of 1.50% to 2.75% or (2) the 30, 60, 90 or 180-day LIBOR rate plus a margin of 2.50% to 3.75%, with the margin determined by our consolidated leverage ratio. In 2011 and 2010 our effective average interest rate for borrowings
was 3.3% and 3.4%, respectively. As of December 31, 2011 our interest rate was 3.4%. The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding real property. The Credit Facility requires us to maintain certain financial
ratios and other financial conditions and prohibits us from making certain investments, advances, cash dividends or loans, and limits incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens. As of December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with those
covenants.

As of December 31, 2011, we had $60.7 million in outstanding borrowings and unused available borrowing capacity of $81.0
million under the Credit Facility. In addition, as of December 31, 2011, our bank had issued outstanding letters of credit totaling $8.3 million to secure surety bonds required by some of our customer contracts. These letters of credit reduce
our available borrowing capacity and expire through mid-2012.

We paid income taxes, net of refunds received, of $13.4 million in 2011, $15.8
million in 2010, and $18.1 million in 2009.



Excluding acquisitions and investments in office buildings, we anticipate that 2012 capital spending will
be between $6.0 million and $7.0 million. We expect the majority of this capital spending will consist of computer equipment and software for infrastructure replacements and expansion. We currently do not expect to capitalize significant amounts
related to software development in 2012, but the actual amount and timing of those costs, and whether they are capitalized or expensed may result in additional capitalized software development. We also plan to spend approximately $16.7 million over
the next two years in connection with the construction of an office building in Plano, Texas. We expect approximately $9.0 million of the total cost will be paid in 2012 with the remaining $7.7 million paid in 2013. Capital spending, including the
construction of an office facility, is expected to be funded from existing cash balances and cash flows from operations.

In January 2012, we
acquired substantially all of the assets of Akanda Innovation, Inc., a provider of web-based solutions to the public sector which are integrated with our property tax software, for a total purchase price of $2.9 million. The purchase price included
certain liabilities assumed by us of approximately $800,000, resulting in net cash paid to the sellers of $2.1 million, of which $900,000 was paid prior to December 31, 2011 and is included with other current assets.

From time to time we engage in discussions with potential acquisition candidates. In order to pursue such opportunities, which could require significant
commitments of capital, we may be required to incur debt or to issue additional potentially dilutive securities in the future. No assurance can be given as to our future acquisition opportunities and how such opportunities will be financed.

We lease office facilities, as well as transportation, computer and other equipment used in our operations under non-cancelable operating
lease agreements expiring at various dates through 2018. Most leases contain renewal options and some contain purchase options.

Summarized in
the table below are our obligations to make future payments under our long-term revolving credit agreement and lease obligations at December 31, 2011 (in thousands):

CAPITALIZATION

At December 31, 2011, our capitalization consisted of $60.7 million in long-term obligations and $78.1 million of shareholders’ equity. Our
total debt-to-capital ratio was 43.7% at December 31, 2011.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2011-08 amends existing guidance by giving an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to
determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If this is the case, companies will need to perform a more detailed two-step goodwill
impairment test which is used to identify potential goodwill impairments and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment losses to be recognized, if any. ASU 2011-08 will be effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, which for us will be in our 2012 second quarter, with early adoption permitted. We do not believe the adoption of this update will have a material impact on our financial statements.

In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income, which amends certain guidance in ASC 220, Comprehensive Income. ASU
2011-05 revises the manner in which entities present comprehensive income in their financial statements. ASU 2011-05 removes the presentation options in ASC 220 and requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either (1) a
continuous statement of comprehensive income or (2) two separate but consecutive statements. ASU 2011-05 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011 and will be applied on a retrospective basis.



ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

Market risk represents the risk of loss that may affect us due to adverse changes in financial market prices and interest rates. As of December 31, 2011 we had $60.7 million in outstanding borrowings
under the Credit Facility. These borrowings bear interest at a rate of either (1) the Bank of America’s prime rate plus a margin of 1.50% to 2.75% or (2) the 30, 60, 90 or 180-day LIBOR rate plus a margin of 2.50% to 3.75%, with the
margin determined by our consolidated leverage ratio. In 2011 and 2010 our effective average interest rate for borrowings was 3.3% and 3.4%, respectively. As of December 31, 2011 our interest rate was 3.4%. Assuming borrowings of $60.7 million,
a hypothetical 10% increase in our interest rate at December 31, 2011 for a one year period would result in approximately $206,000 of additional interest rate expense.

Investments available-for-sale consist of two ARS with stated maturities of 20 to 30 years, for which the interest rate is designed to be reset through Dutch auctions approximately every 30 days which
would have qualified as Level 1 under ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements. However, due to events in the credit markets, auctions for these securities have not occurred since February 2008. Therefore, quoted prices in active markets are no longer
available and we determined the estimated fair values of these securities as of December 31, 2011, utilizing a discounted trinomial model.

In association with this estimate of fair value, we have recorded an after-tax temporary unrealized loss on our non-current ARS of $80,000, net of
related tax effects of $43,000 in 2011, which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our balance sheet. We consider the impairment in our ARS as temporary because we do not have the intent to sell, nor is it more-likely-than-not that
we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their cost basis. We believe that this temporary decline in fair value is due entirely to liquidity issues, because the underlying assets of these securities are supported by municipal
agencies and do not include mortgage-backed securities, have redemption features which call for redemption at 100% of par value and have a current credit rating of A or AA. The ratings on the ARS take into account credit support through insurance
policies guaranteeing each of the bonds’ payment of principal and accrued interest, if it becomes necessary. In addition, both ARS have had very small partial redemptions at par in the period July 2009 through February 2012. Based on our cash
and cash equivalents balance of $1.3 million, expected operating cash flows and a $150.0 million revolving credit line, we do not believe a lack of liquidity associated with our ARS will adversely affect our ability to conduct business, and believe
we have the ability to hold the securities throughout the currently estimated recovery period. We will continue to evaluate any changes in the fair value of our ARS and in the future, depending upon existing market conditions, we may be required to
record an other-than-temporary decline in market value.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

— We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the
Securities Exchange Act) designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. These include controls and procedures designed to ensure that this information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Management, with the participation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
December 31, 2011. Based on this evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2011.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

— Tyler’s management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Tyler’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to Tyler’s management and
board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.



Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Management assessed the effectiveness of Tyler’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

. Based on our assessment, we concluded that, as of December 31, 2011, Tyler’s internal control over financial
reporting was effective based on those criteria.

Tyler’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 has been
audited by Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm who also audited Tyler’s financial statements. Ernst & Young’s attestation report on Tyler’s internal control over financial reporting
appears on page F-2 hereof.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

— During the quarter ended December 31,
2011, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f), that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Tyler Technologies, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Tyler Technologies,
Inc. as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related statements of income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted
our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Tyler Technologies, Inc. at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results
of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Tyler Technologies, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 23, 2012 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Tyler
Technologies, Inc.

We have audited Tyler Technologies, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011,
based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Tyler Technologies, Inc.’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting.” Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In our opinion, Tyler Technologies, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the balance sheets of Tyler Technologies, Inc. as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related statements of income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2011 and our report dated February 23, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

We provide
integrated software systems and related services for the public sector, with a focus on local and state governments. We develop and market a broad line of software solutions and services to address the information technology (“IT”) needs
of cities, counties, schools and other local government entities as well as state governments. In addition, we provide professional IT services, including software and hardware installation, data conversion, training, and for certain customers,
product modifications, along with continuing maintenance and support for customers using our systems. We also provide subscription-based services such as application service provider arrangements and other hosting services as well as property
appraisal outsourcing services for taxing jurisdictions.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash in excess of that necessary for operating requirements is invested in short-term, highly liquid, income-producing investments. Investments with original maturities of three months or less are
classified as cash and cash equivalents, which primarily consist of money market funds. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates market value. As of December 31, 2011, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $8.3
million. Some of our customers, primarily those for our property appraisal services, require that we secure performance bonds before they will select us as a vendor. The maximum potential amount of an outstanding performance bond would be the
remaining cost of work to be performed under our contracts. The notional amount of performance guarantees outstanding as of December 31, 2011 was estimated to be $61.3 million. We provide letters of credit as security for the issuance of
performance bonds. These letters of credit are issued under our revolving line of credit and reduce our available borrowing capacity. We do not believe these letters of credit will be required to be drawn upon. These letters of credit expire through
mid-2012.

INVESTMENTS

Investments
consist of auction rate municipal securities. These investments are classified as available-for-sale securities and are stated at fair value in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820, Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosures. Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, if any, are not reflected in earnings but are reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income until realized. The cost basis of securities sold is the
specific cost of the auction rate municipal security. We account for the transactions as “proceeds from sales of investments” for the security relinquished, and a “purchases of investments” for the security purchased, in the
accompanying Statements of Cash Flows.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Software Arrangements:

We earn revenue from software licenses, subscriptions, software
services, post-contract customer support (“PCS” or “maintenance”), and hardware. PCS includes telephone support, bug fixes, and rights to upgrades on a when-and-if available basis. We provide services that range from
installation, training, and basic consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer needs. In software arrangements that include rights to multiple software products, specified upgrades, PCS, and/or other services, we
allocate the total arrangement fee among each deliverable based on the relative fair value of each.

We typically enter into multiple element
arrangements, which include software licenses, software services, PCS and occasionally hardware. The majority of our software arrangements are multiple element arrangements, but for those arrangements that involve significant production,
modification or customization of the software, or where software services are otherwise considered essential to the functionality of the software in the customer’s environment, we use contract accounting and apply the provisions of the
Construction — Type and Production — Type Contracts as discussed in ASC 605-35, Multiple Elements Arrangements.

F-7


If the arrangement does not require significant production, modification or customization or where the
software services are not considered essential to the functionality of the software, revenue is recognized when all of the following conditions are met:

i.

persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;

ii.

delivery has occurred;

iii.

our fee is fixed or determinable; and

iv.

collectability is probable.

For multiple
element arrangements, each element of the arrangement is analyzed and we allocate a portion of the total arrangement fee to the elements based on the relative fair value of the element using vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value
(“VSOE”), regardless of any separate prices stated within the contract for each element. Fair value is considered the price a customer would be required to pay if the element was sold separately based on our historical experience of
stand-alone sales of these elements to third parties. For PCS, we use renewal rates for continued support arrangements to determine fair value. For software services, we use the fair value we charge our customers when those services are sold
separately. We monitor our transactions to determine that we maintain and periodically revise VSOE to reflect fair value. In software arrangements in which we have the fair value of all undelivered elements but not of a delivered element, we apply
the “residual method,” in compliance with ASC 985-605, Software Revenue Recognition, in accounting for any element of a multiple element arrangement involving software that remains undelivered such that any discount inherent in a contract
is allocated to the delivered element. Under the residual method, if the fair value of all undelivered elements is determinable, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to
the delivered element(s) and is recognized as revenue assuming the other revenue recognition criteria are met. In software arrangements in which we do not have VSOE for all undelivered elements, revenue is deferred until fair value is determined or
all elements for which we do not have VSOE have been delivered. Alternatively, if sufficient VSOE does not exist and the only undelivered element is services that do not involve significant modification or customization of the software, the entire
fee is recognized over the period during which the services are expected to be performed.

Software Licenses

We recognize the revenue allocable to software licenses and specified upgrades upon delivery of the software product or upgrade to the customer, unless
the fee is not fixed or determinable or collectability is not probable. If the fee is not fixed or determinable, software license revenue is generally recognized as payments become due from the customer. If collectability is not considered probable,
revenue is recognized when the fee is collected. Arrangements that include software services, such as training or installation, are evaluated to determine whether those services are essential to the product’s functionality.

A majority of our software arrangements involve “off-the-shelf” software. We consider software to be off-the-shelf software if it can be added
to an arrangement with minor changes in the underlying code and it can be used by the customer for the customer’s purpose upon installation. For off-the-shelf software arrangements, we recognize the software license fee as revenue after
delivery has occurred, customer acceptance is reasonably assured, that portion of the fee represents a non-refundable enforceable claim and is probable of collection, and the remaining services such as training are not considered essential to the
product’s functionality.

For arrangements that involve significant production, modification or customization of the software, or where
software services are otherwise considered essential, we recognize revenue using contract accounting. We generally use the percentage-of-completion method to recognize revenue from these arrangements. We measure progress-to-completion primarily
using labor hours incurred, or value added. The percentage-of-completion method generally results in the recognition of reasonably consistent profit margins over the life of a contract because we have the ability to produce reasonably dependable
estimates of contract billings and contract costs. We use the level of profit margin that is most likely to occur on a contract. If the most likely profit margin cannot be precisely determined, the lowest probable level of profit in the range of
estimates is used until the results can be estimated more precisely. These arrangements are often implemented over an extended time period and occasionally require us to revise total cost estimates. Amounts recognized in revenue are calculated using
the progress-to-completion measurement after giving effect to any changes in our cost estimates. Changes to total estimated contract costs, if any, are recorded in the period they are determined. Estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are
recorded in the period in which we first determine that a loss is apparent. For arrangements that include new product releases for which it is difficult to estimate final profitability except to assume that no loss will ultimately be incurred, we
recognize revenue under the completed contract method. Under the completed contract method, revenue is recognized only when a contract is completed or substantially complete. Historically these amounts have been immaterial.

F-8


Subscription-Based Services

Subscription-based services primarily consist of revenues derived from application service provider (“ASP”) arrangements and other hosted service offerings, software subscriptions, document
processing transaction fees and disaster recovery services.

We recognize revenue for ASP and other hosting services, software subscriptions
and disaster recovery ratably over the period of the applicable agreement as services are provided. Disaster recovery agreements and other hosting services are typically renewable annually. ASP and software subscriptions are typically for periods of
three to six years. The majority of the ASP and other hosting services and software subscriptions also include professional services as well as maintenance and support. In certain ASP arrangements, the customer also acquires a license to the
software.

For ASP and other hosting arrangements, we evaluate whether the customer has the contractual right to take possession of our
software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and whether the customer can feasibly maintain the software on the customer’s hardware or enter into another arrangement with a third party to host the software. If we
determine that the customer has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and can feasibly maintain the software on the customer’s hardware or enter into another
arrangement with a third party to host the software, we recognize the license, professional services and hosting services revenues pursuant to ASC 985-605, Software Revenue Recognition. For ASP and other hosting arrangements that do not meet the
criteria for recognition under ASC 985-605, we account for the elements under ASC 605-25, Multiple Element Arrangements using all applicable facts and circumstances, including whether (i) the element has stand-alone value, (ii) there is a
general right of return and (iii) the revenue is contingent on delivery of other elements. We allocate contract value to each element of the arrangement that qualifies for treatment as a separate element based on VSOE, and if VSOE is not
available, third party evidence, and if third party evidence is unavailable, estimated selling price. For professional services associated with ASP and hosting arrangements that we determine do not have stand-alone value to the customer or are
contingent on delivery of other elements, we recognize the services revenue ratably over the remaining contractual period once hosting has gone live and we may begin billing for the hosting services. We record amounts that have been invoiced in
accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenues, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.

Document
processing transaction fees primarily pertain to documents filed with the courts by attorneys and other third parties via our e-filing services and retrieval of filed documents via our access services, and the elements for these arrangements are
accounted for under ASC 605-25. For each document filed with a court, the filer generally pays a transaction fee and a court filing fee to us and we remit a portion of the transaction fee and the filing fee to the court. We record as revenue the
transaction fee, and the portion of the transaction fee remitted to the courts is recorded as cost of sales as we are acting as a principal in the arrangement. Court filing fees collected on behalf of the courts and remitted to the courts are
recorded on a net basis and do not affect the statement of income or the balance sheet.

Software Services

Some of our software arrangements include services considered essential for the customer to use the software for the customer’s purposes. For these
software arrangements, both the software license revenue and the services revenue are recognized as the services are performed using the percentage-of-completion contract accounting method. When software services are not considered essential, the
fee allocable to the service element is recognized as revenue as we perform the services.

Computer Hardware Equipment

Revenue allocable to computer hardware equipment is recognized when we deliver the equipment and collection is probable.

Postcontract Customer Support

Our customers
generally enter into PCS agreements when they purchase our software licenses. Our PCS agreements are typically renewable annually. Revenue allocated to PCS is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period the PCS is provided. All significant
costs and expenses associated with PCS are expensed as incurred. VSOE of fair value for the maintenance and support obligations for software licenses is based upon the specific sale renewals to customers.

F-9


Allocation of Revenue in Statement of Income

In our statements of income, we allocate revenue to software licenses, software services, maintenance and hardware and other based on the VSOE of fair value for elements in each revenue arrangement and
the application of the residual method for arrangements in which we have established VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements. In arrangements where we are not able to establish VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements, revenue is
first allocated to any undelivered elements for which VSOE of fair value has been established. We then allocate revenue to any undelivered elements for which VSOE of fair value has not been established based upon management’s best estimate of
fair value of those undelivered elements and apply a residual method to determine the license fee. Management’s best estimate of fair value of undelivered elements for which VSOE of fair value has not been established is based upon the VSOE of
similar offerings and other objective criteria.

Appraisal Services:

For our property appraisal projects, we recognize revenue using the proportional performance method of revenue recognition since many of these projects are implemented over one to three year periods and
consist of various unique activities. Under this method of revenue recognition, we identify each activity for the appraisal project, with a typical project generally calling for bonding, office set up, training, routing of map information, data
entry, data collection, data verification, informal hearings, appeals and project management. Each activity or act is specifically identified and assigned an estimated cost. Costs which are considered to be associated with indirect activities, such
as bonding costs and office set up, are expensed as incurred. These costs are typically billed as incurred and are recognized as revenue equal to cost. Direct contract fulfillment activities and related supervisory costs such as data collection,
data entry and verification are expensed as incurred. The direct costs for these activities are determined and the total contract value is then allocated to each activity based on a consistent profit margin. Each activity is assigned a consistent
unit of measure to determine progress towards completion and revenue is recognized for each activity based upon the percentage complete as applied to the estimated revenue for that activity. Progress for the fulfillment activities is typically based
on labor hours or an output measure such as the number of parcel counts completed for that activity. Estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which we first determine that a loss is apparent.

Other:

The majority of deferred revenue
consists of unearned support and maintenance revenue that has been billed based on contractual terms in the underlying arrangement with the remaining balance consisting of payments received in advance of revenue being earned under software
licensing, subscription-based services, software and appraisal services and hardware installation. Unbilled revenue is not billable at the balance sheet date but is recoverable over the remaining life of the contract through billings made in
accordance with contractual agreements. The termination clauses in our contracts generally provide for the payment for the fair value of products delivered and services performed in the event of an early termination.

Prepaid expenses and other current assets include direct and incremental costs, consisting primarily of commissions associated with arrangements for
which revenue recognition has been deferred and third party subcontractor payments. Such costs are expensed at the time the related revenue is recognized.

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the application of the percentage-of-completion and proportional performance
methods of revenue recognition, the carrying amount and estimated useful lives of intangible assets, determination of share-based compensation expense and valuation allowance for receivables. Actual results could differ from estimates.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET

Property,
equipment and purchased software are recorded at original cost and increased by the cost of any significant improvements after purchase. We expense maintenance and repairs when incurred. Depreciation and amortization is calculated using the
straight-line method over the shorter of the asset’s estimated useful life or the term of the lease in the case of leasehold improvements. For income tax purposes, we use accelerated depreciation methods as allowed by tax laws.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS

We expensed
research and development costs of $16.4 million during 2011, $14.0 million during 2010 and $11.2 million during 2009. We reduced our research and development expense by approximately $3.5 million in 2011, $5.1 million in 2010 and $3.5 million in
2009, which was the amount earned under the terms of our strategic alliance with a development partner.

F-10


INCOME TAXES

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred taxes arise because of different treatment between financial statement accounting and tax accounting, known as “temporary
differences.” We record the tax effect of these temporary differences as “deferred tax assets” (generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the future periods) and “deferred tax liabilities” (generally
items that we received a tax deduction for, which have not yet been recorded in the income statement). The deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rules and laws that are expected to be in effect when the temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance would be established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

We have a stock
option plan that provides for the grant of stock options to key employees, directors and non-employee consultants. Stock options vest after four to six years of continuous service from the date of grant and have a contractual term of ten years. We
account for share-based compensation utilizing the fair value recognition pursuant to ASC 718, Stock Compensation. See Note 10 — “Share-Based Compensation” for further information.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Goodwill

We have used the acquisition
method of accounting for all of our business combinations. Our business acquisitions result in the allocation of the purchase price to goodwill and other intangible assets. We first allocate the cost of acquired companies to identifiable assets
based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed, is recorded as goodwill.

We review goodwill impairment annually as of April or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable. Assets, liabilities and goodwill have
been assigned to reporting units based on assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition.

The provisions of ASC 350,
Intangibles – Goodwill and Other, require that we perform a two-step impairment test on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the
carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the
reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the asset’s
implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. The fair values calculated in our impairment tests are determined using discounted cash flow models involving several assumptions. These assumptions include, but
are not limited to, anticipated operating income growth rates, our long-term anticipated operating income growth rate and the discount rate. Our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are
using to manage the underlying businesses. The assumptions that are used are based upon what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value. We evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value calculations of our
reporting units by comparing the total of the fair value of all of our reporting units to our total market capitalization. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently
uncertain. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred between testing dates. Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in expected future cash flows; a sustained,
significant decline in stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; and reductions in growth rates. In addition, products, capabilities, or technologies
developed by others may render our software products obsolete or non-competitive. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill. Our annual goodwill impairment analysis, which we performed
during the second quarter of 2011, did not result in an impairment charge.

Other Intangible Assets

We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets other than goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an
impairment may exist. Customer base constitutes approximately 85% of our purchased intangible assets other than goodwill. We review our customer turnover each year for indications of impairment. Our customer turnover has historically been very low.
If indications of impairment are determined to exist, we measure the recoverability of assets by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying
amount of the assets exceeds their estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. There have been no significant impairments of
intangible assets in any of the periods presented.

F-11


IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

We periodically evaluate whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our property and equipment or other long-lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. If
such circumstances are determined to exist, we measure the recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset or appropriate grouping of assets and the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected
to be generated by the assets. If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets
to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held
for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet. There have been no significant impairments of long-lived assets in any of the periods presented.

COSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE

We capitalize
software development costs upon the establishment of technological feasibility and prior to the availability of the product for general release to customers. We did not capitalize any internal software development costs in 2011, 2010 or 2009.
Software development costs primarily consist of personnel costs and rent for related office space. We begin to amortize capitalized costs when a product is available for general release to customers. Amortization expense is determined on a
product-by-product basis at a rate not less than straight-line basis over the product’s remaining estimated economic life, but not to exceed five years. Amortization of software development costs was approximately $125,000 in 2011, $430,000 in
2010, and $743,000 in 2009, and is included in cost of software license revenue in the accompanying statements of income.

FAIR VALUE OF
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivables, accounts payables, short-term obligations and certain other assets at
cost approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. Our investments available-for-sale are recorded at fair value as of December 31, 2011 based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure
their fair value. See Note 3 — “Fair Value of Financial Instruments” for further information. The fair value of our revolving line of credit approximates book value as of December 31, 2011.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK AND UNBILLED RECEIVABLES

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, investments in auction rate securities and accounts
receivable from trade customers. Our cash and cash equivalents primarily consists of money market fund investments which are maintained at one major financial institution and the balances often exceed insured amounts. As of December 31, 2011 we
had cash and cash equivalents of $1.3 million. We perform periodic evaluations of the credit standing of this financial institution.

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the size and geographical diversity of our customer base. Historically, our
credit losses have not been significant. As a result, we do not believe we have any significant concentrations of credit risk as of December 31, 2011.

We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments, which are provided at the time the revenue is recognized. Since most of our customers are domestic governmental entities, we rarely
incur a loss resulting from the inability of a customer to make required payments. Events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount for the allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments may require revision,
include, but are not limited to, deterioration of a customer’s financial condition, failure to manage our customer’s expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered, and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of
our software products.

F-12


The following table summarizes the changes in the allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments:

The termination clauses in most of our contracts provide for the payment for the fair value of products delivered or
services performed in the event of early termination. Our property appraisal outsourcing service contracts can range up to three years and, in a few cases, as long as five years, in duration. In connection with these contracts, as well as certain
software service contracts, we may perform work prior to when the software and services are billable and/or payable pursuant to the contract. We have historically recorded such unbilled receivables (costs and estimated profit in excess of billings)
in connection with (1) property appraisal services contracts accounted for using proportional performance accounting in which the revenue is earned based upon activities performed in one accounting period but the billing normally occurs shortly
thereafter and may span another accounting period; (2) software services contracts accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method of revenue recognition using labor hours as a measure of progress towards completion in which the
services are performed in one accounting period but the billing for the software element of the arrangement may be based upon the specific phase of the implementation; (3) software revenue for which we have objective evidence that the
customer-specified objective criteria has been met but the billing has not yet been submitted to the customer; (4) some of our contracts provide for an amount to be withheld from a progress billing (generally a 10% retention) until final and
satisfactory project completion is achieved; and (5) in a limited number of cases, we may grant extended payment terms generally to existing customers with whom we have a long-term relationship and favorable collection history.

In connection with this activity, we have recorded unbilled receivables of $7.2 million and $11.7 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010,
respectively. We also have recorded retention receivables of $1.9 million and $2.4 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively and these retentions become payable upon the completion of the contract or completion of our field work and
formal hearings. Unbilled receivables and retention receivables expected to be collected in excess of one year have been included with accounts receivable, long-term portion in the accompanying balance sheets.

As of December 31, 2010 our accounts receivable balance included $4.2 million associated with one customer that terminated its arrangement with us
for convenience and, in addition, had disputed certain amounts we invoiced prior to the termination. In December 2011, we negotiated a final settlement with this customer which did not have a material impact on the financial statements.

INDEMNIFICATION

Most of our software license
agreements indemnify our customers in the event that the software sold infringes upon the intellectual property rights of a third party. These agreements typically provide that in such event we will either modify or replace the software so that it
becomes non-infringing or procure for the customer the right to use the software. We have recorded no liability associated with these indemnifications, as we are not aware of any pending or threatened infringement actions that are possible losses.
We believe the estimated fair value of these intellectual property indemnification clauses is minimal.

We have also agreed to indemnify our
officers and board members if they are named or threatened to be named as a party to any proceeding by reason of the fact that they acted in such capacity. We maintain directors’ and officers’ insurance coverage to protect against any such
losses. We have recorded no liability associated with these indemnifications. Because of our insurance coverage, we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Accounting
Standards Update (“ASU”) 2011-08 amends existing guidance by giving an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50%) that the fair value
of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If this is the case, companies will need to perform a more detailed two-step goodwill impairment test which is used to identify potential goodwill impairments and to measure the amount of
goodwill impairment losses to be recognized, if any. ASU 2011-08 will be effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, which for us will be in our 2012 second quarter,
with early adoption permitted. We do not believe the adoption of this update will have a material impact on our financial statements.

F-13


In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income, which amends certain
guidance in ASC 220, Comprehensive Income. ASU 2011-05 revises the manner in which entities present comprehensive income in their financial statements. ASU 2011-05 removes the presentation options in ASC 220 and requires entities to report
components of comprehensive income in either (1) a continuous statement of comprehensive income or (2) two separate but consecutive statements. ASU 2011-05 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2011 and will be applied on a retrospective basis.

(2) ACQUISITIONS


On
October 14, 2011, we acquired all of the capital stock of Windsor Management Group, L.L.C. (“Windsor”) for a cash purchase price of $16.4 million, net of cash acquired of $7.4 million. Windsor provides a suite of financial and human
capital management solutions to the K-12 education market, primarily in the Southwest.

In connection with this transaction we recorded
customer relationship of approximately $5.6 million, acquired software of $2.4 million, deferred revenue of $6.2 million and net assets of $1.5 million. We recorded goodwill of approximately $13.3 million, all of which is expected to be deductible
for tax purposes. Customer relationships and acquired software will be amortized over a weighted average period of eight years. We believe likely market participants for this transaction would be software companies with a presence in the K-12 school
market. Therefore, the goodwill of $13.3 million arising from the acquisition is primarily attributed to our ability to maximize the value of the customer base through Tyler’s software product suite that targets the K-12 school market and to a
much lesser extent, the assembled workforce of Windsor. Our balance sheet as of December 31, 2011 reflects the allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.

The operating results of this acquisition are included in our results of operations from the date of acquisition.


On January 1, 2010 we
acquired all of the assets of Wiznet, Inc. (“Wiznet”) for a cash purchase price of $9.5 million. Wiznet provides electronic document filing solutions for courts and law offices throughout the United States and is integrated with our
primary courts and justice solution.


On July 16, 2009, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of KPL, Inc. d/b/a Parker-Lowe & Associates (“Parker-Lowe”) for $700,000 in cash. Parker-Lowe provides scanning and
retrieval software and related services for land record and social services offices in local governments primarily in the North Carolina area. This acquisition was accounted for as a purchase of a business.

On April 3, 2009, we completed the acquisition of all of the capital stock of Assessment Evaluation Services, Inc. (“AES”). AES develops
integrated property appraisal solutions and specializes in applications that deal with the unique provisions of the California Revenue and Taxation Code. The purchase price was approximately $1.1 million in cash.

In 2009, we also paid approximately $1.1 million for certain software assets to complement our tax and appraisal solutions and our student information
management solutions.

F-14


(3) FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Assets recorded at fair value in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2011 are categorized based upon the level of judgment
associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value. Hierarchical levels, defined by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, are directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these
assets, are as follows:

Level 1 — Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities at the measurement date;

Level 2 — Inputs other than Level 1 inputs that are either
directly or indirectly observable; and

Level 3 — Unobservable inputs, for which little or no market data
exist, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own

assumptions.

As of December 31, 2011 we held investments available-for-sale that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The following
tables summarize the fair value of these financial assets as well as cash and cash equivalents:

Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds with original maturity dates of three months or less,
for which we determine fair value through quoted market prices. These money market funds did not experience any declines in fair value in 2011.

Investments available-for-sale consist of two auction rate municipal securities (“ARS”) which are collateralized debt obligations supported by
municipal agencies and do not include mortgage-backed securities. Short-term investments available-for-sale consists of a portion of one of these ARS which was partially redeemed at par during the period January 1, 2012 through
February 23, 2012. These ARS are debt instruments with stated maturities of 20 and 30 years, for which the interest rate is designed to be reset through Dutch auctions approximately every 30 days. However, due to events in the credit markets,
auctions for these securities have not occurred since February 2008. Both of our ARS have had very small partial redemptions at par in the period from July 2009 through February 2012. As of December 31, 2011 we have continued to earn and
collect interest on both of our ARS.

Because quoted prices in active markets are no longer available we determined the estimated fair values
of these securities utilizing a discounted trinomial model. The model considers the probability of three potential occurrences for each auction event through the maturity date of each ARS. The three potential outcomes for each auction are
(i) successful auction/early redemption, (ii) failed auction and (iii) issuer default. Inputs in determining the probabilities of the potential outcomes include but are not limited to, the securities’ collateral, credit rating,
insurance, issuer’s financial standing, contractual restrictions on disposition and the liquidity in the market. The fair value of each ARS is determined by summing the present value of the probability-weighted future principal and interest
payments determined by the model. Since there can be no assurances that auctions for these securities will be successful in the near future, we have classified our ARS as non-current investments.

F-15


The par and carrying values, and related cumulative unrealized loss for our non-current ARS as of
December 31, 2011 are as follows:

Par Value

Temporary

Impairment

Carrying Value

Non-current investments available-for-sale

$

2,500

$


$

1,953

In association with this estimate of fair value, we have recorded an after-tax temporary unrealized loss on our
non-current ARS of $80,000, net of related tax effects of $43,000 in 2011, which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our balance sheet. We consider the impairment in our ARS as temporary because we do not have the intent to sell,
nor is it more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their cost basis. We believe that this temporary decline in fair value is due entirely to liquidity issues, because the underlying assets of these
securities are supported by municipal agencies and do not include mortgage-backed securities, have redemption features which call for redemption at 100% of par value and have a current credit rating of A or AA. The ratings on the ARS take into
account credit support through insurance policies guaranteeing each of the bonds’ payment of principal and accrued interest, if it becomes necessary. In addition, both ARS have had very small partial redemptions at par in the period July 2009
through February 2012. Based on our cash and cash equivalents balance of $1.3 million, expected operating cash flows, and a $150.0 million credit line, we do not believe a lack of liquidity associated with our ARS will adversely affect our ability
to conduct business, and believe we have the ability to hold the securities throughout the currently estimated recovery period. We will continue to evaluate any changes in the fair value of our ARS and in the future, depending upon existing market
conditions, we may be required to record an other-than-temporary decline in market value.

The following table reflects the activity for assets
measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs for the years ended December 31:

(4) PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET

Property and equipment, net consists of the following at December 31:

.

Depreciation
expense was $5.3 million during 2011, $5.1 million during 2010, and $4.4 million during 2009.

We own office buildings in Yarmouth, Maine,
Lubbock, Texas and Dayton, Ohio. We lease a small amount of space in two of these buildings to third-party tenants. These leases expire between 2013 and 2015 and are expected to provide rental income of approximately $640,000 during 2012, $404,000
during 2013, $235,000 during 2014, $78,000 during 2015, and none thereafter. Rental income associated with third party tenants was $1.2 million in 2011, $1.4 million in 2010 and $1.3 million in 2009, respectively and was included as a reduction of
selling, general and administrative expenses.

(5) GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Other intangible assets and related accumulated amortization consists of the following at December 31:

Total amortization expense, for acquisition related intangibles and post acquisition software development costs, was $4.9
million during 2011, $5.5 million during 2010, and $5.1 million during 2009.

The allocation of acquisition intangible assets is summarized in the following table:

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the two years ended December 31, 2011 are as follows:

Estimated annual amortization expense relating to acquisition intangibles, including acquired software for which the
amortization expense is recorded as cost of revenues and acquired leases for which amortization expense is recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses, is as follows:

(6) ACCRUED LIABILITIES

Accrued liabilities consist of the following at December 31:

(7) REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT

On August 11, 2010, we entered into a new $150.0 million Credit Agreement (the “Credit Facility”) and a related pledge
and security agreement with a group of seven financial institutions, with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent. The Credit Facility provides for a revolving credit line of $150.0 million (which may be increased up to $200.0 million subject
to our obtaining commitments for such increase), with a $25.0 million sublimit for letters of credit. The Credit Facility matures on August 11, 2014. Borrowings under the Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including
working capital requirements, acquisitions and share repurchases.

Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate of either
(1) the Bank of America’s prime rate plus a margin of 1.50% to 2.75% or (2) the 30, 60, 90 or 180-day LIBOR rate plus a margin of 2.50% to 3.75%, with the margin determined by our consolidated leverage ratio. In 2011 and 2010, our
effective average interest rate for borrowings was 3.3% and 3.4%, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, our interest rate was 3.4%. The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding real property. The Credit Facility
requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and other financial conditions and prohibits us from making certain investments, advances, cash dividends or loans, and limits incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens. As of December 31,
2011, we were in compliance with those covenants.

As of December 31, 2011, we had $60.7 million in outstanding borrowings and unused
available borrowing capacity of $81.0 million under the Credit Facility. In addition, as of December 31, 2011, our bank had issued outstanding letters of credit totaling $8.3 million to secure surety bonds required by some of our customer
contracts. These letters of credit reduce our available borrowing capacity and expire through mid-2012.

We paid interest of $1.9 million in
2011 and $689,000 in 2010.

(8) INCOME TAX

The income tax provision (benefit) on income from operations consists of the following:

Reconciliation of the U.S. statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax expense rate for operations follows:

Approximately 35% of our stock option expense is derived from incentive stock options (“ISOs”). As such, a tax
benefit is not recorded at the time the compensation cost related to the options is recorded for book purposes due to the fact that an ISO does not ordinarily result in a tax benefit unless there is a disqualifying disposition. Stock option grants
of non-qualified options result in the creation of a deferred tax asset, which is a temporary difference, until the time that the option is exercised. Due to the treatment of ISOs for tax purposes, our effective tax rate from year to year is subject
to variability.

F-19


The tax effects of the major items recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31
are:

Although realization is not assured, we believe it is more likely than not that all the deferred tax assets at
December 31, 2011 and 2010 will be realized. Accordingly, we believe no valuation allowance is required for the deferred tax assets. However, the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted in the future if
estimates of reversing taxable temporary differences are revised.

No reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded pursuant
to ASC 740-10, Income Taxes.

The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) is examining our U.S. income tax return for the year 2010. As of
February 22, 2012, no significant adjustments have been proposed by the IRS. We are unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash settlements, if any, will occur.

We are subject to U.S. federal tax as well as income tax of multiple state and local jurisdictions. We are no longer subject to United States federal income tax examinations for years before 2008. We are
no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years before 2007.

We paid income taxes, net of
refunds received, of $13.4 million in 2011, $15.8 million in 2010, and $18.1 million in 2009.

(9) SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

The following table details activity in our common stock:

As of February 22, 2012 we had authorization from our board of directors to repurchase up to 1.7 million
additional shares of our common stock.

(10) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

Share-Based Compensation Plan

We have a stock option plan that provides for the grant of stock options to key employees, directors and non-employee consultants. Stock options vest after four to six years of continuous service from the
date of grant and have a contractual term of ten years. Once options become exercisable, the employee can purchase shares of our common stock at the market price on the date we granted the option. We account for share-based compensation utilizing
the fair value recognition pursuant to ASC 718, Stock Compensation.

F-20


As of December 31, 2011, there were 3.5 million shares available for future grants under the plan
from the 16.0 million shares previously approved by the stockholders.

Determining Fair Value of Stock Compensation

Valuation and Amortization Method. We estimate the fair value of share-based awards granted using the Black-Scholes option valuation
model. We amortize the fair value of all awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods, which are generally the vesting periods.

Expected Life. The expected life of awards granted represents the period of time that they are expected to be outstanding. As provided by ASC 718-10 we use the “simplified” method which is
allowed for those companies that cannot reasonably estimate expected life of options based on its historical share option exercise experience. We use the “simplified” method to estimate expected life due to insufficient historical exercise
data for the current optionee group. This optionee group has not been in place long enough to generate sufficient historical data to estimate the expected period of time an option award would be expected to be outstanding.

Expected Volatility. Using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the
historical volatility of our common stock.

Risk-Free Interest Rate. We base the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes option
valuation model on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term equal to the expected life of the award.

Expected Dividend Yield. We have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock in the last ten years and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we use an
expected dividend yield of zero in the Black-Scholes option valuation model.

Expected Forfeitures. We use historical data to estimate
pre-vesting option forfeitures. We record share-based compensation only for those awards that are expected to vest.

The following weighted
average assumptions were used for options granted:

The following table summarizes share-based compensation expense related to share-based awards which is recorded in the
statements of income:

Stock Option Activity

Options granted, exercised, forfeited and expired are summarized as follows:

We had unvested options to purchase 2.7 million shares with a weighted average grant date value of $19.35 as of
December 31, 2011 and unvested options to purchase 2.7 million shares with a weighted average grant date value of $16.04 as of December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2011, we had $18.9 million of total unrecognized compensation
cost related to unvested options, net of expected forfeitures, which is expected to be amortized over a weighted average amortization period of four years.

Other information pertaining to option activity was as follows during the twelve months ended December 31:

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) participants may contribute up to 15% of their annual compensation to purchase common shares of Tyler. The purchase price of the shares is equal
to 85% of the closing price of Tyler shares on the last day of each quarterly offering period. As of December 31, 2011, there were 129,000 shares available for future grants under the ESPP from the 1.0 million shares originally reserved
for issuance.

(11) EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic earnings and diluted earnings per share data were computed as follows:

Stock options representing the right to purchase common stock of 714,000 shares in 2011, 1.8 million shares in 2010,
and 2.6 million shares in 2009 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect.

(12) LEASES

We lease office facilities for use in our operations, as well as transportation, computer and other equipment. We also have an office
facility lease agreement with an entity in which an executive’s father and brother have a 100% ownership interest. The executive does not have an interest in the entity that leases the property to us and the lease arrangement existed at the
time we acquired the division that occupies this property. Most of our leases are non-cancelable operating lease agreements and they expire at various dates through 2018. In addition to rent, the leases generally require us to pay taxes,
maintenance, insurance and certain other operating expenses.

Rent expense was approximately $5.9 million in 2011, $5.4 million in 2010, and
$6.3 million in 2009, which included rent expense associated with related party lease agreements of $1.8 million in 2011, $1.9 million in 2010 and $2.0 million in 2009.

Future minimum lease payments under all non-cancelable leases at December 31, 2011 are as follows:

Included in future minimum lease payments are non-cancelable payments due to related parties of $1.7 million in 2012,
$1.7 million in 2013, $1.7 million in 2014, $1.7 million in 2015, $1.7 million in 2016, and $1.7 million thereafter.

(13) EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

We provide a defined contribution plan for the majority of our employees meeting minimum service requirements. The employees can
contribute up to 30% of their current compensation to the plan subject to certain statutory limitations. We contribute up to a maximum of 3% of an employee’s compensation to the plan. We made contributions to the plan and charged operations
$2.9 million during 2011, $2.8 million during 2010, and $2.6 million during 2009.

(14) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Other than ordinary course, routine litigation incidental to our business and except as described in this Annual Report, there are no
material legal proceedings pending to which we are party or to which any of our properties are subject.

(15) SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION

We are a major provider of integrated information management solutions and services for the public sector, with a focus on local and
state governments.

We provide our software systems and services and appraisal services through four business
units which focus on the

following products:

•

financial management and education software solutions;

•

financial management and municipal courts software solutions;

•

courts and justice software solutions; and

•

appraisal and tax software solutions and property appraisal services.

In accordance with ASC 280-10, Segment Reporting, the financial management and education software solutions unit, financial management and municipal courts software solutions unit and the courts and
justice software solutions unit meet the criteria for aggregation and are presented in one reportable segment, Enterprise Software Solutions (“ESS”). The ESS segment provides municipal and county governments and schools with software
systems and services to meet their information technology and automation needs for mission-critical “back-office” functions such as financial management and courts and justice processes. The Appraisal and Tax Software Solutions and
Services (“ATSS”) segment provides systems and software that automate the appraisal and assessment of real and personal property as well as property appraisal outsourcing services for local governments and taxing authorities. Property
appraisal outsourcing services include: the physical inspection of commercial and residential properties; data collection and processing; computer analysis for property valuation; preparation of tax rolls; community education; and arbitration
between taxpayers and the assessing jurisdiction.

We evaluate performance based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is
business segment operating income. We define segment operating income as income before noncash amortization of intangible assets associated with their acquisition, share-based compensation expense, interest expense and income taxes. Segment
operating income includes intercompany transactions. The majority of intercompany transactions relate to contracts involving more than one unit and are valued based on the contractual arrangement. Segment operating income for corporate primarily
consists of compensation costs for the executive management team and certain accounting and administrative staff and share-based compensation expense for the entire company Corporate segment operating income also includes revenues and expenses
related to a company-wide user conference. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”

Segment assets include net accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, net property and equipment and intangibles associated with
their acquisition. Corporate assets consist of cash and investments, prepaid insurance, deferred income taxes and net property and equipment mainly related to unallocated information and technology assets.

ESS segment capital expenditures in 2011 and 2009 included $6.6 million and $11.2 million, respectively for the purchase of buildings and land in
connection with plans to consolidate workforces and support long-term growth.

In 2009 the ATSS segment had one appraisal services customer
which accounted for 10.4% of this segment’s total revenues. The ATSS segment did not have any customers in 2011 and 2010 that accounted for 10% or more of their total revenues.

In January 2012, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Akanda Innovation, Inc., a provider of web-based solutions to the
public sector which are integrated with our property tax software, for a total purchase price of $2.9 million. The purchase price included certain liabilities we assumed of approximately $800,000, resulting in net cash paid to the sellers of $2.1
million, of which $900,000 was paid prior to December 31, 2011 and is included with other current assets.
