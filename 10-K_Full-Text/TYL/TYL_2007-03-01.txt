PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Tyler Technologies, Inc. (“Tyler”) is a major provider of integrated information management
solutions and services for local governments. We partner with clients to make local government
more accessible to the public, more responsive to the needs of citizens and more efficient in its
operations. We have a broad line of software products and services to address the information
technology (“IT”) needs of virtually every major area of operation for cities, counties, schools
and other local government entities. Most of our customers have our software installed in-house.
For customers who prefer not to physically acquire the software and hardware, we provide outsourced
hosting for some of our applications at one of our data centers through an applications service
provider (“ASP”) arrangement. We provide professional IT services to our customers, including
software and hardware installation, data conversion, training and, at times, product modifications.
In addition, we are the nation’s largest provider of outsourced property appraisal services for
taxing jurisdictions. We also provide continuing customer support services to ensure proper
product performance and reliability, which provides us with long-term customer relationships and a
significant base of recurring maintenance revenue.

Tyler was founded in 1966. Prior to 1998, we operated as a diversified industrial conglomerate,
with operations in various industrial, retail and distribution businesses, all of which have been
sold or otherwise disposed. In 1997, we embarked on a multi-phase growth plan focused on serving
the specialized information management needs of local governments nationwide. In 1998 and 1999, we
made a series of strategic acquisitions of companies in the local government IT market.

MARKET OVERVIEW

The state and local government market is one of the largest and most decentralized IT markets in
the country, consisting of all 50 states, approximately 3,100 counties, 36,000 cities and towns and
14,400 school districts. This market is also comprised of approximately 35,000 special districts
and other agencies, each with specialized delegated responsibilities and unique information
management requirements.

Traditionally, local government bodies and agencies performed state-mandated duties, including
property assessment, record keeping, road maintenance, law enforcement, administration of election
and judicial functions, and the provision of welfare assistance. Today, a host of emerging and
urgent issues are confronting local governments, each of which demands a service response. These
areas include criminal justice and corrections, administration and finance, public safety, health
and human services, and public works. Transfers of responsibility from the federal and state
governments to county and municipal governments and agencies in these and other areas also place
additional service and financial requirements on these local government units. In addition,
constituents of local governments are increasingly demanding improved service and better access to
information from public entities. As a result, local governments recognize the increasing value of
information management systems and services to, among other things, improve revenue collection,
provide increased access to information, and streamline delivery of services to their constituents.
Local government bodies are now recognizing that “e-government” is an additional responsibility
for community development. From integrated tax systems to integrated civil and criminal justice
information systems, many counties and cities have benefited significantly from the implementation
of jurisdiction-wide systems that allow different agencies or government offices to share data and
provide a more comprehensive approach to information management. Many city and county governmental
agencies also have unique individual information management requirements, which must be tailored to
the specific functions of each particular office.

Many local governments also have difficulties attracting and retaining the staff necessary to
support their IT functions. As a result, they seek to establish long-term relationships with
reliable providers of high quality IT products and services such as Tyler.

Although local governments generally face budgetary constraints in their operations, their primary
revenue sources are usually property taxes, and to a lesser extent, utility fees, which tend to be
relatively stable. In addition, the acquisition of new technology typically enables local
governments to operate more efficiently, and often provides a measurable return on investment that
justifies the purchase of software and related services.

Gartner estimates that state and local government IT spending will grow from $48.4 billion in 2007
to $55.6 billion in 2010, with local government accounting for $25.1 billion of IT spending in 2007
and $28.9 billion in 2010. The external services and software



segments of the market, where our business is primarily focused, are expected to be the most
rapidly growing areas of the local government IT market, expanding from $13.1 billion in 2007 to
$16.1 billion in 2010.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

We provide a comprehensive and flexible suite of products and services that address the information
technology needs of cities, counties, schools and other local government entities. We derive our
revenues from four primary sources:

•

sales of software licenses;

•

software services;

•

maintenance and support; and

•

appraisal services.

We design, develop and market a broad range of software products to serve mission-critical
“back-office” functions of local governments. Many of our software applications include
Internet-accessible solutions that allow for real-time public access to a variety of information or
that allow the public to transact business with local governments via the Internet. Our software
products and services are generally grouped in four major product areas:

•

Financials;

•

Courts and Justice;

•

Property Appraisal and Tax; and

•

Document Management.

Each of our core software systems consists of several fully integrated application modules. For
customers who acquire the software for use in-house, we generally license our systems under
standard license agreements that provide the customer with a fully paid, nonexclusive,
nontransferable right to use the software. In some of the product areas, such as financials and
property appraisal, we offer multiple solutions designed to meet the needs of different sized
governments.

We also offer certain software products on an outsourced basis for customers who do not wish to
maintain, update and operate these systems or to make large up-front capital expenditures to
implement these advanced technologies. For these customers, we host the applications and data at
one of our data centers. Customers typically pay monthly fees under multi-year contracts for these
services.

Historically, we have had a greater proportion of our annual revenues in the second half of our
fiscal year due to governmental budget and spending cycles and the timing of system implementations
for customers desiring to “go live” at the beginning of the calendar year.

A description of our suite of products and services follows:

Software Licensing

Financials

Our financials products are ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems for local governments, which
integrate information across all facets of a client organization. Our financial products include
modular fund accounting systems that can be tailored to meet the needs of virtually any government
agency or not-for-profit entity. Our financial systems include modules for general ledger, budget
preparation, fixed assets, requisitions, purchase orders, bid management, accounts payable,
contract management, accounts receivable, investment management, inventory control, project and
grant accounting, work orders, job costing, GASB 34 reporting, payroll and human resources. All of
our financial systems are intended to conform to government auditing and financial reporting
requirements and generally accepted accounting principles.

We sell utility billing systems that support the billing and collection of metered and non-metered
services, along with multiple billing cycles. Our Web-enabled utility billing solutions allow
customers to access information online such as average consumption and transaction history. In
addition, our systems can accept secured Internet payments via credit cards and checks.



We also offer specialized products that automate numerous city functions, including municipal
courts, parking tickets, equipment and project costing, animal licenses, business licenses, permits
and inspections, code enforcement, citizen complaint tracking, ambulance billing, fleet
maintenance, and cemetery records management.

In 2006 we began offering a student information system for K-12 schools, which manages such
applications as scheduling, grades and attendance and software products to manage public sector
pension funds.

Tyler’s financial products include Web components that enhance local governments’ service
capabilities by facilitating online access to information for both employees and citizens and
enabling online transactions.

Courts and Justice

We offer a complete, integrated suite of products designed to automate, track and manage the law
enforcement and judicial process, from the initiation of incidents in computer-aided
dispatch/emergency 911 systems through the process of arrest, court appearances and final
disposition to probation. These applications may be installed on a stand-alone basis or integrated
with our other products to eliminate duplicate entries and improve efficiency.

Our Web-enabled court systems are designed to automate the tracking and management of information
involved in criminal and civil court cases, including municipal, family and probate courts. These
applications track the status of criminal and civil cases, process fines and fees and generate the
specialized judgment and sentencing documents, citations, notices and forms required in court
proceedings. Additional judicial applications automate the management of court calendars,
coordinate judge’s schedules, generate court dockets, manage justice of the peace processes and
automate district attorney and prosecutor functions. Related products include jury selection,
“hot” check processing, and adult and juvenile probation management applications. Our courtroom
technologies allow judges to review cases, calendars, and to scan documents and mug shots using a
Web browser. Additionally, document-imaging options include the ability to scan, store, retrieve
and archive a variety of criminal and civil case-related documents.

Our law enforcement systems automate police and sheriff functions from dispatch and records
management through booking and jail management. Searching, reporting and tracking features are
integrated, allowing reliable, up-to-date access to current arrest and incarceration data. The
systems also provide warrant checks for visitors or book-ins, inmate classification and risk
assessment, commissary, property and medical processing, and automation of statistics and state and
federal reporting. Our computer-aided dispatch/emergency 911 system tracks calls and the
availability of emergency response vehicles, interfaces with local and state searches, and
generally assists dispatchers in processing emergency situations. The law enforcement and jail
management systems are fully integrated with the suite of court products that manages the judicial
process.

Our court and law enforcement systems allow the public to access, via the Internet, a variety of
information, including criminal and civil court records, jail booking and release information, bond
and bondsmen information, and court calendars and dockets. In addition, our systems allow cities
and counties to accept payments for traffic and parking tickets over the Internet, with a seamless
and automatic interface to back-office justice and financial systems.

In 2003 we released Odyssey, an all-new unified court case management system. Odyssey uses
enhanced Web-browser concepts to render a unique user interface. It incorporates current
technology – XML, n-tier architecture, component-based design, and an ultra-thin client footprint –
to maximize the value of a court’s investment in new software. We believe that some of Odyssey’s
design concepts, including embedded imaging functionality, COM+ objects to enable local
customization, and an architecture that enables multiple deployment options, are unique in the
court automation marketplace.



Property Appraisal and Tax

We provide systems and software that automate the appraisal and assessment of real and personal
property, including record keeping, mass appraisal, inquiry and protest tracking, appraisal and tax
roll generation, tax statement processing, and electronic state-level reporting. These systems are
image- and video-enabled to facilitate the storage of and access to the many property-related
documents and for the online storage of digital photographs of properties for use in defending
values in protest situations. Other related tax applications are available for agencies that bill
and collect taxes, including cities, counties, school tax offices, and special taxing and
collection agencies. These systems support billing, collections, lock box operations, mortgage
company electronic payments, and various reporting requirements.

Document Management

We offer a number of specialized applications designed to help county governments enhance and
automate courthouse operations. These systems record and index information for the many documents
maintained at the courthouse, such as deeds, mortgages, liens, UCC financing statements and vital
records (birth, death and marriage certificates).

Software Services

We provide a variety of professional IT services to customers who utilize our software products.
Virtually all of our customers contract with us for installation, training, and data conversion
services in connection with their purchase of Tyler’s software products. The complete
implementation process for a typical system includes planning, design, data conversion, set-up and
testing. At the culmination of the implementation process, an installation team travels to the
customer’s facility to ensure the smooth transfer of data to the new system. Installation fees are
charged separately to customers on either a fixed-fee or hourly charge basis, depending on the
contract, with full pass-through to customers of travel and other out-of-pocket expenses.

Both in connection with the installation of new systems and on an ongoing basis, we provide
extensive training services and programs related to our products and services. Training can be
provided in our training centers, onsite at customers’ locations, or at meetings and conferences,
and can be customized to meet customers’ requirements. The vast majority of our customers contract
with us for training services, both to improve their employees’ proficiency and productivity and to
fully utilize the functionality of our systems. Training services are generally billed on an
hourly basis, along with travel and other expenses.

Maintenance and Support

Following the implementation of our software systems, we provide ongoing software support services
to assist our customers in operating the systems and to periodically update the software. Support
is provided over the phone to customers through help desks staffed by our customer support
representatives. For more complicated issues, our staff, with the customers’ permission, can log
on to customers’ systems remotely. We maintain our customers’ software largely through releases
that contain improvements and incremental additions, along with updates necessary because of
legislative or regulatory changes.

Virtually all of our software customers contract with us for maintenance and support, which
provides us with a significant source of recurring revenue. We generally provide maintenance and
support under annual contracts, with a typical fee based on a percentage of the software product’s
license fee. These fees can be increased annually and may also increase as new license fees
increase. Maintenance and support fees are generally paid in advance for the entire maintenance
contract period. Most maintenance contracts automatically renew unless the customer or Tyler gives
notice of termination prior to expiration. Similar support is provided to our ASP customers, and
is included in their overall monthly fees.



Appraisal Services

We are the nation’s largest provider of property appraisal outsourcing services for local
government taxing authorities. These services include:

Local government taxing entities normally reappraise properties from time to time to update values
for tax assessment purposes and to maintain equity in the taxing process. In some jurisdictions,
reassessment cycles are mandated by law; in others, they are discretionary. While some taxing
jurisdictions perform reappraisals in-house, many local governments outsource this function because
of its cyclical nature and because of the specialized knowledge and expertise requirements
associated with it. Our business unit that provides appraisal outsourcing services to local
governments has been in this business since 1938.

In some instances, we also sell property tax and/or appraisal software products in connection with
appraisal outsourcing projects, while other customers may only engage us to provide appraisal
services. Appraisal outsourcing services are somewhat seasonal in nature to the extent that winter
weather conditions reduce the productivity of data collection activities in connection with those
projects.

STRATEGY

Our objective is to grow our revenue and earnings internally, supplemented by focused strategic
acquisitions. The key components of our business strategy are to:

•

Provide high quality, value–added products and services to our clients.

We
compete on the basis of, among other things, delivering to customers our deep domain
expertise in local government operations through the highest value products and services in
the market. We believe we have achieved a reputation as a premium product and service
provider to the local government market.

•

Continue to expand our product and service offerings.

While we already have what
we believe to be the broadest line of software products for local governments, we
continually upgrade our core software applications and expand our complementary product and
service offerings to respond to technological advancements and the changing needs of our
clients. For example, we offer solutions that allow the public to access data and conduct
transactions with local governments, such as paying traffic tickets, property taxes and
utility bills, via the Internet. We believe that the addition of such features enhance the
market appeal of our core products. Since 2001, we have also offered certain of our
software products in an ASP environment, a delivery model that we believe will, over time,
have increasing appeal to local governments and will be expanded to include more
applications. We have also increased our offerings of consulting and business process
reengineering services.

•

Leverage a core technology framework across multiple product development efforts.

We have developed a core technology framework upon which we have developed or are
developing a new generation of a number of products. By leveraging the core framework,
which is based on an n-tier, browser-based architecture, for the development of multiple
products, we believe we can develop new-generation products more efficiently, and at a lower
total cost. In addition, utilizing a core framework is also expected to help us bring new
products to market more rapidly. By having more products built on a common technology
framework, we expect to enhance our cross-selling opportunities and be able to provide
maintenance and other services more efficiently.

•

Expand our customer base.

We seek to establish long-term relationships with new
customers primarily through our sales and marketing efforts. While we currently have
customers in all 50 states, Canada, Puerto Rico, and the United Kingdom, not all of our
product lines have nationwide geographic penetration. We intend to continue to expand into
new geographic markets



q

products and services to complement our existing offerings;

q

entry into new markets related to local governments; and

q

new customers and/or geographic expansion.

•

Establish strategic alliances.

In January 2007 we announced a strategic alliance
with Microsoft Corporation to jointly develop core public sector functionality for Microsoft
Dynamics AX to address the unique accounting needs of public sector organizations worldwide.
As part of this alliance we will enhance Microsoft Dynamics AX with public sector-specific
functionality. The co-development will broaden the functionality of Microsoft Dynamics AX,
providing both Tyler and Microsoft with a public sector accounting platform to support their
existing and prospective clients well into the future. Microsoft Dynamics AX with public
sector functionality will be sold in the United States and internationally through
Microsoft’s distribution channels and is expected to be available for delivery in 2010.
Tyler will also become an authorized Microsoft reseller for the Microsoft Dynamics solutions
developed under this arrangement, and will sell the solutions directly into the government
market. Tyler will receive license and maintenance royalties on direct and indirect sales
of the solutions co-developed under this multi-year term of this relationship.

SALES, MARKETING, AND CUSTOMERS

We market our products and services through direct sales and marketing personnel located throughout
the United States. Other in-house marketing staff focuses on add-on sales, professional services
and support.

Sales of new systems are typically generated from referrals from other government offices or
departments within a county or municipality, referrals from other local governments, relationships
established between sales representatives and county or local officials, contacts at trade shows,
direct mailings, and direct contact from prospects already familiar with us. We are active in
numerous national, state, county, and local government associations, and participate in annual
meetings, trade shows, and educational events.



Customers consist primarily of county and municipal agencies, school districts and other local
government offices. In counties, customers include the auditor, treasurer, tax assessor/collector,
county clerk, district clerk, county and district court judges, probation officers, sheriff, and
county appraiser. At municipal government sites, customers include directors from various
departments, including administration, finance, utilities, public works, code enforcement,
personnel, purchasing, taxation, municipal court, and police. Contracts for software products and
services are generally implemented over periods of three months to one year, with annually renewing
maintenance and support update agreements thereafter. Although either the customer or we can
terminate these agreements, historically almost all support and maintenance agreements are
automatically renewed annually. Contracts for appraisal outsourcing services are generally one to
three years in duration. During 2006, approximately 38% of our revenue was attributable to ongoing
support and maintenance agreements.

COMPETITION

We compete with numerous local, regional, and national firms that provide or offer some or many of
the same products and services that we provide. Most of these competitors are smaller companies
that may be able to offer less expensive solutions than ours. Many of these firms operate within a
specific geographic area and/or in a narrow product or service niche. We also compete with
national firms, some of which have greater financial and technical resources than we do, including
Oracle Corporation, Lawson Software, Inc., SAP AG, MAXIMUS, Inc., Affiliated Computer Services,
Inc., SunGard Data Systems, Inc., New World Systems and Manatron, Inc. In addition, we sometimes
compete with consulting and systems integration firms, such as BearingPoint, Inc., which develop
custom systems, primarily for larger governments. We also occasionally compete with central
internal information service departments of local governments, which require us to persuade the
end-user department to discontinue service by its own personnel and outsource the service to us. We
compete on a variety of factors, including price, service, name recognition, reputation,
technological capabilities, and the ability to modify existing products and services to accommodate
the individual requirements of the customer. Our ability to offer an integrated system of
applications for several offices or departments is often a competitive strength. Local
governmental units often are required to seek competitive proposals through a request for proposal
process.

SUPPLIERS

All computers, peripherals, printers, scanners, operating system software, office automation
software, and other equipment necessary for the implementation and provision of our software
systems and services are presently available from several third-party sources. Hardware is
purchased on original equipment manufacturer or distributor terms at discounts from retail. We have
not experienced any significant supply problems.

BACKLOG

At December 31, 2006, our estimated revenue backlog was approximately $205.9 million, compared to
$165.4 million at December 31, 2005. The backlog represents signed contracts under which the
products have not been delivered or the services have not been performed as of year-end.
Approximately $150.3 million of the backlog is expected to be recognized during 2007.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, AND LICENSES

We regard certain features of our internal operations, software, and documentation as confidential
and proprietary and rely on a combination of contractual restrictions, trade secret laws and other
measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property. We generally do not rely on patents. We
believe that, due to the rapid rate of technological change in the computer software industry,
trade secrets and copyright protection are less significant than factors such as knowledge, ability
and experience of our employees, frequent product enhancements, and timeliness and quality of
support services. We typically license our software products under non-exclusive license agreements
which are generally non-transferable and have a perpetual term.

EMPLOYEES

At December 31, 2006, we had approximately 1,530 employees. Appraisal outsourcing projects are
cyclical in nature and can be widely dispersed geographically. We often hire temporary employees
to assist in these projects whose term of employment generally ends with the project’s completion.
None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to collective bargaining
agreements. We consider our relations with our employees to be positive.



INTERNET WEBSITE AND AVAILABILITY OF PUBLIC FILINGS

We file annual, quarterly, current and other reports, proxy statements and other information with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act. You may
read and copy any materials we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room by calling the
SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and other
information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including us, that file
electronically with the SEC. The address of this site is

http://www.sec.gov.

We also maintain an Internet site at

www.tylertech.com.

We make available free of charge
through this site our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Forms 4 and 5,
Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section
13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file
such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. Our “Code of Business Conduct and Ethics” is also
available on our Web site. We intend to satisfy the disclosure requirements regarding amendments
to, or waivers from, a provision of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics by posting such
information on our Web site.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Investors evaluating our company
should carefully consider the factors described below and all other information contained in this
Annual Report. Any of the following factors could materially harm our business, operating results,
and financial condition. Additional factors and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we
currently consider immaterial could also harm our business, operating results, and financial
condition. This section should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements
and related Notes and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations included in this Annual Report. We may make forward-looking statements from time to
time, both written and oral. We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results
of any revisions to these forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially
from those projected in any such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including
those set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report.

A decline in information technology spending may result in a decrease in our revenues or lower our
growth rate.

A decline in the demand for information technology among our current and prospective customers may
result in decreased revenues or a lower growth rate for us because our sales depend, in part, on
our customers’ level of funding for new or additional information technology systems and services.
Moreover, demand for our solutions may be reduced by a decline in overall demand for computer
software and services. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase or
maintain our revenues.

Our products are complex and we run the risk of errors or defects with new product introductions or
enhancements.

Software products as complex as those developed by us may contain errors or defects, especially
when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. Although we have not
experienced material adverse effects resulting from any such defects or errors to date, we cannot
assure you that material defects and errors will not be found after commencement of product
shipments. Any such defects could result in loss of revenues or delay market acceptance.

Our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our
exposure to potential liability claims. It is possible, however, that we may not always be able to
negotiate such provisions in our contracts with customers or that the limitation of liability
provisions contained in our license agreements may not be effective as a result of existing or
future federal, state or local laws, ordinances, or judicial decisions. Although we maintain
errors and omissions and general liability insurance, and we try to structure our contracts to
include limitations on liability, we cannot assure you that a successful claim could not be made or
would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.



We may experience fluctuations in quarterly revenue that could adversely impact our stock price and
our operating results.

Our actual revenues in a quarter could fall below expectations, which could lead to a decline in
our stock price. Our revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate
substantially from quarter to quarter. Revenues from license fees in any quarter depend
substantially upon our contracting activity and our ability to recognize revenues in that quarter
in accordance with our revenue recognition policies. Our quarterly revenue may fluctuate and may
be difficult to forecast for a variety of reasons, including the following:

Fluctuation in our quarterly revenues may adversely affect our operating results. In each fiscal
quarter our expense levels, operating costs, and hiring plans are based on projections of future
revenues and are relatively fixed. If our actual revenues fall below expectations, we could
experience a reduction in operating results.

As with other software vendors, we may be required to delay revenue recognition into future
periods, which could adversely impact our operating results.

We have in the past had to, and in the future may have to, defer revenue recognition for license
fees due to several factors, including whether:

Because of the factors listed above and other specific requirements under generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States for software revenue recognition, we must have very
precise terms in our license agreements in order to recognize revenue when we initially deliver and
install software or perform services. Negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions can
extend the sales cycle, and sometimes we do not obtain terms and conditions that permit revenue
recognition at the time of delivery or even as work on the project is completed.

Compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in
additional expenses.

Changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure,
including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, new Securities and Exchange Commission regulations and
New York Stock Exchange rules, are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours. The costs
required to comply with such evolving laws are difficult to predict. To maintain high standards of
corporate governance and public disclosure, we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources
to comply with evolving standards. This investment may result in an unforeseen increase in general
and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from
revenue-generating activities, which may harm our business, financial condition, or results of
operations.



Increases in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues could decrease overall margins and
adversely affect our operating results.

We realize lower margins on software and appraisal service revenues than on license revenue. The
majority of our contracts include both software licenses and professional services. Therefore, an
increase in the percentage of software service and appraisal service revenue compared to license
revenue could have a detrimental impact on our overall gross margins and could adversely affect
operating results.

Selling products and services into the public sector poses unique challenges.

We derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of software and services to state, county
and city governments, other municipal agencies, and other public entities. We expect that sales to
public sector customers will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues in the
future. We face many risks and challenges associated with contracting with governmental entities,
including:

Each of these risks is outside our control. If we fail to adequately adapt to these risks and
uncertainties, our financial performance could be adversely affected.

The open bidding process for governmental contracts creates uncertainty in predicting future
contract awards.

Many governmental agencies purchase products and services through an open bidding process.
Generally, a governmental entity will publish an established list of requirements requesting
potential vendors to propose solutions for the established requirements. To respond successfully to
these requests for proposals, we must accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a
proposed contract, the time required to establish operations for the proposed client, and the
likely terms of any other third party proposals submitted. We cannot guarantee that we will win
any bids in the future through the request for proposal process, or that any winning bids will
ultimately result in contracts on favorable terms. Our failure to secure contracts through the
open bidding process, or to secure such contracts on favorable terms, may adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Fixed- price contracts may affect our profits.

Some of our present contracts are on a fixed-priced basis, which can lead to various risks,
including:

•

the failure to accurately estimate the resources and time required for an engagement;

•

the failure to effectively manage governmental agencies’ and other customers’
expectations regarding the scope of services to be delivered for an estimated price; and

•

the failure to timely complete fixed-price engagements within budget to the customers’
satisfaction.

If we do not adequately assess these and other risks, we may be subject to cost overruns and
penalties, which may harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.



We face significant competition from other vendors and potential new entrants into our markets.

We believe we are a leading provider of integrated solutions for the public sector. However, we
face competition from a variety of software vendors that offer products and services similar to
those offered by us, as well as from companies offering to develop custom software. We compete on
the basis of a number of factors, including:

We believe the market is highly fragmented with a large number of competitors that vary in size,
primary computer platforms, and overall product scope. Our competitors include the consulting
divisions of national and regional accounting firms, publicly held companies that focus on selected
segments of the public sector market, and a significant number of smaller, privately held
companies. Certain competitors have greater technical, marketing, and financial resources than we
do. We cannot assure you that such competitors will not develop products or offer services that
are superior to our products or services or that achieve greater market acceptance.

We also compete with internal, centralized information service departments of governmental
entities, which require us to persuade the end-user to stop the internal service and outsource to
us. In addition, our customers may elect in the future to provide information management services
internally through new or existing departments, which could reduce the market for our services.

We could face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the public
sector software application market and new products and technologies are introduced. Increased
competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced gross margins, and
loss of market share. In addition, current and potential competitors may make strategic
acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third-parties, thereby
increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers. It is
possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly
gain significant market share. Further, competitive pressures could require us to reduce the price
of our software licenses and related services. We cannot assure you that we will be able to
compete successfully against current and future competitors, and the failure to do so would have
material adverse effect upon our business, operating results, and financial condition.

We must respond to rapid technological changes to be competitive.

The market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry
standards in computer hardware and software technology, changes in customer requirements, and
frequent new product introductions and enhancements. The introduction of products embodying new
technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and
unmarketable. As a result, our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to continue
to enhance existing products and develop and introduce in a timely manner or acquire new products
that keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer
requirements, and achieve market acceptance. We cannot assure you that we will successfully
identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and
cost-effective manner. Further, we cannot assure you that the products, capabilities, or
technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or
noncompetitive. If we are unable to develop or acquire on a timely and cost-effective basis new
software products or enhancements to existing products, or if such new products or enhancements do
not achieve market acceptance, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be
materially adversely affected.

Our failure to properly manage growth could adversely affect our business.

We have expanded our operations since February 1998, when we entered the business of providing
software solutions and services to the public sector. We intend to continue expansion in the
foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities. This growth places a
significant demand on management and operational resources. In order to manage growth effectively,
we must implement and improve our operational systems, procedures, and controls on a timely basis.
We must also identify, hire, train, and manage key managerial and technical personnel. If we fail
to implement these systems or employ and retain such qualified personnel, our business, financial
condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.



We may be unable to hire, integrate, and retain qualified personnel.

Our continued success will depend upon the availability and performance of our key management,
sales, marketing, customer support, and product development personnel. The loss of key management
or technical personnel could adversely affect us. We believe that our continued success will
depend in large part upon our ability to attract, integrate, and retain such personnel. We have at
times experienced and continue to experience difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel.
Competition for qualified software development, sales, and other personnel is intense, and we
cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel.

We may experience difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy.

In addition, a significant portion of our growth has resulted from strategic acquisitions in new
product and geographic markets. Although our future focus will be on internal growth, we will
continue to identify and pursue strategic acquisitions and alliances with suitable candidates. Our
future success will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully integrate future acquisitions
and other strategic alliances into our operations. Acquisitions may involve a number of special
risks, including diversion of management’s attention, failure to retain key acquired personnel,
unanticipated events or circumstances, legal liabilities, and amortization of certain acquired
intangible assets. Some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, and results of operations. Although we conduct due diligence
reviews of potential acquisition candidates, we may not identify all material liabilities or risks
related to acquisition candidates. There can be no assurance that any such strategic acquisitions
or alliances will be accomplished on favorable terms or will result in profitable operations.

We may be unable to protect our proprietary rights.

Many of our product and service offerings incorporate proprietary information, trade secrets,
know-how, and other intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of contracts,
copyrights, and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our
technology. We cannot be certain that we have taken all appropriate steps to deter
misappropriation of our intellectual property. In addition, there has been significant litigation
in the United States in recent years involving intellectual property rights. We are not currently
involved in any material intellectual property litigation. We may, however, be a party to
intellectual property litigation in the future to protect our proprietary information, trade
secrets, know-how, and other intellectual property rights. Further, we cannot assure you that
third parties will not assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us in the future with
respect to current or future products. Any claims or litigation, with or without merit, could be
time-consuming and result in costly litigation and diversion of management’s attention. Further,
any claims and litigation could cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty
or licensing arrangements. Such royalty or licensing arrangements, if required, may not be
available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Thus, litigation to defend and enforce our
intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, and results of operations, regardless of the final outcome of such litigation.

Our Application Service Provider strategy has yet to gain widespread acceptance.

Some businesses choose to access enterprise software applications through application service
providers, or ASPs, which are businesses that host applications and provide access to software on a
subscription basis. The public sector market for ASP solutions is new and unproven. Acceptance of
our ASP model depends upon the ability and willingness of different governmental entities to accept
and implement ASP solutions. Some prospective clients have expressed security and privacy concerns
with the ASP model, including a concern regarding the confidential nature of the information and
transactions available from and conducted with governments and concerns regarding off-site storage
of such information. We have limited experience selling our solutions through ASPs and may not be
successful in generating revenue from this distribution channel.



Changes in the insurance markets may affect our ability to win some contract awards and may
lead to increased expenses.

Some of our customers, primarily those for our property appraisal services, require that we secure
performance bonds before they will select us as their vendor. The number of qualified, high-rated
insurance companies that offer performance bonds has decreased in recent years, while the costs
associated with securing these bonds has increased dramatically. In addition, we are generally
required to issue a letter of credit as security for the issuance of a performance bond. We
periodically enter into long-term borrowing agreements and each letter of credit we issue without
corresponding cash collateral may reduce our borrowing capacity under the borrowing agreement. We
cannot guarantee that we will be able to secure such performance bonds in the future on terms that
are favorable to us, if at all. Our inability to obtain performance bonds on favorable terms or at
all could impact our future ability to win some contract awards, particularly large property
appraisal services contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

Recent volatility in the stock markets, increasing shareholder litigation, the adoption of
expansive legislation that redefines corporate controls (in particular, legislation adopted to
prevent future corporate and accounting scandals), as well as other factors have recently led to
significant increases in premiums for directors’ and officers’ liability insurance. The number of
insurers offering directors and officers insurance at competitive rates has also decreased in
recent years. Volatility of the insurance market may result in future increases in our general and
administrative expenses, which may adversely affect future operating results.

Our stock price may be volatile.

The market price of our common stock may be volatile and may be significantly affected by many
different factors. Some examples of factors that can have a significant impact on our stock price
include:

In addition, the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume
fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for the common stock of technology
companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common
stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company’s
securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. We
cannot assure you that similar litigation will not occur in the future with respect to us. Such
litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and
resources, which could have a material adverse effect upon our business, operating results, and
financial condition.

Historically, we have not paid dividends on our common stock.

We have not declared or paid a cash dividend since we entered the business of providing software
solutions and services to the public sector in February 1998. Additionally, we may enter into
credit agreements that could restrict our ability to pay cash dividends. We intend to retain
earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any
cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.

Provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, and Delaware law could deter takeover
attempts.

Our board of directors may issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock and may determine the
price, rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions, including voting and conversion rights,
of these shares of preferred stock. These determinations may be made without any further vote or
action by our stockholders. The rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to, and
may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued
in the future. The issuance of preferred stock may make it more difficult for a third party to
acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. In addition, some provisions of our
Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, and of the Delaware General Corporation Law could also delay,
prevent, or make more difficult a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest involving us.



Financial Outlook.

From time to time in press releases and otherwise, we may publish forecasts or other
forward-looking statements regarding our results, including estimated revenues or net earnings.
Any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions. These assumptions are subject
to significant uncertainties, and as a matter of course, any number of them may prove to be
incorrect. Further, the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors
(including those described in this discussion), many of which are beyond our control. As a result,
we cannot be certain that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that
the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse. Current and potential
stockholders are cautioned not to base their entire analysis of our business and prospects upon
isolated predictions, but instead are encouraged to utilize our entire publicly available mix of
historical and forward-looking information, as well as other available information regarding us,
our products and services, and the software industry when evaluating our prospective results of
operations.

We did not pay any cash dividends in 2006 or 2005. During 2006 our bank credit agreement
contained restrictions on the payment of cash dividends. We terminated this credit agreement in
January 2007. We intend to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business,
and, therefore, we do not anticipate declaring a cash dividend in the foreseeable future.

OPERATIONS.

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS

In addition to historical information, this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking
statements. The forward-looking statements are made in reliance upon safe harbor provisions of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The forward-looking statements are subject to
certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those

OVERVIEW

We provide integrated information management solutions and services for local governments. We
develop and market a broad line of software products and services to address the information
technology (“IT”) needs of cities, counties, schools and other local government entities. In
addition, we provide professional IT services to our customers, including software and hardware
installation, data conversion, training and for certain customers, product modifications, along
with continuing maintenance and support for customers using our systems. We also provide property
appraisal outsourcing services for taxing jurisdictions.

Our products are generally grouped into four major areas:

•

Financials;

•

Courts and Justice;

•

Property Appraisal and Tax; and

•

Document Management.

We monitor and analyze several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and
evaluate our financial and operating performance. These indicators include the following:

•

Revenues — We derive our revenues from four primary sources: sale of software licenses;
software services; appraisal services; and maintenance and support. Because the majority
of the software we sell is “off-the-shelf”, increased sales of software products generally
result in incrementally higher gross margins. Thus, the most significant driver to our
business is the number and size of software license sales. In addition, new software
license sales generally generate implementation services revenues as well as future
maintenance and support revenues, which we view as a recurring revenue source. We also
monitor our customer base and churn since our maintenance and support revenue should
increase due to our historically low customer turnover.

•

Cost of Revenues and Gross Margins — Our primary cost component is personnel expenses in
connection with providing software implementation and appraisal services to our customers.
We can improve gross margins by controlling headcount and related costs and by expanding
our revenue base, especially from those products and services that produce incremental
revenue with minimal incremental cost, such as software licenses and maintenance and
support. Our appraisal projects are seasonal in nature, and we often employ appraisal
personnel on a short-term basis to coincide with the life of a project.

•

Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Expenses – The primary components of SG&A
expense are administrative and sales personnel salaries and commissions, marketing expense,
research and development costs, rent and professional fees. Sales commissions generally
fluctuate with revenues but other administrative expenses tend to grow at a slower rate
than revenues; however, these costs have recently grown disproportionately because of the
requirements of corporate governance legislation. Research and development costs fluctuate
from year-to-year depending on product development activity.



•

Liquidity and Cash Flows — The primary driver of our cash flows is net income. Uses of
cash include acquisitions, capital investments in software development and property and
equipment and the discretionary purchases of treasury stock. During 2006 we used cash of
$12.2 million to acquire two small companies and certain maintenance and support
agreements. In 2006, we also purchased 1.0 million shares of our common stock at an
aggregate cash purchase price of $10.5 million. Our working capital needs are fairly
stable throughout the year with the significant components of cash outflows being payment
of personnel expenses offset by cash inflows representing collection of accounts receivable
and cash receipts from customers in advance of revenue being earned.

•

Balance Sheet — Cash, accounts receivable and days sales outstanding and deferred
revenue balances are important indicators of our business.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our
consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues, cost of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period, and related disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities. The Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included as part of this Annual
Report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated
financial statements. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including, but not limited
to, those related to intangible assets, bad debts and our service contracts. We base our estimates
on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under
the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect significant judgments and estimates
used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition

. We recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of Statement of
Position (“SOP”) 97-2, “Software Revenue Recognition,” as amended by SOP 98-4 and SOP 98-9, as well
as Technical Practice Aids issued from time to time by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, and in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 104 “Revenue Recognition.” We recognize revenue on our appraisal services contracts
using the proportionate performance method of accounting, with considerations for the provisions of
Emerging Issue Task Force No. 00-21, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.” Our
revenues are derived from sale of software licenses, appraisal services, maintenance and support,
and services that typically range from installation, training and basic consulting to software
modification and customization to meet specific customer needs. For multiple element software
arrangements, which do not entail the performance of services that are considered essential to the
functionality of the software, we generally record revenue when the delivered products or performed
services result in a legally enforceable and non-refundable claim. We maintain allowances for
doubtful accounts and sales adjustments, which are provided at the time the revenue is recognized.
Because most of our customers are governmental entities, we rarely incur a loss resulting from the
inability of a customer to make required payments. In a limited number of cases, we encounter a
customer who is dissatisfied with some aspect of the software product or our service, and we may
offer a “concession” to such customer. In those limited situations where we grant a concession, we
rarely reduce the contract arrangement fee, but alternatively may perform additional services, such
as additional training or programming a minor feature the customer had in their prior software
solution. These amounts have historically been considered nominal. In connection with our
customer contracts and the adequacy of related allowances and measures of progress towards contract
completion, our project managers are charged with the responsibility to continually review the
status of each customer on a specific contract basis. Also, we review, on at least a quarterly
basis, significant past due accounts receivable and the adequacy of related reserves. Events or
changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount for the allowances for doubtful
accounts and sales adjustments may require revision, include, but are not limited to, deterioration
of a customer’s financial condition, failure to manage our customer’s expectations regarding the
scope of the services to be delivered, and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our
software products.

For those software arrangements that involve significant production, modification or customization
of the software, which is considered essential to its functionality, and for substantially all real
estate appraisal outsourcing projects, we recognize revenue and profit as the work progresses using
the percentage-of-completion method and the proportionate performance method of revenue
recognition. These methods rely on estimates of total expected contract revenue, billings and
collections and expected contract costs, as well as measures of progress toward completion. We
believe reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and costs and progress applicable to various
stages of a contract can be made. At times, we perform additional and/or non-contractual services
for little to no incremental fee to satisfy customer expectations. If changes occur in delivery,
productivity or other factors used in developing our



estimates of expected costs or revenues, we revise our cost and revenue estimates, and any
revisions are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision
first become known.

We use contract accounting, primarily the percentage-of-completion method, and apply the provisions
of SOP No. 81-1 “Accounting for Performance of Construction — Type and Certain Production — Type
Contracts” for those software arrangements that involve significant production, modification or
customization of the software, or where our software services are otherwise considered essential to
the functionality of the software. In addition, we recognize revenue using the proportionate
performance method of revenue recognition for our property appraisal projects, some of which can
range up to three years. In connection with these and certain other contracts, we may perform the
work prior to when the services are billable and/or payable pursuant to the contract. The
termination clauses in most of our contracts provide for the payment for the fair value of products
delivered and services performed in the event of an early termination.

In connection with certain of our contracts, we have recorded retentions receivable or unbilled
receivables consisting of costs and estimated profit in excess of billings as of the balance sheet
date. Many of the contracts which give rise to unbilled receivables at a given balance sheet date
are subject to billings in the subsequent accounting period. Management reviews unbilled
receivables and related contract provisions to ensure we are justified in recognizing revenue prior
to billing the customer and that we have objective evidence which allows us to recognize such
revenue. In addition, we have a sizable amount of deferred revenue which represents billings in
excess of revenue earned. The majority of this liability consists of maintenance billings in which
payments are made in advance and the revenue is ratably earned over the maintenance period,
generally one year. We also have deferred revenue for those contracts in which we receive a
deposit and the conditions in which to record revenue for the service or product has not been met.
On a periodic basis, we review by customer the detail components of our deferred revenue to ensure
our accounting remains appropriate.

Intangible Assets and Goodwill

. Our business acquisitions typically result in the creation of
goodwill and other intangible asset balances, and these balances affect the amount and timing of
future period amortization expense, as well as expense we could possibly incur as a result of an
impairment charge. The cost of acquired companies is allocated to identifiable tangible and
intangible assets based on estimated fair value, with the excess allocated to goodwill.
Accordingly, we have a significant balance of acquisition date intangible assets, including
software, customer related intangibles, trade name and goodwill. In addition, we capitalize
software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility.
These intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. All intangible assets
with definite and indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Recoverability of goodwill is generally measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset
to its fair value, generally determined by estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated
by the asset. Recoverability of other intangible assets is generally measured by comparison of the
carrying amount to estimated undiscounted future cash flows. The assessment of recoverability or of
the estimated useful life for amortization purposes will be affected if the timing or the amount of
estimated future operating cash flows is not achieved. Events or changes in circumstances that
indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable include, but are not limited to, a significant
decrease in the market value of the business or asset acquired, a significant adverse change in the
extent or manner in which the business or asset acquired is used, or a significant adverse change
in the business climate. In addition, products, capabilities, or technologies developed by others
may render our software products obsolete or non-competitive.

Share-based Compensation.

We have a stock option plan that provides for the grant of stock options
to key employees, directors and non-employee consultants. Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted
for share-based compensation utilizing the intrinsic value method in accordance with the
provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion (“APB”) No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,” and related Interpretations. Accordingly no compensation expense was recorded because
the exercise prices of the stock options equaled the market prices of the underlying stock on the
dates of grants. However, prior to adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”) No. 123R, share-based compensation had been included in pro forma disclosures in the
financial statement footnotes for periods prior to 2006.

Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment,” which
establishes accounting for share-based awards exchanged for employee services, using the modified
prospective application transition method. Subsequently, we recorded compensation expense in our
statement of operations over the service period that the awards are expected to vest. Compensation
cost recognized in 2006, includes the applicable amounts of: (a) compensation cost of all
share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of, January 1, 2006 (based on the
grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” and previously presented in the pro forma footnote
disclosures), and (b) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted subsequent to January
1, 2006 (based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the new provisions of SFAS
No. 123R).



We estimate the fair value of share-based awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option valuation model. Share-based compensation expense includes the estimated effects of
forfeitures, which will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual
forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ from such estimates. Changes in estimated
forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be
recognized in future periods. Forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data. We
estimate stock price volatility at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our
common stock. Estimated option life is determined using the “simplified method” in accordance with
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107. Determining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating
the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment, including
estimating stock price volatility, expected option life and forfeiture rates.

Software licenses

. Changes in software license revenues consist of the following components:

§

Software license revenue related to financial products, which comprise over 70% of our
software license revenues in the years presented, increased significantly compared to the
prior year primarily due to growth from geographic expansion and increased success in
winning larger contracts. Third party software revenue also increased over the comparable
prior year because we sold more financial software modules that utilize third party
software. Also, in late 2005 we simplified the implementation process for one of our
financial products, which has enabled us to deliver the product more rapidly. Our financial
software products automate accounting systems for cities, counties, school districts, public
utilities and not-for-profit organizations.

§

In 2006 software license revenue related to our products other than financial systems
experienced strong increases in the aggregate compared to 2005. Software license revenues
from our Odyssey courts and justice products experienced a substantial increase over the
prior year as a result of the product maturing following successful early implementations
and leveraging our existing customer base. In addition, licenses of
our tax and appraisal products and a document management product were much higher than the prior year due to several new Java based
product releases and increased appraisal revaluation activity. Our appraisal software
license volume varies from period to period dependent upon the special needs and timing of
our customers. Local government taxing entities normally reappraise properties from time
to time to update values for tax assessment purposes and to maintain equity in the taxing
process. While certain of these taxing jurisdictions contract with our appraisal services
division to perform the reappraisals, it is not always necessary for the customer to
purchase new software in order to process the appraisals. In some cases, a customer may
simply add additional appraisal software modules to enhance the functionality of its
existing software.

Software services

. Changes in software services revenues consist of the following components:

§

Software services revenue related to financial products, which comprise more than half of
our software service revenue in the years presented, increased significantly in 2006
compared to the prior year reflecting increased contract volume and additions



to training
staff which enabled us to deliver our backlog at a faster rate. Typically, software
contracts include services such as installing the software, converting the customers’ data
to be compatible with the software and training customer personnel to use the software. Our
application service provider (“ASP”) hosting and disaster recovery services also contributed
to the increase as a result of geographic expansion, primarily in the South in the aftermath
of hurricane Katrina.

•

Software services revenue related to Odyssey courts and justice products was up
moderately in 2006 compared to 2005 reflecting increased contract volume. Since March 31,
2005, we have increased our presence with Odyssey in Texas, Florida and Michigan and added
one contract in Nevada. Odyssey software services revenue did not increase as strongly as
Odyssey software license revenue because the prior year included a $1.4 million contract for
follow-on services to an existing customer that had previously implemented and accepted the
software.

•

Software services revenue related to our document management products experienced strong increases in
2006 due to several new Java based product releases and other related products.

Maintenance

. We provide maintenance and support services for our software products and third party
software. Maintenance revenues increased due to growth in our installed customer base as evidenced
by our software license revenue and slightly higher maintenance rates on most of our product lines.

Appraisal services.

The appraisal services business is driven in part by revaluation cycles in
various states. Appraisal services revenue increased over the prior year mainly due to activity
related to Ohio’s revaluation cycle, which occurs every six years as well as the addition of new
customers. The Ohio revaluation cycle was nearly complete by the end of 2006. The level of
appraisal services revenues in 2007 will depend on our ability to replace appraisal services
revenues associated with the Ohio revaluation.

Cost of software license revenues.

Our software license gross margin percentage in 2006
increased due to substantially higher software license revenues and slightly lower
amortization expense of software development costs as some products became fully amortized
during the first quarter of 2006. Approximately half of our cost of software license revenues
is amortization expense for capitalized development costs on certain software products with
the remainder consisting of costs related to third-party software.



Amortization costs are
fixed in nature and do not change with revenue changes. Once a product is released, we begin
to amortize over the estimated useful life of the product the costs associated with its
development. Amortization expense is determined on a product-by-product basis at an annual
rate not less than straight-line basis over the product’s estimated life, which is generally
five years. Development costs consist mainly of personnel costs, such as salary and benefits
paid to our developers and rent for related office space.

Cost of software services and maintenance revenues.

The software services and maintenance gross
margin percentage in 2006 was comparable to the 2005. The cost of software services and maintenance
increased because we added to our implementation and support staff to increase our capacity to
support new sales growth and deliver sales backlog. Cost of software services and maintenance
primarily consists of expenses, such as personnel costs related to installation of our software
licenses, conversion of customer data, training customer personnel and support activities and
various other services such as ASP and disaster recovery.

Cost of appraisal services revenues.

The appraisal services gross margin percentage increased in
2006 compared to 2005 mainly due to significant organizational changes and headcount
reductions we made in the second quarter of 2005 to our appraisal services business to bring
costs in line with expected levels of revenue. In addition, margins in 2005 were negatively
affected by cost inefficiencies associated with one large contract.

The overall gross margin percentage rose mainly due to a revenue mix that included more software
license revenues, as well as lower costs as a result of the restructuring of our appraisal services
business in the second quarter of 2005. Software license revenue inherently has higher gross
margins than other revenues such as software services and hardware.

In 2006 SG&A includes a non-cash purchased in-process research and development charge of
$140,000 relating to one of our acquisitions in January 2006 and $2.0 million of non-cash
share-based compensation expense as a result of implementing SFAS No. 123R in January 2006.
Partially offsetting these charges were lower SG&A expenses relating to our appraisal services
and appraisal and tax software businesses due to the restructuring of those businesses in the
second quarter of 2005.

Restructuring Charge

Because of unsatisfactory financial performance early in 2005, we made significant organizational
changes in the second quarter of 2005 to those areas of our business that were not performing to
our expectations. Our goal was to bring costs in line with expected levels of revenue while
improving the efficiency of our organizational structure to ensure that clients continue to receive
superior service.

We reorganized the appraisal services business to eliminate levels of management and reduce
overhead expense. We also took actions to reduce headcount and costs in our appraisal and tax
software division, and we consolidated certain senior management positions at the corporate office.
These cost reductions were made in the second quarter of 2005. As a result, we eliminated
approximately 120 positions, including management, staff and project-related personnel.

In connection with the reorganization, we incurred certain charges which were primarily comprised
of employee severance costs and related fringe benefits, and totaled approximately $1.3 million
before income taxes. The related payments were paid in 2005.



Amortization of Customer and Trade Name Intangibles

Acquisition intangibles are composed of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net
tangible assets acquired that is allocated to acquired and amortizable software, customer and trade
name intangibles with the remainder allocated to goodwill that is not subject to amortization.
However, amortization expense related to acquired software is included with cost of revenues while
amortization expense of customer and trade name intangibles is recorded as other expense. The
estimated useful lives of both
customer and trade name intangibles are 5 to 25 years. The following table sets forth a comparison
of amortization of customer and trade name intangibles for the following years ended December 31:

%

The effective income tax rates were different from the statutory United States federal income tax
rate of 35% primarily due to state income taxes, the qualified manufacturing activities deduction
and non-deductible meals and entertainment costs. In 2006 the rate is also impacted by
non-deductible share-based compensation expense.

The effective rate for 2006 was lower than the prior year mainly due to changes in the Texas
franchise tax law and rates enacted in the second quarter of 2006, favorable state income tax
audit results and lower state income taxes as a result of a change in our corporate structure
implemented in early 2005.

Slightly more than half of our stock option awards granted qualify as incentive stock options
(“ISO”) for income tax purposes. As such, a tax benefit is not recorded at the time the
compensation cost related to the options is recorded for book purposes due to the fact that an ISO
does not ordinarily result in a tax benefit unless there is a disqualifying disposition. Stock
option grants of non-qualified options result in the creation of a deferred tax asset, which is a
temporary difference, until the time that the option is exercised. Due to the treatment of
incentive stock options for tax purposes, our effective tax rate from year to year is subject to
variability.

Software licenses

. Changes in software license revenues consist of the following components:

§

Software license revenue related to financial products, which comprise approximately 80%
of our software license revenues in the years presented, increased slightly compared to the
prior year primarily due to third party software products which enhance the functionality of
our proprietary software.

§

Software license revenue related to our Odyssey courts and justice products declined in
2005 compared to 2004. The prior year was unusually high because it included approximately
$900,000 of license fees earned upon final acceptance for two original Odyssey installation
sites. In 2005 we had fifteen Odyssey contracts in process compared to seven Odyssey
contracts in 2004. The implementation cycle for Odyssey products ranges from nine to
thirty-six months depending on the scope of the contract and modification complexity. We
have recognized revenue on these contracts using contract accounting.

Software services

. Changes in software services revenues consist of the following components:

§

Software services revenue related to financial products, which comprise more than half of
our software service revenue in the years presented, increased moderately in 2005 compared
to the prior year. Approximately one-half of our financial software services revenue
increase related to training and the remaining increases were due to new customers for our
application service provider hosting and disaster recovery services and other miscellaneous
services. We increased our training staff in 2005 which enabled us to deliver our backlog
at a faster rate.

§

Software services revenue related to our Odyssey courts and justice products increased
significantly in 2005 compared to the prior year mainly due to a new $1.4 million contract
for follow-on services to an existing customer that had previously implemented and accepted
the software.

§

Software services revenue related to appraisal and tax products declined substantially in
2005. This decline was mainly associated with the completion of several legacy appraisal
and tax contracts in 2004 and early 2005.

Maintenance

. We provide maintenance and support services for our software products and third party
software. Maintenance revenues increased due to growth in our installed customer base as evidenced
by our software license revenue and slightly higher maintenance rates on most of our product lines.

Appraisal services.

The decrease in appraisal services revenues is due to the completion in 2004
of certain significant appraisal contracts. These larger projects are often relatively
discretionary in nature compared to smaller projects which tend to occur on a more consistent
basis, and the larger projects we recently completed have not been replaced by similar projects.
The appraisal services business is driven in part by revaluation cycles in various states.

Cost of software license revenues.

Amortization expense for capitalized software products
declined from $6.1 million in 2004 to $5.9 million in 2005, because certain software products
became fully amortized during 2005, which offset new amortization expense from software products
released in 2004.

Cost of acquired software.

In 2005 cost of acquired software declined compared to the prior year
because certain acquired software assets recorded for previous acquisitions became fully amortized.

Cost of software services and maintenance revenues.

In 2005 cost of software services and
maintenance grew 11% while the related software services and maintenance revenues increased 8%
compared to the prior year period. During 2005, costs increased at a faster rate than related
software services and maintenance revenues, which reflects lower utilization of personnel in our
appraisal and tax software division, costs to support our recently released Orion products, a shift
in the roles of certain of our development personnel whose costs were capitalized in 2004 to
projects that were expensed in 2005, and higher health care costs.

Cost of appraisal services revenues.

The decline in the cost of appraisal services revenues is the
result of lower appraisal services revenues. We often hire temporary employees to assist in
appraisal projects whose term of employment generally ends with the projects’ completion. In
addition, in the second quarter of 2005 we made significant organizational changes to our appraisal
services division because of the declining gross margins.

Gross margin percentage.

The overall gross margin percentage decline was due to cost
inefficiencies associated with lower appraisal services revenues and efforts and costs to support
our recently released Orion products, as well as a shift in the roles of certain of our development
personnel whose costs were capitalized in 2004 to projects that are being expensed in 2005 and
higher health care costs.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Historically, we have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily with cash generated
from operating activities. As of December 31, 2006, our combined cash and cash equivalents and
short-term investments (including restricted cash equivalents and a restricted certificate of
deposit) balance was $41.7 million compared to $37.5 million at December 31, 2005. Cash provided
by operating activities was $26.8 million in 2006 compared to $21.2 million in 2005 and $22.2
million in 2004. Cash and short-term investments increased primarily due to continued strong
operating performance and higher deferred revenue due to additional maintenance customers and new
contract signings.

At December 31, 2006, our days sales outstanding (“DSOs”) were 102 days compared to DSOs of 101
days at December 31, 2005. DSOs are calculated based on accounts receivable (excluding long-term
receivables) divided by the quotient of annualized quarterly revenues divided by 360 days.

Investing activities used cash of $24.3 million in 2006, while investing activities provided cash
of $1.8 million in 2005 and used cash of $9.9 million in 2004. In January 2006, we acquired two
companies, MazikUSA, Inc. and TACS, Inc. The combined purchase price, including transaction costs,
for the two companies was approximately $14.6 million, comprised of approximately $11.7 million in
cash and 325,000 shares of Tyler common stock. In September 2006 we also purchased certain
maintenance and support agreements associated with one of our financial products for approximately
$580,000. Other investing activities during 2006 were capital expenditures of $4.3 million,
including $4.1 million for computer hardware and purchased software for internal use, including a
new enterprise-wide customer relationship management system, and other asset additions to support
internal growth. In 2005 and 2004 investing activities primarily consisted of investments in software development
and property and equipment. Investing activities in 2004 also included adjustments to the
acquisition of Eden Systems, Inc. (“Eden”). Pursuant to our purchase



agreement, two of the
shareholders of Eden were granted the right to “put” their remaining shares to Tyler and we
were also granted the right to “call” the remaining shares. In 2004, we purchased the
remaining 2,500 shares for $725,000 in cash.

We purchased $26.8 million of short-term investments during 2006. Proceeds from sales of
short-term investments were $19.0 million during 2006. During 2006, the short-term
investments earned interest income of $438,000 which was reinvested. We also earned interest
income of $962,000 from money market investments and a restricted certificate of deposit.

Financing activities used cash of $6.0 million in 2006 compared to $14.8 million in 2005 and $9.9
million in 2004. Cash used in financing activities was primarily comprised of purchases of
treasury shares, net of proceeds from stock option exercises and contributions from our employee
stock purchase plan.

During 2006, we purchased approximately 1.0 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate
cash purchase price of $10.5 million.

In 2006, we received $2.9 million from the exercise of options to purchase approximately 623,000
shares of our common stock under our employee stock option plan. During 2005 we issued 436,000
shares of common stock and received $1.8 million in aggregate proceeds, upon exercise of stock
options and during 2004 we issued 680,000 shares of common stock and received $1.9 million in
aggregate proceeds upon exercise of stock options.

In both 2006 and 2005, we received $1.0 million for contributions to the Tyler Technologies, Inc.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). The ESPP was adopted by our shareholders in May 2004.

Subsequent to December 31, 2006 and through February 23, 2007 we purchased approximately 188,000
shares of our common stock for an aggregate cash purchase price of $2.6 million.

We maintain a $10.0 million Letter of Credit facility under which the bank will issue cash
collateralized letters of credit. As of December 31, 2006 we had outstanding letters of credit
totaling $5.0 million to secure surety bonds required by some of our customer contracts.

In the first quarter of 2007 we acquired two small companies and a building for a combined cash
purchase price of $5.0 million. We have not finalized the allocation of the excess purchase price
over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired companies but expect this
allocation will result in non-cash charges that may have a small dilutive effect on earnings per
share in 2007.

Excluding acquisitions, we anticipate that 2007 capital spending will be between $3.5 million and
$4.0 million, the majority of which will be related to computer equipment and software for
infrastructure expansions. We currently do not expect to capitalize significant amounts
related to software development in 2007 but the actual amount and timing of those costs, and
whether they are capitalized or expensed may result in additional capitalized software
development. Capital spending in 2007 is expected to be funded from existing cash balances
and cash flows from operations.

From time to time we engage in discussions with potential acquisition candidates. In order to
pursue such opportunities, which could require significant commitments of capital, we may be
required to incur debt or to issue additional potentially dilutive securities in the future. No
assurance can be given as to our future acquisition opportunities and how such opportunities will
be financed. In the absence of future acquisitions of other businesses, we believe our current
cash balances and expected future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our
anticipated cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures and other activities through the
next twelve months. If operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our needs, we believe that
credit would be available to us.



We lease office facilities, as well as transportation, computer and other equipment used in our
operations under non-cancelable operating lease agreements expiring at various dates through 2013.
Most leases contain renewal options and some contain purchase options. Following are the future
obligations under non-cancelable leases at December 31, 2006 (in thousands):

It is not our usual business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements or to issue
guarantees to third parties. As of December 31, 2006 we have no material purchase commitments,
except for the operating lease commitments listed above.

CAPITALIZATION

At December 31, 2006, our capitalization consisted of $125.9 million of shareholders’ equity.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,
“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN
48”), which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions, as defined.
FIN 48 seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition
and measurement related to accounting for income taxes. This interpretation is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We do not expect the interpretation will have a
material impact on our results from operations or financial position.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements”. SFAS No. 157 defines
fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States, and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, with
earlier application encouraged. Any amounts recognized upon adoption as a cumulative effect
adjustment will be recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption.
We have not yet determined the impact of SFAS No. 157 on our financial condition and results of
operations.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

Market risk represents the risk of loss that may affect us due to adverse changes in financial
market prices and interest rates. As of December 31, 2006, we had funds invested in auction rate
municipal securities and state and municipal bonds, which we accounted for in accordance with SFAS
No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.” These investments were
treated as available-for-sale under SFAS No. 115. The carrying value of these investments
approximates fair market value. Due to the nature of this investment, we are not subject to
significant market rate risk.

We have no outstanding debt at December 31, 2006, and we therefore are not subject to any interest
rate risk.

The reports of our independent registered public accounting firm and our consolidated financial
statements, related notes, and supplementary data are included as part of this Annual Report

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

— Our chief executive officer and our chief
financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Securities Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)) as of December 31,
2006. Based on such evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have
concluded that as of December 31, 2006 such disclosure controls and procedures were effective and
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit
under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and include controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in such reports is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

— During the quarter ended December 31, 2006, there were
no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting, as defined in Securities Exchange Act
Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f), that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

— Tyler’s management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as
defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Tyler’s internal control over financial
reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to Tyler’s management and board of directors
regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Management assessed the effectiveness of Tyler’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2006. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2006, Tyler’s
internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2006 has been audited by Ernst & Young, LLP, the independent registered public
accounting firm who also audited Tyler’s consolidated financial statements. Ernst & Young’s
attestation report on management’s assessment of Tyler’s internal control over financial reporting
appears on page F-2 hereof.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Tyler Technologies, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tyler Technologies, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2006. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Tyler Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries at
December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company changed
its method of accounting for share-based compensation effective January 1, 2006.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the effectiveness of Tyler Technologies, Inc.’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission and our report dated February 20, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Tyler Technologies, Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Controls over Financial Reporting, that Tyler Technologies, Inc. maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Tyler Technologies, Inc.’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Tyler Technologies, Inc. maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Tyler Technologies, Inc. maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Tyler Technologies, Inc. as of December
31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006 and our report dated
February 20, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

December 31, 2006 and 2005

(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

We provide integrated software systems and related services for local governments. We develop and
market a broad line of software products and services to address the information technology (“IT”)
needs of cities, counties, schools and other local government entities. In addition, we provide
professional IT services, including software and hardware installation, data conversion, training,
and for certain customers, product modifications, along with continuing maintenance and support for
customers using our systems. We also provide property appraisal outsourcing services for taxing
jurisdictions.

Tyler’s business is subject to risks and uncertainties including dependence on IT spending by
customers, fluctuations of quarterly results, a lengthy and variable sales cycle, dependence on key
personnel, dependence on principal products and third-party technology and rapid technological
change. In addition, our products are complex and we run the risk of errors or defects with new
product introductions or enhancements.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

In 2005, we merged all of our subsidiaries into the parent company. The consolidated financials as
of December 31, 2004 include our parent company and our subsidiaries, all of which were
wholly-owned.

CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND OTHER

Cash equivalents include items almost as liquid as cash, such as money market investments with
insignificant interest rate risk and original maturities of three months or less at the time of
purchase. For purposes of the statements of cash flows, we consider all investments with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 115, “Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” we determine the appropriate classification of
debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluate the classification as of each
balance sheet date. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we classified our short-term investments as
available-for-sale securities pursuant to SFAS No. 115. Investments which are classified as
available-for-sale are recorded at fair value as determined by quoted market price and unrealized
holding gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, if any, are not reflected in earnings but
are reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income until realized. Interest and
dividends earned on these securities are reinvested in the securities. The cost basis of
securities sold is determined using the average cost method. Following is a summary of short-term
investments:

We maintain a $10.0 million Letter of Credit facility under which the bank will issue cash
collateralized letters of credit. As of December 31, 2006 approximately $5.0 million of our cash
equivalents are restricted and designated as collateral for our letters of credit issued in
connection with our surety bond program. These letters of credit expire during 2007.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

We recognize revenue related to our software arrangements pursuant to the provisions of Statement
of Position (“SOP”) 97-2, “Software Revenue Recognition,” as amended by SOP 98-4 and SOP 98-9, and
related interpretations, as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 104, “Revenue Recognition.” We recognize revenue on our appraisal services contracts
using the proportionate performance method of accounting, with considerations for the provisions of
Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) No. 00-21, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.”

Software Arrangements:

We earn revenue from software licenses, post-contract customer support (“PCS” or “maintenance”),
software related services and hardware. PCS includes telephone support, bug fixes, and rights to
upgrades on a when-and-if available basis. We provide services that range from installation,
training, and basic consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer
needs. In software arrangements that include rights to multiple software products, specified
upgrades, PCS, and/or other services, we allocate the total arrangement fee among each deliverable
based on the relative fair value of each.

We typically enter into multiple element arrangements, which include software licenses, software
services, PCS and occasionally hardware. The majority of our software arrangements are multiple
element arrangements, but for those arrangements that involve significant production, modification
or customization of the software, or where software services are otherwise considered essential to
the functionality of the software in the customer’s environment, we use contract accounting and
apply the provisions of SOP 81-1 “Accounting for Performance of Construction — Type and Certain
Production — Type Contracts.”

If the arrangement does not require significant production, modification or customization or where
the software services are not considered essential to the functionality of the software revenue, is
recognized when all of the following conditions are met:

i.

persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;

ii.

delivery has occurred;

iii.

our fee is fixed or determinable; and

iv.

collectibility is probable.

For multiple element arrangements, each element of the arrangement is analyzed and we allocate a
portion of the total arrangement fee to the elements based on the fair value of the element using
vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”), regardless of any separate prices stated
within the contract for each element. Fair value is considered the price a customer would be
required to pay if the element was sold separately based on our historical experience of
stand-alone sales of these elements to third parties. For PCS, we use renewal rates for continued
support arrangements to determine fair value. For software services, we use the fair value we
charge our customers when those services are sold separately. We monitor our transactions to
insure we maintain and periodically revise VSOE to reflect fair value. In software arrangements
in which we have the fair value of all undelivered elements but not of a delivered element, we
apply the “residual method” as allowed under SOP 98-9 in accounting for any element of a multiple
element arrangement involving software that remains undelivered such that any discount inherent in
a contract is allocated to the delivered element. Under the residual method, if the fair value of
all undelivered elements is determinable, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred
and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered element(s) and is
recognized as revenue assuming the other revenue recognition criteria are met. In software
arrangements in which we do not have VSOE for all undelivered elements, revenue is deferred until
fair value is determined or all elements for which we do not have VSOE have been delivered.
Alternatively, if sufficient VSOE does not exist and the only undelivered element is services that
do not involve significant modification or customization of the software, the entire fee is
recognized over the period during which the services are expected to be performed.

Software Licenses

We recognize the revenue allocable to software licenses and specified upgrades upon delivery of the
software product or upgrade to the customer, unless the fee is not fixed or determinable or
collectibility is not probable. If the fee is not fixed or determinable,

F-8


including new customers
whose payment terms are three months or more from shipment, revenue is generally recognized as
payments
become due from the customer. If collectibility is not considered probable, revenue is recognized
when the fee is collected. Arrangements that include software services, such as training or
installation, are evaluated to determine whether those services are essential to the product’s
functionality.

A majority of our software arrangements involve “off-the-shelf” software. We consider software to
be off-the-shelf software if it can be added to an arrangement with minor changes in the underlying
code and it can be used by the customer for the customer’s purpose upon installation. For
off-the-shelf software arrangements, we recognize the software license fee as revenue after
delivery has occurred, customer acceptance is reasonably assured, that portion of the fee
represents a non-refundable enforceable claim and is probable of collection, and the remaining
services such as training are not considered essential to the product’s functionality.

For arrangements that involve significant production, modification or customization of the
software, or where software services are otherwise considered essential, we recognize revenue using
contract accounting. We generally use the percentage-of-completion method to recognize revenue
from these arrangements. We measure progress-to-completion primarily using labor hours incurred,
or value added. The percentage-of-completion method generally results in the recognition of
reasonably consistent profit margins over the life of a contract since we have the ability to
produce reasonably dependable estimates of contract billings and contract costs. We use the level
of profit margin that is most likely to occur on a contract. If the most likely profit margin
cannot be precisely determined, the lowest probable level of profit in the range of estimates is
used until the results can be estimated more precisely. These arrangements are often implemented
over an extended time period and occasionally require us to revise total cost estimates. Amounts
recognized in revenue are calculated using the progress-to-completion measurement after giving
effect to any changes in our cost estimates. Changes to total estimated contract costs, if any,
are recorded in the period they are determined. Estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are
recorded in the period in which we first determine that a loss is apparent.

For arrangements that include new product releases for which it is difficult to estimate final
profitability except to assume that no loss will ultimately be incurred, we recognize revenue under
the completed contract method. Under the completed contract method, revenue is recognized only
when a contract is completed or substantially complete. Historically these amounts have been
immaterial.

Software Services

Some of our software arrangements include services considered essential for the customer to use the
software for the customer’s purposes. For these software arrangements, both the software license
revenue and the services revenue are recognized as the services are performed using the
percentage-of-completion contract accounting method. When software services are not considered
essential, the fee allocable to the service element is recognized as revenue as we perform the
services.

Computer Hardware Equipment

Revenue allocable to computer hardware equipment, which is based on VSOE, is recognized when we
deliver the equipment and collection is probable.

Postcontract Customer Support

Our customers generally enter into PCS agreements when they purchase our software licenses. Our
PCS agreements are typically renewable annually. Revenue allocated to PCS is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the period the PCS is provided. All significant costs and expenses
associated with PCS are expensed as incurred. Fair value for the maintenance and support
obligations for software licenses is based upon the specific sale renewals to customers.

Appraisal Services:

For our property appraisal projects, we recognize revenue using the proportionate performance
method of revenue recognition since many of these projects are implemented over one to three year
periods and consist of various unique activities. Under this method of revenue recognition, we
identify each activity for the appraisal project, with a typical project generally calling for
bonding, office set up, training, routing of map information, data entry, data collection, data
verification, informal hearings, appeals and project management. Each activity or act is
specifically identified and assigned an estimated cost. Costs which are considered to be
associated with indirect activities, such as bonding costs and office set up, are expensed as
incurred. These costs are typically billed as incurred and are recognized as revenue equal to
cost. Direct contract fulfillment activities and related supervisory costs such as data
collection, data entry and verification are expensed as incurred. The direct costs for these
activities are determined and the total

F-9


contract value is then allocated to each activity based on
a consistent profit margin. Each activity is assigned a consistent unit of
measure to determine progress towards completion and revenue is recognized for each activity based
upon the percentage complete as applied to the estimated revenue for that activity. Progress for
the fulfillment activities is typically based on labor hours or an output measure such as the
number of parcel counts completed for that activity. Estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are
recorded in the period in which we first determine that a loss is apparent.

Other:

The majority of deferred revenue consists of unearned support and maintenance revenue that has been
billed based on contractual terms in the underlying arrangement with the remaining balance
consisting of payments received in advance of revenue being earned under software licensing,
software and appraisal services and hardware installation. Unbilled revenue is not billable at the
balance sheet date but is recoverable over the remaining life of the contract through billings made
in accordance with contractual agreements. The termination clauses in most of our contracts
provide for the payment for the fair value of products delivered and services performed in the
event of an early termination.

Prepaid expenses and other current assets include direct and incremental costs, consisting
primarily of commissions associated with arrangements for which revenue recognition has been
deferred and third party subcontractor payments. Such costs are expensed at the time the related
revenue is recognized.

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions
include the application of the percentage-of-completion and proportionate performance methods of
revenue recognition, the carrying amount and estimated useful lives of intangible assets and
valuation allowance for receivables. In addition we are primarily self-insured for employee health
care and base our self-insurance liability on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but
not yet reported. Actual results could differ from estimates.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET

Property, equipment and purchased software are recorded at original cost and increased by the cost
of any significant improvements after purchase. We expense maintenance and repairs when incurred.
Depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the
asset’s estimated useful life or the term of the lease in the case of leasehold improvements. For
income tax purposes, we use accelerated depreciation methods as allowed by tax laws.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS

Research and development costs are included with selling, general and administrative expenses and
are expensed when incurred. We expensed research and development costs of $3.3 million during 2006,
$2.4 million during 2005 and $2.5 million during 2004.

INCOME TAXES

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred taxes arise because
of different treatment between financial statement accounting and tax accounting, known as
“temporary differences.” We record the tax effect of these temporary differences as “deferred tax
assets” (generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the future periods) and
“deferred tax liabilities” (generally items that we received a tax deduction for, which have not
yet been recorded in the income statement). The deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rules and laws that are expected to be in effect when the temporary differences
are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance would be established to reduce
deferred tax assets if it is likely that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.

STOCK COMPENSATION

Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for stock options using the intrinsic value method under
Accounting Principles Board Opinion (“APB”) No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” and
related interpretations, as permitted by SFAS No. 123,

F-10


“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”,
under which no compensation expense was recognized for stock option grants.

Accordingly, share-based compensation related to our stock options for periods prior to 2006 are
included as a pro forma disclosure in the financial statement footnotes.

Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R,
“Share-Based Payment” using the modified-prospective method. Under this transition method,
compensation cost recognized in 2006, includes the applicable amounts of: (a) compensation cost of
all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of, January 1, 2006 (based on the
grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, and
previously presented in the pro forma footnote disclosures), and (b) compensation cost for all
share-based payments granted subsequent to January 1, 2006 (based on the grant-date fair value
estimated in accordance with the new provisions of SFAS No. 123R). Results for prior periods have
not been restated.

As a result of adopting SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006, our earnings before income taxes and net
earnings for 2006 were $2.0 million and $1.6 million lower, respectively, than if we had continued
to account for share-based compensation under APB No. 25. Basic and diluted earnings per share for
2006 would have been $0.04 higher, had we continued to account for share-based compensation under
APB No. 25.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we presented all tax benefits of deductions resulting from
the exercise of options as operating cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. SFAS
No. 123R requires the cash flows resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost
recognized for those options (excess tax benefits) to be classified as financing cash flows. The
$614,000 excess tax benefit classified as a financing cash inflow for 2006 would have been
classified as an operating cash inflow if we had not adopted SFAS No. 123R.

If compensation expense for our stock-based awards to employees had been recognized using the fair
value method of SFAS No. 123R rather than the intrinsic value method under APB No. 25, net income
and earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts below for 2005 and 2004.

SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION

Although we have a number of operating divisions, separate segment data has not been presented as
they meet the criteria for aggregation as permitted by SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures About Segments of
an Enterprise and Related Information.”

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

We have used the purchase method of accounting for all of our business combinations. Our business
acquisitions result in the allocation of the purchase price to goodwill and other intangible
assets. We first allocate the cost of acquired companies to identifiable assets based on estimated
fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired,
net of liabilities assumed, is recorded as goodwill.

Under SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” we evaluate goodwill for impairment
annually as of April 1st, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. An impairment loss is
recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s

F-11


fair value. In the
implementation of SFAS No. 142, we identified two reporting units for impairment testing. The
appraisal services
and appraisal software stand-alone business unit qualified as a reporting unit since it is one
level below an operating segment, discrete financial information exists for the business unit and
the executive management group directly reviews this business unit. The other software business
units were aggregated into the other single reporting unit. The appraisal services and appraisal
software stand-alone business unit is organized in such a manner that both of its revenue sources
are tightly integrated with each other and discrete financial information at the operating profit
level does not exist for this business unit’s respective revenue sources.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

We periodically evaluate whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of
our property and equipment or other long-lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable.
If such circumstances are determined to exist, we measure the recoverability of assets to be held
and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset or appropriate grouping of assets and
the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If the
carrying amount of the assets exceeds their estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is
recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the
assets. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at
the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated.
The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented
separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet.

COSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE

Software development costs have been accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 86, “Accounting for
the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed.” Under SFAS No. 86,
capitalization of software development costs begins upon the establishment of technological
feasibility and prior to the availability of the product for general release to customers. We
capitalized software development costs of approximately $236,000 during 2006, $1.0 million during
2005, and $4.6 million during 2004. Software development costs primarily consist of personnel
costs and rent for related office space. We begin to amortize capitalized costs when a product is
available for general release to customers. Amortization expense is determined on a
product-by-product basis at a rate not less than straight-line basis over the product’s remaining
estimated economic life, but not to exceed five years. Amortization of software development costs
was approximately $5.1 million in 2006, $5.9 million in 2005, and $6.1 million in 2004 and is
included in cost of software license revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivables, accounts payables, deferred revenues and certain
other assets at cost approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. Our
available-for-sale investments are recorded at fair value based on quoted market prices.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK AND UNBILLED RECEIVABLES

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the size and
geographical diversity of our customer base. Historically, our credit losses have not been
significant. As a result, we do not believe we have any significant concentrations of credit risk
as of December 31, 2006.

We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments, which are provided at the time
the revenue is recognized. Since most of our customers are domestic governmental entities, we
rarely incur a loss resulting from the inability of a customer to make required payments. Events
or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount for the allowances for doubtful
accounts and sales adjustments may require revision, include, but are not limited to, deterioration
of a customer’s financial condition, failure to manage our customer’s expectations regarding the
scope of the services to be delivered, and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our
software products.

The termination clauses in most of our contracts provide for the payment for the fair value of
products delivered or services performed in the event of early termination. Our property appraisal
outsourcing service contracts can range up to three years and, in one case, as long as six years in
duration. In connection with these contracts, as well as certain software service contracts, we
may perform work prior to when the software and services are billable and/or payable pursuant to
the contract. We have historically recorded such unbilled receivables (costs and estimated profit
in excess of billings) in connection with (1) property appraisal services contracts accounted for
using proportionate performance accounting in which the revenue is earned based upon activities
performed in one accounting period but the billing normally occurs shortly thereafter and may span
another accounting period; (2) software services

F-12


contracts accounted for using the
percentage-of-completion method of revenue recognition using labor hours as a measure of progress
towards completion in which the services are performed in one accounting period but the billing for
the software element of the arrangement may be based upon the specific phase of the implementation;
(3) software revenue for which we have objective evidence that the customer-specified objective
criteria has been met but the billing has not yet been submitted to the customer; and (4) in a
limited number of cases, we may grant extended payment terms generally to existing customers with
whom we have a long-term relationship and favorable collection history. In addition, certain of
our property appraisal outsourcing contracts are required by law to have an amount withheld from a
progress billing (generally a 10% retention) until final and satisfactory project completion is
achieved, typically upon the completion of fieldwork or formal hearings.

In connection with this activity, we have recorded unbilled receivables of $10.1 million and $8.6
million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, with billing primarily dependent on fixed
payment schedules based on specific calendar dates. We also have recorded retention receivable of
$3.8 million and $1.7 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and these retentions
become payable upon the completion of the contract or completion of our field work and formal
hearings. Unbilled receivables and retention receivables expected to be collected in excess of one
year have been classified as non-current receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets.

INDEMNIFICATION

Most of our software license agreements indemnify our customers in the event that the software sold
infringes upon the intellectual property rights of a third party. These agreements typically
provide that in such event we will either modify or replace the software so that it becomes
non-infringing or procure for the customer the right to use the software. We have recorded no
liability associated with these indemnifications, as we are not aware of any pending or threatened
infringement actions that are possible losses. We believe the estimated fair value of these
intellectual property indemnification clauses is minimal.

We have also agreed to indemnify our officers and board members if they are named or threatened to
be named as a party to any proceeding by reason of the fact that they acted in such capacity. A
form of the indemnification agreement was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to our Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2002. We maintain directors’ and officers’ insurance coverage to protect against any
such losses. We have recorded no liability associated with these indemnifications. Because of our
insurance coverage, we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is
minimal.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,
“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN
48”), which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions, as defined.
FIN 48 seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition
and measurement related to accounting for income taxes. This interpretation is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We do not expect the interpretation will have a
material impact on our results from operations or financial position.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements”. SFAS No. 157 defines
fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States, and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, with
earlier application encouraged. Any amounts recognized upon adoption as a cumulative effect
adjustment will be recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption.
We have not yet determined the impact of SFAS No. 157 on our financial condition and results of
operations.

(2) ACQUISITIONS

In January 2006, we completed the acquisitions of all of the capital stock of MazikUSA, Inc.
(“Mazik”) and TACS, Inc. (“TACS”). The total value of these transactions, including transaction
costs, was approximately $14.6 million, which was comprised of $11.7 million in cash and 325,000
shares of Tyler common stock valued at $2.9 million.

•

Mazik provides an integrated software solution for schools that combines the
functionalities of student performance monitoring, student tracking, financial accounting,
human resources and reporting.

F-13


•

TACS provides pension and retirement software solutions that assist public and private
pension institutions in increasing operational efficiency and accuracy.

We believe the products offered by Mazik and TACS will complement our business model and give us
additional opportunities to provide our customers with solutions tailored specifically for local
governments.

We acquired assets of approximately $300,000 and assumed liabilities of approximately $1.7 million.
We recorded goodwill of $12.4 million, all of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes,
and other intangible assets of $3.3 million. The $3.3 million of intangible assets is attributable
to acquired software and customer relationships that will be amortized over a weighted average
period of approximately five years, and purchased in-process research and development of $140,000
which we expensed during the first quarter of 2006. Our consolidated balance sheet as of December
31, 2006 reflects the allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition. The operating results of the
acquired businesses are included in our results of operations since their respective dates of
acquisition in late January 2006.

In September 2006, we also purchased certain maintenance and support agreements associated with one
of our financial software products for approximately $580,000. These costs have been capitalized
and will be amortized over 13 years.

(3) RESTRUCTURING CHARGE

Because of unsatisfactory financial performance early in 2005, we made significant organizational
changes in the second quarter of 2005 to those areas of our business that were not performing to
our expectations. Our goal was to bring costs in line with expected levels of revenue while
improving the efficiency of our organizational structure to ensure that clients continue to receive
superior service.

We reorganized the appraisal services business to eliminate levels of management and reduce
overhead expense. We also took actions to reduce headcount and costs in our appraisal and tax
software division, and we consolidated certain senior management positions at the corporate office.
These cost reductions were made in the second quarter of 2005. As a result, we eliminated
approximately 120 positions, including management, staff and project-related personnel.

In connection with the reorganization, we incurred certain charges which were primarily comprised
of employee severance costs and related fringe benefits, and totaled approximately $1.3 million
before income taxes. The related payments were paid in 2005.

Slightly more than half of our stock option awards granted qualify as incentive stock options
(“ISO”) for income tax purposes. As such, a tax benefit is not recorded at the time the
compensation cost related to the options is recorded for book purposes due to the fact that an ISO
does not ordinarily result in a tax benefit unless there is a disqualifying disposition. Stock
option grants of non-qualified options result in the creation of a deferred tax asset, which is a
temporary difference, until the time that the option is exercised. Due to the treatment of
incentive stock options for tax purposes, our effective tax rate from year to year is subject to
variability.

Although realization is not assured, we believe it is more likely than not that all the
deferred tax assets at December 31, 2006 and 2005 will be realized. Accordingly, we believe no
valuation allowance is required for the deferred tax assets. However, the amount of the deferred
tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted in the future if estimates of reversing taxable
temporary differences are revised.

We paid income taxes, net of refunds received, of $10.4 million in 2006, $8.1 million in 2005, and
$6.5 million in 2004.

Subsequent to December 31, 2006 and through February 23, 2007, we repurchased 188,000 shares
for an aggregate purchase price of $2.6 million. As of February 23, 2007 we had authorization from
our board of directors to repurchase up to 843,000 additional shares of our common stock.

As of December 31, 2006, we had warrants outstanding to purchase 1.6 million shares of common stock
at $2.50 per share. These warrants expire in September 2007.

(9) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

Share-based compensation plan

We have a stock option plan that provides for the grant of stock options to key employees,
directors and non-employee consultants. Options become fully exercisable after three to five years
of continuous employment and expire ten years after the grant date. Once options become
exercisable, the employee can purchase shares of our common stock at the market price on the date
we granted the option. Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123R,
“Share-Based Payment,” which establishes accounting for share-based awards exchanged for employee
services, using the modified prospective application transition method. Under this transition
method, compensation cost recognized in 2006, includes the applicable amounts of: (a) compensation
cost of all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of, January 1, 2006 (based
on the grant-date fair value estimated in

F-17


accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,”
and previously presented in the pro forma footnote disclosures), and (b) compensation cost for all
share-based payments granted subsequent to January 1, 2006 (based on the grant-date fair value
estimated in accordance with the new provisions of SFAS No. 123R). Results for prior periods have
not been restated. For prior periods we applied APB No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,” and related Interpretations, and provided the required pro forma disclosures under SFAS
No. 123.

As of December 31, 2006, there were 974,000 shares available for future grants under the plan from
the 8.5 million shares previously approved by the stockholders.

Determining Fair Value Under SFAS No. 123R

Valuation and Amortization Method. We estimate the fair value of share-based awards granted using
the Black-Scholes option valuation model. We amortize the fair value of all awards on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service periods, which are generally the vesting periods.

Expected Life. The expected life of awards granted represents the period of time that they are
expected to be outstanding. We determine the expected life using the “simplified method” in
accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107.

Expected Volatility. Using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, we estimate the volatility of
our common stock at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock.

Risk-Free Interest Rate. We base the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes option
valuation model on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with
an equivalent remaining term equal to the expected life of the award.

Expected Dividend Yield. We have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock in the last ten
years and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently,
we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the Black-Scholes option valuation model.

Expected Forfeitures. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures. We record
stock-based compensation only for those awards that are expected to vest.

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option valuation model.

The following weighted average assumptions were used for options granted:

compensation cost related to unvested options, net of expected forfeitures, which is expected to be
amortized over a weighted average amortization period of 2.2 years.

Stock options representing the right to purchase common stock of 13,000 shares in 2006,
229,000 shares in 2005, and 110,000 shares in 2004, had exercise prices greater than the average
quoted market price of our common stock. These options were outstanding during 2006, 2005 and
2004, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because their
inclusion would have had an antidilutive effect.

(11) LEASES

We lease office facilities for use in our operations, as well as transportation, computer and other
equipment. We also have two office facility lease agreements with a shareholder and certain
division managers. Most of these leases are noncancelable operating lease agreements and they
expire at various dates through 2013. In addition to rent, the leases generally require us to pay
taxes, maintenance, insurance and certain other operating expenses.

Rent expense was approximately $4.9 million in 2006, $4.6 million in 2005, and $4.6 million in
2004, which included rent expense associated with related party lease agreements of $1.7 million in
2006, $1.5 million in 2005, and $1.4 million in 2004.

Future minimum lease payments under all noncancelable leases at December 31, 2006 are as follows:

(12) EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

We provide a defined contribution plan for the majority of our employees meeting minimum service
requirements. The employees can contribute up to 30% of their current compensation to the plan
subject to certain statutory limitations. We contribute up to a maximum of 2.5% of an employee’s
compensation to the plan. We made contributions to the plan and charged operations $1.6 million
during 2006, $1.0 million during 2005, and $801,000 during 2004.

(13) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Other than ordinary course, routine litigation incidental to our business and except as described
in this Annual Report, there are no material legal proceedings pending to which we are party or to
which any of our properties are subject.

(14) SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

In the first quarter of 2007 we acquired two small companies and a building for a combined
cash purchase price of $5.0 million. We have not finalized the allocation of the excess purchase
price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired companies but expect this
allocation will result in non-cash charges that may have a small dilutive effect on earnings per
share in 2007.

if we had continued to account for share-based compensation under APB No. 25. Basic and
diluted earnings per share for 2006 would have been $0.04 higher, had we continued to account
for share-based compensation under APB No. 25.
