Overview

We are a full service, early-stage contract research organization (CRO). We have built upon our core competency of laboratory animal medicine and science (research model technologies) to develop a diverse portfolio of discovery and safety assessment services, both Good Laboratory Practice (

GLP

) and non-GLP, which is able to support our clients from target identification through preclinical development. We also provide a suite of products and services to support our clients’ manufacturing activities.

Utilizing our broad portfolio of products and services enables our clients to create a more flexible drug development model, which reduces their costs, enhances their productivity and effectiveness and increases speed to market.

Discovery

represents the earliest stages of research in the life sciences, directed at the identification, screening and selection of a lead molecule for future drug development. Discovery activities typically extend anywhere from 4-6 years in conventional pharmaceutical research and development timelines.

Development

activities, which follow, and which can take up to 7-10 years, are directed at demonstrating the

safety, tolerability

and

clinical efficacy

of the selected drug candidates. During the preclinical stage of the development process, a drug candidate is tested

in vitro

(non-animal, typically on a cellular or sub-cellular level in a test tube or multi-well petri plate) and

in vivo

(in research models) to support planned or on-going human trials.

The development of new drugs requires the steadily increasing investment of time and money. Various studies and reports estimate that it takes between 10-15 years, up to $2.0 billion, and exploration of between 5,000 and 10,000 drug molecules to produce a single Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug. We are positioned to leverage our leading portfolio in early-stage drug research

in an efficient and cost-effective way to aid our clients in bringing their drugs to market faster. Our clients reduce their costs, increase their speed and improve their productivity and effectiveness in early-stage discovery and development by using our broad portfolio of products and services.

For nearly 70 years, we have been in the business of providing the research models required in research and development of new drugs, devices and therapies. Over this time, we have built upon our core competency of

in vivo

biology to develop a diverse and expanding portfolio of products and services, which now encompasses the broader early-stage drug research process. Our client base includes global pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, government agencies and hospitals and academic institutions around the world. We currently operate 64 facilities in 18 countries worldwide,

which numbers exclude our Insourcing Solutions (IS) sites. Our products and services, supported by our global infrastructure and deep scientific expertise, enable our clients to overcome many of the challenges of early-stage life sciences research. In 2015, our total revenue was

$1.4 billion

and our operating income from continuing operations, before income taxes, was $195.4 million.

We have three reporting segments: Research Models and Services (

RMS

), Discovery and Safety Assessment (

DSA

), and Manufacturing Support (

Manufacturing

).

Through our RMS segment, we have been supplying research models to the drug development industry since 1947. With over 150 different strains, we continue to maintain our position as the global leader in the production and sale of the most widely used rodent research model strains, principally genetically and microbiologically defined purpose-bred rats and mice. We also provide a variety of related services that are designed to assist our clients in supporting the use of research models in drug discovery and development. With multiple facilities located on three continents (North America, Europe and Asia), we maintain production centers, including barrier rooms and/or isolator facilities. In 2015, RMS accounted for

34.7%

of our total revenue and approximately 3,100 of our employees, including approximately 75 science professionals with advanced degrees.

Our DSA business segment provides services that enable our clients to outsource their innovative drug discovery research, their critical, regulatory-required safety assessment testing and related drug discovery and development activities to us. The demand for these services has historically been driven by the needs of large global pharmaceutical companies that exceeded their internal capacity and by the needs of biotechnology companies and non-profits who traditionally outsourced most of their discovery and development programs. Global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies choose to outsource their discovery and development activities because outsourcing reduces the significant investment in personnel, facilities and other capital resources necessary to efficiently and effectively conduct required scientific studies.

We are one of the two largest providers of drug discovery and preclinical development services worldwide and offer a comprehensive portfolio of target discovery through safety assessment studies required for regulatory submission. We have extensive expertise in the discovery of small molecule clinical candidates and in the design, execution and reporting of safety


assessment studies for both small and large molecules. We currently provide discovery and safety assessment services at multiple facilities located in the United States (U.S.), Canada and Europe. Our DSA segment represented

44.9%

of our total revenue in 2015 and employed approximately 3,900 of our employees including approximately 630 science professionals with advanced degrees.

Through our Manufacturing segment, we help ensure the safe production and release of products manufactured by our clients. Our Microbial Solutions (formerly known as Endotoxin and Microbial Detection or EMD) business provides

in vitro

methods for conventional and rapid quality control testing of sterile and non-sterile biopharmaceuticals and consumer products. Our Avian Vaccine Services business provides specific-pathogen-free (

SPF

) fertile chicken eggs and chickens used in the manufacture of live viruses. Our Biologics Testing Solutions business provides specialized testing of biologics and devices frequently outsourced by global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.

In 2015, Manufacturing accounted for

20.4%

of our total revenue from continuing operations and approximately 1,200 of our employees, including approximately 65 science professionals with advanced degrees.

In recent years, we have focused our efforts on unifying our businesses and improving the efficiency of our global operations to enhance our ability to support our key clients. Our key pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients are increasingly seeking full service, “one-stop” global partners to whom they can outsource more of their drug discovery and development efforts. It is estimated that the market for regulated safety assessment services is at least 50% outsourced, while emerging growth areas such as

in vivo

discovery and certain research model services are currently believed to be less outsourced.

Research Models and Services (RMS)

.

Our RMS segment is comprised of (1) Research Models and (2) Research Model Services.

Research Models

.

Our Research Models business is comprised

of the production and sale of research models.

Research Models.

A significant portion of this business is comprised of the commercial production and sale of research models, principally purpose-bred rats and mice for use by researchers. We provide our rodent models to numerous clients around the world, including most pharmaceutical companies, a broad range of biotechnology companies and many government agencies, hospitals and academic institutions.

We have a global footprint with production facilities strategically located in eight countries, in close proximity to our clients. Our research models include standard stocks and strains and disease models such as those with compromised immune systems, which are in demand as early-stage research tools. The

FDA

and foreign regulatory bodies typically require that the safety and efficacy of new drug candidates be tested on research models like ours prior to testing in humans. As a result, our research models are an essential part of the drug discovery and development process.

Our rodent species have been, and continue to be, some of the most extensively used research models in the world, largely as a result of our continuous commitment to innovation and quality. Our research models are bred and maintained in controlled environments, which are designed to ensure that the models are free of specific viral and bacterial agents and other contaminants that can disrupt research operations and distort results. With our production capabilities, we are able to deliver consistently high-quality research models worldwide.

Our research models include:

•

outbred, which are purposefully bred for heterogeneity;

•

inbred, which are bred to be homogeneous;

•

spontaneous mutant, which contain a naturally occurring genetic mutation (such as immune deficiency);

•

hybrid, which are the offspring of two different inbred parents; and

•

other genetically modified research models, such as knock-out models with one or more disabled genes and transgenic models.

Certain of our research models are proprietary, disease-specific rodent models used to find new treatments for diseases such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular and kidney disease.

We are also a premier provider of high quality, purpose bred, SPF large research models to the biomedical research community.

Research Model Services.

RMS also offers a variety of services designed to support our clients' use of research models in basic research and screening preclinical drug candidates. These services address the need among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to outsource the non-core aspects of their drug discovery activities. Our services include those which are related to the maintenance and monitoring of research models, and managing research operations for government entities, academic


organizations and commercial clients. We currently have three service offerings in research models services: Genetically Engineered Models and Services, Insourcing Solutions and Research Animal Diagnostic Services.

Genetically Engineered Models and Services (GEMS)

.

We breed and maintain research models purchased or purposefully created by our clients for biomedical research activities. The creation of a genetically engineered model (GEM) is a critical scientific event, but it is only the first step in the discovery process. Productive utilization of GEMs requires significant additional technical expertise in order to properly support basic and early discovery research. We provide breeding expertise and colony development, quarantine, health and genetic testing and monitoring, germplasm cryopreservation, and rederivation including assisted reproduction. Our team of project managers is supported by a technologically advanced system Internet Colony Management (ICM™) that allows for real-time data exchange. We provide these services to clients around the world, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, hospitals, universities and government agencies.

Insourcing Solutions (IS)

.

We manage research operations (including recruitment, training, staffing and management services) for government entities, academic organizations and commercial clients. Research institutions prefer to outsource staffing and management while retaining certain elements of their research in-house thus driving demand for our services. We believe that our expertise in early-stage drug research, and in particular research model care, scientific and technical support, facility operations, and discovery and development services, enhances the productivity and quality of our clients' research programs.

Research Animal Diagnostic Services (RADS)

.

We monitor and analyze the health profiles of research models and cell lines used by our clients. We developed this capability internally in order to address the diagnostic needs of our own research model business. We are able to serve as their sole-source testing laboratory, or as an alternative source supporting our clients’ internal laboratory capabilities. We believe we are the reference laboratory of choice for health testing of laboratory research models and an industry leader in the field of animal diagnostics.

Discovery and Safety Assessment (DSA)

We currently offer discovery and safety assessment services, both regulated and non-regulated, in which we include both

in vivo

and

in vitro

studies, supporting laboratory services, and strategic preclinical consulting and program management to support product development.

Discovery Services

.

We offer a full spectrum of discovery services from identification of a novel druggable target, followed by high-throughput screening and medical chemistry, through delivery of preclinical drug and therapeutic candidates ready for safety assessment. In 2014, we integrated our Early Discovery and

In Vivo

Discovery businesses into a single business line - Discovery Services - as part of our continued efforts to streamline and enhance the support we can provide for clients’ integrated drug discovery programs. One seamless discovery organization allows us to better engage with clients at the earliest stages of drug discovery and support their complex scientific needs. We support a variety of therapeutic areas including oncology, central nervous system, bone and musculoskeletal, inflammation, metabolic diseases, respiratory and fibrotic diseases, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genito-urinary and ophthalmology. We also provide expertise in the growing area of rare and orphan diseases, which are typically diseases of high unmet medical need in smaller patient populations, such as cystic fibrosis and Huntington’s Disease. We believe there are emerging opportunities to assist our clients in a variety of drug discovery applications and platforms from target discovery to candidate selection.

Early Discovery

.

We are a global leader in integrated drug discovery services, with a predominant focus on

in vitro

biology capabilities and medicinal chemistry. Our knowledge and expertise allow us to support our clients as they drive their programs forward through design and implementation of clear program plans. Our full suite of service offerings allows us to support our clients at the earliest stages of their research, and to stay with them through the entire early-stage process. Our Early Discovery service capabilities include: target discovery and validation, hit identification, medicinal chemistry and testing how a drug is absorbed, distributed in the body, metabolized and excreted (

ADME

). We also offer ion channel testing and

in vitro

cardiac safety assessment services, for both discovery and preclinical purposes. These services extend from the early discovery screening process through to

in vitro

GLP safety assessment testing.

In Vivo Discovery Services

.

In Vivo

Discovery Services represents the earliest

in vivo

stages of drug research, directed at the identification, screening and selection of a lead compound for drug development.

In vivo

activities typically extend anywhere from 4-6 years in conventional pharmaceutical research and development timelines. We offer research and development expertise, capabilities, and services globally to accelerate our clients' drug discovery pipelines from lead generation to candidate selection and on occasion, completing

in vivo

studies in support of clinical efforts or post-marketing work. We complement clients' capabilities and expertise to improve their decision-making, increase their flexibility, and reduce their internal costs and product development timelines. In addition, we provide

in vitro

and

in vivo

assays in support of lead optimization to candidate selection activities. Examples of this include early pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies and

in vitro

and

in


vivo

assays to assess mechanism, bioavailability, metabolism, efficacy, and safety pharmacology. Furthermore, our November 2015 acquisition of Oncotest, a Germany-based CRO providing discovery services for oncology, complements our existing business in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom (U.K.) and Finland.

Safety Assessment

.

We offer a full range of discovery and safety assessment studies required for regulatory submission on a global basis.

Bioanalysis, Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism

.

In support of preclinical drug safety testing, our clients are required to demonstrate appropriate exposure, stability in the collected sample, kinetics of their drug or compound in circulation, the presence of metabolites, and, with biologics, the presence or absence of anti-drug antibodies. We have scientific depth in the sophisticated bioanalytical techniques required to satisfy these requirements for a number of drug classes. After performing sample analysis in support of preclinical studies, we have the opportunity to capture the benefits of bridging the preclinical bioanalysis with subsequent clinical development. Once the analysis is complete, our scientists evaluate the data to provide information on the pharmacokinetics and/or toxicokinetics of the drug, and complete an evaluation of the distribution of the drug or metabolites. Pharmacokinetics refers to understanding what the body does to a drug or compound once administered, including the process by which the drug is absorbed, distributed in the body, metabolized and excreted (

ADME

); toxicokinetics refers to the same understanding as applied at higher doses that may result in adverse effects. These studies are required for the full preclinical assessment of the disposition of the drug and the results are used in the final preclinical safety evaluation of the compound.

In support of preclinical drug safety testing, our clients are required to demonstrate that the compound does not have the potential to prolong the cardiac QT interval. We have the assays and can perform the screening for this demonstration that is required for an investigational new drug submission.

Toxicology.

Toxicology is one of our nonclinical competencies and a competitive strength. We have expertise in the design and execution of development programs in support of both chemically-derived (small molecule) and biotechnology-derived (large molecule) pharmaceuticals. Once a lead molecule is selected, toxicology studies are required to support clinical trials in humans and new drug registrations. These toxicology studies focus on assessing the safety of the molecule to determine if administration of the molecules to humans might cause any unintended harmful effects. These studies are typically performed in research models to identify any potential adverse effects that a compound has on an organism over a variety of doses and over various time periods.

Our toxicology services feature:

•

a broad offering of

in vitro

and

in vivo

capabilities and study types designed to identify possible safety risks for potential therapeutics as they transition from discovery into regulated drug development toxicology and human clinical testing;

•

all the standard

in vitro

and

in vivo

studies in support of general toxicology (acute, sub-acute and chronic studies), genetic toxicology, safety pharmacology and carcinogenicity bioassays that are required for regulatory submissions supporting “first-in-human” to “first-to-the-market” strategies;

•

expertise in standard and specialty routes of administration (e.g., infusion, intravitreal, intrathecal, and inhalation) that are important not only for the testing of potential pharmaceuticals and biopharmaceuticals, but also for the safety testing of medical devices, industrial chemicals, food additives, agrochemicals, biocides, nutraceuticals, animal health products and other materials;

•

expertise in the conduct and assessment of reproductive and developmental toxicology studies (in support of larger-scale and later-stage human clinical trials);

•

services in important specialty areas such as ocular, bone, juvenile/neonatal, immune-toxicology, photobiology and dermal testing;

•

expertise in all major therapeutic areas;

•

study design and strategic advice to our clients based on our wealth of experience and scientific expertise in support of drug development; and

•

a strong history of assisting our clients in achieving their regulatory and/or internal milestones for the safety testing of numerous therapy types including stem cells, vaccines, proteins, antibodies, drug conjugates, oligonucleotide biotherapeutics, small molecules and medical devices.


Our safety assessment facilities comply with GLP to the extent required by the FDA, as well as other international regulatory bodies. Furthermore, our early-stage discovery work, which is not subject to GLP standards, is typically carried out under a quality management system such as ISO 9100 or similarly constructed internally developed quality systems. Our facilities are regularly inspected by U.S. and other regulatory compliance monitoring authorities, our clients' quality assurance departments and our own internal quality assessment program.

Pathology Services.

The ability to identify and characterize clinical and anatomic pathologic changes is critical in determining the safety and efficacy of potential new therapeutics. Key “go/no-go” decisions regarding continued product development are typically dependent on the identification, characterization and evaluation of fluid, tissue and cellular changes that our experts identify and interpret for our clients. We employ a large number of highly trained veterinary anatomic and clinical pathologists and other scientists who use state-of-the-art techniques to identify potential test article-related changes within tissues, fluids and cells. In addition to all standard anatomic and clinical pathology techniques, we provide specialized evaluations such as cytology, platelet function, assay development, immunohistochemistry,

in situ

hybridization and electron microscopy services.

Manufacturing Support (Manufacturing)

Microbial Solutions (formerly known as Endotoxin and Microbial Detection)

. Our Microbial Solutions business provides

in vitro

methods for conventional and rapid quality control testing of sterile and non-sterile biopharmaceutical and consumer products. Our legacy business provided lot release testing of medical devices and injectable drugs for endotoxin contamination. With our acquisition of Celsis in July 2015, we now provide rapid microbial detection systems for quality control testing in the pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and consumer products industries. Our Accugenix business provides state-of-the-art microbial identification and genetic sequencing services for manufacturing in the biopharmaceutical, medical device, nutraceutical and consumer care industries.

Endotoxin testing is an

in vitro

process which uses a processed extract from the blood of the horseshoe crab, known as limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL). The LAL test is the first and most successful FDA-validated alternative to an

in vivo

test to date. The extraction of blood does not harm the crabs, which are subsequently returned to their natural ocean environment. Our Microbial Solutions business produces and distributes a comprehensive portfolio of endotoxin testing, microbial detection and identification kits, reagents, software, accessories, instruments and associated microbial quality control laboratory services to a broad range of companies manufacturing and releasing products from the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, consumer products and dairy industries worldwide. We are a market leader in endotoxin testing products and services, which are used for FDA-required quality control testing of injectable drugs and medical devices, their components and the processes by which they are manufactured.

The growth in our Microbial Solutions business is driven by our FDA approved line of next-generation endotoxin testing products. This line is based on the Endosafe Portable Testing System (Endosafe

®

-PTS™) technology, which allows rapid endotoxin testing in the central laboratory or manufacturing environment. In recent years, we expanded the PTS product portfolio to include a multiple sample testing system known as the Endosafe®-MCS™ (multi-cartridge system) to satisfy the demand of our clients who require higher sample throughput. We anticipate our clients' demand for rapid testing methods will continue to increase as they respond to the FDA's Process Analytical Technology (PAT) Initiative as well as move to faster, simpler testing methods for their technicians. In 2013, we launched the first fully automated robotic system developed specifically for high-volume endotoxin testing: Endosafe®-Nexus™. We expect to see expanded use of this rapid endotoxin testing technology in non-traditional areas such as renal dialysis, nuclear and compounding pharmacies and cellular therapy.

Celsis’ systems are principally used for product-release testing to help ensure the safe manufacture of pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and consumer products. The addition of Celsis, with its Advance II™, Accel™ and Innovate™ systems for non-sterile applications, complements our PTS-Micro™, a rapid bacterial (bioburden) detection system for sterile biopharmaceutical applications. We expect our comprehensive portfolio to drive increased adoption of our quality control testing solutions across both sterile and non-sterile applications.

Our Accugenix subsidiary is the premier global provider of current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) compliant contract microbial identification and genetic sequencing testing. Accugenix is an acknowledged industry leader in species-level identification and strain typing of bacteria and fungi that are recovered from manufacturing facilities. Utilizing state-of-the-art and proprietary

in vitro

technologies, coupled with scientific expertise and analysis, Accugenix excels in providing accurate, timely and cost-effective microbial identification services required to meet internal quality standards and government regulations.

Biologics Testing Solutions

.

We perform specialized testing of biologics frequently outsourced by global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Our laboratories in the U.S., Germany, Scotland and Ireland provide timely and compliant molecular


biology, virology, bioanalysis, immunochemistry, microbiology and related services. We confirm that biological processes and the drug candidates and drugs produced are consistent, correctly defined, stable and essentially contaminant free. This testing is required by the FDA and other international regulatory authorities for our clients to obtain new drug approvals, to maintain government licensed manufacturing facilities and to release approved therapeutic products for patient treatment.

Our manufacturing services group grows and stores well-characterized early-stage client cell lines for later development or manufacture of therapeutic proteins and vaccines for clinical trials. We further design and provide viral clearance projects for Phase I, II and III studies in our German and U.S. facilities.

Avian Vaccine Services

.

We are the global leader

for the supply of SPF fertile chicken eggs and chickens. SPF chicken embryos are used by animal health companies as self-contained “bioreactors” for the manufacture of live viruses. These viruses are used as a raw material primarily in poultry as well as human and veterinary vaccine applications. The production of SPF eggs is performed under biosecure conditions, similar in many ways to our research model production. We have a worldwide presence, with several SPF egg production facilities in the U.S., contracted production capabilities in Hungary, and franchise operations in India. We also operate a specialized avian laboratory in the U.S., which provides in-house quality control testing of the SPF flocks, offers testing services to vaccine companies and commercial poultry operations, and manufactures poultry diagnostics and bulk antigens for poultry vaccines.

Our Strategy

Our objective is to be the preferred strategic global partner for our clients. Our strategy is to deliver a comprehensive and integrated portfolio of drug discovery and non-clinical development products, services and solutions to support our clients' discovery and early-stage drug research, process development, scale up and manufacturing efforts, and enable them to bring new and improved therapies to market faster and more cost effectively. In addition, we believe we can improve and augment drug discovery and early-stage development effectiveness by coordinating the dialog between large pharmaceutical, biotechnology, academic and non-governmental organizations and venture capitalists. Separately, through our various Manufacturing segment businesses, we aim to be the premier provider of products and services that ensure our clients produce and release their products safely. As these groups increasingly rely and interact with one another in this field, we assist them in working together by developing deeper strategic relationships with each of these constituencies.

We believe we have certain competitive advantages in executing this strategy, as a result of our continuing focus on the following:

Integrated Early-Stage Portfolio

.

We are the only large, global

CRO

with a portfolio of products, services and solutions that focuses on drug discovery and early-stage development. We provide research models and associated services, discovery research studies and services, and comprehensive safety assessment studies in both regulated and non-regulated environments. As such, we are able to collaborate with clients from target discovery through candidate selection. When critical decisions are made regarding which therapeutics will progress from discovery to development, we continue to work alongside our clients as the drug candidates move downstream. Our recognized expertise in early-stage drug research and pharmacology provides us with a competitive advantage. We understand our clients' therapies, and the challenges they face during the discovery and development process, including mechanism of action, efficacy, drug metabolism, safety assessment and toxicological testing critical for making “go/no-go” decisions.

We also offer a portfolio of products, services, and solutions that supports the process development, scale up and quality control efforts of the biopharmaceutical industry. We provide products and services that support the development and release of commercialized biologics products. In particular, we are an industry leader in the areas of microbial detection and microbial identification to support process development and ongoing commercial production. Our portfolio spans a broad range of traditional and rapid methods, which provide the highest testing quality, enhance productivity and reduce cycle time.

Deep Scientific Expertis

e.

We provide a breadth and depth of scientific expertise which may be too costly for our clients to build and/or maintain in-house. We provide essential capabilities, including biomarkers, biologics, medicinal chemistry,

in vitro

screening,

in vivo

pharmacology, immunology, pathology, biologics process development testing, microbial detection and identification and other specialty service areas that have high infrastructure costs or are cost-prohibitive for clients to maintain in-house. We continue to expand our portfolio in key therapeutic and pharmacology areas to align with our clients' internal drug discovery and development areas of focus. These areas of disease focus and expertise include oncology, metabolism and obesity, immunology, respiratory, bone and musculoskeletal, diabetes, cardiovascular, infectious disease and central nervous system. In the areas of functional expertise, it includes synthetic and medicinal chemistry, library design, cell line development,

in vitro

and

in vivo

assay development screening,


preclinical imaging, structural biology, process chemistry, toxicology, veterinary pathology, bioanalysis, scale up and formulation development. We also continue to enhance our small molecule and biologics manufacturing portfolio in areas of greatest industry need, where outsourcing provides major benefits for our clients and where we could provide significant benefits given our unique early development portfolio and global footprint.

Commitment to Animal Welfare

.

We are committed to being the worldwide leader in the humane care of laboratory animals and implementation of the “3Rs” (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement). As researchers, we are responsible to our clients and the public for the health and well-being of the animals in our care. We work hand-in-hand with the scientific community to understand how living conditions, handling procedures and reduction of stress play an important role in the quality and efficiency of research.

Superior Quality and Client Support

.

We maintain scientific rigor and high quality standards through management of key performance indicators and an intense focus on biosecurity. These standards allow clients to access our global portfolio of products and services with the confidence that they will obtain consistent results no matter where they choose to obtain their products or conduct their research.

Flexible and Customized Environment to Provide the Right Solutions

.

Each of our clients is different, with unique needs and specific requirements. We understand the importance of flexibility, and leverage the expertise embedded in our integrated early-stage portfolio to provide customized solutions tailored to the specific need or therapeutic area for a particular client. By utilizing our streamlined and efficient facilities, we help clients create a flexible infrastructure in order to improve their workload and staffing requirements. This allows our clients to reduce internal capacity and/or staff. We provide enhanced value to clients who use us as a full-service integrated partner over a longer period of time.

Large, Global Partner

.

W

e believe there is a particular advantage in being a full service, high-quality provider of research models and associated services, discovery and preclinical

in vivo

and

in vitro

services and manufacturing support on a global scale. Many of our clients, especially large biopharmaceutical companies, have decided to limit the number of suppliers with which they work. Their preference is to partner with large Tier 1 CROs like Charles River, who can offer clients support across the earlier-stage drug research process as a result of broader portfolios and experience in project management. This includes extensive scientific, technical and therapeutic area expertise, real-time access to data through secure portals, a global footprint, and streamlined and simplified processes and communications including professional project and relationship management. We are focused on leveraging our competitive advantages to ensure we are recognized as the premier preferred provider thereby enabling us to build broader and deeper long-term strategic relationships with our clients.

Global biopharmaceutical companies are continuing to make the decision to outsource more significant tranches of their drug discovery, development and manufacturing processes. Over the past few years we have entered into strategic relationships with leading global biopharmaceutical companies and expanded existing preferred provider agreements with other leading global biopharmaceutical companies. For example, in 2015, we extended the term of our collaboration with AstraZeneca for outsourced regulated safety assessment and development drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics until 2020. For some of these partners, we provide a broad suite of our research models and discovery and safety assessment services and for others we provide a customized and select array of discovery and safety assessment services and/or research models. Offering flexibility enables our clients to utilize our products and services to deliver innovative health solutions in a manner which best suits their individual needs.

There have been fundamental changes in our clients' research and development needs, particularly with regard to the large pharmaceutical industry. First, these clients are increasingly emphasizing studies that have greater translation to the clinic so that they can make appropriate decisions regarding the progression of potential therapeutic entities earlier in the development process. The result is a greater focus on discovery services, including

in vivo

pharmacology studies consisting of efficacy and non-GLP DMPK (drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics) studies. Second, these clients are choosing to outsource additional discovery and safety assessment services in order to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their drug selection processes.

There have been fundamental shifts in the manufacturing needs of our clients. Clients have significantly outsourced their small molecule manufacturing capacity by selling off assets as well as contracting with contract manufacturing organizations (

CMOs

). There is now a very large, global and highly fragmented CMO industry supporting the industry. Biologic production has been slower to be outsourced, but this is accelerating. Furthermore, the industry is increasing reliance on venture capital funded and mid-tier companies for new small molecule and biologics drugs and they prefer an outsourced CMO model. This will continue to drive further manufacturing outsourcing. Higher standards for quality control testing during process


development and ongoing manufacturing will drive enhanced need for CMO testing support services, particularly rapid methods and fast turnaround services, to minimize the impact on manufacturing timelines and costs.

We believe that this changing environment will provide enhanced outsourcing opportunities for us in the future. We remain optimistic that our clients are increasingly receptive to partnering with CROs and CMOs as a means of meeting their discovery and preclinical support needs. We believe that the successful launch of new therapies and outsourcing by the pharmaceutical industry will continue to be positive drivers of demand for our products and services.

We also believe that larger biopharmaceutical companies will increasingly focus on efficiencies and execution. They will continue to reassess what are core differentiators from research and development to commercialization. We expect they will also continue to be conservative in re-building infrastructure and expertise. This should lead to more opportunities for strategic outsourcing as clients choose to utilize external resources rather than invest in internal infrastructure. In the aggregate, we believe that the evolving large biopharmaceutical research and development business model will make our essential products and services even more relevant to our clients, and allow them to leverage our integrated offerings and expertise to drive their research, preclinical development and manufacturing efficiency and cost effectiveness.

We believe it is critical to participate in the strategic partnering process because these relationships are likely to extend for lengthy periods of time - three to five years. Furthermore, both the client and the CRO invest heavily in the initial phases of the relationship to successfully transfer work streams and establish governance processes. Given this investment, clients are less likely to change CROs at the conclusion of the initial relationship. Our goal is to prevail in the majority of these opportunities.

We also believe that our portfolio provides flexible solutions that meet the customized needs for virtual and small biotechnology companies, which have limited or no infrastructure. These clients also value our ability to provide a broad range of services and integrated services where we work hand in hand with our customers to design, plan and manage integrated projects and programs. This includes classically outsourced services, “insourced” services and hybrid offerings blending resources from both our clients and staff. Our clients have utilized this capability, which blends both resources inside and outside their walls.

We maintain an intense focus on initiatives designed to allow us to drive profitable growth and maximize value for shareholders, and better position ourselves to operate successfully in the current and future business environment. As a result, we believe that we are well positioned to exploit both existing and new outsourcing opportunities.

We intend to continue to broaden the scope of the products and services we provide across the drug discovery and early-stage development continuum primarily through internal development, and, as needed, through focused acquisitions and alliances. Acquisitions are an integral part of our growth strategy, but we are committed to a disciplined approach that seeks to target businesses that are a sound strategic fit and that offer the prospect of enhancing shareholder value, typically including the achievement of a hurdle rate for return on invested capital above our weighted cost of capital. For example, in each of 2014 and 2015, we completed significant strategic acquisitions. In 2014, we acquired Argenta and BioFocus, global leaders in integrated drug discovery services with a predominant focus on

in vitro

capabilities, and ChanTest, a premier provider of ion channel testing. In 2015, we acquired Celsis Group Limited., a leading provider of rapid bacterial detection systems for sterile and non-sterile quality control testing in the biopharmaceutical and consumer products industries.

Our acquisition strategy also takes into account geographic as well as strategic expansion of existing core services. For example, in 2015, we acquired Oncotest, a Germany-based CRO providing discovery services for oncology, which complements our existing

In Vivo

Discovery businesses in the U.S. and Finland, and Sunrise Farms, a producer of SPF fertile chicken eggs and chickens used in the manufacture of live viruses. In 2013, we acquired Microbial Solutions Singapore and 75% ownership of Vital River, the premier commercial provider of research models and related services in China. And, in 2014 and 2012, we acquired VivoPath and Accugenix, respectively.

We are also partnering with a number of venture capital firms primarily investing in life sciences, health care and technology companies with an emphasis on early-stage emerging growth companies. Through these partnerships we are able to promote contract research services for discovery and safety assessment to these companies. This offers us the opportunity to establish ourselves as a provider of choice for a unique client group which has emerged as biopharmaceutical companies rationalize and prioritize their development pipelines.

Customers

We maintain a three-pronged sales organization with a focus on:

•

global biopharmaceutical companies;


•

small and mid-sized pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies; and

•

academic and government institutions.

We also maintain several sales specialists which either have specific technical expertise (often degreed scientists) or cover unique markets.

Our clients continue to consist primarily of all of the major biopharmaceutical companies; many biotechnology, agricultural and chemical, life science, veterinary medicine, medical device, diagnostic and consumer product companies; contract research and contract manufacturing organizations; and other commercial entities, as well as leading hospitals, academic institutions, and government agencies.

We have stable, long-term relationships with many of our clients. During 2015, no single commercial client accounted for more than 5% of our total revenue

and no single customer accounted for more than 10% of the revenue of any of our three business segments.

We continue to pursue a goal of expanding our relationships with our large biopharmaceutical clients, and with many of our larger mid-market clients. These relationships take different forms, from preferred provider arrangements to strategic partnerships. The structure of these relationships incentivizes clients to purchase more products and services across our early-stage portfolio, and in total, the strategic relationships in which we are now engaged represent over 30% of our total revenues.

B

ecause of the strength of these relationships, we have better insight into our clients' planning processes, and therefore, better visibility than in the past. For information regarding revenue attributable to each of our business segments for the last three fiscal years, please see Note 14 “Segment and Geographic Information” included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. For information regarding revenue and long-lived assets attributable to operations in the United States, Europe, Canada, Japan and other countries for each of the last three fiscal years, please review Note 14 “Segment and Geographic Information” included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

Sales, Marketing and Customer Support

We have designated dedicated sales people for each of our three client segments (global biopharmaceutical, small and mid-sized pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and academic and government institutions). This enhances our ability to meet client needs by offering customized, tailored solutions across our entire portfolio. In addition, our mid-market pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients benefit by additional support from a combination of account managers with broad portfolio knowledge and specialists with specific scientific expertise. This allows us to provide comprehensive coverage of all of the market segments among our diverse client population. We also apply the use of dedicated sales specialists for certain technical product lines, such as in our Manufacturing business.

We sell our products and services principally through our direct sales force and account management teams who work in North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific countries. In addition to interactions with our direct sales force, our primary promotional activities include organizing scientific symposia, publishing scientific papers and newsletters, webinars and making presentations at, and participating in, scientific conferences and trade shows in North America, Europe and Asia. We supplement these scientifically based marketing activities with internet-based marketing, advertising and direct mail. In certain areas, our direct sales force is supplemented by international distributors and agents.

Our internal marketing/product management teams support the field sales staff and account management teams while developing and implementing programs to create close working relationships with our clients in the biomedical research industry. We maintain customer service, technical assistance and consulting service departments (in addition to project managers for our service businesses), which address both our clients' routine and more specialized needs and generally serve as a scientific resource for them. We frequently assist our clients in solving problems related to animal husbandry, health and genetics, biosecurity, preclinical study design, regulatory consulting, protocol development and other areas in which our expertise is widely recognized as a valuable resource by our clients.

Our marketing efforts are focused on stimulating demand for further outsourcing across our entire services portfolio. We believe that our ability to provide solutions that address all aspects of early-stage drug research

are increasingly attractive to our clients, and we continue to design and market our commercial activities to deliver flexible, customized programs designed by segment to meet our clients' global and site-specific needs.

Competition

Our goal is to be a leader in each of the markets in which we participate. We compete in the marketplace on the basis of our therapeutic and scientific expertise in early-stage drug research, quality, reputation, flexibility, responsiveness, pricing,


innovation and global capabilities. We are able to offer a unique portfolio of early-stage products and services to support drug discovery and development.

We encounter a broad range of competitors of different sizes and capabilities in each of our three businesses segments, although the largest competitors within any segment vary.  We also face competition from the internal discovery and development resources of our clients.

•

For RMS, we have five main competitors of which one is a government funded, not-for-profit entity; one is part of a large public company; two are privately held in Europe and one is privately held in the U.S. We believe that none of these competitors compare to us in global reach, financial strength, breadth of product and services offerings, technical expertise or pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry relationships.

•

For DSA, both our Discovery Services and Safety Assessment businesses have numerous competitors. Discovery has hundreds of competitors as in a highly competitive and fragmented market. Safety Assessment has seven main competitors; one is part of a large public company in the U.S.; one is a privately held company in the U.K.; one is a private company with operations in the U.S. and China; one is a privately held company with operations in the U.S. and the EU; and three are privately held companies in the U.S. Our DSA segment also competes with in-house departments of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities and teaching hospitals.

•

For Manufacturing, each of our underlying businesses has several competitors. In addition to many smaller competitors, Biologics has five main competitors, of which three are public companies in Europe, one is a private company in the U.S., and one is a public company in China. Avian has one main competitor to its SPF eggs business, which is privately held in the European Union, and numerous competitors for services provided through our specialized avian laboratory. Microbial Solutions has six main competitors, of which three are public companies in the European Union, two are public companies in the U.S. and one is privately held in the U.S.

Industry Support and Animal Welfare

One of our core values is a concern for, and commitment to, animal welfare. We have been in the forefront of animal welfare improvements in our industry, and continue to show our commitment with special recognition programs for employees who demonstrate an extraordinary commitment in this critical aspect of our business. We created our own Humane Care Initiative, which is directed by our Animal Welfare and Training Group. The goal of the initiative is to assure that we continue as a worldwide leader in the humane care of laboratory animals and implementation of the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement). Laboratory animals are an important resource that further our knowledge of living systems and contribute to the discovery of life-saving drugs and procedures. We work hand-in-hand with the scientific community to understand how living conditions, handling procedures and stress play a role in the quality and efficiency of research. As researchers, we are responsible to our clients and the public for the health and well-being of the animals in our care.

We are firmly committed to the 3Rs and to reducing the number of animals used by emphasizing health and genetic integrity to decrease study data variability. Whenever possible, we use technological advances such as new diagnostic tests for screening pathogens in laboratory rodents, microsampling and

in vitro

assays. We also partner with customers to develop study designs decreasing the number of animals needed and suggesting pilot studies where appropriate. We have recently instituted a quarterly award recognizing our employees’ efforts to continually implement the 3Rs at our sites globally.

We support a wide variety of organizations and individuals working to further animal welfare as well as the interests of the biomedical research community. We fund scholarships to laboratory animal training programs, provide financial support to non-profit institutions that educate the public about the benefits of animal research and provide awards and prizes to outstanding leaders in the laboratory animal medicine field and the supporters of 3Rs.

Employees

As of December 26, 2015, we had approximately 8,600 employees (including approximately 770 science professionals with advanced degrees, including Ph.D.s, D.V.M.s and M.D.s). Our employees are not unionized in the U.S. Employees at some of our European facilities are represented by works councils and/or unions, which is consistent with local customs for our industry. We believe we have good relationships with our employees, based on a number of factors including employee retention and survey results.

Backlog

Our backlog for our RMS, DSA and Manufacturing reportable segments was $106.6 million, $327.8 million and $36.2 million, respectively, as of December 26, 2015, as compared to $115.7 million, $310.5 million and $27.5 million, respectively, as of


December 27, 2014. Related services are performed over varying durations, from short to extended periods of time, which may be as long as several years. We maintain an order backlog to track anticipated revenue from studies and projects that either have not started, but are anticipated to begin in the near future, or are in process and have not been completed. We only recognize a study or project in backlog after we have received written evidence of a client's intention to proceed. Canceled studies or projects are removed from backlog.

We believe our aggregate backlog as of any date is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of our future results for a variety of reasons. First, studies vary in duration (i.e., some studies or projects that are included in 2015 backlog may be completed in 2016, while others may be completed in later years). Second, the scope of studies or projects may change, which may either increase or decrease their value. Third, studies or projects included in backlog may be subject to bonus or penalty payments. Fourth, studies or projects may be terminated or delayed at any time by the client or regulatory authorities for a number of reasons, including the failure of a drug to satisfy safety and efficacy requirements, or a sponsor making a strategic decision that a study or service is no longer necessary. Delayed contracts remain in our backlog until a determination of whether to continue, modify or cancel the study has been made. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to realize all or most of the net revenues included in backlog or estimate the portion to be filled in the current year.

Regulatory Matters

As our business operates in a number of distinct operating environments and in a variety of locations worldwide, we are subject to numerous, and sometimes overlapping, regulatory environments.

The Animal Welfare Act (

AWA

) governs the care and use of certain species of animals used for research in the U.S. other than laboratory rats, mice and chickens. As a result, most of our U.S. small animal research models activities and our avian vaccine services operations are not subject to regulation under the AWA. For regulated species, the AWA and the associated Animal Care regulations require producers and users of regulated species to provide veterinary care and to utilize specific husbandry practices such as cage size, shipping conditions, sanitation and, for certain species, environmental enrichment to assure the welfare of these animals. Separately, facilities using live vertebrate animals in research funded by the U.S. Public Health Service (

PHS

) must also adhere to the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and follow the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals produced by the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research.

We comply with licensing and registration requirement standards set by the United States Department of Agriculture (

USDA

) and similar agencies in other countries such as the European Union, China, Japan and Canada for the care and use of regulated species. Our animal production facilities in the U.S. - our DSA facilities in the U.S., and Canada - and most of our DSA sites in the European Union are accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International, a private, nonprofit, international organization that promotes the humane treatment of animals in science through voluntary accreditation and assessment programs.

Our import and export of animals and our operations in foreign countries are subject to international agreements and conventions, as well as a variety of national, regional, and local laws and regulations, which establish the standards for the humane treatment, care, handling and transport of animals by dealers and research facilities.

We conduct nonclinical safety assessment studies to support the submissions for approval or licensing of our clients' products throughout the world. Many of these studies must comply with national statutory or regulatory requirements for Good Laboratory Practice (

GLP

). GLP regulations describe a quality system for the organizational process and the conditions under which nonclinical studies are planned, performed, monitored, recorded, reported and archived. GLP compliance is required by such regulatory agencies as the FDA, United States Environmental Protection Agency, European Medicines Agency, Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in the U.K., Health Products Regulatory Authority in Ireland, Health Canada and other similar monitoring authorities in the countries where we operate. GLP requirements are significantly harmonized throughout the world and our laboratories are capable of conducting studies in compliance with all necessary requirements.

Our Manufacturing businesses produce endotoxin test kits, reagents, cell banks used in research and biopharmaceutical production, clinical trial vaccines and vaccine support products. Additionally, several of our laboratories conduct identity, stability, sterility and potency testing in support of our clients' manufacturing programs working with our clients to fulfill their validation requirements as applicable. These activities are subject to regulation by the FDA and other national regulatory agencies under their respective current Good Manufacturing Practice (

cGMP

) regulations. These regulations require that we manufacture our products or perform testing in a prescribed manner with respect to cGMP compliance, and maintain records of our manufacturing, testing and control activities. In addition, the specific activities of some of our businesses require us to hold specialized licenses for the manufacture, distribution and/or marketing of particular products.


All of our sites are subject to licensing and regulation under international treaties and conventions, including national, regional and local laws relating to:

•

the surface and air transportation of chemicals, biological reagents and laboratory specimens;

•

the handling, use, storage and disposal of chemicals (including narcotics and psychotropic drugs), biological reagents, laboratory specimens, hazardous waste and radioactive materials;

•

the procurement, handling, use, storage and disposal of human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue based products for research purposes;

•

the safety and health of employees and visitors to our facilities; and

•

protection of the environment and general public.

Global compliance programs are centralized under a single group responsible for global quality programs and systems to ensure that all business sectors comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and satisfy our clients’ expectations for quality and regulatory compliance. To assure these compliance obligations, we established quality assurance units (QAUs) in each of our regulated businesses that require independent oversight. The QAUs operate independently from those individuals that direct and conduct studies, manufacturing or studies that support manufacturing.

Intellectual Property

We develop and implement computer software and technically derived procedures and products intended to maximize the quality and effectiveness of our services. Although our intellectual property rights are valuable to our success, we believe that such factors as the technical expertise, proprietary know-how, ability and experience of our professionals are more important, and that, overall, these technological capabilities provide significant benefits to our clients. Where we consider it appropriate, steps are taken to protect our know-how through confidentiality agreements and registrations. In addition, we in-license technology and products from other companies when it enhances our product and services businesses. In the future, in-licensing may become a larger initiative to enhance our offerings, particularly as we focus on therapeutic area expertise. With the exception of technology related to our Microbial Solutions testing business, we have no patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises or concessions which are material and upon which any of our products or services are dependent.

Corporate Governance

We are committed to operating our business with integrity and accountability. We strive to meet or exceed all of the corporate governance standards established by the New York Stock Exchange, the SEC, and the Federal government as implemented by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Eight of the nine members of our Board of Directors are independent and have no significant financial, business or personal ties to us or management and all of our board committees (with the exception of our Executive Committee and our Strategic Planning and Capital Allocation Committee) are composed entirely of independent directors. The Board adheres to our Corporate Governance Guidelines and a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics which has been communicated to employees and posted on our website. We are diligent in complying with established accounting principles and are committed to providing financial information that is transparent, timely and accurate. We have a Related Person Transactions Policy designed to promote the timely identification of such transactions and to ensure we give appropriate consideration to any real or perceived conflicts in our commercial arrangements. We have a global process through which employees, either directly or anonymously, can notify management (and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors) of alleged accounting and auditing concerns or violations including fraud. Our internal Disclosure Committee meets regularly and operates pursuant to formal disclosure procedures and guidelines which help to ensure that our public disclosures are accurate and timely. Copies of our Corporate Governance Guidelines, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Related Person Transactions Policy are available on our website at www.criver.com under the “Investor Relations-Corporate Governance” caption.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors

Set forth below, elsewhere in this Form 10-K and in other documents we file with the SEC are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K. We note that factors set forth below, individually or in the aggregate, may cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.


The outsourcing trend in preclinical (discovery and safety assessment) stages of drug discovery and development may decrease, which could impair our growth.

Over the past decade, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have generally increased their outsourcing of preclinical research support activities, such as discovery and safety assessment. While many industry analysts expect the outsourcing trend to continue to increase for the next several years (although with different growth rates for different phases of drug discovery and development),

decreases in such outsourcing may result in a diminished growth rate in the sales of any one or more of our service lines and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For additional discussion of the factors that we believe have recently been influencing outsourcing demand from our clients, please see the section entitled “Our Strategy” included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

A reduction in research and development budgets at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may adversely affect our business.

Our clients include researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Our ability to continue to grow and win new business is dependent in large part upon the ability and willingness of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to continue to spend on molecules in the preclinical phases of research and development (and in particular discovery and safety assessment) and to outsource the products and services we provide. Fluctuations in the expenditure amounts in each phase of the research and development budgets of these researchers and their organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services. Research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources, mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, spending priorities (including available resources of our biotechnology clients, particularly those that are cash-negative, who may be highly focused on rationing their liquid assets in a challenging funding environment), general economic conditions and institutional budgetary policies.

Available funding

for

biotechnology clients in particular

may be

affected by the

capital markets,

investment objectives of

venture capital investors,

and

priorities of biopharmaceutical

industry sponsors.

Our business could be adversely affected by any significant decrease in drug research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as by academic institutions, government laboratories or private foundations. In particular, studies in recent years have indicated that a majority of academic researchers are anticipating reductions in their budgets.

Similarly, economic factors and industry trends that affect our clients in these industries, also affect their research and development budgets and, consequentially, our business as well. Furthermore, our clients (particularly larger biopharmaceutical companies) continue to search for ways to maximize the return on their investments with a focus on leaner research and development costs per drug candidate. For additional discussion of the factors that we believe have recently been influencing research and development budgets at our clients, please see the sections entitled “Our Strategy” and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

A reduction or delay in government funding of research and development may adversely affect our business.

A portion of revenue in our RMS segment is derived from clients at academic institutions and research laboratories whose funding is partially dependent on both the level and timing of funding from government sources such as the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and similar domestic and international agencies, which can be difficult to forecast. Government funding of research and development is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Our sales may be adversely affected if our clients delay purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government budget proposals. Also, government proposals to reduce or eliminate budgetary deficits have sometimes included reduced allocations to the NIH and other government agencies that fund research and development activities. Other programs, such as homeland security or defense, or general efforts to reduce the federal budget deficit could be viewed by the U.S. government as a higher priority. These budgetary pressures may result in reduced allocations in the future to government agencies that fund research and development activities. Only since 2013 has funding for the NIH begun to increase. A reduction in government funding for the NIH or other government research agencies could adversely affect our business and our financial results. Also, there is no guarantee that NIH funding will be directed towards projects and studies that require use of our products and services.

Several of our product and service offerings are dependent on a limited source of supply, which if interrupted could adversely affect our business.

We depend on a limited international source of supply for certain products, such as large research models. Disruptions to their continued supply may arise from health problems, export or import laws/restrictions or embargoes, international trade regulations, foreign government or economic instability, severe weather conditions, increased competition amongst suppliers for models, disruptions to the air travel system, commercial disputes, supplier insolvency, or other normal-course or


unanticipated events. Any disruption of supply could harm our business if we cannot remove the disruption or are unable to secure an alternative or secondary supply source on comparable commercial terms.

Changes in government regulation or in practices relating to the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries, including potential health care reform, could decrease the need for the services we provide.

Governmental agencies throughout the world, but particularly in the U.S., strictly regulate the drug development process. Our business involves helping pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, among others, navigate the regulatory drug approval process. Accordingly, many regulations, and often new regulations, are expected to result in higher regulatory standards and often additional revenues for companies that service these industries. However, some changes in regulations, such as a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of streamlined or expedited drug approval procedures, or an increase in regulatory requirements that we have difficulty satisfying or that make our services less competitive, could eliminate or substantially reduce the demand for our services.

Although we believe we are currently in compliance in all material respects with national, regional and local laws as well as other accepted guidance used by oversight bodies (which include the USDA, the standards set by the International Air Transport Association, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, The Centers for Disease Control, the Department of Transportation, the office of Laboratory Animal Welfare of NIH, the Drug Enforcement Agency as well as numerous other Canadian, European and Asian oversight agencies), failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and other enforcement actions. In addition, if regulatory authorities were to mandate a significant reduction in safety assessment procedures which utilize laboratory animals (as has been advocated by certain groups), certain segments of our business could be materially adversely affected.

In March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted health care reform legislation intended over time to expand health insurance coverage and impose health industry cost containment measures. In June 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of this legislation. The Court’s decision allows implementation of key provisions impacting drug manufacturers going forward including, but not limited to, (1) expansion of access to health insurance coverage, (2) expansion of the Medicaid program, (3) enactment of an industry fee on pharmaceutical companies, and (4) imposition of an excise tax on the sale of medical devices. Since the law and its implementation continue to face challenges in Congress and federal courts, and from certain state governments, opposition advocacy groups, and some small business organizations, we are uncertain as to the effects of this legislation on our business and are unable to predict what legislative proposals will be adopted in the future.

Implementation of health care reform legislation may have certain benefits but also may contain costs that could limit the profits that can be made from the development of new drugs. This could adversely affect research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, which could in turn decrease the business opportunities available to us both in the U.S. and abroad. In addition, new laws or regulations may create a risk of liability, increase our costs or limit our service offerings. Furthermore, if health insurers were to change their practices with respect to reimbursements for pharmaceutical products, our clients may spend less, or reduce their growth in spending on research and development.

The FDA is in the process of reviewing and modernizing the GLP regulations to reflect current industry standards. As this may change some of the GLP requirements, the regulatory impact will not be known until the final regulations are issued.

We are at risk that changes in U.S. Government practices may negatively affect our business since it is a significant customer of ours. For example, in 2014, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) canceled a 10-year, $112.0 million contract that was originally initiated in 2006, which had two years remaining. Under the contract, we produced NCI research models for academic and government researchers. In an effort to mitigate the effect of the cancellation, we launched an outreach program to inform researchers that they could continue to obtain the NCI models from us, with no change in initial pricing or logistics. From a revenue standpoint, we received between $10.0 and $11.0 million annually to produce the models, and expect that we will retain approximately half of that amount from direct sales to researchers.

Contaminations in our animal populations can damage our inventory, harm our reputation for contaminant-free production, result in decreased sales and cause us to incur additional costs.

Our research models and fertile chicken eggs must be free of certain infectious agents such as certain viruses and bacteria because the presence of these contaminants can distort or compromise the quality of research results and could adversely impact human or animal health. The presence of these infectious agents in our animal production facilities and certain service operations could disrupt our contaminant-free research model and fertile egg production as well as our animal services businesses including GEMS, harm our reputation for contaminant-free production and result in decreased sales.


If they occur, contaminations typically require cleaning up, renovating, disinfecting, retesting and restarting production or services. Such clean-ups result in inventory loss, clean-up and start-up costs, and reduced sales as a result of lost client orders and potentially credits for prior shipments. In addition to microbiological contaminations, the potential for genetic mix-ups or mis-matings also exists and may require the restarting of the applicable colonies. While this does not require the complete clean-up, renovation and disinfection of the barrier room, it would likely result in inventory loss, additional start-up costs and possibly reduced sales. Contaminations also expose us to risks that clients will request compensation for damages in excess of our contractual indemnification requirements. There also exists a risk that contaminations from models that we produce may affect our client's facilities, with similar impact to them for which we could be liable for damages. In some cases, we may produce or import animals carrying infectious agents capable of causing disease in humans; and in the case of such a contamination or undiagnosed infection, there could be a possible risk of human exposure and infection.

We are also subject to similar contamination risks with respect to our large research models. While often we own these models, they may be maintained on our behalf at a site operated by the original provider. Accordingly, risk of contamination may be outside of our control, and we depend on the practices and protocols of third parties to ensure a contamination-free environment. A contamination may require extended CDC quarantine with subsequent reduced sales as a result of lost client orders as well as the potential for complete inventory loss and disinfection of the affected quarantine rooms. Furthermore, while we often negotiate for contractual risk indemnification, we may be exposed in the event of such contaminations if the third party does not fulfill its indemnification obligation or is unable to as a result of insolvency or other impediments.

All such contaminations described above are unanticipated and difficult to predict and could adversely impact our financial results. Many of our operations are comprised of complex mechanical systems which are subject to periodic failure, including aging fatigue. Such failures are unpredictable, and while we have made significant capital expenditures designed to create redundancy within these mechanical systems, strengthen our biosecurity, improve our operating procedures to protect against such contaminations, and replace impaired systems and equipment in advance of such events, failures and/or contaminations may still occur.

Any failure by us to comply with applicable regulations and related guidance could harm our reputation and operating results, and compliance with new regulations and guidance may result in additional costs.

Any failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of ongoing research or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities. This could harm our reputation, our prospects for future work and our operating results. For example, the issuance of a notice of objectionable observations or a warning from the FDA based on a finding of a material violation by us for GLP or cGMP requirements could materially and adversely affect us. If our operations are found to violate any applicable law or other governmental regulations, we might be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages and fines. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management's attention from the operation of our business and damage our reputation.

In addition, regulations and guidance worldwide concerning the production and use of laboratory animals for research purposes continues to be updated. Notably, the European Directive 2010/63/EU requires new standards for animal housing and accommodations that require implementation by 2017.

Some of these new standards require additional operating and capital expenses that will impact not only us and our industry competitors, but clients in the biomedical research community through both changes in the pricing of goods and services and changes in their own operations.

Similarly, guidance has been and continues to be developed for other areas that impact the biomedical research community on both a national and international basis including transportation, mandated contingency planning, euthanasia guidance, import and export requirements of biological materials, health monitoring requirements and the use of disinfectants.

Our revenue generating agreements contain termination and service reduction provisions or may otherwise terminate according to their term, which may result in less contract revenue than we anticipate.

Many of our agreements with both large and small clients, including those which underlie our strategic relationships with some of our more significant customers, provide for termination or reduction in scope with little or no notice. In addition, we sell our products and services to our competitors, and similarly they sell products and services to us. For instance, we have historically entered into, and currently are party to, contracts with certain of our competitors to distribute specialty research models in locations where our competitors may not have distribution capabilities.

Clients and/or competitors may elect to terminate their agreements with us for various reasons including:

•

the products being tested fail to satisfy safety requirements;


•

unexpected or undesired study results;

•

production problems resulting in shortages of the drug being tested;

•

a client's decision to forego or terminate a particular study;

•

establishment of alternative distribution channels by our competitors;

•

the loss of funding for the particular research study; or

•

general convenience/counterparty preference.

If a client or competitor terminates a contract with us, we are typically entitled under the terms of the contract to receive revenue earned to date as well as certain other costs and, in some cases, termination fees. Cancellation of a large contract or proximate delay, cancellation or conclusion of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business and, therefore, may adversely affect our operating results.

Many of our contracts are fixed price and may be delayed or terminated or reduced in scope for reasons beyond our control, or we may under‑price or overrun cost estimates with these contracts, potentially resulting in financial losses.

Many of our contracts provide for services on a fixed price or fee-for-service with a cap basis and, accordingly, we bear the financial risk if we initially under-price our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates. In addition, these contracts may be terminated or reduced in scope either immediately or upon notice. Cancellations may occur for a variety of reasons, and often at the discretion of the client. The loss, reduction in scope or delay of a large contract or the loss or delay of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business, although our contracts frequently entitle us to receive the costs of winding down the terminated projects, as well as all fees earned by us up to the time of termination. Some contracts also entitle us to a predetermined termination fee and irrevocably committed costs/expenses.

We could experience a breach of the confidentiality of the information we hold or of the security of our computer systems.

We operate large and complex computer systems that contain significant amounts of client data. As a routine element of our business, we collect, analyze and retain substantial amounts of data pertaining to the preclinical studies we conduct for our clients. Unauthorized third parties could attempt to gain entry to such computer systems for the purpose of stealing data or disrupting the systems. We believe that we have taken appropriate measures to protect them from intrusion, and we continue to improve and enhance our systems in this regard, but in the event that our efforts are unsuccessful we could suffer significant harm. Our contracts with our clients typically contain provisions that require us to keep confidential the information generated from these studies. In the event the confidentiality of such information was compromised, we could suffer significant harm.

Impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets may adversely impact future results of operations.

We have intangible assets, including goodwill, on our balance sheet due to our acquisitions of businesses. The initial identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition involve use of management judgments and estimates. These estimates are based on, among other factors, projections of cash flows that arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses and discount rates based on an analysis of our weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets. Disruptions in global financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could, among other things, impact the discount rate and other assumptions used in the valuations and actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows, which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such assets.

If the future growth and operating results of our business are not as strong as anticipated, overall macroeconomic or industry conditions deteriorate and/or our market capitalization declines, this could impact the assumptions used in calculating the carrying value of goodwill or other intangibles. To the extent goodwill or other intangibles are impaired, their carrying value will be written down to their implied fair value and a charge will be made to our income from continuing operations. Such an impairment charge could materially and adversely affect our operating results. As of December 26, 2015, the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangibles on our consolidated balance sheet

was

$719.6 million

.

Our business is subject to risks relating to operating internationally.

A significant part of our revenue is derived from operations outside the U.S. Our international revenues, which include revenues from our non-U.S. subsidiaries, have represented approximately one-half of our total revenue in recent years.

We expect that


international revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future. There are a number of risks associated with our international business including:

•

foreign currencies we receive for sales and in which we record expenses outside the U.S. could be subject to unfavorable exchange rates with the U.S. dollar and reduce the amount of revenue and cash flow (and increase the amount of expenses) that we recognize and cause fluctuations in reported financial results;

•

certain contracts, particularly in Canada, are frequently denominated in currencies other than the currency in which we incur expenses related to those contracts and where expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which contracts are priced, fluctuations in the relative value of those currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations;

•

general economic and political conditions in the markets in which we operate;

•

potential international conflicts, including terrorist acts;

•

potential trade restrictions, exchange controls, adverse tax consequences, and legal restrictions on the repatriation of funds into the U.S.;

•

difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations, including risks of work stoppages and/or strikes, as well as violations of local laws or anti-bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act, and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (

OECD

) Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions;

•

unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;

•

the difficulties of compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations;

•

unfavorable labor regulations in foreign jurisdictions;

•

potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of U.S. and foreign tax laws;

•

exposure to business disruption or property damage due to geographically unique natural disasters;

•

longer accounts receivable cycles in certain foreign countries; and

•

import and export licensing requirements.

These risks, individually or in the aggregate, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. For example, as mentioned above, we are subject to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our employees, distributors and agents are required to comply with these laws, we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics. The occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations.

New technologies may be developed, validated and increasingly used in biomedical research that could reduce demand for some of our products and services.

The scientific and research communities continue to explore methods to develop improved models and systems that would improve the translation of cellular and animal models to human studies and vice-versa and possibly replace or supplement the use of traditional living animals as test platforms in biomedical research. Some companies have developed techniques in these areas that may have scientific merit to improve translation between species. In addition, technological improvements to existing or new processes, such as imaging and other translational biomarker technologies, could result in the refinement and utility for the number of animal research models necessary to improve the translation from preclinical to human studies. There is an increasing push to focus on

in vitro

technologies such as human materials, stem cell technology and model creation technology. However, the increasing availability and utility of these

in vitro

models is partially offset by these technologies facilitating the creation of humanized, highly specialized and specific disease mimicking models we can produce.

It is our strategy to explore these

in vitro

technologies to refine and potentially reduce the utilization of animal models as these new methods become validated. For example, ChanTest has a well-developed program to evaluate the cardiac properties of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. We may not be successful in commercializing these methods, and, furthermore, revenues from these new models and approaches if successfully developed may not offset reduced sales or profits


from research models. In addition, alternative research methods could decrease the need for future research models, and we may not be able to develop new products effectively or in a timely manner to replace any lost sales. Lastly, other companies or entities may develop research models with characteristics different than the ones that we produce, and which may be viewed as more desirable by some of our clients.

Negative attention from special interest groups may impair our business.

The products and services which we provide our clients are essential to the drug discovery, development and manufacturing processes, and are almost universally mandated by law. Notwithstanding, certain special interest groups categorically object to the use of animals for valid research purposes. Historically, our core research model activities with rats, mice and other rodents have not been the subject of significant animal rights media attention. However, research activities with animals have been the subject of adverse attention, including shareholder proposals and attempts to disrupt air carriers from transporting research models, impacting the industry. This has included demonstrations near facilities operated by us and at our annual meetings, as well as shareholder proposals we received for some of our past Annual Meetings of Shareholders. Periodic demonstrations at our operating sites occur, particularly where large animals are situated. Any negative attention, threats or acts of vandalism directed against either our animal research activities or our third party service providers such as our airline carriers in the future could impair our ability to operate our business efficiently.

Our debt level could adversely affect our business and growth prospects.

At December 26, 2015, we had $829.4 million of debt and in connection with our plan to acquire WIL Research (See Note 16 “Subsequent Events”, included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Form 10-K), we announced our intention to increase our borrowing by approximately $350.0 million. Our debt could have significant adverse effects on our business, including making it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing on favorable terms; requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the repayment of debt and the interest on this debt; limiting our ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities; and making us more vulnerable to rising interest rates. For additional information regarding our debt, please see Note 7 “Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations”, included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

The drug discovery, development services and manufacturing support industries are highly competitive.

The drug discovery, preclinical development and manufacturing support services industries are highly competitive. We often compete for business not only with other CROs and CMOs, but also with internal discovery and development departments within our larger clients, who may have greater resources than ours. We also compete with universities and teaching hospitals for outsourced services. We compete on a variety of factors, including:

•

reputation for on-time quality performance;

•

reputation for regulatory compliance;

•

expertise and experience in multiple specialized areas;

•

scope and breadth of service and product offerings across the drug discovery and development spectrum;

•

scope and breadth of service and product offerings across the manufacturing support spectrum;

•

ability to provide flexible and customized solutions to support our clients' drug discovery, preclinical development and manufacturing support needs;

•

broad geographic availability (with consistent quality);

•

price/value;

•

technological expertise and efficient drug development processes;

•

quality of facilities;

•

financial stability;

•

size;

•

ability to acquire, process, analyze and report data in an accurate manner; and

•

accessibility of client data through secure portals.


If we do not compete successfully, our business will suffer. Increased competition might lead to price and other concessions that might adversely affect our operating results. The drug discovery and development services industry has continued to see a trend towards consolidation, particularly among the biotechnology companies, who are targets for each other and for larger pharmaceutical companies. If this trend continues, it is likely to produce more competition among the larger companies and CROs and CMOs generally, with respect to both clients and acquisition candidates. In addition, small, specialized entities considering entering the CRO industries will continue to find lower barriers to entry, and private equity firms may determine that there are opportunities to acquire and consolidate these companies, thus further increasing possible competition. More generally, our competitors or others might develop technologies, services or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our current or future technologies, services or products, or that render our technologies, services or products less competitive or obsolete. If competitors introduce superior technologies, services or products and we cannot make enhancements to ours to remain competitive, our competitive position, and in turn our business, revenue and financial condition, would be materially and adversely affected. In the aggregate, these competitive pressures may affect the attractiveness of our technologies, services or products and could adversely affect our financial results.

Potential Changes in U.S. and International Tax Law.

In the U.S., there are several proposals to reform corporate tax law that are currently under consideration. These proposals include reducing the corporate statutory tax rate, broadening the corporate tax base through the elimination or reduction of deductions, exclusions and credits, implementing a territorial regime of taxation, limiting the ability of U.S. corporations to deduct interest expense associated with offshore earnings, modifying the foreign tax credit rules, and reducing the ability to defer U.S. tax on offshore earnings. These or other changes in the U.S. tax laws could increase our effective tax rate which would affect our profitability.

We have substantial operations in Canada and the United Kingdom which currently benefit from favorable corporate tax arrangements. We receive substantial tax credits in Canada, from both the Canadian federal and Quebec governments, and the United Kingdom. Any reduction in the availability or amount of these tax credits due to tax law changes or outcomes of tax controversies could have a material adverse effect on our profits, cash flow and effective tax rate.

Currently, the OECD has developed an action plan to address concerns regarding base erosion and profit shifting (

BEPS

). This initiative has resulted in proposed and enacted changes to tax laws in various countries including France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Future changes to tax laws or interpretation of tax laws resulting from the BEPS project could increase our effective tax rate which would affect our profitability.

Contract research services create a risk of liability.

As a CRO, we face a range of potential liabilities which may include:

•

errors or omissions in reporting of study detail in preclinical studies that may lead to inaccurate reports, which may undermine the usefulness of a study or data from the study, or which may potentially advance studies absent the necessary support or inhibit studies from proceeding to the next level of testing;

•

risks associated with our possible failure to properly care for our clients' property, such as research models and samples, study compounds, records, work in progress, other archived materials, or goods and materials in transit, while in our possession;

•

risks that models in our breeding facilities or in facilities that we manage may be infected with diseases that may be harmful and even lethal to themselves or humans despite preventive measures contained in our policies for the quarantine and handling of imported animals; and

•

risks that we may have errors and omissions and/or product liabilities related to our products designed to conduct lot release testing of medical devices, injectable drugs, food, beverages and home and beauty products (primarily through our Microbial Solutions business) or in the testing of biologics and other services performed by our Biologics business, which could result in us or our clients failing to identify unsafe or contaminated materials.

While we attempt to mitigate these risks through a variety of methods, it is impossible to completely eradicate such risks. In our RMS business, we mitigate these risks to the best of our abilities through our regimen of animal testing, quarantine procedures, and veterinary staff vigilance, through which we seek to control the exposure of animal related disease or infections. In our DSA and Manufacturing businesses, we attempt to reduce these risks by contractual risk transfer provisions entitling us to be indemnified subject to a limitation of liability, by insurance maintained by our clients and/or by us, and by various regulatory requirements we must follow in connection with our business.


Contractual risk transfer indemnifications generally do not protect us against liability arising from certain of our own actions, such as negligence or misconduct. We could be materially and adversely affected if we are required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim that is outside any contractual indemnification provision, or if a party does not fulfill its indemnification obligations, or the damage is beyond the scope or level of insurance coverage. We also often contractually indemnify our clients (subject to a limitation of liability), similar to the way they indemnify us, and we may be materially adversely affected if we have to fulfill our indemnity obligations. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we nor a party required to indemnify us will be able to maintain such insurance coverage (either at all or on terms acceptable to us).

If we are not successful in selecting and integrating the businesses and technologies we acquire, or in managing our current and future divestitures, our business may suffer.

During the past fifteen years, we have steadily expanded our business through numerous acquisitions. We plan to continue to acquire businesses and technologies and form strategic alliances. However, businesses and technologies may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable. We risk spending time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition or alliance partners, but not completing transactions.

On January 6, 2016, we announced our plans to acquire WIL Research, a premier provider of safety assessment and contract development manufacturing services to biopharmaceutical, agricultural and industrial chemical companies worldwide. If consummated, this transaction will be the largest acquisition in over ten years.

Refer to Item 8, “Financial Statements and Other Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more details.

Even if completed, acquisitions and alliances involve numerous risks which may include:

•

difficulties in achieving business and financial success;

•

difficulties and expenses incurred in assimilating and integrating operations, services, products, technologies or pre-existing relationships with our customers, distributors and suppliers;

•

challenges with developing and operating new businesses, including those which are materially different from our existing businesses and which may require the development or acquisition of new internal capabilities and expertise;

•

potential losses resulting from undiscovered liabilities of acquired companies that are not covered by the indemnification we may obtain from the seller or the insurance we acquire in connection with the transaction;

•

loss of key employees;

•

the presence or absence of adequate internal controls and/or significant fraud in the financial systems of acquired companies;

•

diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;

•

acquisitions could be dilutive to earnings, or in the event of acquisitions made through the issuance of our common stock to the shareholders of the acquired company, dilutive to the percentage of ownership of our existing shareholders;

•

risks of not being able to overcome differences in foreign business practices, customs and importation regulations, language and other cultural barriers in connection with the acquisition of foreign companies;

•

new technologies and products may be developed which cause businesses or assets we acquire to become less valuable; and

•

risks that disagreements or disputes with prior owners of an acquired business, technology, service or product may result in litigation expenses and distribution of our management's attention.

In the event that an acquired business, technology or an alliance does not meet our expectations, our results of operations may be adversely affected.

Some of the same risks exist when we decide to sell a business, site, or product line. In addition, divestitures could involve additional risks, including the following:

•

difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel; and

•

the need to agree to retain or assume certain current or future liabilities in order to complete the divestiture.


We continually evaluate the performance and strategic fit of our businesses. These and any divestitures may result in significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers, or, alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices, terms and in a timely manner. We may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business, site or product line, and as a result, we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the divestiture.

Upgrading and integrating our business systems could result in implementation issues and business disruptions.

In recent years we implemented a project to replace many of our numerous legacy business systems at certain sites worldwide with an enterprise wide, integrated enterprise resource planning (

ERP

) system. The expansion of the system to other international locations may occur at a future date based on value to the business. In general, the process of planning and preparing for these types of integrated, wide-scale implementations is extremely complex and we are required to address a number of challenges including data conversion, system cutover and user training. Problems in any of these areas could cause operational problems during implementation including delayed shipments, missed sales, billing and accounting errors and other operational issues. There have been numerous, well-publicized instances of companies experiencing difficulties with the implementation of ERP systems which resulted in negative business consequences.

The drug discovery and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation, and we might be involved in costly intellectual property lawsuits.

The drug discovery and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and these lawsuits will likely continue. Accordingly, we face potential patent infringement suits by companies that have patents for similar products and methods used in business or other suits alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights. Legal proceedings relating to intellectual property could be expensive, take significant time and divert management's attention from other business concerns, whether we win or lose. If we do not prevail in an infringement lawsuit brought against us, we might have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages, and we could be required to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license to use technology on unfavorable terms.

We may not be able to successfully develop and market new services and products.

We may seek to develop and market new services and products that complement or expand our existing business or service offerings. We believe our ability to in-license new technologies from third-parties will be critical to our ability to offer new products and services to our customers. Our ability to gain access to technologies that we need for new products and services depends, in part, on our ability to convince inventors and their agents or assignees that we can successfully commercialize their inventions. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify new technologies of interest to our customers. Even if we are able to identify new technologies of interest, we may not be able to negotiate license agreements on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to develop new services and products and/or create demand for those newly developed services and products, our future business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected.

We depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel, which would harm our business.

Our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our senior management and other members of management. James C. Foster, our Chief Executive Officer since 1992 and Chairman since 2000, has held various positions with us for four decades. We have no employment agreement with Mr. Foster or other members of our non-European based senior management. If Mr. Foster or other members of senior management do not continue in their present positions, our business may suffer.

Because of the specialized scientific nature of our business, we are highly dependent upon attracting and retaining qualified scientific, technical and managerial personnel. While we have a strong record of employee retention, there is still significant competition for qualified personnel in the veterinary, pharmaceutical and biotechnology fields. Therefore, we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business. The loss of the services of existing personnel, as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific, technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner, could harm our business.

Our quarterly operating results may vary, which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock.

Our results of operations in any quarter may vary from quarter to quarter and are influenced by such factors as:

•

changes in the general global economy;


•

the number and scope of ongoing client engagements;

•

the commencement, postponement, delay, progress, completion or cancellation of client contracts in the quarter;

•

changes in the mix of our products and services;

•

competitive pricing pressures;

•

the extent of cost overruns;

•

holiday buying patterns of our clients;

•

budget cycles of our clients;

•

changes in tax laws, rules, regulations and tax rates in the locations in which we operate;

•

the timing and charges associated with completed acquisitions and other events;

•

the financial performance of the limited partnerships in which we invest;

•

the occasional extra “53rd week” that we recognize in a fiscal year (and 4th fiscal quarter thereof) due to our fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December; and

•

exchange rate fluctuations.

We believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results. Nonetheless, fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could negatively affect the market price of our common stock.

Our industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation, which can be costly

.

Our industry has a history of intellectual property litigation. On July 31, 2015, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. and IDEXX Distribution, Inc. filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging we infringed three recently issued patents related to a dried blood spot sample collection method used in determining the presence or absence of an infectious disease in a population of rodents. Legal proceedings relating to intellectual property can be expensive, take significant time and divert management’s attention from other business concerns, regardless of the outcome of the litigation. While we intend to defend against this proceeding vigorously, if we do not prevail in this lawsuit, we might be ordered to pay damages, and we could be required to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license to use the technology on unfavorable terms.

Since we do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future, our shareholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value.

We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our financial condition, capital requirements, legal requirements, earnings and other factors. Consequently, our shareholders should not rely on dividends to receive a return on their investment.

Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments

There are no unresolved comments to be reported in response to Item 1B.

Item 2.    Properties

We own or lease the land and buildings where we have facilities. We own large facilities (facilities over 50,000 square feet) for our DSA businesses in Canada, Ireland, Scotland and the United States and lease large facilities in England and the United States. We own large RMS facilities in Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, England and the United States. We own large Manufacturing segment facilities in the United States and China. None of our leases is individually material to our business operations. Many of our leases have an option to renew

,

and we believe that we will be able to successfully renew expiring leases on terms satisfactory to us.

We believe that our facilities are adequate for our operations and that suitable additional space will be available when needed. For additional information, see Note 7, “Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations” and

Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies”

included in

Item 8, “Financial Statements and Other Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Capacity at our Safety Assessment businesses within our DSA segment is primarily based on physical room infrastructure designed towards meeting specific scientific and regulatory requirements. We track room utilization on an ongoing basis and


depending on the needs of our clients at given times, we may need to execute on contingent plans for expansion, which average between six and fifteen months to complete.

We may also expand at specific sites in order to accommodate needs resulting from any consolidation strategy. We continue to employ a master site planning strategy to proactively evaluate our real estate needs. In certain circumstances, we dispose of or consolidate operations, which could result in impairment charges. In situations where the associated real estate is leased, and depending on the resolution of these situations, we may be encumbered with the remaining real estate lease obligations.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

We are not party to any material legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business that is not material to our business or financial condition.

In early May 2013, with the assistance of the law firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, we commenced an investigation of inaccurate billing with respect to certain government contracts. This issue had been reported to our senior management by a Charles River employee. We promptly reported these matters to the relevant government contracting officers, the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of the Inspector General, and the Department of Justice, and is cooperating with these agencies to ensure the proper repayment and resolution of this matter.

The investigation to date has confirmed that our RMS business segment billed the Department of Health and Human Services for certain work that had not been performed with respect to a small subset of our government contracts. It has been determined that when employees regularly assigned to work in research model barrier rooms associated with these contracts were absent, other employees' names would be substituted on time-keeping records associated with the relevant contracts. We billed the government for the hours associated with these substitute employees, despite the fact that, in many cases, these employees did not perform any services in connection with the relevant government contracts. Based on the findings of the investigation to date, we believe that this conduct was limited to our research model facilities in Raleigh, North Carolina, and Kingston, New York.  We have identified approximately $1.5 million in excess amounts billed on these contracts since January 1, 2007 and have recorded a

liability

for such amount as of December 26, 2015. Because of the ongoing discussions with the government and the complex nature of this matter, we believe it is reasonably possible that additional losses may be incurred but cannot at this time make a reasonable estimate of the potential range of loss beyond such estimated liability.

We have already taken appropriate steps to prevent this conduct from recurring, and will consider additional remedial measures following the conclusion of the investigation.

On July 31, 2015, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. and IDEXX Distribution, Inc. (collectively,

IDEXX

) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging we infringed three recently issued patents related to a blood spot sample collection method used in determining the presence or absence of an infectious disease in a population of rodents. On September 21, 2015, we timely filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that all of the claims are directed to unpatentable subject matter and therefore are invalid. On October 7, 2015, IDEXX filed an amended complaint which substantially asserts the same patents and infringement allegations as asserted in the original complaint and, on October 26, 2015, we timely filed a motion to dismiss this amended complaint. While no prediction may be made as to the outcome of litigation, we intend to defend against this proceeding vigorously and therefore an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made.

The following table provides information relating to our purchases of shares of our common stock during the fourth quarter of 2015:

In July 2010, our Board of Directors authorized a $500.0 million stock repurchase program, and subsequently approved increases to the stock repurchase program of $250.0 million in the fiscal year 2010, $250.0 million in the fiscal year 2013 and $150.0 million in the fiscal year 2014, for an aggregate authorization of $1,150.0 million. During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2015, we did not repurchase any shares of common stock under our Rule 10b5-1 Purchase Plan and in open market trading.


Additionally, our stock-based compensation plans permit the netting of common stock upon vesting of restricted stock, performance share units, and restricted stock units in order to satisfy individual minimum statutory tax withholding requirements.

Comparison of 5-Year Cumulative Total Return

The following stock performance graph compares the annual percentage change in the Company’s cumulative total shareholder return on its common stock during a period commencing on December 25, 2010 and ending on December 26, 2015 (as measured by dividing (1) the sum of (A) the cumulative amount of dividends for the measurement period, assuming dividend reinvestment, and (B) the difference between the Company’s share price at the end and the beginning of the measurement period; by (2) the share price at the beginning of the measurement period) with the cumulative total return of the S&P 500 Index, the S&P 500 Health Care Index, and the NASDAQ Pharmaceutical Index during such period. The Company has not paid any dividends on the common stock, and no dividends are included in the representation of the Company’s performance. The stock price performance on the graph below is not necessarily indicative of future price performance. The graph is not “soliciting material,” is not deemed filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is not to be incorporated by reference in any filing of the Company under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, whether made before or after the date hereof and irrespective of any general incorporation language in any such filing. Information used in the graph was obtained from Standards & Poor’s Institutional Market Services, a source believed to be reliable, but the Company is not responsible for any errors or omissions in such information.

In the fiscal year 2015, the Company changed from the NASDAQ Pharmaceutical to the S&P 500 Health Care index because the companies which comprise the S&P 500 Health Care index better reflect the Company’s current size and businesses.

Overview

We are a full service, early-stage contract research organization (CRO). For nearly 70 years, we have been in the business of providing the research models required in research and development of new drugs, devices, and therapies. Over this time, we have built upon our original core competency of laboratory animal medicine and science (research model technologies) to develop a diverse portfolio of discovery and safety assessment services, both Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and non-GLP, which are able to support our clients from target identification through preclinical development. We also provide a suite of products and services to support our clients’ manufacturing activities. Utilizing our broad portfolio of products and services enables our clients to create a more flexible drug development model, which reduces their costs, enhances their productivity and effectiveness, and increases speed to market.

Our client base includes all of the major global pharmaceutical companies, many biotechnology companies, CROs, agricultural and industrial chemical companies, life science companies, veterinary medicine companies, contract manufacturing organizations, medical device companies, and diagnostic and other commercial entities, as well as leading hospitals, academic institutions and government agencies around the world. We currently operate approximately 64 facilities in 18 countries worldwide, which numbers exclude our Insourcing Solutions (IS) sites.

Business Trends

The demand for our outsourced services increased in the fiscal year 2015, as did demand for products and services to support our clients’ manufacturing activities. Our pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients continued to intensify their use of strategic outsourcing to improve their operating efficiency and access capabilities that they do not maintain internally. Many of our large biopharmaceutical clients have refocused on their drug discovery and early-stage development efforts, after a period of greater emphasis on delivering late-stage programs to bring new drugs to market. In addition, small and mid-size biopharmaceutical clients benefited from the continued strength in the biotechnology funding environment in the fiscal year 2015, from capital markets partnering with large biopharmaceutical companies, and investment by venture capital. Academia has also benefited from partnering activities, as large biopharmaceutical companies have increasingly utilized academic research capabilities to broaden the scope of their research activities.

The primary result of these trends was improved demand for our discovery and safety assessment services in the fiscal year 2015, particularly from biotechnology clients. This improvement led to capacity continuing to fill in our safety assessment facilities which were open during 2015, and in which utilization approached optimal levels. Price also improved moderately in the fiscal year 2015, as industry capacity utilization continued to increase. We believe our scientific expertise, quality, and responsiveness remain key criteria when our clients make the decision to outsource to us. In order to accommodate this increased demand and maintain responsiveness to clients’ needs, we opened small amounts of new capacity in the fiscal year 2015 at existing facilities and reopened our Charles River Massachusetts facility in the first quarter of 2016. Charles River Massachusetts will provide additional capacity for early-stage drug research services and is strategically located near the Boston/Cambridge biotechnology hub.

Demand for our products and services that support our clients’ manufacturing activities was also robust in the fiscal year 2015. Our Biologics Testing Solutions (Biologics) business continued to benefit from increased demand for services associated with the growing proportion of biologic drugs in the pipeline and on the market. Demand for our Microbial Solutions (formerly Endotoxin and Microbial Detection, or EMD) business also remained strong as we addressed manufacturers’ requirements for a comprehensive rapid microbial testing solution. To further enhance our rapid testing portfolio, we acquired Celsis in the fiscal year 2015 to expand in the non-sterile quality control testing market.

Our clients’ intensified focus on the earliest stages of their pipelines has been visible in increasing demand for discovery services, and the willingness to outsource new areas of their research programs. To address these emerging needs and move further upstream in the drug research and development continuum, we have significantly enhanced our Discovery Services capabilities over the past two years to enable us to work with clients at the earliest stages of the discovery process. We acquired


the Discovery Services businesses of Argenta, BioFocus, ChanTest, and VivoPath in the fiscal year 2014, and Oncotest in the fiscal year 2015. Our full service, early-stage portfolio continued to lead to additional client discussions in the fiscal year 2015 regarding strategic relationships, where clients seek to outsource larger portions of their early-stage drug research programs to us.

Demand for research models and certain services began to stabilize in the fiscal year 2015, particularly in North America and Europe. Clients’ efforts to consolidate infrastructure and seek greater pipeline productivity have begun to moderate as these initiatives generate the desired benefits. We remain confident in the long-term drivers of this business because research models and services remain essential tools for our clients’ drug discovery and early-stage development efforts.

Acquisitions

During the fiscal year 2015, we continued to make a number of strategic acquisitions designed to expand our portfolio of services to support the drug discovery and early-stage development continuum and position us as a market leader in the outsourced discovery services market. The 2015 acquisitions include:

•

In May 2015, we acquired Sunrise Farms, Inc. (Sunrise), a producer of specific-pathogen-free fertile chicken eggs and chickens used in the manufacture of live viruses. The purpose of this business acquisition was to expand the capabilities of our existing Avian Vaccine Services (Avian) business. The purchase price of the acquisition was $9.6 million.

•

In July 2015, we acquired Celsis Group Limited (Celsis), a leading provider of rapid testing systems for non-sterile bacterial contamination for the biopharmaceutical and consumer products industries. The purpose of this acquisition was to enhance our portfolio of rapid microbial detection products and services with the addition of a rapid bioburden testing product. The purchase price for Celsis was $214.5 million.

•

In November 2015, we acquired Oncotest GmbH (Oncotest), a CRO providing discovery services for oncology, one of the largest therapeutic areas for biopharmaceutical research and development spending. The purpose of this acquisition was to expand our oncology services capabilities, enabling us to provide clients with access to a more comprehensive portfolio of technologies, including patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and syngeneic models. The preliminary purchase price for Oncotest was $36.0 million.

On January 6, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire WRH, Inc. (WIL Research), a premier provider of safety assessment and contract development and manufacturing services to biopharmaceutical and agricultural and industrial chemical companies worldwide. Acquiring WIL Research will enhance our position as a leading global early-stage CRO by strengthening our ability to partner with global clients across the drug discovery and development continuum. The transaction is expected to close early in the second quarter of 2016, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. The preliminary purchase price will be approximately $585.0 million in cash, subject to customary closing adjustments. The acquisition and associated fees are expected to be financed through an expansion of our credit facility and cash. In the event the agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay WIL Research a termination fee of $17.5 million.

Segment Reporting

In the second quarter of 2014, following our acquisition of Argenta and BioFocus, we revised our reportable segments to ensure alignment with our view of the business. We reviewed the new and existing markets addressed by the business, the recently revised go-to-market strategy, long-term operating margins, and the discrete financial information available to our Chief Operating Decision Maker, and considered how our businesses aggregated based on these qualitative and quantitative factors. Based on this review, we identified three reportable segments: Research Models and Services (RMS), Discovery and Safety Assessment (DSA), and Manufacturing Support (Manufacturing). We reported segment results on this basis for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.


The revised reportable segments are as follows:

Our RMS segment includes the Research Models and Research Model Services businesses. Research Models includes the commercial production and sale of small research models, as well as the supply of large research models. Research Model Services includes three business units: GEMS, which performs contract breeding and other services associated with genetically engineered research models; RADS, which provides health monitoring and diagnostics services related to research models; and IS, which provides management of our clients’ research operations (including recruitment, training, staffing, and management services). Our DSA segment includes services required to take a drug through the early development process including discovery services, which are non-regulated services to assist clients with the identification, screening, and selection of a lead compound for drug development, and regulated and non-regulated safety assessment services. Our Manufacturing segment includes Microbial Solutions, which includes

in vitro

(non-animal) lot-release testing products and microbial detection, conventional and rapid quality control testing of sterile and non-sterile biopharmaceutical and consumer products and species identification services; Biologics, which performs specialized testing of biologics; and Avian, which supplies specific-pathogen-free fertile chicken eggs and chickens.

Prior to recasting the reportable segments, the businesses were reported in two segments as follows:

Fiscal Quarters

Our fiscal quarters consists of the 3 months ending on the last Saturday on, or prior to, March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S.). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods and related disclosures. These estimates and assumptions are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on our historical experience, trends in the industry, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We believe that our application of the following accounting policies, each of which require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management, are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1, “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”, to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.


We believe the following represent our critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements:

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been provided, our price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.

Service revenue is generally evidenced by client contracts, which range in duration from a few weeks to a few years and typically take the form of an agreed upon rate per unit or fixed fee arrangements. Such contracts typically do not contain acceptance provisions based upon the achievement of certain study or laboratory testing results. Revenue of agreed upon rate per unit contracts is recognized as services are performed, based upon rates specified in the contract. In cases where performance spans reporting periods, revenue of fixed fee contracts is recognized as services are performed, measured on the ratio of outputs or performance obligations completed to the total contractual outputs or performance obligations to be provided. Changes in estimated effort to complete the fixed fee contract are reflected in the period in which the change becomes known. Changes in scope of work are common, especially under long-term contracts, and generally result in a change in contract value. Once the parties have agreed to the changes in scope and renegotiated pricing terms, the contract value is amended and revenue is typically recognized as described above.

Most contracts are terminable by the client, either immediately or upon notice. These contracts often require payment to us of expenses to wind down the project, fees earned to date or, in some cases, a termination fee. Such payments are included in revenues when earned.

We recognize product revenue, net of allowances for estimated returns, rebates and discounts, when title and risk of loss pass to customers. When we sell equipment with specified acceptance criteria, we assess our ability to meet the acceptance criteria in order to determine the timing of revenue recognition. We would defer revenue until completion of customer acceptance testing if we are not able to demonstrate the ability to meet such acceptance criteria.

A portion of our revenue is from multiple-element arrangements that include multiple products and/or services as deliverables in a single arrangement, with each deliverable, or a combination of the deliverables, representing a separate unit of accounting. We allocate revenues to each element in a multiple-element arrangement based upon the relative selling price of each deliverable. Revenue allocated to each deliverable is then recognized when all revenue recognition criteria are met. Judgments as to the identification of deliverables, units of accounting, the allocation of consideration to the deliverable, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are critical with respect to these arrangements.

At the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether (a) the consideration is commensurate with either (1) our performance to achieve the milestone, or (2) the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone; (b) the consideration relates solely to past performance; and (c) the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement.

We evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone, the level of effort and investment required and whether the milestone consideration is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement in making this assessment.

If a substantive milestone is achieved and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured, we recognize revenue related to the milestone in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved.

If we were to achieve milestones that we consider substantive under any of our revenue arrangements, we may experience significant fluctuations in our revenue from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on the timing of achieving such substantive milestones.

In those circumstances where a milestone is not substantive, we recognize as revenue, on the date the milestone is achieved, an amount equal to the applicable percentage of the performance period that had elapsed as of the date the milestone was achieved, with the balance being deferred and recognized over the remaining period of performance. As of December 26, 2015, we had no significant milestones that were deemed substantive.

Income Taxes

We prepare and file income tax returns based on our interpretation of each jurisdiction’s tax laws and regulations. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. Significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred


tax assets. In performing this assessment, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. In making this determination, under the applicable financial accounting standards, we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and the effects of tax planning strategies. In the event that actual results differ from our estimates, we adjust our estimates in future periods and we may need to establish a valuation allowance, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.

We account for uncertain tax positions using a “more-likely-than-not” threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions. We evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and consider various factors, that include, but are not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, information obtained during in process audit activities and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position. We adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions. Our liabilities for uncertain tax positions can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations, the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the “more-likely-than-not” threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the examination process. We consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures, including all appeals and administrative reviews; we have no plans to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position; and we believe that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would re-examine the related tax position. We also accrue for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

As of December 26, 2015, our non-U.S. subsidiaries’ undistributed foreign earnings included in consolidated retained earnings were $547.6 million. As of the end of fiscal year 2015, our policy with respect to the undistributed earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries is to maintain an indefinite reinvestment assertion as they are required to fund needs outside of the U.S. and cannot be repatriated in a manner that is substantially tax-free. This assertion is made on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis and takes into account the liquidity requirements in both the U.S. and within our foreign subsidiaries. If we decide to repatriate funds to the U.S. in the future to execute our growth initiatives or to fund any other liquidity needs, the resulting tax consequences could negatively impact our results of operations through a higher effective tax rate and dilution of our earnings. On December 18, 2015, the U.S. enacted the Consolidated Appropriations Act, which provides for a reinstatement and extension of the controlled foreign corporation look-through rules through the fiscal year 2019. This rule allows us to access Chinese and Canadian cash in a more tax-efficient manner and utilize the cash outside of the U.S. without triggering residual U.S. tax. As such, we will begin accruing foreign withholding taxes to reflect this change for the years in which the rules are reinstated.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

We use assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of our acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. We utilize commonly accepted valuation techniques, such as the income approach and the cost approach, as appropriate, in establishing the fair value of intangible assets. Typically, key assumptions include projections of cash flows that arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses as well as discount rates based on an analysis of our weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets.

We review definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset.

We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually, during the fourth quarter, and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset-related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors. Different assumptions from those made in our analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and our evaluation of goodwill for impairment.


We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. If we elect this option and believe, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the carrying value of goodwill is not recoverable, the quantitative two-step impairment test is required; otherwise, no further testing is required. Alternatively, we may elect to not first assess qualitative factors and immediately perform the quantitative two-step impairment test. In the first step, we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values. If the carrying values of the net assets assigned to the reporting units exceed the fair values of the reporting units, then the second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of our goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference.

In the fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, we performed the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test for our reporting units. Fair value was determined by using a weighted combination of a market-based approach and an income approach, as this combination was deemed to be the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants. Under the market-based approach, we utilized information about our Company as well as publicly available industry information to determine earnings multiples and sales multiples that are used to value our reporting units. Under the income approach, we determined fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn.

Our 2015, 2014 and 2013 impairment test indicated that goodwill and other intangible assets were not impaired.

In 2014, we revised our reportable segments to align with our new view of the business following the Argenta and BioFocus acquisition. As a result of this reorganization, goodwill was allocated from our prior reportable segments to our new reportable segments based on the fair value of each business group within its original reporting unit relative to the fair value of that reporting unit. In addition, we completed an assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for all reporting units immediately prior to the reallocation and determined that no impairment existed.

Valuation and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets to be held and used, including property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, the following:

•

significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;

•

significant negative industry or economic trends; or

•

significant changes or developments in strategy or operations that negatively affect the utilization of our long-lived assets.

Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset, net of any sublease income, if applicable, and its eventual disposition. In the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets, the assets are written-down to their fair values. We measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model. Significant judgments are required to estimate future cash flows, including the selection of appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. We may also estimate fair value based on market prices for similar assets, as appropriate. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for these assets. During the fiscal year 2015, we did not record any significant impairment charges to long-lived assets.

Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans

Several of our U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. We recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability. This amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. We measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of our fiscal year end.

The cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease. Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the expected return on plan assets, withdrawal and mortality rates, discount rate, and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. Assumptions are determined based on our


data and appropriate market indicators, and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement date. Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligations. In determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, we consider the relative weighting of plan assets, the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance.

The discount rate reflects the rate we would have to pay to purchase high-quality investments that would provide cash sufficient to settle our current pension obligations. Beginning in the fiscal year 2014, we have employed the discount rate based on a cash-flow matching analysis using Towers Watson’s proprietary Bond:Link tool.  Prior to the fiscal year 2014, we employed a cash-flow matching methodology, which used the spot yield curve underlying the Citigroup Index. The refined estimation technique permits us to more closely match cash flows to the expected payments to participants than would be possible with the previously used yield curve model. We believe such a refinement results in an estimate of the discount rate that more accurately reflects the settlement value for plan obligations than the yield curve methodology used in prior years, as it provides the ability to review the quality and diversification of the portfolio to select the bond issues that would settle the obligation in an optimal manner. This refinement reduced our benefit obligations as of December 27, 2014 by $5.5 million.

The rate of compensation increase reflects the expected annual salary increases for the plan participants based on historical experience and the current employee compensation strategy.

In the fiscal year 2014, for our U.K. and U.S. plans, we adopted newly released mortality tables and mortality improvement scales for measurement of retirement plan obligations, which increased our benefit obligations by $7.9 million as of December 27, 2014. In the fiscal year 2015, new mortality improvement scales were issued in the U.S. and the U.K. reflecting a decline in longevity projection from the 2014 releases that we adopted, which decreased our benefit obligations by $3.3 million as of December 26, 2015.

Stock-Based Compensation

We grant stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance share units (PSUs) to employees, and stock options and restricted stock to non-employee directors under stock-based compensation plans. We make certain assumptions in order to value and record expense associated with awards made under our stock-based compensation arrangements. Changes in these assumptions may lead to variability with respect to the timing and amount of expense we recognize in connection with share-based payments.

Determining the appropriate valuation model and related assumptions requires judgment. The fair value of stock options granted is calculated using the Black-Scholes model and the fair value of PSUs is calculated using a lattice model with a Monte Carlo simulation, both of which require the use of subjective assumptions including volatility and expected term, among others.

Determining the appropriate amount to expense based on the anticipated achievement of PSU’s performance targets requires judgment, including forecasting the achievement of future financial targets. The estimate of expense is revised periodically based on the probability of achieving the required performance targets. The cumulative impact of any changes to our estimates is reflected in the period of change.

We also estimate forfeitures over the requisite service period when recognizing share-based compensation expense based on historical rates and forward looking factors; these estimates are adjusted to the extent that actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to materially differ, from our estimates.

Amortization of intangibles for the fiscal year


was

$24.2 million

, a decrease of

$1.8 million

, or 6.7%, from

$26.0 million

for the fiscal year


, due primarily to certain intangibles acquired in connection with several Discovery Services and Safety Assessment businesses becoming fully amortized and the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by an increase due to recent acquisitions, primarily Argenta, BioFocus, ChanTest, Sunrise, Celsis and Oncotest.

Interest Income

Interest income, which represents earnings on held cash, cash equivalents, and time deposits was

$1.0 million

for the fiscal year


, a decrease of

$0.2 million

, or

9.4%

, compared to

$1.2 million

for the fiscal year


.

Interest Expense

Interest expense for the fiscal year


was

$15.1 million

, an increase of

$3.1 million

, or

26.1%

, compared to

$12.0 million

for the fiscal year


. The increase was due primarily to the write-off of a portion of debt issuance costs in connection with the modification of our $970M Credit Facility in April 2015, interest expense related to new capital leases, and overall higher average debt due to additional borrowings related to business acquisitions.

Other Income (Expense), Net

Other income (expense), net was a net other income of

$3.0 million

for the fiscal year


, a decrease of

$7.7 million

, or

71.9%

, compared to a net other income of

$10.7 million

for the fiscal year


. The decrease in other income (expense), net was driven by a decrease of $10.4 million due to a reversal of the indemnification asset associated with a pre-acquisition tax position and corresponding unrecognized tax benefit; a decrease of $5.5 million in income from our investments in limited partnerships accounted for under the equity method; and the absence of a noncash gain of $2.1 million related to assets assumed at our Frederick, Maryland, facility following the termination of a customer contract, which was recorded in the fiscal year 2014;  partially offset by a bargain purchase gain of $9.8 million associated with the acquisition of Sunrise and an increase of $0.5 million from other activity.

Income Taxes

Income tax expense

was

$43.4 million

for the fiscal year


,

a decrease

of

$4.3 million

, compared to

$47.7 million

for the fiscal year 2014

. Our effective tax rate was

22.2%

in the fiscal year


, compared to

26.8%

in the fiscal year


. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $10.4 million reduction in unrecognized tax benefits and related interest due to the expiration of the statute of limitations associated with pre-acquisition tax positions on the forgiveness of debt and a non-taxable bargain purchase gain of $9.8 million associated with the acquisition of Sunrise. These benefits were offset by a tax accrual of $6.6 million

of withholding taxes in order to access cash from our Canadian and Chinese operations for use outside of the U.S

.

Fiscal Year


Compared to Fiscal Year


Revenue

Revenue for the fiscal year 2014 increased $132.2 million, or 11.3%, compared with the fiscal year 2013.

The negative effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased revenue by

$1.7 million, or 0.1%, when compared to the prior period.

RMS revenue decreased $3.9 million due to lower research models services and research models revenue, primarily in Japan and Europe. Additionally, the fiscal year 2013 included a $1.5 million revenue adjustment related to inaccurate billings with respect to certain government contracts. See Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies.”


DSA revenue increased $105.8 million due to an increase in the Discovery Services business, which included the Argenta and BioFocus acquisition that contributed $71.4 million to revenue growth, as well as higher revenue in the Safety Assessment business.

Manufacturing revenue increased $30.3 million, driven by broad-based growth across all three businesses, particularly the Microbial Solutions business.

Service revenue for the fiscal year 2014 was $797.8 million, an increase of $108.6 million, or 15.8%, compared to $689.2 million for the fiscal year 2013. The increase in service revenue was due to the acquisition of Argenta and BioFocus that contributed $68.9 million to service revenue growth, as well as higher revenue in the Safety Assessment business, primarily driven by increased volume.

Product revenue for the fiscal year 2014 was $499.9 million, an increase of $23.5 million, or 4.9%, compared to $476.4 million for the fiscal year 2013. The increase was due to growth in our Manufacturing businesses, particularly Microbial Solutions, and the acquisition of Argenta and BioFocus that contributed $2.5 million to product revenue growth.

Cost of Products Sold and Services Provided (Excluding Amortization of Intangible Assets)

Costs for the fiscal year 2014 increased $54.4 million, or 7.1%, compared with the fiscal year 2013. Costs as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year 2014 were 63.6%, a decrease of 2.5%, from 66.1% for the fiscal year 2013. The costs above include asset impairments, which were previously presented separately in our consolidated statement of income.

RMS costs decreased $14.6 million, primarily the result of lower accelerated depreciation expense associated with global efficiency initiatives in our research models business. RMS costs as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year 2014 were 62.5%, a decrease of 2.4%, from 64.9% for the fiscal year 2013, the result of global efficiency initiatives in our research models business.

DSA costs increased $61.7 million due to a $49.1 million increase in Discovery Services costs, which includes a higher cost base due to the Argenta and BioFocus acquisition, and a $12.6 million increase in Safety Assessment costs, as a result of increased revenues. DSA costs as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year 2014 were 72.0%, a decrease of 3.3%, from 75.3% for the fiscal year 2013, as a result of leverage of fixed costs from higher revenues.

Manufacturing costs increased $7.3 million, primarily as a result of higher revenue for each of our Manufacturing businesses. Manufacturing costs as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year 2014 were 47.8%, a decrease of 3.2%, from 51.0% for the fiscal year 2013, as a result of leverage of fixed costs from higher revenue.

Costs of services provided for the fiscal year 2014 was $558.6 million, an increase of $60.7 million, or 12.2%, compared to $497.9 million for the fiscal year 2013. The increase was due to a higher cost base as a result of the acquisition of Argenta and BioFocus, and increased costs in the Safety Assessment business as a result of increased revenue. Costs of products sold for the fiscal year 2014 was $266.4 million, a decrease of $6.4 million, or 2.3%, compared to $272.8 million for the fiscal year 2013. The decrease was primarily due to lower accelerated depreciation expense associated with global efficiency initiatives in our research models business; partially offset by growth in our Manufacturing business and a higher costs base due to the acquisition of Argenta and BioFocus.


Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

SG&A for the fiscal year 2014 increased $43.3 million, or 19.2%, compared with the fiscal year 2013. SG&A as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year 2014 was 20.7%, an increase of 1.3%, from 19.4% for the fiscal year 2013.

The increase in RMS SG&A of $6.2 million was related to an increase of $2.5 million in compensation, benefits and other employee related expenses; the recording of $1.6 million in charges related to an arbitration award in favor of a large model supplier; an increase of $0.5 million in severance due to consolidation plans in the U.S. and Japan; and an increase of $2.6 million in other expenses; partially offset by a decrease of $1.0 million due to a gain on the sale of a facility impacted by a consolidation plan. RMS SG&A as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year 2014 was 13.0%, an increase of 1.3%, from 11.7% for the fiscal year 2013.

The increase in DSA SG&A of $13.4 million was related to an increase of $5.5 million in compensation, benefits and other employee related expenses; an increase of $1.9 million in severance; an increase of $1.2 million in operating expenses including information technology infrastructure and facility expenses; an increase of $0.8 million in stock-based compensation, primarily related to our new hire grants and our annual stock-based grants made in February 2014; and an increase of $4.0 million in other expenses; all of which were primarily due to the Argenta and BioFocus acquisition. DSA SG&A as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year 2014 was 11.7%, an increase of 0.2%, from 11.5% for the fiscal year 2013.

The increase in Manufacturing SG&A of $5.6 million was related to an increase of $3.8 million in compensation, benefits and other employee related expenses; an increase of $1.8 million in operating expenses including information technology infrastructure and facility expenses; and an increase of $0.5 million in stock-based compensation, primarily related to our new hire grants and our annual stock-based grants made in February 2014; partially offset by a decrease of $0.5 million in other expenses. Manufacturing SG&A as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year 2014 was 18.9%, consistent with the fiscal year 2013.

The increase in unallocated corporate SG&A of $18.1 million was related to an increase of $7.4 million in compensation, benefits and other employee related expenses; an increase of $5.1 million of stock-based compensation, primarily related to our new hire grants; our annual stock-based grants made in February 2014 and increased expense recognized for performance share units whose payout is based upon our financial performance; an increase of $4.8 million in external consulting and other service expenses; an increase of $4.5 million of costs associated with the evaluation and integration of acquisitions; and an increase of $1.4 million in other expenses; partially offset by a reduction of $5.1 million in information technology related expenses.

Amortization of Intangible Assets

Amortization of intangibles for the fiscal year 2014 was $26.0 million, an increase of $8.2 million, or 46.1%, from $17.8 million for the fiscal year 2013, primarily as a result of the Argenta and BioFocus acquisition.

Interest Income

Interest income, which represents earnings on held cash, cash equivalents, and time deposits, was $1.2 million for the fiscal year 2014, an increase of $0.5 million, or 71.4%, compared to $0.7 million for the fiscal year 2013.

Interest Expense

Interest expense for the fiscal year 2014 was $12.0 million, a decrease of $9.0 million, or 42.9%, compared to $21.0 million for the fiscal year 2013. The decrease was primarily the result of the retirement of our senior convertible debentures late in the second quarter of the fiscal year 2013, which lowered our effective interest rate.

Other Income (Expense), Net

Other income (expense), net was $10.7 million for the fiscal year 2014, an increase of $3.5 million, or 48.6%, compared to $7.2 million for the fiscal year 2013. The increase in other income (expense), net was driven by our investments in limited partnerships accounted for under the equity method, which increased $3.4 million, and a non-cash gain of $2.1 million related to assets assumed at our Frederick, Maryland facility following the termination of a customer contract, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange and other activity of $2.0 million.


Income Taxes

Income tax expense in the fiscal year 2014 increased $14.8 million, compared with the fiscal year 2013. Our effective tax rate was 26.8% in the fiscal year 2014, compared to 23.8% in the fiscal year 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to current-year tax law changes, including a statutory 25% decrease in the Canadian Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) credit and an increase in the limitation of deductibility of interest expense in France. In addition, the effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2014 reflected a discrete tax cost of $1.6 million related to the nondeductible transaction costs incurred in the fiscal year 2014 for the acquisition of the Early Discovery businesses and a discrete tax cost of $1.2 million related to the write-off of deferred tax assets as a result of the reorganization of the Company’s RMS U.K. entities. These increases were partially offset by a $2.1 million release of an uncertain tax position resulting from an ability to offset tax on a capital gain from an investment in a limited partnership. The fiscal year 2013 effective tax rate included a discrete tax detriment of $2.0 million related to the ongoing transfer pricing controversy with the Canadian Revenue Authority (CRA).

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We currently require cash to fund our working capital needs, pension obligations, capital expansion, acquisitions, and to pay our debt obligations. Our principal sources of liquidity have been our cash flows from operations, supplemented by long-term borrowings. Based on our current business plan, we believe that our existing funds, when combined with cash generated from operations and our access to financing resources, are sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future.

The following table presents our cash, cash equivalents and investments held by U.S. and non-U.S. entities:

Borrowings

In April, 2015, we amended and restated our $970M Credit Facility, creating a $1.3 billion facility ($1.3B Credit Facility) that provides for a $400.0 million term loan facility and a $900.0 million multi-currency revolving facility. The term loan facility matures in 20 quarterly installments with the last installment due April 22, 2020. The revolving facility matures on April 22, 2020 and requires no scheduled payment before that date. The interest rates applicable to term loans and revolving loans under our credit agreement are, at our option, equal to either the alternate base rate (which is the higher of (1) the prime rate, (2) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, or (3) the one-month adjusted LIBOR rate plus 1%), or the adjusted LIBOR rate plus an interest rate margin based upon our leverage ratio.

Amounts outstanding under the $1.3B Credit Facility were as follows as of

December 26, 2015

and

December 27, 2014

:

In connection with our plan to acquire WIL Research, we entered into a commitment letter, pursuant to which our existing credit facility will be expanded to make available to us up to an additional $350.0 million in debt financing.

Repurchases of Common Stock

In

July 2010

, our Board of Directors authorized a

$500.0 million

stock repurchase program, and subsequently approved increases for an aggregate authorization of

$1,150.0 million

. During the fiscal year


, we repurchased approximately

1.5 million

shares at a cost of

$108.8 million

. As of

December 26, 2015

, we had

$69.7 million

remaining on the authorized stock


repurchase program.

Our stock-based compensation plans permit the netting of common stock upon vesting of restricted stock, performance share units, and restricted stock units in order to satisfy individual minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. During the fiscal year


, we acquired approximately 0.1 million shares for $8.7 million.

Cash Flows

The following table presents our net cash provided by operating activities:

Cash flows from operating activities represent the cash receipts and disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting our income from continuing operations for (1) non-cash operating items such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, gains (losses) on investments in limited partnerships and gains on bargain purchases, as well as (2) changes in operating assets and liabilities, which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in our results of operations. The increases in cash provided by operating activities from the fiscal year 2014 to 2015 and from the fiscal year 2013 to 2014 were primarily driven by higher income from continuing operations and changes in assets and liabilities. Our days sales outstanding, which includes deferred revenue as an offset to accounts receivable in the calculation, was 51 days as of December 26, 2015, compared to 52 days as of December 27, 2014 and 56 days as of December 28, 2013.

The following table presents our net cash used in investing activities:

The primary use of cash in investing activities in the fiscal year


was related to our acquisitions, primarily Celsis for $202.0 million, net of cash acquired; Oncotest for $35.2 million, net of cash acquired; and Sunrise for $9.6 million, net of cash acquired, as well as our capital expenditures. The primary use of cash in the fiscal year


was related to our acquisitions, primarily Argenta and BioFocus for $182.5 million, net of cash acquired; and ChanTest for $51.1 million, net of cash acquired, as well as our capital expenditures. The primary use of cash in the fiscal year


was our acquisition of 75% of Vital River for

$24.2 million

, net of cash acquired, and of a Microbial Solutions products and service provider in Singapore for

$4.9 million

.


The following table presents our net cash provided by (used in) financing activities:

For the fiscal year


, cash provided by financing activities reflected net borrowings of $75.2 million and proceeds from exercises of employee stock options of $39.3 million, partially offset by treasury stock purchases of $117.5 million made pursuant to our authorized stock repurchase program. For the fiscal year


, cash provided by financing activities reflected net borrowings of

$104.4 million

and proceeds from exercises of employee stock options of

$73.7 million

, partially offset by treasury stock purchases of

$122.0 million

made pursuant to our authorized stock repurchase program. For the fiscal year


, cash used in financing activities reflected net debt repayments of

$11.5 million

and treasury stock purchases of

$165.9 million

, partially offset by proceeds from exercises of employee stock options of

$93.8 million

.

Contractual Commitments and Obligations

Minimum future payments of our contractual obligations as of

December 26, 2015

are as follows:

(1)

Notes payable includes the principal payments on our debt.

(2)

We lease properties and equipment for use in our operations. In addition to rent, the leases may require us to pay additional amounts for taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses. Amounts reflected within the table, detail future minimum rental commitments under non-cancellable operating leases for each of the periods presented.

(3)

The estimated cash obligation for redeemable noncontrolling interest, which is exercisable by the non-controlling interest holders in 2016 at fair value, is based on the estimated fair value of the interest as of

December 26, 2015

.

(4)

The timing of the remaining capital commitment payments to limited partnerships is subject to the procedures of the limited partnerships; the above table reflects the earliest possible date the payment can be required under the relevant agreements.

(5)

In connection with business acquisitions, we agreed to make additional payments of up to $3.3 million based upon the achievement of certain financial targets. The contingent consideration obligation included in the table above has not been probability adjusted or discounted.

The above table excludes obligations related to our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. Refer to Item 8, “Financial Statements and Other Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more details.

Tax Related Obligations

We excluded liabilities pertaining to uncertain tax positions from our summary of contractual obligations presented above, as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. As of

December 26, 2015

, we had

$23.3 million

of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions.


Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of December 26, 2015, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act, except as disclosed below.

WIL Research

On January 6, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire WIL Research. In the event the agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay WIL Research a termination fee of $17.5 million. Refer to Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more details.

Investments in Limited Partnerships

We invest in several venture capital limited partnerships that invest in start-up companies, primarily in the life sciences industry. Our total commitment to these entities as of December 26, 2015 was $65.0 million, of which we had funded $28.8 million as of December 26, 2015. Refer to Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more details.

Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates, which could affect our future results of operations and financial condition. We manage our exposure to these risks through our regular operating and financing activities.

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing financing activities. As of

December 26, 2015

, our debt portfolio was comprised primarily of floating interest rate borrowings. A 100-basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual pre-tax interest expense by approximately

$8.4 million

.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We operate on a global basis and have exposure to some foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

While the financial results of our global activities are reported in U.S. dollars, our foreign subsidiaries typically conduct their operations in their respective local currency.

The principal functional currencies of the company’s foreign subsidiaries are the Euro, British Pound and C

anadian Dollar. During the fiscal year 2015, the most significant drivers of foreign currency translation adjustment the Company recorded as part of comprehensive income were the Euro and Canadian Dollar, and to a lesser extent, the British Pound.

Fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates of the countries in which we do business will affect our

financial position, results of operations, and cash flows

, often in ways that are difficult to predict. In particular, as the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, the value of our non-U.S. revenue

, expenses, assets, liabilities and cash flows

will

generally

decline when reported in U.S. dollars. The impact to net income as a result of a U.S. dollar strengthening will be partially mitigated by the value of non-U.S. expense, which will also decline when reported in U.S. dollars. As the U.S. dollar weakens versus other currencies, the value of the non-U.S. revenue and expenses

,

assets, liabilities, and cash flows

will

generally

increase when reported in U.S. dollars.

For the fiscal year


, our revenue  would have decreased by approximately $55.7 million and our operating income would have increased by approximately $0.8 million, respectively, if the U.S. dollar exchange rate would have strengthened by 10% with all other variables held constant.

We attempt to minimize this exposure by using certain financial instruments in accordance with our overall risk management and our hedge policy. We do not enter into speculative derivative agreements.

During the fiscal year


, we utilized foreign exchange contracts, principally to hedge certain balance sheet exposures resulting from currency fluctuations.

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. and its subsidiaries

at December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, and the results of their

operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

December 26, 2015

in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated

audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it classifies deferred taxes in 2015 and 2014 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2015-17,

Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes

.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As described in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Sunrise Farms, Inc., Celsis Group Limited and Oncotest GmbH from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2015 because they were acquired by the Company during 2015. We have also excluded Sunrise Farms, Inc., Celsis Group Limited and Oncotest GmbH from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Sunrise Farms, Inc., Celsis Group Limited and Oncotest GmbH are wholly-owned subsidiaries whose total assets and total revenues collectively represent 14.4 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 26, 2015.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Description of Business

Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. (the Company), together with its subsidiaries, is a full service, early-stage contract research organization (CRO). The Company has built upon its core competency of laboratory animal medicine and science (research model technologies) to develop a diverse portfolio of discovery and safety assessment services, both Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and non-GLP, which is able to support its clients from target identification through preclinical development. The Company also provides a suite of products and services to support its clients’ manufacturing activities.

Principles of Consolidation

The Company’s consolidated financial statements reflect its financial statements and those of its subsidiaries in which the Company holds a controlling financial interest. For consolidated entities in which the Company owns or is exposed to less than 100% of the economics, the Company records net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests in its consolidated statements of income equal to the percentage of the economic or ownership interest retained in such entities by the respective noncontrolling parties. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

The Company’s fiscal quarters consists of the 3 months ending on the last Saturday on, or prior to, March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year statements to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications have no impact on period reported net income or cash flow.

Segment Reporting

During the quarter ended June 28, 2014, following its acquisition of the CRO services division of Galapagos N.V. (Argenta and BioFocus), the Company revised its reportable segments to ensure alignment with the Company’s view of the business. The Company reviewed the new and existing markets addressed by the business, the recently revised go-to-market strategy, long-term operating margins, and the discrete financial information available to its Chief Operating Decision Maker, and considered how its businesses aggregate based on these qualitative and quantitative factors. Based on this review, the Company identified three reportable segments: Research Models and Services (RMS), Discovery and Safety Assessment (DSA) and Manufacturing Support (Manufacturing). The Company reported segment results on this basis for all periods presented.

The revised reportable segments are as follows:


CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Prior to recasting the reportable segments, the businesses were reported in two segments as follows:

Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP) requires that the Company makes estimates and judgments that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, judgments and methodologies. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results in the period in which they become known.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents include money market funds, time deposits and other investments with remaining maturities at the purchase date of three months or less.

Investments

Marketable securities are reported at fair value. Realized gains and losses on marketable securities are included in other income (expense), net and are determined using the specific identification method. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale marketable securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Time deposits with original maturities of greater than three months are reported as investments.

Trade Receivables, Net

The Company records trade receivables net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is established based on historical collection information, a review of major client accounts receivable balances and current economic conditions in the geographies in which it operates. Amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged or written off against the allowance.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investments and trade receivables. The Company places cash and cash equivalents and investments in various financial institutions with high credit rating and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution. Trade receivables are primarily from clients in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, as well as academic and government institutions. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables, which are typically unsecured, are limited due to the wide variety of customers using the Company’s products and services as well as their dispersion across many geographic areas.

No

single client accounted for more than

5%

of revenue or trade receivables for any period presented.

Fair Value Measurements

The accounting standard for fair value measurements defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements. Under this standard, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company has certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value which have been classified as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy:

•

Level 1 - Fair values are determined utilizing quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access;


CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

•

Level 2 - Fair values are determined by utilizing quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in active markets or other market observable inputs such as interest rates, yield curves and foreign currency spot rates;

•

Level 3 - Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.

The fair value hierarchy level is determined by asset or liability class based on the lowest level of significant input. The observability of inputs may change for certain assets or liabilities. This condition could cause an asset or liability to be reclassified between levels. The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter.

Valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured or disclosed at fair value are as follows:

•

Cash equivalents - Valued at quoted market prices determined through third-party pricing services.

•

Mutual funds - Valued at the unadjusted quoted net asset value of shares held by the Company.

•

Foreign currency forward contracts - Valued using readily observable market inputs, such as forward foreign exchange points and foreign exchanges rates.

•

Life insurance policies - Valued at cash surrender value based on fair value of underlying investments.

•

Contingent consideration - Valued based on a probability weighting of the future cash flows associated with the potential outcomes.

•

Redeemable noncontrolling interest - Valued using the income approach based on estimated future cash flows of the underlying business discounted by a weighted average cost of capital.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on the average cost method for the small model business and first-in-first-out for the Company’s large model and Microbial Solutions businesses. For the small model business, cost includes direct materials such as feed and bedding, costs of personnel directly involved in the care of the models, and an allocation of facility overhead. For the large model business, cost is primarily the external cost paid to acquire the model. Certain businesses value inventory based on standard costs, which are periodically compared to and adjusted to actual costs. Inventory costs are charged to cost of revenue in the period the products are sold to an external party. The Company analyzes its inventory levels on a quarterly basis and writes down inventory that is determined to be damaged, obsolete or otherwise unmarketable, with a corresponding charge to cost of products sold.

Property, Plant and Equipment, Net

Property, plant and equipment, including improvements that significantly add to productive capacity or extend useful life, are carried at cost and are subject to review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The cost of normal, recurring, or periodic repairs and maintenance activities related to property, plant and equipment is expensed as incurred. In addition, the Company capitalizes certain internal use computer software development costs.

Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred, while costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software. The Company also capitalizes costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality. Maintenance and training costs related to software obtained for internal use are expensed as incurred.

Interest costs incurred during the construction of major capital projects are capitalized until the underlying asset is ready for its intended use, at which point the interest costs are amortized as depreciation expense over the life of the underlying asset.


CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The Company generally depreciates the cost of its property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows:

Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. Capital lease assets are amortized over the lease term, however, if ownership is transferred by the end of the capital lease, or there is a bargain purchase option, such capital lease assets are amortized over the useful life that would be assigned if such assets were owned.

When the Company disposes of property, plant and equipment, it removes the associated cost and accumulated depreciation from the related accounts on its consolidated balance sheet and includes any resulting gain or loss in its consolidated statement of income.

Business Acquisitions

The Company accounts for acquisitions as business acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting. The Company allocates the amounts that it pays for each acquisition to the assets it acquires and liabilities it assumes based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets. The Company bases the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination on valuations that use information and assumptions determined by management and which consider management’s best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use.

Contingent Consideration

The consideration for the Company’s acquisitions often includes future payments that are contingent upon the occurrence of a particular event. The Company records an obligation for such contingent payments at fair value on the acquisition date. The Company estimates the fair value of contingent consideration obligations through valuation models that incorporate probability adjusted assumptions related to the achievement of the milestones and thus likelihood of making related payments. The Company revalues these contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations are recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of income as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can result from changes to one or multiple inputs, including adjustments to the discount rates and changes in the assumed probabilities of successful achievement of certain financial targets.

Discount rates in the Company’s valuation models represent a measure of the credit risk associated with settling the liability. The period over which the Company discounts its contingent obligations is typically based on when the contingent payments would be triggered. These fair value measurements are based on significant inputs not observable in the market. See Note 5, “Fair Value.”

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible net assets when accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Goodwill is not amortized, but reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of the Company's reporting units below their carrying amounts.

The Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step impairment test. If the Company elects this option and believes, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the carrying value of goodwill is not recoverable, the quantitative two-step impairment test is required; otherwise, no further testing is required. Alternatively, the Company may elect to not first assess qualitative factors and immediately perform the quantitative two-step impairment test. In the first step, the Company compares the fair value of its reporting units


CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

to their carrying values. If the carrying values of the net assets assigned to the reporting units exceed the fair values of the reporting units, then the second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the Company’s goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then the Company would record an impairment loss equal to the difference.

Definite-lived intangible assets, including client relationships, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable.  Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset, which requires the use of customer attribution rates and other assumptions. In the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the definite-lived intangible assets, the definite-lived intangible assets are written-down to their fair values.

Valuation and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable.

Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. In the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets, the assets are written-down to their fair values.

Long-lived assets to be disposed of are carried at fair value less costs to sell.

Limited Partnerships

The Company invests in several venture capital limited partnerships that invest in start-up companies primarily in the life sciences industry. The Company

ownership interest in these limited partnerships ranges from

3.6%

to

12.0%

.

The

Company accounts for such investments under the equity method of accounting, whereby its portion of the investment gains and losses, as reported in the fund’s financial statements on a quarterly lag each reporting period, is recorded in other income (expense), net. In addition, the Company adjusts the carrying value of these investments to reflect its estimate of changes to fair value since the fund’s financial statements based on information from the fund’s management team, market prices of known public holdings of the fund and other information.

Life Insurance Contracts

Investments in life insurance contracts are recorded at cash surrender value. The initial investment at the transaction price is recognized and remeasured based on fair value of underlying investments or contractual value each reporting period. Investments in and redemptions of these life insurance contracts are reported as cash flows from investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. As of

December 26, 2015

and

December 27, 2014

, the Company held


and


contracts, respectively, with a face value of

$60.5 million

and

$68.2 million

, respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company grants stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units (PSUs) to employees and stock options and restricted stock to non-employee directors under stock-based compensation plans. Stock-based compensation is recognized as an expense in the consolidated financial statements based on the grant date fair value, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period.

For stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units that vest based on service conditions, the Company uses the straight-line method to allocate compensation expense to reporting periods.

Where awards are made with non-substantive vesting periods, where a portion of the award continues to vests after the employee’s retirement, the Company recognizes expense based on the period from the grant date to the date on which the employee is retirement eligible.

The Company records the expense for PSU grants subject to performance and/or market conditions using the accelerated attribution method over the remaining service period when management determines that achievement of the performance-based milestone is probable.

The fair value of stock options granted is calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the fair value of PSUs is estimated using a lattice model with a Monte Carlo simulation, both of which require the use of subjective assumptions including volatility and expected term, among others. The expected volatility assumption is typically determined using the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock over the expected life of the stock-based award. The expected term is determined using historical option exercise activity. The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant.


CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been provided, the price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.

Service revenue is generally evidenced by client contracts, which range in duration from a few weeks to a few years and typically take the form of an agreed upon rate per unit or fixed fee arrangements. Such contracts typically do not contain acceptance provisions based upon the achievement of certain study or laboratory testing results. Revenue of agreed upon rate per unit contracts is recognized as services are performed, based upon rates specified in the contract. In cases where performance spans reporting periods, revenue of fixed fee contracts is recognized as services are performed, measured on the ratio of outputs or performance obligations completed to the total contractual outputs or performance obligations to be provided. Changes in estimated effort to complete the fixed fee contract are reflected in the period in which the change becomes known. Changes in scope of work are common, especially under long-term contracts, and generally result in a change in contract value. Once the client has agreed to the changes in scope and renegotiated pricing terms, the contract value is amended and revenue is typically recognized as described above.

Billing schedules and payment terms are generally negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis. Payments received in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue. As the contracted services are subsequently performed and the associated revenue is recognized, the deferred revenue balance is reduced by the amount of revenue recognized during the period. In other cases, services may be provided and revenue is recognized before the client is invoiced. In these cases, revenue recognized will exceed amounts billed and the difference, representing amounts which are currently unbillable to the customer pursuant to contractual terms, is recorded as an unbilled receivable. Once the client is invoiced, the unbilled receivable is reduced for the amount billed, and a corresponding trade receivable is recorded.

Most contracts are terminable by the client, either immediately or upon notice. These contracts often require payment to the Company of expenses to wind down the project, fees earned to date or, in some cases, a termination fee. Such payments are included in revenues when earned.

The Company recognizes product revenue net of allowances for estimated returns, rebates and discounts when title and risk of loss pass to customers. When the Company sells equipment with specified acceptance criteria, it assesses its ability to meet the acceptance criteria in order to determine the timing of revenue recognition. The Company would defer revenue until completion of customer acceptance testing if it is not able to demonstrate the ability to meet such acceptance criteria.

A portion of the Company’s revenue is from multiple-element arrangements that include multiple products and/or services as deliverables in a single arrangement with each deliverable, or a combination of the deliverables, representing a separate unit of accounting. The Company allocates revenues to each element in a multiple-element arrangement based upon the relative selling price of each deliverable. Revenue allocated to each deliverable is then recognized when all revenue recognition criteria are met. Judgments as to the identification of deliverables, units of accounting, the allocation of consideration to the deliverable, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are critical with respect to these arrangements.

At the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments, the Company evaluates whether each milestone is substantive. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether (a) the consideration is commensurate with either (1) the Company’s performance to achieve the milestone, or (2) the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the Company’s performance to achieve the milestone; (b) the consideration relates solely to past performance; and (c) the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. If a substantive milestone is achieved and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured, the Company recognizes revenue related to the milestone in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved. In those circumstances where a milestone is not substantive, the Company recognizes as revenue, on the date the milestone is achieved, an amount equal to the applicable percentage of the performance period that had elapsed as of the date the milestone was achieved, with the balance being deferred and recognized over the remaining period of performance. As of December 26, 2015, the Company had

no

significant milestones that were deemed substantive.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. For the fiscal years

$1.2 million

$1.3 million

and

$1.1 million

, respectively.


CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes includes federal, state, local and foreign taxes. Income taxes are accounted for under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statements carrying amounts and their respective tax basis. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are expected to be settled. The Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.

The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions using a “more-likely-than-not” threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions. The Company evaluates uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and considers various factors, including, but not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, information obtained during in process audit activities and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position. The Company also accrues for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

Foreign Currency Contracts

Foreign currency contracts are recorded at fair value in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and are not designated as hedging instruments. Any gains or losses on such contracts are immediately recognized in other income (expense), net.

Translation of Foreign Currencies

For the Company’s subsidiaries that transact in a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, assets and liabilities are translated at current rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average foreign exchange rates for the period. Adjustments resulting from the translation of the financial statements of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars are excluded from the determination of net income and are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of equity.

Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans

The Company recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans as an asset or liability. This amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. The Company measures plan assets and benefit obligations as of its fiscal year end.

The key assumptions used to calculate benefit obligations and related pension costs include expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, withdrawal and mortality rates, expected rate of increase in employee compensation levels and discount rate. Assumptions are determined based on the Company’s data and appropriate market indicators, and evaluated each year as of the plan’s measurement date.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligations. In determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the Company considers the relative weighting of plan assets, the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance.

In the fiscal year 2014, for the U.K. and U.S. plans, the Company adopted newly released mortality tables and mortality improvement scales for measurement of retirement plan obligations, which increased the Company’s benefit obligations by

$7.9 million

as of December 27, 2014. In the fiscal year 2015, new mortality improvement scales were issued in the U.S. and the U.K. reflecting a decline in longevity projection from the 2014 releases that the Company adopted, which decreased the Company’s benefit obligations by

$3.3 million

as of December 26, 2015.

The discount rate reflects the rate the Company would have to pay to purchase high-quality investments that would provide cash sufficient to settle its current pension obligations. Beginning in the fiscal year 2014, the Company had employed a discount rate based on a cash-flow matching analysis using Towers Watson’s proprietary Bond:Link tool.  Prior to the fiscal year 2014, the Company employed a cash-flow matching methodology, which used the spot yield curve underlying the Citigroup Index. The refined estimation technique permits the Company to more closely match cash flows to the expected payments to participants than would be possible with the previously used yield curve model. This refinement reduced the Company’s benefit obligations as of December 27, 2014 by

$5.5 million

.

The rate of compensation increase reflects the expected annual salary increases for the plan participants based on historical experience and the current employee compensation strategy.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The Company is required to recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise but were not previously required to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. Other comprehensive income is adjusted as these amounts are later recognized in income as components of net periodic benefit cost.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Except where the result would be anti-dilutive to income from continuing operations, diluted earnings per share is computed using the treasury stock method, assuming the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, or PSUs, as well as their related income tax effects.

Newly Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-17, “Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,” that requires companies to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any valuation allowance, as noncurrent on the balance sheet instead of separating deferred taxes into current and noncurrent amounts. The guidance does not change the existing requirement that only permits offsetting within a jurisdiction. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company elected early adoption of this standard

as it improved the efficiency of the year end financial reporting process for income taxes

and applied the changes retrospectively to all prior periods presented in its consolidated financial statements.

As of December 27, 2014, the adoption of this standard has resulted in decreases of

$27.6 million

,

$1.5 million

, and

$7.7 million

to other current assets, other current liabilities and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities, respectively, and an increase of

$18.4 million

to noncurrent deferred tax assets.

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, “Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments,” that eliminates the current requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Instead, acquirers will recognize measurement-period adjustments during the period in which they determine the amount of the adjustments, including the effect on earnings of any amounts they would have recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted.

During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company elected early adoption of this standard. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-04, “Practical Expedient for the Measurement Date of an Employer’s Defined Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets” to provide a practical expedient related to the measurement date of the defined benefit plan assets and obligations. The practical expedient allows employers with fiscal year-end dates that do not coincide with a calendar month end to measure pension and post-retirement benefit plan assets and obligations as of the calendar month-end date closest to the fiscal year end. The standard requires entities that elect the practical expedient to adjust the measurement of benefit plan assets and obligations for contributions or significant events between the month-end measurement date and the entity fiscal year end. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company elected not to utilize the practical expedient provided by ASU 2015-04.

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, “Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,” which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability, consistent with the presentation of debt discounts or premiums. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. During the second quarter of 2015, the Company elected early adoption of this standard and applied the changes retrospectively to all prior periods presented in its consolidated financial statements.

The Company historically presented deferred debt issuance costs, or fees related to directly issuing debt, as assets on the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 27, 2014, the adoption of this standard has resulted in the reclassification of

$5.4 million

from other assets to long-term debt, net and capital leases. These costs will continue to be amortized as interest expense over the term of the corresponding debt issuance.

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, “Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis,” which amends existing consolidation requirements. The guidance affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. Specifically, the guidance amends (i) the identification of variable interests (fees paid to a


CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

decision maker or service provider), (ii) the variable interest entity characteristics for a limited partnership or similar entity and (iii) the primary beneficiary determination. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted.

During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company elected early adoption of this standard. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Newly Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, “Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,” that simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventories by replacing the current lower of cost or market test with a lower of cost or net realizable value test. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is still evaluating the impact this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.” The standard requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The standard will be effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company has not yet selected a transition method and is evaluating the impact the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

2. BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS

Oncotest

On November 18, 2015, the Company acquired Oncotest, a German CRO providing discovery services for oncology, one of the largest therapeutic areas for biopharmaceutical research and development spending. With this acquisition, the Company has expanded its oncology services capabilities, enabling it to provide clients with access to a more comprehensive portfolio of technologies, including patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and syngeneic models.  The purchase price for Oncotest was approximately $

36.0 million

, including $

0.3 million

in contingent consideration. The acquisition was funded by borrowings on the Company's revolving credit facility. The business is reported in the Company’s DSA reportable segment.

The contingent consideration is a one-time payment that could become payable based on the achievement of a revenue target for the fiscal year 2016. If achieved, the payment will become due in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. The aggregate, undiscounted amount of contingent consideration that the Company may pay is

€2.0 million

(

$2.2 million

as of December 26, 2015). The Company estimated the fair value of this contingent consideration based on a probability-weighted set of outcomes.

The preliminary purchase price allocation of

$35.4 million

, net of $

0.6 million

of cash acquired, was as follows:

The purchase price allocations were prepared on a preliminary basis and are subject to change as additional information becomes available concerning the fair value and tax basis of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any additional adjustments to the purchase price allocation will be made as soon as practicable but no later than one year from the date of acquisition.

Sunrise

On

May 5, 2015, the Company acquired Sunrise Farms, Inc. (Sunrise), a producer of specific-pathogen-free fertile chicken eggs and chickens used in the manufacture of live viruses. The purpose of this business acquisition was to expand the capabilities of the Company’s existing Avian Vaccine Services business. The purchase price of the acquisition was $

9.6 million

and was funded by cash on hand and borrowings on the Company’s revolving credit facility. The business is reported in the Company’s Manufacturing reportable segment.

The Company recorded a bargain purchase gain of $

9.8 million

, which represents the excess of the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired over the preliminary purchase price. The bargain purchase gain was recorded in other income (expense), net in the Company’s consolidated statement of income and was not recognized for tax purposes. The Company believes there were several factors that contributed to this transaction resulting in a bargain purchase gain, including the highly specialized nature of Sunrise’s business falling outside of the seller’s core activities and a limited pool of potential buyers.

The breakout of definite-lived intangible assets acquired was as follows:

The goodwill resulting from the transaction is primarily attributed to the potential growth of the business in China and is not deductible for tax purposes.

Concurrent with the acquisition, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with the noncontrolling interest holders that provide the Company with the right to purchase the remaining

25%

of the entity for cash at its then appraised value beginning in January 2016. Additionally, the noncontrolling interest holders were granted the right to require the Company to purchase the remaining

25%

of the entity at its then appraised value beginning in January 2016 for cash. These rights are accelerated in certain events. As the noncontrolling interest holders can require the Company purchase the remaining

25%

interest, the noncontrolling interest is classified in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet, which is above the equity section and below liabilities. The acquisition-date fair value of the noncontrolling interest was determined based on the fair value of the consideration exchanged for the

75%

of Vital River. Subsequent to the acquisition, the noncontrolling interest carrying amount is adjusted to the fair value each quarter using an income approach. The income approach uses estimated future cash flows based on projected financial data discounted by a rate which considers the Company’s weighted average cost of capital and the specific risks of achieving these cash flows. Adjustments to fair value are recorded through additional paid-in capital.

As of

December 26, 2015

, the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company’s redeemable noncontrolling interest are the estimated future cash flows and a discount rate of

18.0%

. Significant changes in the timing or amounts of the estimated future cash flows would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. Significant increases or decreases in the discount rate would result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement, respectively. A

1%

increase in the discount rate used would result in a

$1.7 million

decrease in the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest.

Contingent Consideration

The following table provides a rollforward of the contingent consideration related to previous business acquisitions. See Note 2, “Business Acquisitions.”

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company’s contingent consideration are the probabilities of successful achievement of certain financial targets and a discount rate. Significant increases or decreases in any of the probabilities of success would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement, respectively. Significant increases or decreases in the discount rate would result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement, respectively.

Debt Instruments

The book value of the Company’s term and revolving loans, which are variable rate loans carried at amortized cost, approximates their fair value based on current market pricing of similar debt. As the fair value is based on significant other observable inputs, including current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, it is deemed to be Level 2.

Goodwill

The following table provides a rollforward of the Company’s goodwill:

In the second quarter of 2014, the Company revised its reportable segments to align with the view of the business following its acquisition of Argenta and BioFocus. See Note 1, "Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies." As a result of this reorganization, goodwill was allocated from the Company's prior reportable segments to new reportable segments, as shown in the preceding table within "transfers." The allocation was based on the fair value of each business group within its original reporting unit relative to the fair value of that reporting unit. In addition, the Company completed an assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for all reporting units immediately prior to the reallocation and determined that no impairment existed.

Based on the Company’s step one goodwill impairment test for the fiscal years

Credit Facility, creating a $

1.3 billion

facility ($

Credit Facility) that provides for a $

400.0 million

term loan facility and a $

900.0 million

multi-currency revolving facility. The term loan facility matures in


quarterly installments with the last installment due April 22, 2020. The revolving facility matures on April 22, 2020 and requires no scheduled payment before that date.

The interest rates applicable to term loans and revolving loans under our credit agreement are, at the Company’s option, equal to either the alternate base rate (which is the higher of (1) the prime rate, (2) the federal funds rate plus

0.5%

or (3) the one-month adjusted LIBOR rate plus

1%

), or the adjusted LIBOR rate plus an interest rate margin based upon the Company’s leverage ratio. As of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, the weighted average interest rate on the Company’s debt was

1.33%

Capital Lease Obligations

The Company acquired a build-to-suit lease as part of its acquisition of Argenta and BioFocus. In accordance with accounting guidance applicable to entities involved with the construction of an asset that will be leased when the construction is completed, the Company was considered the owner, for accounting purposes, of this property during the construction period. Accordingly, the Company recorded an asset and a corresponding financing obligation on its consolidated balance sheet for the amount of total project costs incurred related to the construction in progress for this property through completion of the construction period. Upon completion of the construction during the second quarter of 2015, the Company determined that it was no longer considered the owner of the property because it did not have continuing involvement. Consequently, the Company recorded a successful sale leaseback and derecognized the property and the associated financing obligation from the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and recorded a capital lease asset and a corresponding liability of $

35.8 million

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Changes to each component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes, are as follows:

Nonredeemable Noncontrolling Interests

The Company has investments in several entities, whose financial results are consolidated in the Company’s financial statements, as it has the ability to exercise control over these entities. The interests of the respective noncontrolling parties in these entities have been recorded as noncontrolling interests.

9. INCOME TAXES

The components of income from continuing operations before income taxes and the related provision for income taxes are presented below:

The components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:


CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Reconciliations of the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate to effective tax rates are as follows:

The tax rate benefit for the impact of tax uncertainties is primarily related to a

$10.4 million

reduction in unrecognized tax benefits and related interest due to the expiration of the statute of limitations associated with pre-acquisition tax positions on the forgiveness of debt. The tax rate benefit for enacted tax rate changes is primarily associated with a reduction in the U.K.’s statutory tax rates. The tax benefit associated with a $

9.8 million

non-taxable bargain purchase gain related to the acquisition of Sunrise is included within the impact of acquisitions and restructuring line of the rate reconciliation above.

As of

December 26, 2015

, the Company had foreign net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of

$34.6 million

, as compared to

$39.8 million

as of

December 27, 2014

. Of this amount,

$4.3 million

will expire beginning after 2015,

$18.7 million

will begin to expire in 2032 and beyond, and the remainder of

$11.6 million

can be carried forward indefinitely. In accordance with Canadian Federal tax law, the Company claims Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) credits on qualified research and development costs incurred in its Safety Assessment facility in Montreal, and currently maintains

$18.7 million

in credit carryforwards, which will begin to expire in 2032. Additionally, the Company records a benefit to operating income for research and development credits in both Quebec and the U.K. related to its Safety Assessment and Early Discovery facilities.

The Company has fully recognized its deferred tax assets on the belief that it is more likely than not that they will be realized. The only exceptions relate to deferred tax assets primarily for net operating losses in Hong Kong, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, capital losses in the U.S. and Canada, and fixed assets in the U.K. The valuation allowance increased by

$0.2 million

from

$5.9 million

as of

December 27, 2014

to

$6.1 million

as of

December 26, 2015

.

A reconciliation of the Company’s beginning and ending unrecognized income tax benefits is as follows:

The

$11.3 million

decrease in unrecognized income tax benefits during the fiscal year 2015 is primarily attributable to the expiration of the statute of limitations associated with pre-acquisition tax positions on forgiveness of debt.


CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The amount of unrecognized income tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably impact the effective tax rate was $

20.1 million

as of December 26, 2015 and

$32.3 million

as of December 27, 2014. The

$12.2 million

decrease is primarily attributable to the expiration of the statute of limitations associated with pre-acquisition tax positions on forgiveness of debt. It is reasonably possible as of December 26, 2015 that the liability for unrecognized tax benefits for the uncertain tax position will decrease by $

1.9 million

, primarily as a result of the outcome of a pending tax ruling. The Company continues to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized income tax benefits in income tax expense. The total amount of accrued interest related to unrecognized income tax benefits as of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014 was $

1.0 million

and $

1.4 million

, respectively.

The Company conducts business in a number of tax jurisdictions. As a result, it is subject to tax audits on a regular basis including, but not limited to, such major jurisdictions as the U.S., the U.K., France, Japan, Germany and Canada. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. and international income tax examinations for years before 2012.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are currently under audit by various tax authorities in the U.S. and France. The Company does not anticipate resolution of these audits will have a material impact on its financial statements.

During 2015, the Company applied with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Canadian Revenue Authority (CRA) for relief pursuant to the competent authority procedure provided in the tax treaty between the U.S. and Canada for transfer pricing tax assessments related to the tax years 2008 through 2012. The Company believes that the controversy will likely be ultimately settled via the competent authority process and accordingly have recorded both a Canadian liability and a U.S. receivable. The actual amounts of the liability for Canadian taxes and the asset for the correlative relief in the U.S. could be different based upon the agreement reached between the IRS and the CRA.

On October 21, 2015, the Quebec government enacted Bill 13, which provides for a one-time retroactive benefit to operating income in the fourth quarter of 2015 related to tax years 2012 through 2014 and provides for a corresponding increase to the Company’s effective tax rate. Additionally, the tax law change provides for an ongoing reduction in benefit to operating income and an additional corresponding increase to the Company’s effective tax rate beginning in 2015 and beyond. The cumulative impact of this law change has been reflected in the fourth quarter results.

In accordance with the Company’s policy, the undistributed earnings of the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries remain indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. as of the end of 2015 as they are required to fund needs outside the U.S. and cannot be repatriated in a manner that is substantially tax free. As of December 26, 2015, the earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries considered to be indefinitely reinvested totaled

$547.6 million

. No provision for U.S. income taxes has been provided herein. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on these earnings is not practicable because of the complexities with the hypothetical calculation. Additionally, the amount of liability is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs. On December 18, 2015, the U.S. enacted the Consolidated Appropriations Act, which provides for a reinstatement and extension of the controlled foreign corporation look-through rules. This rule allows the Company to access Chinese and Canadian cash in a more tax-efficient manner and utilize the cash outside of the U.S. without triggering residual U.S. tax. As such, in 2015 the Company accrued

$6.6 million

of foreign withholding taxes to reflect this change.

10. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Charles River Laboratories Employee Savings Plan

The Charles River Laboratories Employee Savings Plan is a defined contribution plan in the form of a qualified 401(k) plan in which substantially all U.S. employees are eligible to participate upon employment. The plan contains a provision whereby the Company matches a percentage of employee contributions. During the fiscal years


,


and


, the costs associated with this defined contribution plan totaled

$5.3 million

,

$4.9 million

and

$4.7 million

, respectively.

Charles River Laboratories Deferred Compensation Plan and Executive Supplemental Life Insurance Retirement Plan

The Company maintains a non-qualified deferred compensation plan, known as the Charles River Laboratories Deferred Compensation Plan (DCP), which allows a select group of eligible employees to defer a portion of their compensation. At the present time, no contributions are credited to the DCP, except as set forth below. Participants must specify the distribution date for deferred amounts at the time of deferral, in accordance with applicable IRS regulations. Generally, amounts may be paid in lump sum or installments upon retirement or termination of employment, or later if the employee terminates employment after age 55 and before age 65. Amounts may also be distributed during employment, subject to a minimum deferral requirement of three years.

The Company provides certain active employees an annual contribution into their DCP account of

10%

of the employee’s base salary plus the lesser of their target annual bonus or actual annual bonus.


CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

In addition to the DCP, certain officers and key employees also participate, or in the past participated, in the Company’s Executive Supplemental Life Insurance Retirement Plan (ESLIRP), which is a non-funded, non-qualified arrangement. Annual benefits under this plan will equal a percentage of the highest five consecutive years of compensation, offset by amounts payable under the Charles River Laboratories, Inc. Pension Plan (CRL Pension Plan) and Social Security. In connection with the establishment of the DCP, certain active ESLIRP participants, who agreed to convert their accrued ESLIRP benefit to a comparable deferred compensation benefit, discontinued their direct participation in the ESLIRP. Instead, the present values of the accrued benefits of ESLIRP participants were credited to their DCP accounts, and future accruals are converted to present values and credited to their DCP accounts annually.

The costs associated with these plans, including the ESLIRP, for the fiscal years


,


and


totaled

$2.6 million

, $

3.3 million

and

$3.3 million

, respectively.

The Company has invested in several corporate-owned key-person life insurance policies and mutual funds with the intention of using these investments to fund the ESLIRP and the DCP. Participants have no interest in any such investments. As of

December 26, 2015

and

December 27, 2014

, the cash surrender value of these life insurance policies were

$27.6 million

and

$27.6 million

, respectively.

Post-Retirement Health and Life Insurance Plans

The Company’s Canadian location offers post-retirement life insurance benefits to its employees and post-retirement medical and dental insurance coverage to certain executives. The plan is non-contributory and unfunded. As of

December 26, 2015

and

December 27, 2014

, the accumulated benefit obligation related to the plan was

$0.9 million

and

$1.2 million

, respectively. The amounts included in other accumulated comprehensive income as well as expenses related to the plan were insignificant in the fiscal years


,


, and


.

Pension Plans

The CRL Pension Plan is a qualified, non-contributory defined benefit plan covering certain U.S. employees. Effective 2002, the plan was amended to exclude new participants from joining and in 2008 the accrual of benefits was frozen.

The Charles River Pension Plan is a defined contribution and defined benefit pension plan covering certain U.K. employees. Benefits are based on participants’ final pensionable salary and years of service. Participants’ rights vest immediately. Effective December 31, 2002, the plan was amended to exclude new participants from joining the defined benefit section of the plan and a defined contribution section was established for new entrants. Contributions under the defined contribution plan are determined as a percentage of gross salary.

In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Charles River Pension Plan was amended such that the members of the defined benefit section of the plan will cease to accrue additional benefits; however, their benefits will continue to be adjusted for changes in their final pensionable salary or a specified inflation index, as applicable.

In addition, the Company has several defined benefit plans in certain other countries in which it maintains an operating presence, including Japan, Canada and France.

Expected benefit payments are estimated using the same assumptions used in determining the Company’s benefit obligation as of

December 26, 2015

. Benefit payments will depend on future employment and compensation levels, among other factors, and changes in any of these factors could significantly affect these estimated future benefit payments. Estimated future benefit payments during the next five years and in the aggregate for the fiscal years thereafter, are as follows:

11. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

The Company has stock-based compensation plans under which employees and non-employee directors may be granted stock-based awards such as stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and PSUs.

During the fiscal years


,


and


, the primary share-based awards and their general terms and conditions are as follows:

•

Stock options, which entitle the holder to purchase a specified number of shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to the closing market price of common stock on the date of grant; typically vest over


years; and typically expire


to


years from date of grant.

•

Restricted stock units, which represent an unsecured promise to grant at no cost a set number of shares of common stock upon the completion of the vesting schedule, and typically vest over


to


years.  With respect to restricted


CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

stock units, recipients are not entitled to cash dividends and have no voting rights on the stock during the vesting period.

•

Restricted stock, which is an award of common stock issued on the grant date and subject to vesting, typically over


to


years.  Recipients cannot sell or transfer the shares until the restriction period has lapsed, but are entitled to forfeitable cash dividends and to vote their respective shares upon grant.

•

PSUs, which entitle the holder to receive at no cost, a specified number of shares of common stock within a range of shares from

zero

to a specified maximum and typically vest over


years. Payout of this award is contingent upon achievement of certain performance and market conditions.

In May 2007, the Company’s shareholders approved the 2007 Incentive Plan, which was amended in 2009, 2011 and 2013 (2007 Plan). The 2007 Plan provided no further awards to be granted under preexisting stock option and incentive plans; provided, however, that any shares that have been forfeited or canceled in accordance with the terms of the applicable award under a preexisting plan may be subsequently awarded in accordance with the terms of the preexisting plan. The 2007 Plan allows a maximum of

18.7 million

shares to be awarded, of which restricted stock grants, restricted stock units and performance based stock awards count as

2.3

shares and stock options count as

1.0

shares. Any stock options and other share-based awards that were granted under prior plans and were outstanding in May 2007, continue in accordance with the terms of the respective plans.

As of

December 26, 2015

, approximately

6.3 million

shares were authorized for future grants under the Company’s share-based compensation plans. The Company settles employee share-based compensation awards with newly issued shares. The following table provides the financial statement line items in which stock-based compensation is reflected:

During the fiscal year


, the Company modified certain stock-based awards granted in previous years as part of executive retirement transitions. For the stock-based awards granted to employees during

Performance Based Stock Award Program

In the fiscal years


,


and 2013, the Company issued PSUs to certain corporate officers. The number of shares of common stock issued for each PSU is adjusted based on a performance condition linked to the Company’s financial performance. Certain awards are further adjusted based on a market condition, which is calculated based on the Company’s stock performance relative to a peer group over the three-year vesting period. The fair value of the market condition is reflected in the fair value of the award at grant date.

The Company utilizes a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model to value these awards. Information pertaining to the Company’s PSUs and the related estimated weighted-average assumptions used to calculate their fair value were as follows:

The maximum amount of common shares to be issued upon vesting of PSUs is approximately

0.8 million

. For the fiscal years


,


and


, the Company recognized stock-based compensation related to PSUs of

$14.7 million

,

$8.5 million

and

$2.2 million

, respectively. The total fair value of PSUs that vested during the fiscal year 2015 was

$6.6 million

.

In the fiscal year 2015, the Company also issued approximately

15,000

PSUs using a fair value per share of

$76.67

. These PSUs vest upon the achievement of financial targets and other performance measures.

12. FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

During the fiscal year 2015, the Company entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to limit its foreign currency exposure related to intercompany loans denominated in Euros that are not of a long-term investment nature. These contracts are recorded at fair value in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and are not designated as hedging instruments. Any gains or losses on such contracts are immediately recognized in other income (expense), net, and are largely offset by the remeasurement of the underlying intercompany loan balances.

The notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts is summarized as follows:

The following table summarizes the effect of foreign exchange forward contracts on the Company’s consolidated statement of income:

The forward contracts outstanding as of

December 26, 2015

had durations of approximately

13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Operating Leases

The Company rents laboratory and office space, land, vehicles and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. These lease agreements contain various clauses for renewal at the Company’s option and, in certain cases, rent escalation


CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

clauses. Rental expense under these leases amounted to

$23.4 million

,

$14.2 million

and

$16.7 million

in the fiscal years


,


and


, respectively. In addition to rent, the leases may require the Company to pay additional amounts for taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses.

As of

December 26, 2015

, minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable leases, net of income from subleases, for each of the next five years and total thereafter were as follows:

Insurance

The Company maintains various insurance policies that maintain large deductibles up to approximately

$5.0 million

, some with or without stop-loss limits, depending on market availability. Insurance policies at certain locations are based on a percentage of the insured assets, for which deductibles for certain property may exceed

$5.0 million

in the event of a catastrophic event.

Litigation

Various lawsuits, claims, and proceedings of a nature considered normal to its business are pending against the Company. While the outcome of any of these proceedings cannot be accurately predicted, the Company does not believe the ultimate resolution of any of these existing matters would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business or financial condition.

In July 2015, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. and IDEXX Distribution, Inc. (collectively, IDEXX) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging the Company has infringed

three

recently issued patents related to a blood spot sample collection method used in determining the presence or absence of an infectious disease in a population of rodents.  On September 21, 2015, the Company timely filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that all of the claims are directed to unpatentable subject matter and therefore are invalid.  On October 7, 2015, IDEXX filed an amended complaint which substantially asserts the same patents and infringement allegations as asserted in the original complaint, and on October 26, 2015, the Company timely filed a motion to dismiss this amended complaint.  While no prediction may be made as to the outcome of litigation, the Company intends to defend against this proceeding vigorously and therefore an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made.

In May 2013, the Company commenced an investigation into inaccurate billing with respect to certain government contracts. The Company promptly reported these matters to the relevant government contracting officers, the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of the Inspector General, and the Department of Justice, and the Company is cooperating with these agencies to ensure the proper repayment and resolution of this matter.

The Company has identified approximately $

1.5 million

in excess amounts billed on these contracts since January 1, 2007 and has recorded a

liability

for such amount as of December 26, 2015 as this represents the Company’s best estimate. Because of the ongoing discussions with the government and the complex nature of this matter, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that additional losses may be incurred but cannot at this time make a reasonable estimate of the potential range of loss beyond such estimated liability.

Guarantees

The Company enters into certain agreements with other parties in the ordinary course of business that contain indemnification provisions. These typically include agreements with directors and officers, business partners, contractors, landlords, and customers. Under these provisions, the Company generally indemnifies and holds harmless the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result of the Company’s activities. These indemnification provisions generally survive termination of the underlying agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited. However, to date the Company has not incurred


CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification provisions. As a result, the estimated fair value of these obligations is minimal.

14. SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

The Company revised its reportable segments during the fiscal year 2014 to align with its view of the business following its acquisition of Argenta and BioFocus. See Note 1, “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” The Company reported segment results on this basis retrospectively for all comparable prior periods.

Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurances of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in designing and evaluating the controls and procedures.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment and those criteria, management concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 26, 2015

.

We have excluded the business acquisitions completed during the fiscal year


, including Sunrise Farms, Inc., Celsis Group Limited and Oncotest GmbH, from the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of

December 26, 2015

. The acquired businesses

are wholly-owned subsidiaries whose total assets and total revenues collectively represent 14.4% and 1.4%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2015

.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of

December 26, 2015

(b)    Changes in Internal Controls
