Factors Driving the Electronic Design
Automation Industry

During the last decade, the worldwide
communications, business productivity and consumer electronics
markets drove development in the electronics industry.
Ever-decreasing silicon manufacturing process geometries coupled
with the move to 300 millimeter wafer production drive IC
cost decreases,

volume increases and greater
complexity for providers of electronics devices. At the same
time, the development of ICs with greater functionality
complicates effective integration of components into complete
electronic systems. These market and technology forces pose
major challenges for the global electronics design community,
and consequently create significant opportunities and challenges
for EDA product and services providers.

From a design perspective, many of today’s
complex ICs are system-on-a-chip, referred to as SoC, devices.
These SoC devices, as described in more detail below, contain
one or more processors, memory and



application-specific logic. SoC design requires
implementing an entire electronics sub-system on a single IC.
Smaller feature sizes make it possible to put additional
circuitry on a single segment of silicon, or die. The ICs
fabricated on these dies include one or more processors
(microprocessors and digital signal processors), a
high-performance bus for on-chip data communication, numerous
memory devices and peripherals, custom digital logic, custom
analog logic and millions of lines of software code. Such
devices offer benefits in terms of price, performance, power and
size. However, they are extremely difficult to design. Designing
these SoC devices requires the convergence of what have
previously been distinct domains for embedded software, digital
logic, analog circuitry and printed circuit board, or PCB,
design. This convergence is changing the way designs for these
devices are created.

The increasing complexity of electronic devices
poses major challenges for design teams in the migration to
nanometer, or one billionth of a meter, design and SoC design
(for reference, the diameter of the period at the end of this
sentence is approximately 400,000 nanometers). Nanometer design
refers to the design of ICs that will have feature sizes smaller
than 180 nanometers. IC feature sizes for wires, transistors and
contacts decrease with each advance in the semiconductor
manufacturing process. Each successive move to a smaller feature
size (e.g., decreasing from 130 nanometers to 90 nanometers and
smaller) requires introducing new capabilities throughout the
entire design and manufacturing chain to account for new
physical effects. For example, at 130 nanometers, signal
integrity issues such as signal interference between wires, or
crosstalk; power distribution management, or IR
(voltage) drop; and electrical noise on IC performance,
have become critical. At 90 nanometers, power leakage
dramatically affects overall IC power consumption and creates
additional design challenges. The increased complexity,
electrical noise and power consumption due to leakage, combine
to increase pressure on the ability to reach the desired
operating frequency, commonly known as timing closure.

These trends pose significant new challenges for
electronics design teams. Specifically, nanometer design
requires designers to take into account many physical effects
that were too small to impact performance of larger circuit
geometries. SoC design requires new approaches to managing
complexity and its related risks. The electronics industry
addresses these challenges in a number of ways, including the
use of new EDA products, the upgrade of existing tools and
design methodologies, and offering the advantages of highly
integrated front-to-back design solutions.

Operating Segments

We manage our business through three operating
segments: Products, Services and Maintenance. The Products
segment develops and markets our software and hardware
technologies to our customers. The Maintenance segment services
the ongoing, after-sale support requirements of those products
through technical support and software updates. The Services
segment provides our customers with educational services focused
on training customers for the efficient and effective use of our
technologies, methodology services to assist customers in
optimizing the use of our technologies within their design
activities, and design services to develop complex ICs and other
electronic components for our customers. See
“Competition” below and Note 19, Segment
Reporting, to our Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information related to these operating segments.

Products

Through our Products segment, we offer one of the
most comprehensive sets of EDA products in the industry. Our
products improve designer productivity and design quality
throughout the electronic design process. Product revenues
include all fees earned from granting licenses to use our
software and sales and leases of our hardware products, and
exclude revenues derived from Maintenance and Services. We offer
customers three license types for our software: perpetual, term
and subscription. See “Software Licensing
Arrangements” below for additional discussion of our
license types.

Product revenue represented 59% of our total
revenue in 2003, 63% in 2002 and 58% in 2001.



Product Strategy

With the addition of emerging nanometer design
considerations to the already burgeoning set of traditional
design tasks, complex SoC or IC design can no longer be
accomplished using a collection of discrete design tools. What
previously consisted of sequential design activities must be
merged and accomplished nearly simultaneously without
time-consuming data translation steps. We have formulated a
design solution strategy that combines our “best in
class” design technologies into “platforms” for
four major design activities: functional verification, digital
IC design, custom IC design and system interconnect. The four
Cadence design platforms are Incisive

TM

Functional
Verification, Encounter

TM

Digital IC Design,
Virtuoso® Custom Design and Allegro® System
Interconnect Platforms. In addition, we augment these platform
product offerings with a comprehensive set of design for
manufacturing products that span both the digital and custom IC
design flows. These four platforms, together with our design for
manufacturing products comprise our primary product lines.

Incisive Functional Verification
Platform

The Incisive functional verification platform
supports a unified methodology, from design of the total system,
to design-in of particular ICs, to design of specific systems,
for all design domains. Compared to traditional simulation
approaches, the Incisive platform provides faster full-chip
verification throughout the entire design cycle, which
significantly reduces total verification time.

The Incisive platform employs a single-kernel
architecture that overcomes fragmentation by unifying multiple
verification techniques around a single engine. It also provides
support for open design and verification standards as well as
analog/mixed-signal verification. The same platform delivers
Palladium® hardware in-circuit emulation and simulation
acceleration-on-demand, transaction-level support, HDL analysis,
coverage, debug and analysis, and test generation. Not only is
Incisive designed so customers can adopt these technologies
incrementally, it can also deliver the speed and efficiency
required to compress overall verification time. The
QuickCycles

TM

capability allows customers to access
Palladium simulation acceleration and emulation products on a
pay-as-you-go basis, either on the customer site or remotely
over a high-speed, secure network connection.

As part of the Incisive functional verification
platform, Incisive Conformal® provides a complete
logic equivalence checking solution for verifying that the RTL
specification is equivalent to the final IC layout. Conformal
verifies a variety of circuits, including complex arithmetic
logic, datapath, memories, and custom logic.

Encounter Digital IC Design Platform

Our Encounter digital IC design platform employs
a unified architecture for full digital implementation of
nanometer-scale designs. It is based on a single user interface
and unified in-memory data model, and was specifically designed
to analyze and optimize wiring throughout the design process. It
is comprised of the following core technologies:

•

Encounter RTL Compiler, featuring global
    synthesis for timing closure, which uses a patented set of
    global focus algorithms that maximize circuit performance;

•

First Encounter® Ultra, a silicon virtual
    prototyping system that assists in managing the IC design
    process;

•

NanoRoute

TM

Ultra, which uses
    graph-based routing technologies to efficiently support
    variable-spacing, variable-width routes for nanometer process
    technologies;

•

CeltIC

TM

signal integrity analyzer,
    which is used by leading silicon foundries for ensuring that the
    chip designed with the Encounter platform does not contain any
    fatal signal integrity defects; and

•

Encounter Test Solutions

TM

which
    identify opportunities for yield improvements by accelerating
    defect identification, and by linking design data with
    manufacturing data.

Unlike traditional “front-end/back-end”
systems, the Encounter platform does not require translations
between common tasks such as placement, power distribution,
routing, and timing/crosstalk analysis. The



SoC Encounter

TM

configuration supports
hierarchical designs, with full-chip support for designs
containing more than 50 million gates. (A gate is an
electronic switch that allows or prevents the flow of current in
a circuit.) Nano Encounter

TM

supports full-chip
implementation for non-hierarchical chips and blocks of up to
10 million gates.

Virtuoso Custom Design Platform

The Virtuoso custom design platform enables
development of silicon-accurate analog, custom digital, radio
frequency and mixed-signal designs. With the Virtuoso platform,
custom design teams are able to deliver silicon-accurate
designs — while addressing the growing number of
physical effects in package, power grid, interconnect, devices,
and substrate.

By using its advanced custom design methodology
for custom/mixed-signal design, the Virtuoso platform enables
highly accurate design predictability by ensuring that the
circuit design representation will behave correctly in the final
manufactured silicon. The Virtuoso platform reduces design time
by providing:

•

A specification-driven environment that automates
    the entire design process;

•

Multi-mode simulation (digital, analog and radio
    frequency) using a common syntax, model, and equations;

•

Fast custom layout technologies;

•

Highly accurate electrical vs. physical effects
    analysis; and

•

Physical design integration and silicon analysis
    for complex custom, cell-based, and mixed custom designs using
    our Open Access

TM

database.

Design For Manufacturing

The physical design of ICs requires detailed
analysis and optimization to ensure the design can be
manufactured. Our Fire & Ice® QX products take the
designer’s representation of the IC and extract the
physical properties of the design to enable further analysis.
Our SignalStorm®, VoltageStorm® and
ElectronStorm® products address nanometer design challenges
associated with on-chip distribution of power, timing and
crosstalk effects. The Substrate Noise Analyst product, designed
for radio frequency, analog, and mixed-signal ICs, provides a
silicon-accurate model for detecting fatal substrate coupling
defects to enable chip integration. Our Assura products perform
design rule checking to ensure the proposed design meets the
requirements of the foundry’s manufacturing process rules.
Our software and services are designed to provide comprehensive,
high-speed verification that an IC will perform as designed,
taking into account the complex effects of nanometer
semiconductor physics.

Allegro System Interconnect Design
Platform

The Cadence Allegro system interconnect design
platform enables collaborative design of high-performance
interconnect across the domains of IC, package and PCB, reducing
cost and time to market. The system interconnect —
between I/ O buffers and across ICs, packages and
PCBs — can be optimized through the platform’s
co-design methodology, reducing both hardware costs and design
cycles. The Allegro platform’s constraint-driven
methodology includes advanced capabilities for design capture,
signal integrity and physical implementation. The Allegro
co-design methodology is supported by our Encounter and Virtuoso
platforms, enabling effective design chain collaboration.
Silicon design-in kits speed time to market by allowing IC
companies to shorten new device adoption time and allowing
systems companies to accelerate PCB system design cycles.

The System Interconnect product group includes
the Allegro system interconnect platform and the OrCAD product
line of PCB design products that is priced for the individual
user. The OrCAD product line is marketed exclusively through a
worldwide network of value added resellers.



Verification and Application Specific
Programming, or ASP, Services

We offer verification and ASP services through
Time-to-Market Engineering, or TtME, services. Our TtME team
provides customers with consulting services, project services
and/or complete turnkey services for verification acceleration
and system emulation. QuickCycles allows customers to access
Palladium simulation acceleration and emulation products on a
pay-as-you-go basis, either on the customer internet site or
remotely over a high-speed, secure network connection.

Third Party Programs and Initiatives

We recognize that certain of our customers may
also use internally-developed design tools or design tools
provided by other EDA companies. We support the integration of
third party design products through our Open Access Initiative
and Connections® Program. Open Access is a full-featured
EDA database that supports access and manipulation of its
internal EDA data via a fully documented and freely available
programming interface. This provides an open application program
interface, or API, through which applications developed by our
customers, by their other EDA vendors, or by university research
groups can all operate within a single database and with Cadence
platforms. We have contributed the open access database to the
Open Access Coalition, which is operated by the Silicon
Integration Initiative, an organization of EDA, electronic
system and semiconductor industry leaders focused on improving
productivity and reducing cost in creating and producing
integrated silicon systems. The Connections Program provides
other EDA companies with access to our products to ensure that
our products work well with those third party tools. Over 120
EDA providers are members of the Connections Program.
Additionally, we collaborate throughout the silicon design chain
with leading IP, silicon foundry, and library provider partners
to support customer-owned tooling, or COT, solutions for our
customers. We also assist and support library providers in the
integration of our design and verification products and model
formats into COT library solutions. In addition, we work with
vendors of Application Specific Integrated Circuits, or ASICs,
to ensure predictable and smooth handoff of design data from
mutual customers to ASIC implementation. These relationships are
integral to providing complete design chain solutions to IC and
electronic systems designers who depend on coordinated offerings
from multiple suppliers.

Maintenance

The Maintenance segment comprises our customer
support activities for our software and hardware products. We
provide technical support to our customers to facilitate their
use of our products. A high level of customer service and
support is critical to the adoption and successful use of our
products, which results in a close link between the Product and
Maintenance segments.

We have a global customer support organization
and specialized field application engineering teams located in
each of our operating regions, to provide assistance to
customers where and when they need it.

Standard maintenance support includes three major
components: our Sourcelink® online support portal, which
provides 24 hour access to real-time technical information
on our products; contact center support — telephone,
email and web access to our support engineers; and software
updates — periodic updates with regression-tested
critical fixes and updated functionality available via CDs or
secure internet download.

Maintenance is offered to customers as an
integral, non-cancelable component of our subscription license
agreements, or as a separate agreement subject to annual renewal
for our term and perpetual license agreements. During the recent
downturn in the electronics industry, some customers facing
constrained budgets elected not to renew maintenance agreements
associated with license agreements with us.

Some of our customers have relocated, or expanded
the presence of their design teams away from their headquarters
or historical locations to less expensive locations in emerging
growth regions. Accordingly, to provide the most responsive and
effective support for our customers, we expect to continue to
expand the presence of our own support and application
engineering teams into emerging growth regions around the world.



Maintenance revenues represented 29% of our total
revenue in 2003, 26% in 2002 and 24% in 2001. Maintenance
revenue in 2004 will be predominately generated from backlog.

Services

We offer a number of fee-based services,
including education and engineering services related to design
and methodology services. These services may be sold and
performed in conjunction with the sale, lease or license of our
products or sold separately.

Services revenue represented 12% of our total
revenue in 2003, 11% in 2002 and 18% in 2001.

Education Services

Our educational services include Internet,
classroom and custom courses, the content of which ranges from
how to use the most recent product features to instructions in
the latest design techniques.

Design and Methodology Services

We offer engineering services and reusable design
technologies to aid customers with the design of complex ICs. We
focus our offerings primarily on SoC devices, including both
Application Specific Integrated Circuits, or ASICS, and
Application Specific Standard Parts, and on analog and mixed
signal ICs. The customers for these services primarily consist
of semiconductor and systems companies developing products for
the communications, computing, and consumer market segments. We
offer engineering capabilities to assist customers from product
concept through volume manufacturing.

We also make our design intellectual property, or
design IP, portfolio available to customers as part of our
complete technology and services solution. These reusable design
and methodology components enable us to more efficiently deliver
our services, and allow our customers to reduce the design
complexity and time to market for the development of complex
SoCs.

In our design and methodology service practices,
we leverage our cumulative experience and knowledge of design
practices across many customers and different design
environments to improve our own service teams’ and our
customers’ productivity. We work with customers using
outsourcing, consultative and collaborative models depending on
their projects and needs. Our Virtual Computer-Aided Design, or
VCAD, model enables our engineering teams at one or more of our
locations to virtually work “side-by-side” with our
customers’ teams located elsewhere during the course of
their design and engineering projects through a secure private
network infrastructure.

Through collaboration with our customers, we are
able to design advanced ICs, gaining direct and early visibility
to industry design issues that may not be addressed adequately
by today’s design automation solutions. This enables us to
accelerate the development of new software technology to meet
the market’s current and future design requirements.

Marketing and Sales

We generally use a direct sales force consisting
of sales people and applications engineers to market our
products and provide maintenance and services to existing and
prospective customers. Applications engineers provide technical
pre-sales as well as post-sales support for software products.
Our Methodology Services group provides on-site resources and
capabilities to help customers improve productivity with their
design activity. Due to the complexity of EDA products and the
electronic design process in general, the sales cycle is
generally long, requiring three to six months or more. During
the sales cycle, our direct sales force generally provides
technical presentations, product demonstrations and support for
on-site customer evaluation of our software. We also use
traditional marketing approaches to promote our products and
services, including advertising, direct mail, telemarketing,
trade shows, public relations and the Internet.

Internationally, we market and support our
products and services primarily through our subsidiaries. Until
June 28, 2003, we licensed most of our software products in
Japan through Innotech Corporation, of which we



are an approximately 15% stockholder. In June
2003, we purchased certain assets from Innotech, including
distribution rights for certain customers in Japan. Since June
2003, we directly license our software products to customers for
which we acquired the distribution rights from Innotech.

Research and Development

Our investment in research and development was
$340.1 million in 2003, $326.4 million in 2002 and
$297.3 million in 2001.

The primary areas of our research include SoC
design, the design of silicon devices in the nanometer range,
high-speed board design, architectural-level design,
high-performance logic verification technology and hardware/
software co-design. Because the electronics industry combines
rapid innovation with rapidly increasing design and
manufacturing complexity, we focus significant investment on
enhancing our current products, as well as creating new products
and techniques.

Our future performance depends largely on our
ability to maintain and enhance our current product lines to
meet advancing semiconductor manufacturing capability, develop
or acquire new products and services from third parties,
maintain technological competitiveness and meet increasingly
complex customer requirements. In addition to research and
development conducted within each of our segments, we maintain
Cadence Laboratories, an advanced research group responsible for
exploring new directions and applications of our technologies,
migrating new technologies into our existing offerings and
maintaining strong industry relationships.

Manufacturing and Distribution

Our software production operations consist of
configuring the customer’s order, outsourcing the recording
of the product electronically or on CD-ROM, and producing
customer-unique access keys allowing customers to use licensed
products. Software and documentation are generally made
available to customers by secured electronic delivery. User
manuals and other documentation are generally available on
CD-ROM, but are occasionally supplied in hard copy format.

Cadence performs final assembly and test of its
hardware verification, acceleration and emulation products in
San Jose, California. Subcontractors manufacture all major
subassemblies, including all individual printed circuit boards
and custom ICs, and supply them to us for qualification and
testing prior to their incorporation into the assembled product.

Proprietary Technology

Our success depends, in part, upon our
proprietary technology. We generally rely on patents,
copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, licenses and
restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary
rights in technology and products. Many of our products include
software or other intellectual property licensed from third
parties. We may have to seek new or renew existing licenses for
this third party software and other intellectual property in the
future. As part of performing design services for customers, our
design services business licenses certain software and other
intellectual property of third parties, including that of our
competitors.

Competition

The competitive conditions for our Products and
Maintenance segments are closely related. In these segments, we
compete in the EDA market primarily with three other significant
companies: Synopsys, Inc., Mentor Graphics Corporation and
Magma Design Automation, Inc. In 2002 and 2003,
Synopsys, Inc. acquired two significant companies, Avant!
Corporation and Numerical Technologies, Inc., and the
combined companies offer a broader product range than any of
them did before the mergers. We also compete with numerous
smaller EDA companies, with manufacturers of electronic devices
that have developed or have the capability to develop their own
EDA products, and with numerous electronics design and consulting



companies. We generally compete on the basis of
product quality and features, integration in a platform or
compatibility with other tools, price and payment terms and
maintenance offerings.

Our Maintenance business flows directly from the
Products business. The competitive issues associated with the
Maintenance segment are substantially the same as those for the
Products segment in that every maintenance contract is the
direct result of a product contract, and once we have entered
into a product contract, maintenance is generally purchased by
the customer to ensure that the customer will receive access to
bug fixes and service releases, as and when they are made
available, and other continued support.

Certain competitive factors in the Services
business as described in this annual report on form 10-K differ
from those of the Products and Maintenance businesses. We
compete less with other EDA companies in this business segment,
and more with independent design service businesses. These
companies vary greatly in focus, geographic location,
capability, cost structure and pricing. In addition,
manufacturers of electronic devices may be reluctant to purchase
services from independent vendors, such as Cadence, because they
wish to promote their own internal design departments. We
compete with these companies by focusing on the design of
complex analog and digital ICs. It is our strategy to use design
services as a differentiator to further promote our Products and
Maintenance businesses.

Backlog

Our backlog on January 3, 2004 was
approximately $1.6 billion as compared to $1.4 billion
on December 28, 2002. Backlog consists of revenue to be
recognized over multiple fiscal periods after January 3,
2004:

•

From the sale or lease of hardware and
    subscription licenses for software products;

•

For maintenance contracts on hardware and
    software products;

•

From orders for hardware and software products
    sold on perpetual and term licenses on which customers have
    requested delivery dates after January 3, 2004;

•

To be recognized under term licenses under which
    payments are in less than near equal installments;

•

From license arrangements for which
    collectibility is not probable;

•

From the undelivered portion of services
    contracts that is recognized on a percentage-of-completion
    basis; and

•

From services contracts recognized under the
    completed contract method for which services have not yet been
    completed.

The substantial majority of our backlog is
generated by our product and maintenance segments, as customer
licenses generally include both product and maintenance
components. Services is not a significant component of backlog.
We expect that maintenance revenue in 2004 will be predominately
generated from backlog. We have not historically experienced
significant cancellations of our contracts with customers.
However, we often reschedule the required completion dates of
services contracts which, at times, defers revenue recognition
under those contracts beyond the original expected completion
date. Changes in customer license types or payment terms also
can impact the timing of revenue recognition. See “Software
Licensing Arrangements” for discussion of product revenue
recognized from backlog.

Revenue Seasonality

Historically, orders and revenue have been lowest
in our first quarter and highest in our fourth quarter, with a
material decline between the fourth quarter of one year and the
first quarter of the next year. We expect the first quarter will
remain our lowest quarter for orders and revenues; orders and
revenues in other quarters will vary based on the particular
timing and type of licenses entered into with large customers.

Employees

As of February 7, 2004, we employed
approximately 4,800 individuals, with approximately 2,250 in
sales, services, marketing, support and manufacturing
activities, approximately 1,900 in product development and



approximately 650 in management, administration
and finance. None of our employees is represented by a labor
union, and we have experienced no work stoppages. We believe
that our employee relations are good.

Software Licensing Arrangements

We sell software using three license types:
subscription, term and perpetual. Customers who prefer to
license technology for a specified, limited period of time will
choose either a subscription or term license and customers who
prefer to have the right to use the technology continuously
without time restriction choose perpetual licenses. Customers
who desire rights to remix in new technology during the life of
the contract select a subscription license, which allows
customers limited access to unspecified new technology on a
when-and-if-available basis, as opposed to a term or perpetual
license which does not include remix rights to new technology.
Payment terms for subscription and term licenses generally
provide for installments over the license period and for
perpetual licenses generally are net 30 days.

Our revenue recognition depends on a number of
contract-specific terms and conditions, including the license
type, payment terms, creditworthiness of the customer and other
factors as more fully described under the heading “Critical
Accounting Estimates” under Item 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.” Revenue associated
with subscription licenses is recognized over multiple periods
over the license term whereas product revenue associated with
term and perpetual licenses may be eligible for revenue
recognition upon the effective date and delivery of the license,
assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been
met.

Product revenue recognized from backlog comprised
approximately 60% of total product revenue in 2003, 45% in 2002
and 30% in 2001. Our revenue and results of operations may fall
short of expectations due to the actual mix of license types
executed in any given period and due to other contract-specific
terms and conditions as discussed above. We are subject to
greater credit risk on subscription and term licenses, as
compared to perpetual licenses, due to the installment payment
terms generally associated with those license types. Otherwise,
the particular risks to us of one license type versus another
type do not vary considerably.

From time to time we sell receivables from our
licenses with installment payment terms on a non-recourse basis
to third party financing institutions.

For further discussion of our license agreements,
revenue recognition policies and results of operations, please
refer to “Critical Accounting Estimates” found in
Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

International Operations

We have offices located in China, France,
Germany, India, Japan, Russia, Taiwan, the United Kingdom
and other areas throughout the world. These offices primarily
provide sales, research and development and operational support
functions. We consider customer sales and support requirements,
the availability of a skilled workforce, costs and efficiencies
among other relative benefits when determining what operations
to locate internationally. For additional information regarding
our international operations see Note 19, Segment
Reporting, to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Factors That May Affect Future
Results

Our business faces many risks. Described below
are what we believe to be the material risks that we face. If
any of the events or circumstances described in the following
risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or
results of operations could suffer.



Risks Related to Our Business

We are subject to the cyclical nature of
the integrated circuit and electronics systems industries, and
any

downturn
may reduce our revenue.

Purchases of our products and services are
dependent upon the commencement of new design projects by IC
manufacturers and electronics systems companies. The IC industry
is cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid
technological change, rapid product obsolescence and price
erosion, evolving standards, short product life cycles and wide
fluctuations in product supply and demand.

The IC and electronics systems industries have
experienced significant downturns, often connected with, or in
anticipation of, maturing product cycles of both these
industries’ and their customers’ products and a
decline in general economic conditions. These downturns have
been characterized by diminished product demand, production
overcapacity, high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of
average selling prices.

Since 2001, IC manufacturers and electronics
systems companies have experienced a downturn in demand and
production which has resulted in reduced research and
development spending by many of our customers. While many of
these companies appear to have experienced a gradual recovery in
the second half of 2003, they have continued their focus on cost
containment. Any economic downturn could harm our business,
operating results and financial condition.

Our failure to respond quickly to
technological developments could make our products uncompetitive

and
obsolete.

The industries in which we compete experience
rapid technology developments, changes in industry standards,
changes in customer requirements and frequent new product
introductions and improvements. Currently, the industries we
serve are experiencing several revolutionary trends:

•

Migration to nanometer design: the size of
    features such as wires, transistors and contacts on ICs is
    shrinking due to advances in semiconductor manufacturing
    processes. Process feature sizes refer to the width of the
    transistors and the width and spacing of the interconnect on the
    IC. Feature size is normally identified by the headline
    transistor length, which is shrinking from 180 nanometers
    to 130 nanometers and smaller. This is commonly referred to
    in the semiconductor industry as the migration to nanometer
    design. It represents a major challenge for participants in the
    semiconductor industry, from IC design and design automation to
    design of manufacturing equipment and the manufacturing process
    itself. Shrinkage of transistor length to such infinitesimal
    proportions is challenging fundamental laws of physics and
    chemistry.

•

The ability to design System-on-Chip, or
    SoC, ICs increases the complexity of managing a design that
    at the lowest level is represented by billions of shapes on the
    fabrication mask. In addition, SoCs typically incorporate
    microprocessors and digital signal processors that are
    programmed with software, requiring simultaneous design of the
    IC and the related software embedded on the IC.

•

Increased capability of Field-Programmable Gate
    Array, or FPGA, technologies creates an alternative to IC
    implementation for some electronics companies. This could reduce
    demand for Cadence’s IC implementation products and
    services.

•

A growing number of low-cost design services
    businesses could reduce the need for some IC companies to invest
    in EDA products.

•

The challenges of nanometer design are leading
    some customers to work with older, less risky manufacturing
    processes. This may reduce their need to upgrade their EDA
    products and design flows.

If we are unable to respond quickly and
successfully to these developments and the evolution of these
changes, we may lose our competitive position, and our products
or technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete. To compete
successfully, we must develop or acquire new products and
improve our existing products and processes on a schedule that
keeps pace with technological developments in our industries. We
must also be able to support a range of changing computer
software, hardware platforms and customer preferences. We cannot
guarantee that we will be successful in this effort.



We have experienced varied quarterly
operating results, and our operating results for any
particular

fiscal
period are affected by the timing of significant orders for our
software products, fluctuations

in
customer preferences for license types and the timing of
recognition of revenue under those

license
types.

We have experienced, and may continue to
experience, varied quarterly operating results. In particular,
we have experienced quarterly net losses for three of the past
four quarters, and we may experience net losses in future
periods. In addition, we recorded a net loss for the fiscal year
ended January 3, 2004. Various factors affect our quarterly
operating results and some of them are not within our control.
Our quarterly operating results are affected by the timing of
significant orders for our software products because a
significant number of licenses for our software products are in
excess of $5.0 million. The failure to complete a license
for one or more orders for our software products in a particular
quarter could seriously harm our operating results for that
quarter.

Our operating results are also affected by the
mix of license types executed in any given period. We license
software using three different license types: term, subscription
and perpetual. Product revenue associated with term and
perpetual licenses is generally recognized at the beginning of
the license period, whereas product revenue associated with
subscription licenses is recognized over multiple periods over
the term of the license. Revenue may also be deferred under term
and perpetual licenses until payments become due and payable
from customers with nonlinear payment terms or as cash is
collected from customers with lower credit ratings.

We continue to experience increasing customer
preference for our subscription licenses and requests for more
flexible payment terms. We expect revenue recognized from
backlog to increase as a percentage of product revenue, on an
annual basis, assuming that customers continue to prefer
subscription licenses, or continue to request more flexible
payment terms, both of which cause revenue to be recognized over
time. In addition, revenue is impacted by the timing of license
renewals, changes in the extent to which contracts contain
flexible payment terms and changes in the mix of license types
(i.e., perpetual, term or subscription) for existing customers,
which changes could have the effect of accelerating or delaying
the recognition of revenue from the timing of recognition under
the original contract.

We plan operating expense levels primarily based
on forecasted revenue levels. These expenses and the impact of
long-term commitments are relatively fixed in the short term. A
shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results below
expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these
fixed expenses in response to short-term business changes.

You should not view our historical results of
operations as reliable indicators of our future performance. If
revenue or operating results fall short of the levels expected
by public market analysts and investors, the trading price of
our common stock could decline dramatically.

Our future revenue is dependent in part
upon our installed customer base continuing to license
additional

products,
renew maintenance agreements and purchase additional
services.

Our installed customer base has traditionally
generated additional new license, service and maintenance
revenues. In future periods, customers may not necessarily
license additional products or contract for additional services
or maintenance. Maintenance is generally renewable annually at a
customer’s option, and there are no mandatory payment
obligations or obligations to license additional software. If
our customers decide not to renew their maintenance agreements
or license additional products or contract for additional
services, or if they reduce the scope of the maintenance
agreements, our revenue could decrease, which could have an
adverse effect on our results of operations.

We may not receive significant revenues
from our current research and development efforts for
several

years,
if at all.

Internally developing software products and
integrating acquired software products into existing platforms
is expensive, and these investments often require a long time to
generate returns. Our strategy involves



significant investments in software research and
development and related product opportunities. We believe that
we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources
to our research and development efforts to maintain our
competitive position. However, we cannot predict that we will
receive significant revenues from these investments, if at all.

We have acquired and expect to acquire
other companies and businesses and may not realize the
expected

benefits
of these acquisitions.

We have acquired and expect to acquire other
companies and businesses in the future. While we expect to
carefully analyze all potential acquisitions before committing
to the transaction, we cannot assure you that our management
will be able to integrate and manage acquired products and
businesses effectively or that the acquisitions will result in
long-term benefits to us or our stockholders. In addition,
acquisitions involve a number of risks. If any of the following
events occurs after we acquire another business, it could
seriously harm our business, operating results and financial
condition:

•

Difficulties in combining previously separate
    businesses into a single unit;

•

The substantial diversion of management’s
    attention from day-to-day business when evaluating and
    negotiating these transactions and then integrating an acquired
    business;

•

The discovery, after completion of the
    acquisition, of liabilities assumed from the acquired business
    or of assets acquired that are not realizable;

•

The failure to realize anticipated benefits such
    as cost savings and revenue enhancements;

•

The failure to retain key employees of the
    acquired business;

•

Difficulties related to assimilating the products
    of an acquired business in, for example, distribution,
    engineering and customer support areas;

•

Unanticipated costs;

•

Customer dissatisfaction with existing license
    agreements with Cadence which may preclude access to products
    acquired by Cadence after the effective date of the
    license; and

•

Failure to understand and compete effectively in
    markets in which we have limited previous experience.

In a number of our acquisitions, we have agreed
to make future cash or stock payments based on the performance
of the businesses we acquired. The performance goals pursuant to
which these future payments may be made generally relate to
achievement by the acquired business of certain specified
bookings, revenue, product proliferation, product development or
employee retention goals during a specified period following
completion of the applicable acquisition. Future acquisitions
may involve issuances of stock as payment of the purchase price
for the acquired business and also incentive stock or option
grants to employees of the acquired businesses (which may be
dilutive to existing stockholders), expenditure of substantial
cash resources or the incurrence of material amounts of debt.

The specific performance goal levels and amounts
and timing of contingent purchase price payments vary with each
acquisition. In the fiscal year ended January 3, 2004, we
paid $2.4 million in cash and issued 3.7 million
shares, valued at $57.7 million, to former stockholders of
acquired companies, as contingent purchase price.

The additional goodwill and deferred stock
compensation relates to the achievement of certain performance
goals related to bookings, product proliferation, product
development or employee retention resulting from acquisitions.
The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for income tax
purposes.

In connection with our acquisitions completed
prior to January 3, 2004, we may be obligated to pay up to
an aggregate of $39.1 million in cash and issue a total of
0.8 million shares of our common stock during fiscal 2004.
In addition, we may be required to pay an additional
$76.0 million in cash from 2005 through 2007 if certain
performance goals related to bookings, revenues, product
development, product proliferation or employee retention are
achieved in full.



Future acquisitions may result in increased
goodwill and other intangible assets, in addition to
acquisition-related charges. These assets may eventually be
written down to the extent they are deemed to be impaired, and
any such write-downs would adversely affect our results.

Our failure to attract, train, motivate and
retain key employees may make us less competitive in
our

industries
and therefore harm our results of operations.

Our business depends on the efforts and abilities
of our senior management, our research and development staff,
and a number of other key management, sales, support, technical
and services employees. The high cost of training new employees,
not fully utilizing these employees, or losing trained employees
to competing employers could reduce our gross margins and harm
our business and operating results. Even in the current economic
climate, competition for highly skilled employees can be
intense, particularly in geographic areas recognized as high
technology centers such as the Silicon Valley area, where our
principal offices are located, and the other locations where we
maintain facilities. If economic conditions improve and job
opportunities in the technology industry become more plentiful,
we may experience increased employee attrition and increased
competition for skilled employees. To attract, retain and
motivate individuals with the requisite expertise, we may be
required to grant large numbers of stock options or other
stock-based incentive awards, which may be dilutive to existing
stockholders. We may also be required to pay key employees
significant base salaries and cash bonuses, which could harm our
operating results. Additionally, if certain proposed accounting
standards were adopted we would be required to record a charge
to compensation expense for option grants.

In addition, new regulations have been adopted by
the NYSE that require stockholder approval for new stock option
plans and significant amendments to existing plans, including
increases in options, and that prohibit NYSE member
organizations from giving a proxy to vote on equity compensation
plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has given voting
instructions. These new regulations could make it more difficult
for us to grant options to employees in the future. To the
extent that new regulations make it more difficult or expensive
to grant options to employees, we may incur increased
compensation costs or find it difficult to attract, retain and
motivate employees, which could materially and adversely affect
our business.

The competition in our industries is
substantial and we cannot assure you that we will be able to
continue

to
successfully compete in our industries.

The EDA market and the commercial electronics
design and methodology services industries are highly
competitive. If we fail to compete successfully in these
industries, it could seriously harm our business, operating
results and financial condition. To compete in these industries,
we must identify and develop or acquire innovative and cost
competitive EDA products, integrate them into platforms and
market them in a timely manner. We must also gain industry
acceptance for our design and methodology services and offer
better strategic concepts, technical solutions, prices and
response time, or a combination of these factors, than those of
other design companies and the internal design departments of
electronics manufacturers. We cannot assure you that we will be
able to compete successfully in these industries. Factors that
could affect our ability to succeed include:

•

The development by others of competitive EDA
    products or platforms and design and methodology services could
    result in a shift of customer preferences away from our products
    and services and significantly decrease revenue;

•

Decisions by electronics manufacturers to perform
    design and methodology services internally, rather than purchase
    these services from outside vendors due to budget constraints or
    excess engineering capacity;

•

The challenges of developing (or acquiring
    externally-developed) technology solutions which are adequate
    and competitive in meeting the requirements of next-generation
    design challenges;

•

The significant number of current and potential
    competitors in the EDA industry and the low cost of entry;

•

Intense competition to attract acquisition
    targets, which may make it more difficult for us to acquire
    companies at an acceptable price or at all; and



•

The combination of or collaboration among many
    EDA companies to deliver more comprehensive offerings than they
    could individually.

We currently compete in the EDA market primarily
with Synopsys, Inc., Mentor Graphics Corporation and Magma
Design Automation, Inc. In 2002 and 2003,
Synopsys, Inc. acquired two significant companies, Avant!
Corporation and Numerical Technologies, Inc., and the
combined companies offer a broader product range than any of
them did before the mergers. We also compete with numerous
smaller EDA companies, with manufacturers of electronic devices
that have developed or have the capability to develop their own
EDA products, and with numerous electronics design and
consulting companies. Manufacturers of electronic devices may be
reluctant to purchase services from independent vendors such as
us because they wish to promote their own internal design
departments.

We may need to change our pricing models to
compete successfully.

The intensely competitive markets in which we
compete can put pressure on us to reduce our prices. If our
competitors offer deep discounts on certain products in an
effort to recapture or gain market share or to sell other
software or hardware products, we may then need to lower prices
or offer other favorable terms to compete successfully. Any such
changes would be likely to reduce margins and can adversely
affect operating results. Any broadly-based changes to our
prices and pricing policies could cause sales and software
license revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force
implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies.
Some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional
purposes or as a long-term pricing strategy or provide
guarantees of prices and product implementations. These
practices could, over time, significantly constrain the prices
that we can charge for our products. If we cannot offset price
reductions with a corresponding increase in the number of sales
or with lower spending, then the reduced license revenues
resulting from lower prices could have an adverse affect on our
results of operations.

We rely on our proprietary technology as
well as software and other intellectual property rights licensed
to

us by third parties, and we cannot assure
    you that the precautions taken to protect our rights will be
    adequate or that we will continue to be able to adequately
    secure such intellectual property rights from third
    parties.

Our success depends, in part, upon our
proprietary technology. We generally rely on patents,
copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, licenses and
restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary
rights in technology and products. Despite precautions we may
take to protect our intellectual property, we cannot assure you
that third parties will not try to challenge, invalidate or
circumvent these safeguards. We also cannot assure you that the
rights granted under our patents or attendant to our other
intellectual property will provide us with any competitive
advantages, or that patents will be issued on any of our pending
applications, or that future patents will be sufficiently broad
to protect our technology. Furthermore, the laws of foreign
countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those
countries to the same extent as applicable law protects these
rights in the United States. Many of our products include
software or other intellectual property licensed from third
parties. We may have to seek new or renew existing licenses for
such software and other intellectual property in the future. Our
design services business holds licenses to certain software and
other intellectual property owned by third parties. Our failure
to obtain, for our use, software or other intellectual property
licenses or other intellectual property rights on favorable
terms, or the need to engage in litigation over these licenses
or rights, could seriously harm our business, operating results
and financial condition.

Intellectual property infringement by or
against us could result in our loss of key
technology.

There are numerous patents in the EDA industry
and new patents are being issued at a rapid rate. It is not
always practicable to determine in advance whether a product or
any of its components infringes the patent rights of others. As
a result, from time to time, we may be forced to respond to or
prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to protect
our rights or defend a customer’s rights. These claims,
regardless of merit, could consume valuable management time,
result in costly litigation, or cause product shipment delays,
all of which could seriously harm our business, operating
results and financial condition. In settling these



claims, we may be required to enter into royalty
or licensing agreements with the third parties claiming
infringement. These royalty or licensing agreements, if
available, may not have terms favorable to us. Being forced to
enter into a license agreement with unfavorable terms could
seriously harm our business, operating results and financial
condition. Any potential intellectual property litigation could
force us to do one or more of the following:

•

Pay damages, license fees or royalties to the
    party claiming infringement;

•

Stop licensing products or providing services
    that use the challenged intellectual property;

•

Obtain a license from the owner of the infringed
    intellectual property to sell or use the relevant technology,
    which license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at
    all; or

•

Redesign the challenged technology, which could
    be time-consuming and costly.

If we were forced to take any of these actions,
our business and results of operations may suffer.

We may not be able to effectively implement
our restructuring activities, and our restructuring
activities

may not result in the expected benefits,
    which would negatively impact our future results of
    operations.

The EDA market and the commercial electronics
design and methodology services industries are highly
competitive and change quickly. We have responded to increased
competition and changes in the industries in which we compete by
restructuring our operations and reducing the size of our
workforce. Despite our restructuring efforts over the last few
years, we cannot assure you that we will achieve all of the
operating expense reductions and improvements in operating
margins and cash flows currently anticipated from these
restructuring activities in the periods contemplated, or at all.
Our inability to realize these benefits, and our failure to
appropriately structure our business to meet market conditions,
could negatively impact our results of operations.

As part of our recent restructuring activities,
we have reduced the workforce in certain revenue-generating
portions of our business, particularly in our services business.
This reduction in staffing levels could require us to forego
certain future strategic opportunities due to limited resources,
which could negatively affect our long-term revenues.

In addition, these workforce reductions could
result in a lack of focus and reduced productivity by remaining
employees due to changes in responsibilities or concern about
future prospects, which in turn may negatively affect our future
revenues. Further, we believe our future success depends, in
large part, on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled
personnel. Our restructuring activities could negatively affect
our ability to attract such personnel as a result of perceived
risk of future workforce reductions.

We also cannot assure you that we will not be
required to implement further restructuring activities or
reductions in our workforce based on changes in the markets and
industries in which we compete or that any future restructuring
efforts will be successful.

The lengthy sales cycle of our products and
services makes the timing of our revenue difficult to predict
and

may cause our operating results to
    fluctuate unexpectedly.

We have a lengthy sales cycle that generally
extends at least three to six months. The length of the sales
cycle may cause our revenue and operating results to vary
unexpectedly from quarter to quarter. The complexity and expense
associated with our business generally requires a lengthy
customer education, evaluation and approval process.
Consequently, we may incur substantial expenses and devote
significant management effort and expense to develop potential
relationships that do not result in agreements or revenue and
may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities.

In addition, sales of our products and services
may be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of
projects because of:

•

The timing of customers’ competitive
    evaluation processes; or

•

Customers’ budgetary constraints and budget
    cycles.



Lengthy sales cycles for acceleration and
emulation hardware products subject us to a number of
significant risks over which we have limited control, including
insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory, variations in
inventory valuation and fluctuations in quarterly operating
results.

Also, because of the timing of large orders and
our customers’ buying patterns, we may not learn of
bookings shortfalls, revenue shortfalls, earnings shortfalls or
other failures to meet market expectations until late in a
fiscal quarter, which could cause even more immediate and
serious harm to the trading price of our common stock.

The profitability of our services business
depends on factors that are difficult to control, such as the
high

cost of our services employees, our cost of
    performing our fixed-price services contracts and the success of
    our design services business, which has historically suffered
    losses.

To be successful in our services business, we
must overcome several factors that are difficult to control,
including the following:

•

Our cost of services employees is high and
    reduces our gross margin.

Gross margin
    represents the difference between the amount of revenue from the
    sale of services and our cost of providing those services. We
    must pay high salaries to attract and retain professional
    services employees. This results in a lower gross margin than
    the gross margin in our software business. In addition, the high
    cost of training new services employees or not fully utilizing
    these employees can significantly lower gross margin. It is
    difficult to adjust staffing levels quickly to reflect customer
    demand for services; therefore, the services business has in the
    past and could continue to experience losses.

•

A portion of services contracts consists of
    fixed-price contracts.

Some of our
    customers pay a fixed price for services provided, regardless of
    the cost we must incur to perform the contract. If our cost in
    performing the services were to exceed the amount the customer
    has agreed to pay, we would experience a loss on the contract,
    which could harm our business, operating results and financial
    condition.

•

We have historically suffered losses in our
    design services business.

The market
    for electronics design services is sensitive to customer
    budgetary constraints and engineering capacity. Our design
    services business has historically suffered losses. If our
    design services business fails to increase its revenue to offset
    its expenses, the design services business will continue to
    experience losses. Our failure to succeed in the design services
    business may harm our business, operating results and financial
    condition.

Our international operations may seriously
harm our financial condition because of the effect of
foreign

exchange rate fluctuations and other risks
    to our international business.

We have significant operations outside the United
States. Our revenue from international operations as a
percentage of total revenue was approximately 44% in 2003, 45%
in 2002 and 45% in 2001. We expect that revenue from our
international operations will continue to account for a
significant portion of our total revenue. We also transact
business in various foreign currencies. Recent economic and
political uncertainty and the volatility of foreign currencies
in certain regions, most notably the Japanese yen and the
European Union euro, have had, and may continue to have, a
seriously harmful effect on our revenue and operating results.

Fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the
U.S. dollar and the currencies of other countries in which
we conduct business could seriously harm our business, operating
results and financial condition. For example, if there is an
increase in the rate at which a foreign currency exchanges into
U.S. dollars, it will take more of the foreign currency to
equal the same amount of U.S. dollars than before the rate
increase. If we price our products and services in the foreign
currency, we will receive fewer U.S. dollars than we did
before the rate increase went into effect. If we price our
products and services in U.S. dollars, an increase in the
exchange rate will result in an increase in the price for our
products and services compared to those products of our
competitors that are priced in local currency. This could result
in our prices being uncompetitive in markets where business is
transacted in the local currency.



Exposure to foreign currency transaction risk can
arise when transactions are conducted in a currency different
from the functional currency of one of our subsidiaries. A
subsidiary’s functional currency is the currency in which
it primarily conducts its operations, including product pricing,
expenses and borrowings. Although we attempt to reduce the
impact of foreign currency fluctuations, significant exchange
rate movements may hurt our results of operations as expressed
in U.S. dollars.

Our international operations may also be subject
to other risks, including:

•

The adoption and expansion of government trade
    restrictions;

•

Limitations on repatriation of earnings;

•

Limitations on the conversion of foreign
    currencies;

•

Reduced protection of intellectual property
    rights in some countries;

•

Recessions in foreign economies;

•

Longer collection periods for receivables and
    greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;

•

Difficulties in managing foreign operations;

•

Political and economic instability;

•

Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;

•

Tariffs and other trade barriers; and

•

U.S. government licensing requirements for
    exports which may lengthen the sales cycle or restrict or
    prohibit the sale or licensing of certain products.

We have offices throughout the world, including
key research facilities outside of the United States. Our
operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations
throughout the world. Activities that interfere with our
international connectivity, such as computer “hacking”
or the introduction of a virus into our computer systems, could
significantly interfere with our business operations.

Our operating results could be adversely
affected as a result of changes in our effective tax
rates.

Our future effective tax rates could be adversely
affected by the following:

•

Earnings being lower than anticipated in
    countries where we are taxed at lower statutory rates as
    compared to the U.S. tax rate;

•

An increase in expenses not deductible for tax
    purposes, including write-offs of acquired in-process technology
    and impairment of goodwill;

•

Changes in the valuation of our deferred tax
    assets and liabilities; or

•

Changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such
    tax laws.

Any significant change in our future effective
tax rates could adversely impact our results of operations for
future periods.

We have received an examination report from
the Internal Revenue Service proposing a tax deficiency
in

certain of our tax returns, and the outcome
    of the examination or any future examinations involving similar
    claims may have a material adverse effect on our results of
    operations and cash flows.

The IRS and other tax authorities regularly
examine our income tax returns. The IRS recently completed its
field examination of our federal income tax returns for the
fiscal years 1997 through 1999 and has issued a Revenue
Agent’s Report, referred to as the RAR, in which the IRS
proposes to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the
three-year period of approximately $143 million, plus
interest, which interest will accrue until the matter is
resolved. This interest is compounded daily at rates published
by the IRS, which rates have been between four and nine percent
since 1997, and adjusts quarterly. The IRS may also make similar
claims for years subsequent to 1999 in future examinations. The
RAR is not a final Statutory Notice of Deficiency, and we have
filed a protest to certain of the proposed adjustments with the
IRS.

The most significant of the disputed adjustments
relates to transfer pricing arrangements that we have with a
foreign subsidiary. We believe that the proposed IRS adjustments
are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws, and that we have
meritorious defenses to the proposed adjustments. We are
challenging these proposed adjustments vigorously.



Significant judgment is required in determining
our provision for income taxes. In determining the adequacy of
our provision for income taxes, we regularly assess the
likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these
examinations, including the current IRS assessments. However,
the ultimate outcome of tax examinations cannot be predicted
with certainty, including the total amount payable or the timing
of any such payments upon resolution of these issues. In
addition, we cannot assure you that such amount will not be
materially different than that which is reflected in our
historical income tax provisions and accruals. Should the IRS or
other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of a
current or a future examination, we may be required to record
charges to operations in future periods that could have a
material impact on the results of operations, financial position
or cash flows in the applicable period or periods recorded.

Failure to obtain export licenses could
harm our business by rendering us unable to ship products and
transfer

our technology outside of the United
    States.

We must comply with U.S. Department of
Commerce regulations in shipping our software products and
transferring our technology outside the United States and to
foreign nationals. Although we have not had any significant
difficulty complying with these regulations so far, any
significant future difficulty in complying could harm our
business, operating results and financial condition.

Proposed regulations related to equity
compensation could cause us to recognize an additional expense,
which

would result in a reduction in our net
    income.

On March 31, 2004, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board, or FASB, consistent with recent actions of
other accounting agencies and entities, issued a proposed
Statement “Share Based Payment, an Amendment of FASB
Statements No. 123 and 95” relating to the
accounting for equity-based compensation. This Statement
proposes changes to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles, or GAAP, that, if implemented, would require us to
record a charge to compensation expense for stock option grants.
We currently account for stock options under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”. As
permitted by SFAS No. 123, we have elected to use the
intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25, or APB Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” to measure
compensation expense for stock-based awards granted to
employees, under which the granting of stock options is not
considered compensation, if the option exercise price is not
less than the fair market value of the common stock at the grant
date. The FASB’s proposal would eliminate our ability,
starting in 2005, to account for stock-based awards using the
intrinsic value method prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25 and
would instead require that such awards be accounted for using a
fair-value based method, which would require us to measure the
compensation expense for all such awards, including stock
options, at fair-value at the grant date. We cannot predict
whether the proposed regulations will be adopted, but if adopted
they would have an adverse affect on our results of operations.

Errors or defects in our products and
services could expose us to liability and harm our
reputation.

Our customers use our products and services in
designing and developing products that involve a high degree of
technological complexity, each of which has its own
specifications. Because of the complexity of the systems and
products with which we work, some of our products and designs
can be adequately tested only when put to full use in the
marketplace. As a result, our customers or their end users may
discover errors or defects in our software or the systems we
design, or the products or systems incorporating our design and
intellectual property may not operate as expected. Errors or
defects could result in:

•

Loss of current customers and loss of or delay in
    revenue and loss of market share;

•

Failure to attract new customers or achieve
    market acceptance;

•

Diversion of development resources to resolve the
    problem;

•

Increased service costs; and

•

Liability for damages.



If we become subject to unfair hiring
claims, we could be prevented from hiring needed employees,
incur

liability for damages and incur substantial
    costs in defending ourselves.

Companies in our industry whose employees accept
positions with competitors frequently claim that these
competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the
employment of these persons would involve the disclosure or use
of trade secrets. These claims could prevent us from hiring
employees or cause us to incur liability for damages. We could
also incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or our
employees against these claims, regardless of their merits.
Defending ourselves from these claims could also divert the
attention of our management from our operations.

Our business is subject to the risk of
earthquakes, floods and other natural catastrophic
events.

Our corporate headquarters, including certain of
our research and development operations, and certain of our
distribution facilities, are located in the Silicon Valley area
of Northern California, which is a region known to experience
seismic activity. In addition, several of our facilities,
including our corporate headquarters, certain of our research
and development operations, and certain of our distribution
operations, are in areas of San Jose, California that have
been identified by the Director of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, or FEMA, as being located in a special flood
area. The areas at risk are identified as being in a one hundred
year flood plain, using FEMA’s Flood Hazard Boundary Map or
the Flood Insurance Rate Map. If significant seismic or flooding
activity were to occur, our operations may be interrupted, which
would adversely impact our business and results of operations.

We maintain research and other facilities
in parts of the world that are not as politically stable as
the

United States, and as a result we may face
    a higher risk of business interruption from acts of war or
    terrorism than other businesses located only or primarily in the
    United States.

We maintain international research and other
facilities, some of which are in parts of the world that are not
as politically stable as the United States. Consequently, we may
face a greater risk of business interruption as a result of
terrorist acts or military conflicts than businesses located
domestically. Furthermore, this potential harm is exacerbated
given that damage to or disruptions at our international
research and development facilities could have an adverse effect
on our ability to develop new or improve existing products as
compared to other businesses which may only have sales offices
or other less critical operations abroad. We are uninsured for
losses or interruptions caused by acts of war or terrorism.

Risks Related to Our Securities

Our debt obligations expose us to risks
that could adversely affect our business, operating results
and

financial condition, and could prevent us
    from fulfilling our obligations under such
    indebtedness.

We have a substantial level of debt. As of
January 3, 2004, we had $420.5 million of outstanding
indebtedness, including $420.0 million of our Zero Coupon
Zero Yield Senior Convertible Notes, or the Notes, that we
issued in August 2003. The level of our indebtedness, among
other things, could:

•

make it difficult for us to satisfy our payment
    obligations on our debt as described below;

•

make it difficult for us to incur additional debt
    or obtain any necessary financing in the future for working
    capital, capital expenditures, debt service, acquisitions or
    general corporate purposes;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting
    to changes in our business;

•

reduce funds available for use in our operations;

•

make us more vulnerable in the event of a
    downturn in our business;

•

make us more vulnerable in the event of an
    increase in interest rates if we must incur new debt to satisfy
    our obligations under the Notes; or

•

place us at a possible competitive disadvantage
    relative to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have
    greater access to capital resources.

If we experience a decline in revenue due to any
of the factors described in this section entitled “Factors
That May Affect Future Results” or otherwise, we could have
difficulty paying amounts due on our



indebtedness. In the case of the Notes, although
the Notes mature in 2023, the holders of the Notes may require
us to repurchase their notes at an additional premium in 2008,
which makes it probable that we will be required to repurchase
the Notes in 2008 if the Notes are not otherwise converted into
our common stock. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash
flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required
payments, or if we fail to comply with the various requirements
of our indebtedness, including the Notes, we would be in
default, which would permit the holders of our indebtedness to
accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness and could cause
defaults under our other indebtedness. Any default under our
indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our
business, operating results and financial condition.

We are not restricted under our outstanding
indebtedness from incurring additional debt, including other
senior indebtedness or secured indebtedness. In addition, our
outstanding indebtedness does not restrict our ability to pay
dividends, issue or repurchase stock or other securities or
require us to achieve or maintain any minimum financial results
relating to our financial position or results of operations. Our
ability to recapitalize, incur additional debt and take a number
of other actions that are not limited by the terms of our
outstanding indebtedness could have the effect of diminishing
our ability to make payments on such indebtedness when due.
Although our outstanding indebtedness does not contain such
financial and other restrictive covenants, future indebtedness
could include such covenants. If we incur additional
indebtedness or other liabilities, our ability to pay our
obligations on our outstanding indebtedness could be adversely
affected.

We may be unable to adequately service our
indebtedness, which may result in defaults and other
costs to us.

We may not have sufficient funds or may be unable
to arrange for additional financing to pay the outstanding
obligations due on our indebtedness. Any future borrowing
arrangements or debt agreements to which we become a party may
contain restrictions on or prohibitions against our repayment on
our outstanding indebtedness. With respect to the Notes, at
maturity, the entire outstanding principal amount of the Notes
will become due and payable. Holders may require us to
repurchase for cash all or any portion of the Notes on
August 15, 2008 for 100.25% of the principal amount,
August 15, 2013 for 100.00% of the principal amount and
August 15, 2018 for 100.00% of the principal amount. As a
result, although the Notes mature in 2023, the holders may
require us to repurchase the Notes at an additional premium in
2008, which makes it probable that we will be required to
repurchase the Notes in 2008 if the Notes are not otherwise
converted into our common stock. If we are prohibited from
paying our outstanding indebtedness, we could try to obtain the
consent of lenders under those arrangements, or we could attempt
to refinance the borrowings that contain the restrictions. If we
do not obtain the necessary consents or refinance the
borrowings, we may be unable to satisfy our outstanding
indebtedness. Any such failure would constitute an event of
default under our indebtedness, which could, in turn, constitute
a default under the terms of any other indebtedness then
outstanding.

In addition, a material default on our
indebtedness could suspend our eligibility to register
securities using certain registration statement forms under SEC
guidelines which incorporate by reference substantial
information regarding us rather than requiring quarterly and
other revision and updating, which could potentially hinder our
ability to raise capital through the issuance of our securities
and will increase the costs of such registration to us.

The price of our common stock may fluctuate
significantly, which may make it difficult for stockholders
to

sell our common stock when desired or at
    attractive prices.

The market price of our common stock is subject
to significant fluctuations in response to the factors set forth
in this section entitled “Factors That May Affect Future
Results” and other factors, many of which are beyond our
control. Such fluctuations, as well as economic conditions
generally, may adversely affect the market price of our common
stock.

In addition, the stock markets in recent years
have experienced extreme price and trading volume fluctuations
that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the
operating performance of individual companies. These broad
market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common
stock, regardless of our operating performance.



Conversion of the Notes will dilute the
ownership interests of existing stockholders.

The terms of the Notes permit the holders to
convert the Notes into shares of our common stock. The Notes are
convertible into our common stock initially at a conversion
price of $15.65 per share, which would result in an
aggregate of approximately 26.8 million shares of our
common stock issued upon conversion, subject to adjustment upon
the occurrence of specified events. The conversion of some or
all of the Notes will dilute the ownership interest of our
existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the
common stock issuable upon conversion could adversely affect
prevailing market prices of our common stock. Prior to the
conversion of the Notes, if the trading price of our common
stock exceeds the conversion price of the Notes by 145% or more
over specified periods, earnings per share will be diluted if
and to the extent the convertible notes hedge instruments are
not exercised. We may redeem for cash all or any part of the
Notes on or after August 15, 2008 for 100.00% of the
principal amount. The holders may require us to repurchase for
cash all or any portion of their notes on August 15, 2008
for 100.25% of the principal amount, on August 15, 2013 for
100.00% of the principal amount, or on August 15, 2018 for
100.00% of the principal amount.

Each $1,000 of principal of the Notes is
initially convertible into 63.8790 shares of our common
stock, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified
events. Holders of the Notes may convert their Notes prior to
maturity only if: (1) the price of our common stock reaches
$22.69 during periods of time specified by the Notes,
(2) specified corporate transactions occur, (3) the
Notes have been called for redemption or (4) the trading
price of the Notes falls below a certain threshold. As a result,
although the Notes mature in 2023, the holders may require us to
repurchase their notes at an additional premium in 2008, which
makes it probable that we will be required to repurchase the
Notes in 2008 if the Notes are not otherwise converted into our
common stock.

Although the conversion price is currently
$15.65 per share, the convertible notes hedge and warrant
transactions that we entered into in connection with the
issuance of the Notes effectively increased the conversion price
of the Notes until 2008 to approximately $23.08 per share,
which would result in an aggregate issuance upon conversion
prior to August 15, 2008 of approximately 18.2 million
shares of our common stock. We have entered into convertible
notes hedge and warrant transactions to reduce the potential
dilution from the conversion of the Notes, however we cannot
guarantee that such convertible notes hedge and warrant
instruments will fully mitigate the dilution. In addition, the
existence of the Notes may encourage short selling by market
participants because the conversion of the Notes could depress
the price of our common stock.

We may, at the option of the noteholders
and only in certain circumstances, be required to repurchase
the

Notes in shares of our common stock upon a
    significant change in our corporate ownership or structure, and
    issuance of shares to repurchase the notes would result in
    dilution to our existing stockholders.

Under the terms of the Notes, we may be required
to repurchase the Notes following a significant change in our
corporate ownership or structure, such as a change of control,
prior to maturity of the Notes. Following a significant change
in our corporate ownership or structure, in certain
circumstances, we may choose to pay the repurchase price of the
Notes in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of
cash and shares of our common stock. In the event we choose to
pay all or any part of the repurchase price of notes in shares
of our common stock, this would result in dilution to the
holders of our common stock.

Convertible notes hedge and warrant
transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of the
Notes

may affect the value of our common
    stock.

We entered into convertible notes hedge
transactions with JP Morgan Chase Bank, an affiliate of one
of the initial purchasers of the Notes, at the time of issuance
of the Notes, with the objective of reducing the potential
dilutive effect of issuing our common stock upon conversion of
the Notes. We also entered into warrant transactions. In
connection with our convertible notes hedge and warrant
transactions, JP Morgan Chase Bank, or its affiliates
purchased our common stock in secondary market transactions and
entered into various over-the-counter derivative transactions
with respect to our common stock. This entity or its affiliates
is likely to modify its hedge positions from time to time prior
to conversion or maturity of the Notes by



purchasing and selling shares of our common
stock, other of our securities or other instruments it may wish
to use in connection with such hedging. The effect, if any, of
any of these transactions and activities on the market price of
our common stock or the Notes could adversely affect the value
of our common stock and, as a result, the number of shares and
the value of the common stock holders will receive upon
conversion of the Notes. In addition, subject to movement in the
trading price of our common stock, if the convertible notes
hedge transactions settle in our favor, we could be exposed to
credit risk related to the other party.

Rating agencies may provide unsolicited
ratings on the Notes that could reduce the market value
or

liquidity of our common
    stock.

We have not requested a rating of the Notes from
any rating agency and we do not anticipate that the Notes will
be rated. However, if one or more rating agencies independently
elects to rate the Notes and assigns the Notes a rating lower
than the rating expected by investors, or reduces their rating
in the future, the market price or liquidity of the Notes and
our common stock could be harmed. A resulting decline in the
market price of the Notes as compared to the price of our common
stock may require us to repurchase the Notes.

Anti-takeover defenses in our governing
documents and certain provisions under Delaware law
could

prevent an acquisition of our company or
    limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our
    common stock.

Our governing documents and certain provisions of
the Delaware General Corporation Law that apply to us could make
it difficult for another company to acquire control of our
company. For example:

•

Our certificate of incorporation allows our board
    of directors to issue, at any time and without stockholder
    approval, preferred stock with such terms as it may determine.
    No shares of preferred stock are currently outstanding. However,
    the rights of holders of any of our preferred stock that may be
    issued in the future may be superior to the rights of holders of
    our common stock.

•

We have a rights plan, commonly known as a
    “poison pill,” which would make it difficult for
    someone to acquire our company without the approval of our board
    of directors.

•

Section 203 of the Delaware General
    Corporation Law generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from
    engaging in any business combination with a person owning 15% or
    more of its voting stock, or who is affiliated with the
    corporation and owned 15% or more of its voting stock at any
    time within three years prior to the proposed business
    combination, for a period of three years from the date the
    person became a 15% owner, unless specified conditions are met.

All or any one of these factors could limit the
price that certain investors would be willing to pay for shares
of our common stock and could delay, prevent or allow our board
of directors to resist an acquisition of our company, even if
the proposed transaction were favored by a majority of our
independent stockholders.

Item 2. Properties

Our headquarters are located in San Jose,
California, and we own the related land and buildings.
Additionally, we own buildings in India and land and buildings
in Scotland. The total square footage of our owned buildings is
approximately 979,000.

We lease additional facilities for our sales
offices in the United States and various foreign countries, and
our research and development and design services facilities
worldwide. We sublease certain of these facilities where space
is not fully utilized or has been involved in restructuring
activities.

We believe that these facilities and the
undeveloped land we own adjacent to our current headquarters are
adequate for our current needs and that suitable additional or
substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any
expansion of our operations.

Item 3. Legal
Proceedings

From time to time, we are involved in various
disputes and litigation matters that arise in the ordinary
course of business. These include disputes and lawsuits related
to intellectual property, mergers and



acquisitions, licensing, contract law,
distribution arrangements and employee relations matters.
Periodically, we review the status of each significant matter
and assess its potential financial exposure. If the potential
loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable
and the amount can be estimated, we accrue a liability for the
estimated loss at the low end of the range. Legal proceedings
are subject to uncertainties, and the outcomes are difficult to
predict. Because of such uncertainties, accruals are based only
on the best information available at the time. As additional
information becomes available, we reassess the potential
liability related to pending claims and litigation and may
revise estimates.

While the outcome of any disputes and litigation
matters cannot be predicted with any certainty, management does
not believe that the outcome of any current matters will have a
material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position
or results of operations.

a Vote of Security Holders

Item 6.

Selected Financial Data

The following selected consolidated financial
data should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated
Financial Statements and the Notes thereto and the information
contained in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.”
Historical results are not necessarily indicative of future
results.

*

Beginning in our fiscal year 2002, Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 142,
    “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” was adopted
    and, as a result, we have ceased to amortize approximately
    $178.8 million of goodwill, net of accumulated
    amortization, including workforce intangibles that were subsumed
    into goodwill upon adoption of SFAS No. 142. The 1999
    to 2001 consolidated financial data include amortization of
    goodwill and workforce intangibles totaling $50.8 million
    for 2001, $36.5 million for 2000 and $16.5 million for
    1999.

As more fully described in Note 4 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2003, we determined that
certain investments previously accounted for under the cost
method during the fiscal years prior to 2003 should have been
accounted for under the equity method of accounting. In
addition, certain other errors were identified that occurred in
the Consolidated Financial Statements for 2000 through 2002. As
a result of these determinations, the following adjustments to
amounts previously reported have been reflected in the selected
financial data above before the effect of income taxes:

Because the Consolidated Financial Statements for
2001 were not materially affected by the change in accounting
for investments, deferred stock compensation, revenue and
internally developed software and the Consolidated Financial
Statements for that year were audited by a firm that is no
longer in existence, no adjustments have been made to the 2001
Consolidated Financial Statements. However, as described in
Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the 2001
Consolidated Financial Statements were restated to correct
certain classification errors. These reclassifications had no
effect on previously reported Revenue, Income from operations,
Other income, Net income, Total assets or Shareholders’
equity. In order for the 2002 and 2003 Consolidated Financial
Statements to be correct as of the end of each of those years,
we have



recorded the cumulative effect of
$11.9 million for all years prior to fiscal 2002 as an
adjustment to the opening retained earnings balance for fiscal
2002 as follows:

The adjustments to amounts previously presented
in selected financial data are summarized as follows:

The decrease in total assets for fiscal 2002 of
$11.6 million consists of a decrease in Property, plant and
equipment of $2.6 million, an increase in Goodwill of
$0.8 million and a decrease in Other assets of
$9.8 million. The decrease in total assets of
$7.7 million for fiscal 2000 consists of a decrease in
Accounts receivable of $0.6 million and a decrease in Other
assets of $7.1 million. The decrease in total assets of
$4.3 million for fiscal 1999 relates entirely to a decrease
in Other assets.



Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion should be read in
conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes
thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K. Certain of such statements, including, without
limitation, statements regarding the extent and timing of future
revenues and expenses and customer demand, statements regarding
the deployment of our products, statements regarding our
reliance on third parties and other statements using words such
as “anticipates,” “believes,”
“could,” “estimates,” “expects,”
“intends,” “may,” “plans,”
“should,” “will” and “would,” and
words of similar import and the negatives thereof, constitute
forward-looking statements. These statements are predictions
based upon our current expectations about future events. Actual
results could vary materially as a result of certain factors,
including but not limited to, those expressed in these
statements. We refer you to the “Risk Factors”
“Competition,” “Proprietary Technology,”
“Factors That May Affect Future Results,”
“Results of Operations,” “Disclosures About
Market Risk,” and “Liquidity and Capital
Resources” sections contained in this Annual Report and the
risks discussed in our other SEC filings, which identify
important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those contained in the
forward-looking statements.

We urge you to consider these factors
carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements contained
in this Annual Report. All subsequent written or oral
forward-looking statements attributable to our company or
persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their
entirety by these cautionary statements. The forward-looking
statements included in this Annual Report are made only as of
the date of this Annual Report. We do not intend, and undertake
no obligation, to update these forward-looking
statements.

Overview

General

We license electronic design automation, or EDA,
software, sell or lease hardware technology and provide design
and methodology services throughout the world to help accelerate
and manage customers’ electronic product development
processes. Our broad range of products and services are used by
the world’s leading electronics companies to design and
develop complex ICs and personal and commercial electronic
systems. For a detailed discussion of the challenges and
opportunities of the EDA industry and our products and services,
see Item 1. Business above.

As part of our strategy, we have acquired
companies, businesses and third party intellectual property to
acquire technology and key personnel, and we expect to continue
making acquisitions in the future.

After experiencing a downturn in demand and
production in the last several years which resulted in reduced
research and development spending by many of our
customers, IC manufacturers and electronics companies
appear to have experienced a gradual recovery in the second half
of 2003, but have continued their focus on cost containment. In
response to the downturn in the economy, and in the electronics
industry in particular, we have initiated significant
restructuring activities over the past several years to better
align our cost structure with expected demand and revenues.

We have identified certain items that management
uses as performance indicators to manage Cadence’s
business, including revenue, certain elements of operating
expenses and cash flow from operations, and we describe these
items more fully in the “Results of Operations” below.

In 2003, we experienced a continued customer
preference for renewable license types and expect the timing of
license renewals to continue to impact our results of
operations. Product revenue recognized from backlog comprised
approximately 60% of total product revenue in 2003, 45% in 2002
and 30% in 2001. This trend is primarily due to, and may
continue as a result of, increasing customer preference for
subscription licenses and customer requirements for more
flexible payment terms.

Restatement

During 2003, we restated our Consolidated
Financial Statements as of and for the fiscal year ended
December 28, 2002 as discussed in more detail in
Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. While



certain adjustments impacting our Consolidated
Financial Statements for periods prior to fiscal 2002 were also
identified, the Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal
2001 were not materially affected by the adjustments, and a firm
that is no longer in existence audited the Consolidated
Financial Statements for that year. Accordingly, no adjustments
have been made to our fiscal 2001 Consolidated Financial
Statements. However, for the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
December 28, 2002 to be properly stated, we have recorded
the cumulative effect of adjustments for all years prior to
fiscal 2002 of $11.9 million to opening retained earnings
for fiscal 2002. The following discussion in this
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations reflects the effects of the
Restatements.

Acquisitions

We have acquired companies, businesses and third
party technology, some of which are described below, and we
expect to acquire other companies, businesses and third party
technology in the future. We undertake these acquisitions as
part of our overall business strategy, and specifically, to
acquire key personnel, technology and customer relationships of
the acquired business. For each of these acquisitions the
results of operations and the estimated fair value of the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed have been included in our
Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of the
acquisition. These acquisitions are described in more detail
below in Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Comparative pro forma financial information was
not presented for the 2003 or 2002 acquisitions because these
acquisitions were not material to our Consolidated Financial
Statements, either individually or in the aggregate. For
additional information regarding our 2003 acquisitions, see
“Liquidity and Capital Resources”, “Results of
Operations” and “General and Administrative”
found below in this Item 7, “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations”, and the Notes to our Consolidated Financial
Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

A summary of certain information regarding
acquisitions completed by Cadence in fiscal 2003 and 2002,
including the aggregate initial purchase price paid, is as
follows:

The businesses or assets acquired include:

(A)

Verification technology.

(B)

Distribution rights to certain customers, certain
    assets and key personnel of this Japan-based developer and
    distributor of software, electronic devices and semiconductor
    manufacturing equipment.

(C)

Nanometer-scale synthesis.

(D)

Silicon modeling products and full-chip circuit
    simulation.

(E)

Test design automation.

(F)

Design and verification.

The purchase prices of our acquisitions generally
consist of one or more of the following: cash payments, shares
of our common stock, the fair value of assumed options, if any,
and acquisition costs. Other than the



Simplex, Innotech and IBM’s TDA
acquisitions, the purchase price and goodwill associated with
companies acquired (but not asset acquisitions) will increase
above the initial purchase price paid if certain performance
goals related to revenue, bookings, product proliferation,
product development or employee retention, which are measured
over periods of up to four years following the acquisitions, are
achieved.

Concurrent with the Innotech acquisition, we also
modified our distributor agreement with Innotech. Prior to this
acquisition, we licensed most of our software products in Japan
through Innotech, of which we were, and continue to be, a 15%
stockholder. We now directly license our software products to
certain customers for which we acquired the distribution rights
from Innotech.

For most of our acquisitions of private
companies, a portion of the purchase price is payable after the
acquired business group’s achievement of certain
performance goals, which generally relate to one or more of
bookings, revenue, product development, product proliferation or
employee retention. The specific performance goal levels and
amounts and timing of contingent purchase price payments vary
with each acquisition. In connection with some acquisitions,
Cadence may grant stock options with either time-based or
performance-based vesting, or a combination of both, to
employees of the acquired business as performance incentives. As
a result, the amount of cash consideration or shares of our
common stock issued to former stockholders of the acquired
entity will increase as performance goals are achieved,
generally over a period of up to four years following the
completion of the respective acquisition. Accordingly, goodwill
and deferred stock compensation expense will increase upon the
attainment of such goals.

During 2003, we paid $2.4 million in cash
and recorded an additional 3.7 million shares valued at
$57.7 million related to acquisition earnouts. We recorded
$52.3 million in additional goodwill consisting of
$2.4 million in cash and $49.9 million representing
3.2 million shares. We also recorded additional deferred
stock compensation of $7.8 million representing
0.4 million shares for earnouts achieved during 2003. In
addition, we recorded $0.5 million in deferred stock
compensation for estimated future earnouts in accordance with
FASB Interpretation No. 28, “Accounting for Stock
Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award
Plans.” The additional goodwill and deferred stock
compensation related to the achievement of certain performance
goals associated with one or more of the following criteria:
revenue, bookings, product proliferation, product development
and employee retention.

During 2002, we recorded an additional
12.8 million shares, valued at $204.7 million. We
recorded $181.2 million of the $204.7 million as
additional goodwill representing 11.3 million of the
12.8 million shares. We also recorded deferred stock
compensation of $23.5 million of the $204.7 million,
representing 1.5 million of the 12.8 million shares
for earnouts achieved during 2002. In addition, we recorded
$4.6 million in deferred stock compensation for estimated
future earnouts in accordance with FASB Interpretation
No. 28, “Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and
Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans.” The additional
goodwill and deferred stock compensation related to the
achievement of certain performance goals associated with one or
more of the following criteria: bookings, product proliferation,
product development and/or employee retention resulting from
acquisitions.

In connection with our acquisitions completed
prior to January 3, 2004, we may be obligated to pay up to
an aggregate of $39.1 million in cash and issue a total of
0.8 million shares of our common stock during fiscal 2004.
In addition, we may be required to pay an additional
$76.0 million in cash from 2005 through 2007 if certain
performance goals related to bookings, revenues, product
development, product proliferation or employee retention are
achieved in full.

The goodwill recorded in connection with the
above-described contingent earnouts for acquisitions is not
expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

Legal
Settlements

In September 2003, we entered into a
settlement with Mentor Graphics Corporation, pursuant to which
Cadence, Mentor and their respective affiliated parties settled
all outstanding litigation between the companies and such
affiliated parties relating to emulation and acceleration
systems. The companies also agreed that, for a period of seven
years, neither will sue the other over patented emulation and
acceleration technology.



Mentor also paid us $18.0 million in cash as
part of the settlement. Net of related legal costs, we recorded
$14.5 million during the year ended January 3, 2004
for the settlement.

In November 2002, we announced the
settlement of civil litigation filed against Avant! seeking
damages related to theft of our intellectual property, including
software code, as well as other trade secrets. The settlement
with Avant!, its parent corporation Synopsys, Inc. and several
individuals included an agreement to dismiss all pending claims
and counterclaims in the litigation and required the payment to
us of $265.0 million, which was received in the fourth
fiscal quarter of 2002.

In July 2001, Avant! was ordered to pay us
$195.4 million in criminal restitution after Avant! entered
a plea of no contest and was found guilty by the Superior Court
of the State of California of conspiracy to take and use our
trade secrets. This conspiracy included the theft by Avant! and
certain individuals of our intellectual property, including
software code, as well as other trade secrets. As of
December 29, 2001, approximately $196.0 million,
consisting of all of the restitution award plus interest was
received.

Critical Accounting Estimates

In preparing our Consolidated Financial
Statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that
can have a significant impact on our revenue, operating income
and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and
liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We base our
assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience
and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under
the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a
regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and
estimates and make changes accordingly. We believe that the
assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting
for revenue recognition, accounting for income taxes, valuation
of long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill, and
restructuring charges have the greatest potential impact on our
Consolidated Financial Statements, so we consider these to be
our critical accounting estimates. Historically, our
assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical
accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual
results. For further information on our significant accounting
policies, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Our critical accounting estimates are as follows:

•

revenue recognition;

•

accounting for income taxes;

•

valuation of long-lived and intangible assets and
    goodwill; and

•

restructuring charges.

Revenue recognition

We apply the provisions of Statement of Position,
or SOP, 97-2, “Software Revenue Recognition,” as
amended by Statement of Position 98-9 “Modification of
SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to
Certain Transactions,” to all product revenue transactions
where the software is not incidental. We also apply the
provisions of SFAS, No. 13, “Accounting for
Leases,” to all hardware lease transactions. We recognize
revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the
product has been delivered, the fee is fixed or determinable,
collection of the resulting receivable is probable, and
vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value, or VSOE,
exists.

Fee is fixed or
determinable

— We assess
whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the
arrangement, primarily based on the payment terms associated
with the transaction. We generally use installment contracts for
term and subscription licenses and we have established a history
of collecting under the original contract without providing
concessions on payments, products or services. Our installment
contracts generally have payment periods that are equal to or
less than the term of the licenses, the payments are generally
collected quarterly, and periodic payments are generally made in
equal or nearly equal installments. Significant judgment is
involved in this determination, including determining whether a
contract amendment constitutes a concession. Our experience has
been that we are able to determine whether a fee is fixed or
determinable. While we do not expect that experience to change,
if we no longer had a history of



collecting under the original contract without
providing concessions on term licenses, revenue from term
licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under
the installment contract become due and payable. These changes
would have a material impact on our results of operations.

Collection is
probable

— We assess
collectibility at the outset of the arrangement based on a
number of factors, including the customer’s past payment
history and its current creditworthiness. If in our judgment
collection of a fee is not probable, we defer the revenue until
the uncertainty is removed, which generally means revenue is
recognized upon receipt of cash payment. Our experience has been
that we are able to estimate that collection is probable. While
we do not expect that experience to change, if we were to
determine that collection is not probable for any license
arrangement with installment payment terms, revenue from this
license would be recognized generally upon the receipt of cash
payment. These changes could have a material impact on our
results of operations.

Vendor-Specific Objective
Evidence

— Our VSOE for
certain product elements of an arrangement is based upon the
pricing for comparable transactions when the element is sold
separately. VSOE for maintenance is generally based upon the
customer’s stated annual renewal rates. VSOE for services
is generally based on the price charged when the services are
sold separately. For multiple element arrangements, VSOE must
exist to allocate the total fee among all delivered and
undelivered elements in the arrangement. If VSOE does not exist
for all elements to support the allocation of the total fee
among all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement,
revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist for the
undelivered elements, or until all elements are delivered,
whichever is earlier. If VSOE of all undelivered elements exists
but VSOE does not exist for one or more delivered elements,
revenue is recognized using the residual method. Under the
residual method, the VSOE of the undelivered elements is
deferred, and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is
recognized as revenue. Our experience has been that we are able
to estimate VSOE. While we do not expect that experience to
change, if we could no longer support VSOE for undelivered
elements of multiple element arrangements, revenue would be
deferred until we have VSOE for the undelivered elements or all
elements are delivered, whichever is earlier. This change could
have a material impact on our results of operations.

Services
revenue

— Services revenue
consists primarily of revenue received for performing
methodology and design services. Revenue from service contracts
is recognized either on the time and materials method, as work
is performed, or on the percentage-of-completion method. For
contracts with fixed or not-to-exceed fees on a monthly basis,
we estimate the percentage-of-completion, which is based on the
completion of milestones relating to the arrangement. We have a
history of accurately estimating project status and the costs
necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and
external factors can affect our estimates, including labor
rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification
and testing requirement changes. If different conditions were to
prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made, then the
use of the completed contract method would be required and the
recognition of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the
project was completed. This change could have a material impact
on our results of operations.

Accounting for
income taxes

We provide for the effect of income taxes on our
Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with
SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.”
Under SFAS No. 109, income tax expense is recognized
for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current
year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for tax
consequences of events that have been recognized in an
entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Our
assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of
our net deferred tax assets take into account predictions of the
amount and category of future taxable income from potential
sources including tax planning strategies that would, if
necessary, be implemented to prevent a loss carryforward or tax
credit carryforward from expiring unused. Actual operating
results and the underlying amount and category of income in
future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and
estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate, thus
materially impacting our results of operations and financial
position. Management must make significant assumptions,
judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for
income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities
and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred
tax assets. Our judgments, assumptions and estimates relative to
the current provision for income taxes take into



account current tax laws, our interpretation of
current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future
audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities.
Changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the
resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly
impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of
operations, financial position or cash flows. See the risk
factor affecting future results titled

“We have received
an examination report from the Internal Revenue Service
proposing a tax deficiency in certain of our tax returns, and
the outcome of the examination or any future examinations
involving similar claims may have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations and cash flows.”

Valuation of long-lived and intangible assets,
    including goodwill

At least annually we review for impairment of
goodwill resulting from business combinations in accordance with
SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets.” We completed our annual impairment review during
the third quarter of 2003. We did not identify any impairment to
our goodwill as a result of this review. We review long-lived
assets, including certain identifiable intangibles, for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that we will not be able to recover the asset’s carrying
amount in accordance with SFAS No. 144,
“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets.”

For long-lived assets to be held and used,
including acquired intangibles, we initiate our review whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable.
Recoverability of an asset is measured by comparing its carrying
amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows expected
to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset,
excluding future interest costs that would be recognized as an
expense when incurred. Any impairment to be recognized is
measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset
exceeds its fair market value. Significant management judgment
is required in:

•

identifying a triggering event that arises from a
    change in circumstances;

•

forecasting future operating results; and

•

estimating the proceeds from the disposition of
    long-lived or intangible assets.

Material impairment charges could be necessary
should different conditions prevail or different judgments be
made.

Restructuring charges

We account for restructuring charges in
accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100
“Restructuring and Impairment Charges.” Since 2001 we
have undertaken significant restructuring initiatives. All
restructuring activities initiated prior to fiscal year 2003
were accounted for in accordance with EITF No. 94-3,
“Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination
Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain
Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)” and EITF No. 88-10
“Costs Associated with Lease Modifications or
Terminations.” For restructuring activities initiated after
fiscal year 2002, we accounted for the facilities and
asset-related portions of this restructuring in accordance with
SFAS No. 146 “Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities.” The severance and
benefits charges were accounted for in accordance with
SFAS No. 112 “Employers’ Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits — An Amendment of FASB
Statements No. 5 and 43.”

These restructuring initiatives have required us
to make a number of estimates and assumptions related to losses
on excess facilities vacated or consolidated, particularly the
timing of subleases and sublease terms. Closure and space
reduction costs included in our restructuring charges include
payments required under leases, less any applicable estimated
sublease income after the facilities are abandoned, lease buyout
costs and costs to maintain facilities during the period after
abandonment.

In addition, we have recorded estimated
provisions for termination benefits and outplacement costs,
long-term asset write-downs, and other restructuring costs. We
regularly evaluate the adequacy of our restructuring accrual,
and adjust the balance based on changes in estimates and
assumptions. We may incur future charges for new restructuring
activities as well as changes in estimates to amounts previously
recorded.



Results of Operations

We primarily generate revenue from licensing EDA
software and selling or leasing hardware technology, providing
maintenance for the software and hardware and providing design
and methodology services. We principally utilize three license
types which provide a customer flexibility with several
alternatives to the rights it has to utilize our products,
including (i) the right to access to new technology;
(ii) the duration of the license — for a fixed
term, generally two to three years, or on a perpetual basis; and
(iii) payment terms. Customer decisions for these aspects
of license transactions determine the license type, timing of
revenue recognition and potential future business activity. For
example, if a customer chooses a fixed term of use, then this
will result in either a subscription or term license. A business
implication of that decision is that at the expiration of the
license period the customer must decide if it wants to continue
using the technology and therefore renew the license agreement.
Because larger customers generally use products from two or more
of our five product groups, rarely will a large customer
completely terminate its relationship with Cadence at expiration
of the license. See Critical Accounting Estimates for additional
discussion of licenses types and timing of revenue recognition.

To the extent the customer obtains rights to
remix to new technology or more flexible payment terms, the
revenue is recognized over the life of the agreement. This
distinction is critical. For example, a $3.0 million 3-year
subscription would result in $1.0 million of revenue per
year, or $250,000 per quarter. Whereas, a
$3.0 million, 3-year term license, assuming equal or near
equal payments and exclusive of the maintenance element, would
result in $3.0 million of product revenue upon delivery,
which is generally in the first quarter of the arrangement and
no product revenue in succeeding quarters.

An increasing proportion of our product business
consists of subscription licenses, which give customers limited
access to new technology, and licenses with more flexible
payment terms. These changes have the effect of deferring the
timing of revenue recognition to future periods. The result has
been a decline in product revenue in 2003 compared to 2002, and
2002 compared to 2001, as the proportion of product licenses
under which revenue is deferred continued to increase.

With each succeeding quarter in which the amount
of product licenses where revenue is deferred increases, our
revenue from backlog also increases. Product revenue recognized
from backlog comprised approximately 60% of total product
revenue in 2003, 45% in 2002 and 30% in 2001. As long as
customers continue to prefer subscription licenses, we expect
that revenue from backlog will increase and our revenue will be
less susceptible to short-term fluctuations in volume. Because
of our model under which we recognize revenue over multiple
periods, we do not believe that pricing volatility is a material
component of the change in our product revenues from period to
period and we do not analyze changes in pricing from one period
to the next.

The amount of product revenue in future periods
will depend, among other things, on the terms and timing of our
contract renewals or additional product sales with existing
customers, the size of such transactions or renewals, and sales
to new customers. Product revenue in any period is also affected
by the extent to which customers prefer subscription, term or
perpetual licenses, and the extent to which contracts contain
flexible payment terms. Revenue is also affected by changes in
the extent to which existing contracts contain flexible payment
terms and changes in license types (e.g., subscription to term)
for existing customers. Contract renewals, and consequently
product revenues, are also affected by the competitiveness of
our products.



Revenue

Revenue Mix by Product Group

We analyze our business by product groups,
combining revenues for both product and maintenance because of
their interrelationship. We introduced our first platform in
September 2002. The data for product groups before the
introduction of a corresponding platform aggregates the revenues
for the individual products associated with a platform. On this
basis, the following table shows the percentage of product and
maintenance revenue contributed by each of the five product
groups, and services, for 2003, 2002 and 2001.

In 2003 and, to a lesser extent, 2002, revenue
for all platforms was negatively affected by the shift to more
ratable licenses and lower sales volume. The following
discussion analyzes revenue by product group from 2001 to 2003.

Functional Verification: Our Incisive Functional
Verification Platform, introduced in February 2003, supports a
unified methodology, from design of the total system to
design-in of particular ICs to design of specific systems, for
all design domains. The revenue contribution for this platform
remained constant on a relative basis in 2003. Increased revenue
from our new Incisive simulators, our Conformal product, and
strong demand for our new Palladium hardware in-circuit
emulation option was offset by a decline in revenue from our
older simulators and legacy emulation products. The relative
revenue contribution declined from 2001 to 2002 as customers
tended to forego purchases of verification products during the
semiconductor downturn in favor of more critical products in the
digital IC area.

Digital IC Design: Our Encounter Digital IC
Design Platform, introduced in September 2002, leverages a
unified architecture for full digital implementation of
nanometer-scale designs. The revenue contribution from this area
increased on a relative basis from 2002 to 2003 due to
increasing revenue for newer products in the Encounter platform
which are focused on nanometer scale designs offset by declining
sales of our older digital design products which were less
competitive. The relative revenue contribution also increased
from 2001 to 2002, driven by demand for new technology to meet
the design needs of smaller semiconductor process geometries,
and revenue from new products, primarily First Encounter.

Custom IC Design: The Virtuoso Custom IC Design
Platform, introduced in September 2003, enables development of
silicon-accurate analog, custom digital, radio frequency and
mixed-signal designs. The percentage of revenue from the
Virtuoso platform increased from 2002 to 2003 due to incremental
revenue from new products as well as the growing importance of
mixed-signal chip designs, a factor which also contributed to
the increase from 2001 to 2002.



Design for Manufacturing: Our products in the
design for manufacturing area include Fire & Ice QX,
SignalStorm, VoltageStorm, ElectronStorm and our Assura design
rule checking products. The percentage of revenue from this area
remained relatively constant from 2001 to 2003, as increasing
revenue from newer products such as Fire & Ice QX and
our Assura group was offset by declining revenue from our older
products which are less competitive for the newer semiconductor
processes.

System Interconnect: Our Allegro System
Interconnect Design Platform, introduced in March 2004, enables
collaborative design of high-performance interconnect across the
domains of IC, package and PCB, reducing cost and time to
market. Our system interconnect products have underperformed our
integrated circuit design products over the 2001 to 2003 period
because this product group is more exposed to systems companies
in the data communications and computer systems sectors, which
suffered relatively larger declines in business than other
sectors in the electronics industry downturn, and because there
has been less technological change in the design of printed
circuit boards and system interconnect, there has been less
demand for new design products.

Services revenue decreased $18.6 million in
2003 compared to 2002, and decreased $113.5 million in 2002
compared to 2001, due to a decrease in customer spending for
design service as a result of the economic downturn experienced
in the electronics industry.

Additional financial information about segments
can be found in Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Revenue by Geography

Revenue by Geography as a Percent of Total
Revenue

International revenue decreased
$82.1 million in 2003 compared to 2002, primarily due to a
$59.3 million decrease in product revenue in Europe and a
$13.4 million decrease in services revenue in Europe. The
decrease in product revenue in Europe was primarily due to the
timing of license renewals for existing customers.

International revenue decreased
$67.1 million in 2002 compared to 2001, due a
$34.0 million decrease in international services revenue
and a $47.5 million decrease in product revenue in Europe,
slightly offset by a $14.8 million increase in product
revenue in Japan. Revenue in Japan accounted for 33% of total
international revenue in 2002 compared to 28% in 2001. The
slight increase in product revenue in Japan was due to the
timing of license renewals for existing customers and was
partially offset by a decrease in services revenue.

The rate of revenue change varies geographically
due to differences in the timing and extent of term license
renewals for existing customers in those regions. In addition,
both our domestic and international businesses have been
affected by the revenue trends discussed above in this section
entitled “Results of Operations.”



With respect to foreign currency exchange rates,
revenue increased by $18.8 million in 2003 as compared to
2002, primarily due to strengthening of the Japanese yen in
relation to the U.S. dollar. Revenue decreased by
$8.4 million in 2002 as compared to 2001, primarily due to
the weakening of the Japanese yen in relation to the
U.S. dollar. Additional information about revenue and other
financial information by geography can be found in Note 19
to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Cost of Revenue

Cost of Revenue as a Percent of Related
Revenue

Cost of product revenue includes costs associated
with the sale or lease of our hardware and licensing of our
software products. Cost of product revenue primarily includes
the cost of employee salary and benefits, amortization of
intangible assets directly related to Cadence products,
documentation and royalties payable to third party vendors. Cost
of product revenue associated with our Cadence Verification
Acceleration, or CVA, hardware products also includes materials,
assembly labor and overhead. These additional manufacturing
costs make our cost of hardware product higher, as a percentage
of revenue, than our cost of software product.

A summary of Cost of product is as follows:

Cost of product revenue decreased
$31.3 million in 2003 compared to 2002, primarily due to an
$18.9 million reduction in amortized software costs, an
$8.3 million decrease in royalties, a $9.3 million
decrease in Inventory write-offs, and a $2.2 million
decrease in acquisition-related write-offs. The decreases were
partially offset by an increase in amortization of acquired
intangibles of $13.8 million during 2003.

Cost of product revenue decreased
$20.2 million in 2002 compared to 2001, due to a decrease
in salary and benefits costs of $10.6 million, a decrease
of $9.6 million in the amount of inventory write-offs and a
$6.0 million decrease in cost of sales of CVA products,
partially offset by a $6.4 million increase in royalty
costs.

During 2003, we began reporting amortization
expense related to certain intangible assets acquired in
business combinations in Cost of product. We previously recorded
all amortization expense related to these intangibles in
Amortization of acquired intangibles. Accordingly, we have
reclassified amortization expense related to these intangibles
of $25.2 million in 2002 and $20.3 million in 2001.



In 2002, we recognized a charge of
$9.3 million, which is included in cost of product revenue,
for excess inventory from decreased sales forecasts. In 2001, we
recorded an $18.9 million write-off for excess inventory in
cost of product revenue. Of the $18.9 million,
$15.2 million of the write-off was related to excess
inventory from decreased sales forecasts and $3.7 million
related to two product lines that were discontinued as part of
our restructuring. The excess inventory charges of
$9.3 million in 2002 and $15.2 million in 2001 were
due to significant decreases in forecasted revenue for emulation
products and were calculated in accordance with our practice,
which is based on reserving for inventory in excess of estimated
12-month demand. Inventory purchases and commitments are based
on future sales forecasts. We typically buy and build inventory
levels for certain key components to mitigate component supply
constraints. Based on our current 12-month demand forecast, we
do not anticipate that the excess inventory will be used at a
later date. We have determined that inventory levels at
January 3, 2004 were within forecasted usage for the
succeeding 12-month period.

Cost of services revenue primarily includes
employee salary and benefits, costs to maintain the
infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization, and
provisions for contract losses, if any. Cost of services revenue
decreased $21.5 million in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily
due to decreases in employee salary and benefit costs resulting
from our reduction of services professionals in connection with
our restructuring actions initiated in 2002 and 2003. Cost of
services revenue decreased $77.9 million in 2002 compared
to 2001, primarily due to decreases in employee salary and
benefit costs resulting from our reduction of services
professionals in connection with our restructuring actions
initiated in 2001 and 2002.

Cost of maintenance revenue includes the cost of
customer services, such as hot-line and on-site support,
production employees and documentation of maintenance updates.
Cost of maintenance revenue decreased $8.6 million in 2003
compared to 2002 primarily due to a decrease in employee salary
and benefit costs resulting from a decrease in employee
headcount. Cost of maintenance revenue decreased
$0.2 million in 2002 compared to 2001, primarily due to a
decrease in employee salary and benefit costs resulting from a
decrease in employee headcount.

Operating Expenses

Operating Expenses as a Percent of Total
Revenue

Marketing and Sales

Marketing and sales expenses decreased
$75.5 million during 2003 compared to 2002 primarily due to
a $27.8 million decrease in employee salary and benefit
costs resulting from our restructuring activities, a
$16.1 million decrease in commission costs, a
$12.6 million decrease in outside services, and a
$4.1 million decrease in marketing program costs. Salary,
benefits and commission costs declined due to reduced headcount
in the sales and marketing organizations. Outside services costs
declined due to decreased



commission payments to Innotech as a result of
our acquisition of distribution rights to certain customers from
Innotech, and due to a reduction in costs incurred for outside
contractors and consultants.

Marketing and sales expenses increased
$8.5 million in 2002 compared to 2001, primarily due to a
$22.6 million increase in employee salary and benefit costs
primarily related to acquisitions of other businesses and an
$8.0 million increase in commission costs. These increases
were partially offset by decreases of $20.3 million in
sales program costs and $3.1 million in marketing program
costs.

Research and Development

The increase in Research and development expense
of $13.7 million for 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily
due to a $14.1 million increase in salary, benefits and
associated costs resulting from an increase in employees due to
business acquisitions and an $18.9 million reduction in
capitalized development costs, partially offset by an
$11.5 million reduction in costs related to outsourced
services and research and development projects as a result of
the restructuring activities, and a $5.6 million decrease
in expenses related to other outside services.

The increase in Research and development expense
of $29.1 million for 2002 compared to 2001, was primarily
due to a $23.3 million increase in employee salary and
benefit costs resulting from an increase in employees, primarily
due to business acquisitions.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expense decreased
$33.2 million in 2003 compared to 2002, primarily due to a
$16.6 million decrease in legal expense, a
$9.3 million decrease in salary and benefit costs in
connection with our restructuring activities and a
$2.2 million decrease in bad debt expense. Bad debt expense
continues to decline as collection experience in our services
business continues to improve. The allowance for doubtful
accounts as a percentage of total receivables declined in 2003
as compared to 2002 because write-offs continued to decline and
because of additional reductions in the percentage of
receivables past due. There were no significant changes in our
collection policies or payment terms from 2002 to 2003.

General and administrative expense decreased
$3.6 million in 2002 compared to 2001, primarily due to an
increase of $11.1 million in legal expense, partially
offset by a $4.1 million decrease in employee salary and
benefits and an $8.0 million decrease in bad debt expense,
primarily related to the design services business. The design
services business was particularly affected by the economic
downturn during 2001 and 2002 because some customers in
financial distress failed to meet their payment obligations
under their services contracts with us, often because they
failed to obtain expected additional rounds of financing. The
allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of total
receivables declined in 2002 compared to 2001 because of the
write-offs in 2002 of specific reserves recorded in 2001 and
because of a reduction in the percentage of receivables past
due. There were no significant changes in our collection
policies or payment terms from 2001 to 2002.

Foreign currency exchange rates increased
operating expenses by $11.3 million in 2003, compared to
2002, primarily due to the strengthening of the euro and British
pound in relation to the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency exchange
rates increased operating expenses by $1.2 million in 2002,
compared to 2001, primarily due to the strengthening of the euro
and British pound in relation to the U.S. dollar.

Operating Expenses

Operating expenses declined $95.0 million
from 2002 to 2003 as a result of the cost reductions from our
2003 and 2002 restructuring activities described more fully
below in “Restructuring and Other Charges” and
continued cost containment by our customers. We expect our
operating expenses to be flat to up slightly in 2004 as we
continue to realize cost reductions from our 2003 restructuring,
offset by increased expenses from research and development and
selected sales and marketing programs.



Amortization of Acquired
Intangibles

Amortization of acquired intangibles increased
$8.8 million in 2003 compared to 2002, primarily due to a
$10.8 million increase in amortization of intangibles
acquired from Simplex, IBM’s TDA, Celestry, Get2Chip,
Verplex and Innotech. Amortization of acquired intangibles
decreased $17.0 million in 2002 compared to 2001, primarily
due to a $24.9 decrease attributable to the effects of
implementing SFAS, No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets” which requires that goodwill no longer
be amortized. This reduction was partially offset by a
$3.8 million increase in amortization of intangibles
acquired from Simplex and a $2.7 million increase in
amortization of intangibles acquired from Silicon Perspective
Corporation, or SPC.

Amortization of Deferred Stock
Compensation

We amortize deferred stock compensation related
to fixed awards to expense using the straight-line method over
the period that the stock options and restricted stock vest. We
recognize stock compensation expense related to variable awards
using an accelerated method over the period that the stock
options and restricted stock are earned. Amortization of
deferred stock compensation decreased $2.9 million in 2003
compared to 2002, primarily due to a $14.8 million decrease
in the amortization of deferred stock compensation related to
SPC and Tality (the former name of our design services
business). This decrease was partially offset by a
$4.3 million increase in the amortization of deferred stock
compensation related to Verplex, and a $2.2 million
increase in the amortization of deferred stock compensation
related to the mark-to-market of options granted to consultants.
Amortization of deferred stock compensation increased
$26.1 million in 2002 compared to 2001, primarily due to a
$28.5 million increase in the amortization of deferred
stock compensation related to SPC. This increase was partially
offset by a $4.7 million decrease in the amortization of
deferred stock compensation related to Tality.

Restructuring and Other
Charges

We initiated separate plans of restructuring in
each of the past three years, in an effort to improve our
revenue per employee, reduce operating expenses and improve
operating margins and cash flows.

The first of these plans of restructuring, which
was announced in 2001, or the 2001 Restructuring, was intended
to reduce costs by eliminating excess personnel and
consolidating facilities and resources. The restructuring was in
response to the severe economic downturn in the electronics
industry. The restructuring was primarily aimed at reducing
excess personnel and capacity costs within our design services
business (formerly Tality) throughout the world, to align the
cost structure of our design services business with its expected
revenues. The 2001 restructuring was substantially completed
within 12 months after commitment to the plan, except for
remaining facilities-related charges from vacated facilities
included in the plan.

During 2002, we commenced a new plan of
restructuring, or the 2002 Restructuring, intended to further
reduce costs by eliminating excess personnel and consolidating
facilities and resources due to the continued economic downturn
in the electronics industry. The 2002 Restructuring costs
resulted from involuntary terminations and the abandonment of
long-lived assets and vacated facilities. These costs primarily
related to our design services business and certain other
business/infrastructure groups.



In July 2003, we announced an additional plan of
restructuring, or the 2003 Restructuring, intended to reduce
costs and realize efficiencies by eliminating excess personnel
and consolidating facilities and resources throughout the
company to align our cost structure with expected revenues.

A summary of restructuring and other charges by
plan of restructuring for fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001 is as
follows:

Frequently, asset write-downs are based on
significant estimates and assumptions, particularly regarding
remaining useful life and utilization rates. We may incur other
charges in the future if management determines that the useful
life or utilization of certain long-lived assets has been
reduced.

Closure and space reduction costs included
payments required under leases less any applicable estimated
sublease income after the properties were abandoned, lease
buyout costs, and costs to maintain facilities during the period
after abandonment. To determine the lease loss, which is the
loss after our cost recovery efforts from subleasing a building,
certain assumptions were made related to the: (1) time
period over which the relevant building would remain vacant,
(2) sublease terms, and (3) sublease rates, including
common area charges.

As of January 3, 2004, we have accrued the
low end of the lease loss range related to all worldwide
restructuring activities initiated since 2001, which is
estimated to be $23.2 million. This amount will be adjusted
in the future based upon changes in the assumptions used to
estimate the lease loss. As of January 3, 2004, we have
estimated that the high end of the lease loss range could be as
much as $47.8 million if sublease rental rates decrease in
applicable markets or if it takes longer than currently expected
to find a suitable tenant to sublease the facilities. Since
2001, we have recorded facilities consolidation charges under
the 2001, 2002 and 2003 Restructurings of $83.0 million
related to reducing space or the closing of 32 sites, of which
22 have been vacated and ten have been downsized.

Because the restructuring charges and related
benefits are derived from our management estimates made during
the formulation of the restructurings, based on then-currently
available information, our restructuring activities may not
achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the
level contemplated. The demands for our products and services
and, ultimately, our future financial performance, are difficult
to predict with any degree of certainty. Accordingly, additional
actions, including further restructuring of our operations, may
be required in the future.

The following is further discussion of each
restructuring plan:

Restructuring

— The 2003
Restructuring will result in the termination of approximately
635 employees. Costs resulting from this restructuring
included severance payments, severance-related benefits and



outplacement services. All terminations and
termination benefits associated with this restructuring were
communicated to the affected employees prior to January 3,
2004, with all termination benefits expected to be paid by
January 1, 2005.

We expect to incur an additional $4 million
to $6 million of future costs in connection with the 2003
Restructuring, primarily for facilities-related charges, which
will be expensed as incurred. We expect annualized cost
reductions resulting from the 2003 Restructuring of
approximately $62 million in employee salary and benefits
costs, related to the reduction in workforce and approximately
$4 million in facility costs related to facilities
consolidated or closed, which amounts could vary based on
changes in estimates. These workforce reductions occurred
throughout the company.

Of the $25.7 million of asset-related costs
we incurred in conjunction with the 2003 Restructuring,
$11.2 million was directly related to restructuring and
$14.5 million was for other charges. The $11.2 million
of asset-related restructuring charges primarily related to a
fee owed to a third party due to a reduction in headcount,
write-off of leasehold improvements for facilities, disposal of
excess equipment and contract termination costs.

The $14.5 million of other charges was
primarily related to the write-downs of internally developed and
purchased software. As a result of the restructuring efforts, we
eliminated budgeted expenditures for certain internally
developed software projects. As such, we determined that it was
no longer probable that the computer software being developed
for internal purposes would be completed and placed into
service. During the year, we also determined that we would not
integrate certain technology relating to purchased software,
that had been previously capitalized, into any of our future
products. Accordingly, we recognized a charge to reduce the
value of the internally developed software and purchased
software to zero.

The $10.9 million of net facilities charges
we incurred under the 2003 Restructuring primarily related to
space reductions at six sites and closure of five sites, along
with further consolidation of two previously downsized sites. We
accrued facilities charges as part of the 2003 Restructuring at
the time we ceased use of the vacated space.

Restructuring

— The 2002
Restructuring resulted in the termination of employment for
approximately 1,370 employees. While such terminations were
across various business functions, operating units and
geographic regions, the communications-related areas within the
design services business were the most affected. Costs resulting
from the restructuring included severance benefits, notice pay
and outplacement services. All terminations and termination
benefits were communicated to the affected employees prior to
December 28, 2002. During 2003, we incurred an additional
$0.8 million in severance and benefits related to
terminations included in the 2002 Restructuring. As of
January 3, 2004, $1.4 million of severance and
benefits associated with the 2002 restructuring activities
remain to be paid, which are expected to be paid by
June 30, 2004.

Asset-related and other restructuring charges of
$35.3 million incurred during 2002 under the 2002
Restructuring were connected with the abandonment of leasehold
improvements for facilities, impairments resulting from
abandonment of other fixed assets, including software licenses
and contract termination costs. During 2003, we incurred
$0.4 million of additional asset-related charges under the
2002 Restructuring for contract termination costs.

During 2003, we recorded $1.5 million of
additional facilities charges under the 2002 Restructuring,
primarily associated with changes to lease loss estimates
related to sites included in the plan. Facilities consolidation
charges of $32.4 million recorded during 2002 under the
2002 Restructuring were primarily connected with the further
downsizing of four previously downsized sites and the downsizing
and closing of 16 additional sites.

Restructuring

—
Facilities-related charges recorded under the 2001 Restructuring
were $1.8 million in 2003 and $14.5 million during
2002, primarily connected with changes in lease loss estimates,
due to reductions in estimated sublease income caused by
deterioration in local real estate markets where facilities
included in the plan are located.



Write-off of Acquired in-Process
Technology

Upon consummation of an acquisition, we
immediately charge to expense any acquired in-process technology
that has not yet reached technological feasibility and has no
alternative future use. The value assigned to acquired
in-process technology is determined by identifying research
projects in areas for which technological feasibility has not
been established. The values are determined by estimating costs
to develop the acquired in-process technology into commercially
viable products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from
such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their
present value. The discount rates utilized include a factor that
reflects the uncertainty surrounding successful development of
the acquired in-process technology.

Described below are the write-offs of acquired
in-process technology charges in 2003, 2002 and 2001.

Described below is a summary of in-process
technology acquired during 2003, 2002 and 2001 as of
January 3, 2004:

Impairment of Goodwill

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 142,
discussed in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements, we evaluated goodwill for impairment whenever events
or circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of goodwill
may not be recoverable. We recorded a charge of
$25.8 million in 2001 related to the impairment of goodwill
and acquired intangibles associated with the acquisition of
Diablo. This impairment was due to the decline in business
conditions generally and the wireless communications industry in
particular. Key factors in



determining this impairment were significant
downsizing or reassignment of personnel directly related to
these assets and abandonment of most of Diablo’s lines of
business. The impairment was calculated as the difference
between the carrying value of the intangible assets associated
with Diablo’s acquisition and the fair value of those
assets.

Other Income (loss), net

Other income (loss), net, for each of 2003, 2002
and 2001 is as follows:

In 2003, the Other loss of $10.4 million is
comprised of $4.8 million impairment on investments, $5.0
million loss on sales of accounts receivable and $0.6 million of
Other loss, net. In 2002, the Other loss of $8.7 million is
comprised of $14.1 million of impairment of investments,
$15.1 million of loss on sales of accounts receivable,
$24.9 million gain on sale of investments and
$4.4 million of Other loss, net. In 2001, the Other loss of
$1.5 million is comprised of $21.8 million of loss on
sales of accounts receivable, $6.0 million of impairment of
investments, $23.6 million gain on sale of investments and
$2.7 million of Other income, net.

Provision for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes and the effective
tax rates for 2003, 2002 and 2001 are as follows:

The loss before provision for income taxes
resulted in a benefit for income taxes in 2003 compared to a
provision for income taxes in 2002. The 2003 benefit has a
greater detriment from non-deductible amortization of stock
compensation expense partially offset by a greater benefit from
foreign income that is taxed at a lower rate than the federal
statutory rate in comparison to 2002. The effective tax rate
increased in 2002 from 2001, primarily due to the 2002
restructuring activities that resulted in foreign income being
taxed at a higher rate than the federal statutory rate and an
increase in non-deductible amortization of stock compensation
expense.

We expect to have a provision for income taxes in
2004 and expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 20%.
The 2004 provision is expected to have a smaller detriment from
certain non-deductible expenses including the amortization of
stock compensation and the write-off of in-process technology
when compared to 2003. We also estimate that the 2004 provision
will have a larger benefit from foreign income that is taxed at
a lower rate than the federal statutory rate when compared to
2003.

As of January 3, 2004, we had total net
deferred tax assets of approximately $89.5 million.
Realization of the deferred tax assets will depend on generating
sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character prior to
the expiration of certain net operating loss, capital loss and
tax credit carryforwards. Although realization is not assured,
we believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax
assets will be realized. The amount of the net deferred tax
assets, however, could be reduced or increased in the near term
if actual facts, including the estimate of future taxable
income, differ from those estimated.



The IRS and other tax authorities regularly
examine our income tax returns. The IRS recently completed its
field examination of our federal income tax returns for the
fiscal years ended 1997 through 1999 and has issued a Revenue
Agent’s Report, referred to as the RAR, in which the IRS
proposes to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the
three-year period of approximately $143 million, plus
interest, which interest will accrue until the matter is
resolved. This interest is compounded daily at rates published
by the IRS, which rates have been between four and nine percent
since 1997, and adjusts quarterly. The IRS may also make similar
claims for years subsequent to 1999 in future examinations. The
RAR is not a final Statutory Notice of Deficiency, and we have
protested certain of the proposed adjustments with the IRS.

The most significant of the disputed adjustments
relates to transfer pricing arrangements that we have with a
foreign subsidiary. We believe that the proposed IRS adjustments
are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws, and that we have
meritorious defenses to the proposed adjustments. We intend to
challenge these proposed adjustments vigorously. However, the
ultimate outcome of tax examinations cannot be predicted with
certainty, including the total amount payable or the timing of
any such payments upon resolution of these issues. In addition,
we cannot assure you that such amount will not be materially
different than that which is reflected in our historical income
tax provisions and accruals. Should the IRS or other tax
authorities assess additional taxes as a result of a current or
a future examination, we may be required to record charges to
operations in future periods that could have a material impact
on the results of operations, financial position or cash flows
in the period or periods resolved.

Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market risk for changes in
interest rates relates primarily to our short-term investment
portfolio. While we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in
many of the world’s leading industrialized countries, our
interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in
the general level of U.S. interest rates. In this regard,
changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned
on our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term
investments and costs associated with foreign currency hedges.

We invest in high quality credit issuers and, by
policy, limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one
issuer. As part of our policy, our priority is to reduce the
risk of principal loss. Consequently, we seek to preserve our
invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk and
reinvestment risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in only
high quality credit securities that we believe to have low
credit risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond
appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of
any investment issuer or guarantor. The short-term
interest-bearing portfolio includes only marketable securities
with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio
liquidity.

On August 15, 2003, we terminated our two
syndicated, senior unsecured credit facilities that allowed us
to borrow up to $375.0 million.



The table below presents the carrying value and
related weighted average interest rates for our interest-bearing
instruments. All highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are
considered to be cash equivalents; investments with original
maturities between three and 12 months are considered to be
short-term investments. Investments with original maturities
greater than 12 months are considered long-term
investments. The carrying value of our interest-bearing
instruments approximated fair value at January 3, 2004.

Foreign Currency Risk

Our operations include transactions in foreign
currencies and, therefore, we benefit from a weaker dollar, and
we are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major
currencies worldwide. The primary effect of foreign currency
transactions on our results of operations from a weakening
U.S. dollar is an increase in revenue offset by a smaller
increase in expenses. Conversely, the primary effect of foreign
currency transactions on our results of operations from a
strengthening U.S. dollar is a reduction in revenue offset
by a smaller reduction in expenses.

We enter into foreign currency forward exchange
contracts with financial institutions to protect against
currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and
liabilities. A foreign currency forward exchange contract acts
as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying asset
exposures decrease in value or underlying liability exposures
increase in value. Conversely, a foreign currency forward
exchange contract decreases in value when underlying asset
exposures increase in value or underlying liability exposures
decrease in value. Forward contracts are not accounted for as
hedges and, therefore, the unrealized gains and losses are
recognized in Other income (loss), net in advance of the actual
foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward
contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities.

We do not use forward contracts for trading
purposes. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to
currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates
in effect as the forward contracts mature.



The table below provides information as of
January 3, 2004 about Cadence’s forward foreign
currency contracts. The information is provided in
U.S. dollar equivalent amounts. The table presents the
notional amounts, at contract exchange rates, and the weighted
average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as
units of the foreign currency per U.S. dollar. These
forward contracts mature prior to January 16, 2004.

While we actively and continually manage our
foreign currency risks, there can be no assurance that our
foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset
the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our
results of operations, cash flows and financial position.

Equity Price Risk

In August 2003, we issued $420.0 million
principal amount of Zero Coupon Zero Yield Senior Convertible
Notes due 2023, to two initial purchasers in a private offering
for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC
Rule 144A, for which we received net proceeds of
approximately $408.5 million after transaction fees of
approximately $11.5 million. The Notes are convertible into
our common stock initially at a conversion price of
$15.65 per share, which would result in an aggregate of
26.8 million shares issued upon conversion, subject to
adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events.

Each $1,000 of principal of the Notes will
initially be convertible into 63.8790 shares of our common
stock, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified
events. Holders of the Notes may convert their Notes prior to
maturity only if: (1) the price of our common stock reaches
$22.69 during periods of time specified by the Notes,
(2) specified corporate transactions occur, (3) the
Notes have been called for redemption or (4) the trading
price of the Notes falls below a certain threshold.

In addition, in the event of a significant change
in our corporate ownership or structure, the holders may require
us to repurchase all or any portion of their Notes for 100% of
the principal amount.

Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, we
entered into convertible notes hedge transactions with
JP Morgan Chase Bank, whereby we have the option to
purchase up to 26.8 million shares of our common stock at a
price of $15.65 per share. These options expire on
August 15, 2008 and must be settled in net shares. The cost
of the convertible notes hedge transactions to us was
approximately $134.6 million. As of January 3, 2004,
the estimated fair value of the convertible notes hedge
transactions was $215.1 million.

In addition, we sold to JP Morgan Chase Bank
warrants to purchase up to 26.8 million shares of our
common stock at a price of $23.08 per share. The warrants
expire on various dates from February 2008 through May 2008 and
must be settled in net shares. We received approximately
$56.4 million in cash proceeds for the sales of these
warrants. As of January 3, 2004, the estimated fair value
of the sold warrants was $116.2 million.



For additional discussion of the Notes see
“Liquidity and Capital Resources” below.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

At January 3, 2004, our principal sources of
liquidity consisted of $418.4 million of Cash and cash
equivalents and Short-term investments, compared to
$395.6 million at December 28, 2002. The primary
sources of our cash are receipts from software licenses and the
sale or lease of our hardware, proceeds from the issuance of
convertible notes, proceeds from the sale of receivables and
from the exercise of stock options and common stock purchases
under our employee stock purchase plans. In 2003, our primary
uses of cash consisted of payroll costs, costs of acquisitions,
product and services, general and administrative expenses, cash
used to hedge convertible notes to manage equity dilution and
funds used in our share repurchase program.

At January 3, 2004, we had net working
capital of $360.3 million, as compared with
$254.3 million at December 28, 2002. The increase in
net working capital was primarily due to a decrease in Accounts
payable and accrued liabilities of $51.9 million, an
increase in Receivables, net, of $34.7 million, and an
increase in Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments
of $22.8 million, partially offset by an increase in
Deferred revenue of $30.8 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities
decreased by $176.7 million, to $171.0 million, during
2003 when compared to $347.7 million net cash provided by
operating activities during 2002. The decrease from 2002 to 2003
is primarily due to a reduction in income of $77.9 million,
a decrease in deferred income taxes of $35.9 million and a
$26.5 million reduction in write-off of acquired in-process
technology.

We have entered into agreements whereby we may
transfer qualifying accounts receivable to certain financing
institutions on a non-recourse basis. These transfers are
recorded as sales and accounted for in accordance with
SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and
Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
Liabilities.” During 2003, we transferred accounts
receivable totaling $87.4 million, which approximated fair
value, to financing institutions on a non-recourse basis, as
compared to $182.0 million transferred during 2002.

Provision for sales returns is accounted for as a
reduction of revenue. Provision for sales returns increased
$1.2 million in 2003 compared to 2002 due to continued
customer preference for more flexible subscription license
arrangements. The sales return reserve as of year-end 2003
increased modestly in absolute dollars from year-end 2002, but
remained at approximately 3% of net accounts receivable due to a
slight increase in total receivables during 2002. Provision for
sales returns decreased $24.0 million in 2002 compared to
2001 primarily in response to improved customer satisfaction
with more flexible license arrangements, and to a lesser extent,
an improving economic environment. The sales return reserve
decreased $29.9 million in 2002 from 2001 due to write-offs
of specific customer returns allowances recorded in 2001.

Our primary investing activities consisted of
business combinations and acquired intangibles, purchases of
property, plant and equipment, purchases of software licenses
and venture capital partnership and equity investments, which
combined represented $338.4 million of cash used for
investing activities in 2003, as compared to $175.4 million
in 2002.

As part of our overall investment strategy, we
are a limited partner in two venture capital funds, Telos I
and Telos II (referred to together as Telos). We and
certain of our deferred compensation trusts are the sole limited
partners of Telos I and we are the sole limited partner of
Telos II. The partnership agreements governing Telos I
and Telos II, which are substantially the same, require
Cadence to meet capital calls principally for the purpose of
funding investments that are recommended by the applicable Telos
general partner, and approved by the Telos advisory committee as
being consistent with the partnership’s limitations and
stated purposes. The Telos general partner, which is not
affiliated with Cadence, manages the partnerships and may be
removed by Cadence without cause. For both partnerships, the
advisory committee is comprised solely of our Chief Executive
Officer and our Chairman of the Board of Directors. As of
January 3, 2004, we had contributed $83.0 million to
these partnerships and are contractually committed to contribute
to them up to an additional $44.0 million. Our commitments
expire concurrently with the termination date of each
partnership, which, in the case of Telos I is
December 31, 2005 and, in the case of Telos II, is
July 3, 2012.



Our investments in the Telos partnerships are
recorded in Other assets in the accompanying Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

During 2003, we received $9.1 million in
cash from the sale-leaseback of certain equipment. We will make
aggregate payments under the resulting operating leases of
$9.1 million over the three to five year life of the
operating leases.

Net cash provided by financing activities for
2003, of $149.2 million increased by $203.3 million
from 2002. In 2003, our primary source of cash from financing
activities was the issuance of $420.0 million of
convertible notes and the sale of common stock warrants as
discussed further below. The primary use of cash from financing
activities was the repurchase of $213.8 million of treasury
stock and the purchase of convertible notes hedges for
$134.6 million.

During 2003, we issued $86.6 million of
stock upon exercise of employee options and stock purchase
rights.

We expect to continue our financing activity and
use cash reserves to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase
program. We may also consider additional hedging transactions if
opportunities become available.

As compared to December 28, 2002, Other
long-term liabilities increased $112.9 million to
$327.3 million at January 3, 2004. The increase was
primarily attributable to indemnity holdbacks from purchase
price payments relating to three recent business acquisitions
and an increase in deferred payments relating to another recent
acquisition. The primary components of Other long-term
liabilities are $45.3 million of deferred compensation,
$34.8 million of accrued restructuring charges and
$247.2 million relating to indemnity holdbacks from
acquisitions, deferred payments relating to acquisitions and
deferred tax liabilities.

We provide for U.S. income taxes on the
earnings of our foreign subsidiaries unless these earnings are
considered permanently invested outside of the United States. If
some or all of these foreign earnings were to be distributed to
any of our U.S. subsidiaries, we would be required to
provide for additional U.S. income taxes. At
January 3, 2004, the cumulative amount of earnings upon
which U.S. income taxes have not been provided was
approximately $450 million. At January 3, 2004, the
unrecognized deferred tax liability for these earnings was
approximately $80 million.

We recently received a revenue agent report
(referred to as an RAR) from the IRS in which the IRS proposes
to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the tax years from
1997 to 1999 of approximately $143 million, plus interest,
which interest will accrue until the matter is resolved. The RAR
is not a final Statutory Notice of Deficiency, and we have filed
a protest with the IRS to certain of the proposed adjustments.
We are challenging these proposed adjustments vigorously. The
IRS may also make similar claims for tax returns filed for years
subsequent to 1999. While we are protesting certain of the
proposed adjustments, we can not predict with certainty the
ultimate outcome of the tax examination including the amount
payable, or timing of such payments, which may materially impact
our cash flows in the period or periods resolved.

We expect to incur an additional $4 million
to $6 million of future costs in connection with the 2003
Restructuring, primarily for facilities-related charges which
will be expensed as incurred. We expect annualized cost
reductions resulting from the 2003 Restructuring of
approximately $62 million in employee salary and benefits
costs, related to the reduction in workforce and approximately
$4 million in facility costs related to facilities
consolidated or closed, which amounts could vary based on
changes in estimates.

In August 2003, we issued $420.0 million
principal amount of Zero Coupon Zero Yield Senior Convertible
Notes due 2023, or the Notes, to two initial purchasers in a
private offering for resale to qualified institutional buyers
pursuant to SEC Rule 144A. We received net proceeds of
approximately $408.5 million after transaction fees of
approximately $11.5 million that have been recorded in
Other long-term assets and are being amortized to interest
expense using the straight-line method over five years, which is
the duration of the first redemption period. We issued the Notes
at par and the Notes bear no interest. The Notes are convertible
into our common stock initially at a conversion price of
$15.65 per share, which would result in an aggregate of
26.8 million shares issued upon conversion, subject to
adjustment upon the occurrence of



specified events. We may redeem for cash all or
any part of the Notes on or after August 15, 2008 for
100.00% of the principal amount. The holders may require us to
repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Notes on
August 15, 2008 for 100.25% of the principal amount, on
August 15, 2013 for 100.00% of the principal amount or on
August 15, 2018 for 100.00% of the principal amount. As a
result, although the Notes mature in 2023, the holders of the
Notes may require us to repurchase their Notes at an additional
premium in 2008, which makes it probable that we will be
required to repurchase the Notes in 2008 if the Notes are not
otherwise converted into our common stock. The Notes do not
contain restrictive financial covenants.

In addition, in the event of a significant change
in our corporate ownership or structure, the holders may require
us to repurchase all or any portion of their Notes for 100% of
the principal amount. Upon a significant change in our corporate
ownership or structure, in certain circumstances, we may choose
to pay the repurchase price in cash, shares of our common stock
or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock.

We have agreed to file a shelf registration
statement with respect to the resale of the Notes and the common
stock issuable upon the conversion of the Notes with the SEC
within 90 days from the initial issuance of the Notes. In
the event we do not file a shelf registration statement with the
SEC within such time or the shelf registration statement is not
declared effective by the SEC within 180 days from the
initial issuance of the Notes or, after effectiveness, we
suspend its use beyond certain permitted periods, we are
obligated to pay liquidated damages to the holders of the Notes.
In November 2003, we filed with the SEC a resale registration
statement with respect to the Notes. This registration statement
was not declared effective by the SEC within the 180-day period,
and has not been declared effective as of the date of the filing
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As a result, on
February 12, 2004, we began to incur liquidated damages at
a penalty rate of approximately $2,900 per day for the
first 90 days, accruing daily. After the first
90 days, the penalty rate doubles until it ceases to accrue
upon the date the registration statement becomes effective or is
no longer suspended from use. As of the date of filing this
Annual Report on Form 10-K, the registration statement has
not become effective.

Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, we
entered into convertible notes hedge transactions whereby we
have the option to purchase up to 26.8 million shares of
our common stock at a price of $15.65 per share. These
options expire on August 15, 2008 and must be settled in
net shares. The cost of the convertible notes hedge transactions
to us was approximately $134.6 million.

In addition, we sold warrants to purchase up to
26.8 million shares of our common stock at a price of
$23.08 per share. The warrants expire on various dates from
February 2008 through May 2008 and must be settled in net
shares. We received approximately $56.4 million in cash
proceeds for the sales of these warrants.

The costs incurred in connection with the
convertible notes hedge transactions and the proceeds from the
sale of the warrants are included as a net reduction in common
stock and capital in excess of par in the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 3, 2004, in
accordance with the guidance in EITF Issue No. 00-19,
“Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed
to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own
Stock.” Subsequent changes in the fair value of these
convertible notes hedge and warrant transactions will not be
recognized as long as the instruments remain classified in
equity.

Prior to conversion, the Notes have no impact on
the calculation of basic or dilutive earnings per share, or EPS,
unless the price of our common stock reaches $22.69, or the
contingent conversion price, during certain quarterly conversion
periods until August 2018, and then at any time thereafter until
maturity or earlier redemption or repurchase. For any quarterly
conversion period through August 2018 or any time after August
2018 in which the price of our common stock reaches the
contingent conversion price, we will use the “as if
converted” method to calculate the effect on diluted EPS,
which will have the effect of increasing the number of
outstanding shares by 26.8 million.

Because we entered into the Notes hedge
transactions and the sale of the warrants, upon conversion of
the Notes there is no impact on basic or dilutive EPS, except as
described above under the “as if converted” method,
unless the price of our common stock exceeds the warrant strike
price of $23.08 per share. Up to $23.08 per share, in
connection with any conversion, the operation of the Notes hedge
transactions and sale of the warrants would effectively result
in no impact on basic or dilutive EPS. In the event our common
stock



exceeds $23.08 per share, for the first
$1.00 the price exceeds $23.08, there would be dilution of
approximately 1.1 million shares and the impact on the
calculation of EPS will vary depending on when during the
quarter the $23.08 per share price is reached. As this
share price continues to increase, dilution would continue to
occur but at a declining rate. If these transactions settle in
our favor, we could be exposed to credit risk related to the
other party to the transactions.

After our issuance of the Notes, we terminated
our senior credit facilities.

A summary of contractual obligations follows:

In addition to the summary of contractual
obligations detailed above, in connection with our acquisitions
completed prior to January 3, 2004, we may be obligated to
pay up to an aggregate of $39.1 million during fiscal 2004.
In addition, we may be required to pay an additional
$76.0 million in cash from 2005 through 2007 if certain
performance goals related to revenue, bookings, product
development, product proliferation, and employee retention are
achieved in full.

We expect that current cash and short-term
investment balances and cash flow from operations will be
sufficient to meet our working capital and other capital
requirements for at least the next 12 months. Also, while
we have no committed lines of credit, we believe our good credit
and strong banking relationships will provide us with access to
bank debt and opportunities to raise debt in the public markets
if additional liquidity is needed.

New Accounting Standards

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board, or FASB, issued FASB Interpretation
No. 46, or FIN 46, “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities — An Interpretation of ARB
No. 51.” FIN 46 requires companies to include in
their consolidated financial statements the assets, liabilities
and results of activities of variable interest entities if the
company holds a majority of the variable interests. The
consolidation requirements of FIN 46 are effective for
variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003
or for entities in which an interest is acquired after
January 31, 2003. In October 2003, the FASB deferred the
implementation date for the consolidation requirements of
FIN 46 as it relates to variable interest entities that
existed before February 1, 2003. In December 2003, the FASB
revised FIN 46. The consolidation requirements of the
revised FIN 46 will apply to variable interest entities
that existed prior to February 1, 2003 in financial
statements issued for periods ending after December 15,
2003. The revised FIN 46 also requires companies that
expect to consolidate a variable interest entity they acquired
before February 1, 2003 to disclose the entity’s
nature, size, activities, and the company’s maximum
exposure to loss in financial statements issued after
December 31, 2003. We have determined the adoption of the
required provisions of the revised FIN 46 did not have a
material effect on our consolidated financial position, results
of operations or cash flows.

In May 2003, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and
Equity.” SFAS No. 150 requires companies to
classify and measure certain financial instruments with
characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that
an issuer classify



a financial instrument that requires a transfer
of assets and that meets the definition of liabilities in
Concepts Statement 6 and other recognition criteria in
SFAS No. 5, “Recognition and Measurement in
Financial Statements of Business Enterprises,” be reported
as a liability. SFAS No. 150 also requires that
certain obligations that could be settled by issuance of an
entity’s equity but lack other characteristics of equity be
reported as liabilities even though the obligation does not meet
the definition of liabilities in Concepts Statement No. 6.
SFAS No. 150 is effective for financial instruments
entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise
is effective beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of
SFAS No. 150 did not have a material effect on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

Controls and Procedures

Cadence carried out an evaluation required by
Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 under
the supervision and with the participation of Cadence’s
management, including the Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, and
the Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of January 3, 2004.

Disclosure controls and procedures are designed
with the objective of ensuring that (i) information
required to be disclosed in Cadence’s reports filed under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC’s rules and forms; and (ii) information is
accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO
and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. Internal controls are procedures designed
with the objective of providing reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and permitting the
preparation of Cadence’s financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles, including that
its (A) transactions are properly authorized, recorded and
reported and (B) assets are safeguarded against
unauthorized or improper use.

The evaluation of Cadence’s disclosure
controls and procedures and internal controls included a review
of its processes and implementation and the effect on the
information generated for use in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K. In the course of this evaluation, Cadence sought
to identify any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses
in its controls, to determine whether it had identified any acts
of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in its
internal controls, and to confirm that any necessary corrective
action, including process improvements, were being undertaken.
This type of evaluation is done every fiscal quarter so that
Cadence’s conclusions concerning the effectiveness of these
controls can be reported in its periodic reports filed with the
SEC. Cadence’s internal controls are also evaluated on an
ongoing basis by its internal auditors and by other personnel in
its Finance organization. The overall goals of these evaluation
activities are to monitor Cadence’s disclosure and internal
controls and to make modifications as necessary. Cadence intends
to maintain these controls, modifying them as circumstances
warrant.

The evaluation has allowed Cadence to make
conclusions, as set forth below, regarding the state of its
disclosure controls and procedures as of January 3, 2004.
In connection with this evaluation, to improve the quality and
timeliness of information available to management, Cadence made
certain changes in its internal controls over financial
reporting in 2003, as reflected below.

As more fully described in Note 4 to
Cadence’s Consolidated Financial Statements, Cadence has
restated its Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 28,
2002 and the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2002 and
the first three quarters of 2003 to properly reflect the equity
method of accounting for certain equity investments and for
certain other adjustments.

Cadence’s independent auditors have issued a
letter to our Audit Committee related to the audit of
Cadence’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the year
ended January 3, 2004 in which they noted certain matters
involving Cadence’s internal control and operation that
they consider to be “reportable conditions”, as
defined under standards established by the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants. Reportable conditions are matters
coming to the attention of our independent auditors that, in
their judgment, relate to significant deficiencies in the design
or operation of internal control and could adversely affect
Cadence’s ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data consistent with the assertions of management in
the financial statements. The reportable conditions, which are
less serious findings than a finding of material weaknesses,
were: the absence of appropriate controls relating to
investments in non-marketable securities and



the absence of appropriate documentation, review
and approval of significant non-revenue related transactions,
and the corresponding accounting entries originating from
departments other than corporate accounting. As a result of
these findings, Cadence’s Audit Committee has authorized
and directed management to fully implement actions to address
these deficiencies and to enhance the reliability and
effectiveness of Cadence’s control procedures.

To address the insufficiency of appropriate
controls relating to investments in non-marketable securities,
Cadence initiated changes to its internal controls regarding
reporting by Telos and its Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances,
or MA&A, group to Cadence’s corporate accounting group
regarding Cadence and Telos investments, which changes have been
fully implemented. These changes include the implementation of
written reporting and review policies to ensure that
Cadence’s corporate accounting group receives and validates
as complete and accurate on a quarterly basis all pertinent
information relating to investments held directly by Cadence as
well as Telos, so that Cadence can properly account for its
investments in non-marketable securities.

To address the absence of appropriate
documentation, reviews and approvals of transactions, and
accounting entries originating from departments other than
corporate accounting, Cadence has already taken actions designed
to enhance its internal controls, including the implementation
of formal written policies and procedures to ensure appropriate
communication between Cadence’s corporate accounting group
and other departments, including MA&A, Tax, Stock
Administration and foreign locations, to facilitate the timely
identification, documentation, review and approval of, and to
ensure proper accounting for, significant non-revenue related
and non-routine transactions. Cadence will fully implement these
policies before the end of its second fiscal quarter of 2004.

Cadence believes that these efforts have
addressed the significant deficiencies that affected or could
have affected its internal controls in 2003, 2002 and 2001.
Based upon the foregoing, Cadence’s CEO and CFO have
concluded that Cadence’s controls and procedures, after
implementing the aforementioned actions, are effective in
meeting the above-stated objectives. Cadence continues to
improve and refine its internal controls. This process is
ongoing, and Cadence seeks to foster an exemplary internal
control environment. Cadence’s management, including its
CEO and CFO, has concluded that, except for the deficiencies
described above, and taking into account the efforts to address
those deficiencies described above, as of January 3, 2004,
its disclosure controls and procedures are designed, and are
effective, to give reasonable assurance that information it must
disclose in reports filed with the SEC is properly recorded,
processed and summarized, and then reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC.

Other than as summarized above, there have been
no changes in Cadence’s internal controls over financial
reporting or in other factors that have materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal
controls.

Despite management’s conclusions regarding
the effectiveness of Cadence’s controls and procedures, a
control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
objectives of the control system are met. Cadence’s
management, including its CEO and CFO, necessarily applied its
judgment in assessing the benefits of controls relative to their
costs. In particular, Cadence has investments in certain
unconsolidated entities, which investments are accounted for
using either the cost basis or equity method of accounting.
Because Cadence does not control or manage these entities, its
disclosure controls and procedures with respect to information
it receives from such entities are often more limited than those
it maintains with respect to its consolidated subsidiaries.
Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control
systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if
any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is
based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of
future events, and there can be no assurance that any design
will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential
future conditions, regardless of how remote. Because of the
inherent limitations in a control system, misstatements due to
error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

The Stockholders and Board of Directors

Cadence Design Systems, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries
as of January 3, 2004 and December 28, 2002 and the
related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income and cash
flows for the years then ended. In connection with our audits of
the consolidated financial statements for the years ended
January 3, 2004 and December 28, 2002, we also have
audited the financial statement schedule listed in
Item 15.(a)2. These consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedule based on our audits. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule for the year ended December 29, 2001 of Cadence
Design Systems, Inc. were audited by other auditors who have
ceased operations. Those auditors expressed an unqualified
opinion on those consolidated financial statements and the
related financial statement schedule, before the revisions
described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements, in their report dated March 11, 2002.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Cadence Design
Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 3, 2004
and December 28, 2002, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 4 to the accompanying
consolidated financial statements, the consolidated balance
sheet as of December 28, 2002 and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash
flows for the year then ended have been restated.

As discussed above, the consolidated financial
statements of Cadence Design Systems, Inc. for the year
ended December 29, 2001 were audited by other auditors who
have ceased operations. As described in Note 2, the
consolidated statement of operations has been restated to
include amortization of acquired intangibles as a component of
cost of revenues and the consolidated statement of cash flows
has been restated to include proceeds from the sale of
receivables as a component of cash flows from operating
activities rather than as a component of cash flows from
financing activities. We audited the adjustments described in
Note 2 that were applied to restate the 2001 consolidated
statements of operations and cash flows. In our opinion, such
adjustments are appropriate and have been properly applied. As
also described in Note 2, the consolidated financial
statements have been revised to include the transitional
disclosures required by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets” (SFAS No. 142), which was adopted by the
Company as of December 30, 2001 (the beginning of the
Company’s fiscal year 2002). In our opinion, the
disclosures for 2001 related to the adoption of
SFAS No. 142 in Note 2 are appropriate. However,
we were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to
the 2001 consolidated financial statements of Cadence Design
Systems, Inc. other than with respect to such adjustments and
disclosures and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or
any other form of assurance on the 2001 consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC
ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of
Cadence Design Systems, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (a Delaware
corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 29, 2001 and
December 30, 2000, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each
of the three fiscal years in the period ended December 29,
2001. These financial statements and the schedule referred to
below are the responsibility of Cadence’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
consolidated financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Cadence Design Systems, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December 29, 2001 and
December 30, 2000, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the
period ended December 29, 2001, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

Our audits were made for the purpose of forming
an opinion on the basic financial statements taken as a whole.
The schedule listed in Item 14.(a)2. is presented for
purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s rules and is not part of the basic
consolidated financial statements. This schedule has been
subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the
basic consolidated financial statements and, in our opinion,
fairly states in all material respects the financial data
required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

NOTE 1.

CADENCE

Cadence Design Systems, Inc. licenses
electronic design automation, or EDA, software, sells or leases
hardware technology and provides design and methodology services
throughout the world to help accelerate and manage
customer’s electronic product development processes.
Cadence’s broad range of products and services are used by
the world’s leading electronics companies to design and
develop complex ICs, and personal and commercial electronic
systems.

Restatement

During 2003, Cadence restated its Consolidated
Financial Statements as of and for the fiscal year ended
December 28, 2002 as discussed in more detail in
Note 4. While certain adjustments impacting Cadence’s
Consolidated Financial Statements for periods prior to fiscal
2002 were also identified, the Consolidated Financial Statements
for fiscal 2001 were not materially affected by the adjustments
discussed below, and a firm that is no longer in existence
audited the Consolidated Financial Statements for that year.
Accordingly, no adjustments have been made to Cadence’s
fiscal 2001 Consolidated Financial Statements for these items.
However, in order for the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
December 28, 2002 to be properly stated, Cadence has
recorded the cumulative effect of adjustments of
$11.9 million for all years prior to fiscal 2002 to opening
retained earnings for fiscal 2002. The cumulative effect of the
$11.9 million is net of the related tax effects and
consists of $4.3 million in 2001, $3.3 million in
2000, $2.3 million in 1999 and $2.0 million prior to
1999.

NOTE 2.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES

Principles
of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

Cadence’s fiscal year end is the Saturday
closest to December 31. Fiscal 2003 was a 53-week year.
Fiscal 2002 and 2001 were 52-week years. Fiscal 2004 will be a
52-week year ending January 1, 2005.

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Cadence and its subsidiaries after elimination of
intercompany accounts and transactions. Investments in companies
in which voting interests range from 20% to 50%, or for which
Cadence has the ability to exercise significant influence, are
accounted for using the equity method of accounting.

Reclassifications

During 2003, Cadence began reporting amortization
expense related to certain intangible assets acquired in
business combinations in Cost of product, Cost of services and
Cost of maintenance in its Consolidated Statements of
Operations. Cadence previously recorded all amortization expense
related to these intangibles in Amortization of acquired
intangibles. Accordingly, Cadence has restated the following
amounts to correct these errors in 2002 and 2001 in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations:

These restatements had no effect on earnings or
loss in any year. See Note 4, Restatements, for additional
information about other adjustments.



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

January 3, 2004

During the fourth quarter of 2003, Cadence also
reclassified goodwill of $663.2 million as of
December 28, 2002 from Acquired intangibles, net on its
Consolidated Balance Sheets and reclassified $0.9 million
of purchased software technology as of December 28, 2002
from Acquired intangibles, net to Other assets in the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets to correct these errors
and conform to the January 3, 2004 presentation.
Additionally, Cadence reclassified $11.2 million of
deferred revenue from Deferred revenue — current to
Deferred revenue — Long-term to correct these errors
and conform to the January 3, 2004 presentation. See
Note 4, Restatements for additional information.

For the year ended December 28, 2002,
Cadence has restated its Statement of Cash Flows for the effects
of the restatement adjustments discussed in Note 4
resulting in a decrease to Net cash provided by operating
activities of $2.5 million and a decrease to Net cash used
by investing activities of $2.5 million.

For the year ended December 29, 2001,
Cadence has restated its Statements of Cash Flows to include
proceeds from the sale of receivables of $235.8 million as
a component of cash flows from operating activities rather than
as a component of cash flows from financing activities, which is
consistent with the guidance of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 95, “Statement of
Cash Flows.”

Use
of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Cash,
Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

Cadence considers all highly liquid debt
instruments, including commercial paper, euro time deposits,
repurchase agreements and certificates of deposit with remaining
maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be
cash equivalents. Investments with maturities greater than three
months and less than one year are classified as short-term
investments.

Foreign
Currency Translation

Cadence transacts business in various foreign
currencies. In general, the functional currency of a foreign
operation is the local country’s currency except for
Cadence’s principal Irish and Hungarian subsidiaries, whose
functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Non-functional
currency monetary balances are remeasured into the functional
currency of the subsidiary with any related gain or loss
recorded in earnings. Assets and liabilities of operations
outside the United States, for which the functional currency is
the local currency, are translated into U.S. dollars using
fiscal year-end exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are
translated at the exchange rates in effect at the end of each
fiscal month during the year. The effects of foreign currency
translation adjustments are included in Stockholders’
Equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income
in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Derivative
Financial Instruments

Cadence enters into foreign currency forward
exchange contracts with financial institutions to protect
against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets
and liabilities. A foreign currency forward exchange contract
acts as an economic hedge by increasing in value when underlying
asset exposures decrease in value or underlying liability
exposures increase in value. Conversely, a foreign currency
forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying
asset exposures increase in value or underlying liability
exposures decrease in value. Forward contracts are not accounted
for as hedges and, therefore, the unrealized gains and



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

January 3, 2004

losses are recognized in Other income (loss), net
included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Operations in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows
with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as
accrued liabilities or other assets.

Cadence does not use forward contracts for
trading or hedging purposes. Cadence’s ultimate realized
gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend
on the currency exchange rates in effect as the forward
contracts mature.

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts

Cadence makes judgments as to its ability to
collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the
portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful.
Provisions are made based upon a specific review of all
significant outstanding invoices and are recorded in operating
expenses. For those invoices not specifically reviewed,
provisions are provided at differing rates, based upon the age
of the receivable. In determining these percentages, Cadence
analyzes its historical collection experience and current
economic trends. If the historical data Cadence uses to
calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not
reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables,
additional provisions may be needed and the future results of
operations could be materially affected.

Allowance
for Sales Returns

Provisions for sales returns primarily result
from amendments to product, maintenance and service arrangements
and are recorded as a reduction to revenue. These provisions are
made based on historical experience and changes in customer
preferences.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost
(using the first-in, first-out method) or market value.
Cadence’s inventories include high technology parts and
components for complex computer systems that emulate the
performance and operation of computer IC and electronic systems.
These parts and components may be specialized in nature or
subject to rapid technological obsolescence. While Cadence has
programs to minimize the required inventories on hand and
considers technological obsolescence when estimating required
reserves to reduce recorded amounts to market values, it is
reasonably possible that such estimates could change in the near
term. Cadence’s practice is to reserve for inventory in
excess of 12-month demand.

In the year ended January 3, 2004, Cadence
recorded no write-off for excess inventory. In the year ended
December 28, 2002, Cadence recorded a $9.3 million
write-off for excess inventory in cost of product revenue, for
excess inventory from decreased sales forecasts. In the year
ended December 29, 2001, Cadence recorded an
$18.9 million write-off for excess inventory in cost of
product revenue. Of the $18.9 million write-off,
$15.2 million was related to excess inventory from
decreased sales forecasts and $3.7 million related to two
product lines that were discontinued as part of Cadence’s
restructuring. The excess inventory charges of $9.3 million
in 2002 and $15.2 million in 2001 were due to significant
decreases in forecasted revenue for emulation products.



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

January 3, 2004

Property,
Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is stated at
historical cost. Depreciation and amortization are generally
provided over the estimated useful lives, using the
straight-line method, as follows:

Computer equipment and related software

3-8 years

Buildings

10-32 years

Leasehold and building improvements

Shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful
    life

Furniture and fixtures

3-5 years

Equipment

3-5 years

Cadence capitalizes the costs of software
developed for internal use in compliance with Statement of
Position, or SOP, 98-1 “Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use”
and with Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue 00-2
“Accounting for Web Site Development Costs.”
Capitalization of software developed for internal use and web
site development costs begins at the application development
phase of the project. Cadence capitalized $21.0 million in
2003, $48.1 million in 2002, and $68.0 million in
2001, of costs relating to purchased software, internal
development and other consulting services from third parties for
software that is used, or intended to be used, internally.
Amortization of software developed for internal use and web site
development costs begins when the computer software is ready for
its intended use, and is computed on a straight-line basis over
the estimated useful life of the product.

Cadence recorded depreciation expense of
property, plant and equipment for the fiscal years 2003, 2002,
and 2001 in the amount of $81.9 million,
$100.1 million, and $83.2 million, respectively.

Software
Development Costs

Cadence accounts for software development costs
in accordance with SFAS No. 86, “Accounting for
the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise
Marketed.” Software development costs are capitalized
beginning when a product’s technological feasibility has
been established by completion of a working model of the product
and ending when a product is available for general release to
customers. The period between the achievement of technological
feasibility and the general release of Cadence’s products
has been of short duration. Internally-generated and purchased
capitalizable software development costs have not been material.

Cadence capitalized $33.5 million of
purchased software during 2003 and $8.8 million during
2002. Cadence has deemed the purchased software to have an
alternative future use. Cadence begins amortization of purchased
software, on a straight-line basis, when the technology is
available for general release to customers. Amortization expense
related to purchased software was $0.5 million during 2003,
$1.9 million during 2002 and $3.3 million during 2001.
In addition, Cadence reported an impairment charge of
$10.2 million in 2002 in connection with purchased software
included in Restructuring and other charges in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations.

Acquired
Intangibles, including Goodwill

Acquired intangibles, which include purchased
technology and other intangible assets, are stated at cost less
accumulated amortization and are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may
exist. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets” which was adopted on
December 30, 2001 (the beginning of Cadence’s fiscal
year 2002), goodwill and purchased intangibles with indefinite
useful lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed
periodically for impairment. Accordingly, beginning in 2002
Cadence has ceased to amortize approximately $178.8 million
of goodwill, net of amortization, including workforce
intangibles that were subsumed into goodwill upon adoption



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

January 3, 2004

of SFAS No. 142. Acquired intangibles
with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over
the remaining estimated economic life of the underlying products
and technologies (original lives assigned are one to ten years).

During the third quarters of 2003 and 2002,
Cadence completed its annual impairment analysis of goodwill.
Based on the results of the impairment review, Cadence has
determined that no indicators of impairment existed for its
three reporting units. No impairment charge has been recognized
during 2003 or 2002.

The pro forma effects of the adoption of
SFAS No. 142 are as follows:

Long-lived
Assets

Cadence’s long-lived assets consist of
property, plant and equipment and other acquired intangibles,
excluding goodwill. Cadence reviews its long-lived assets for
impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144
“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets.” For assets to be held and used, Cadence initiates
its review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be
recoverable. Recoverability of an asset is measured by
comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future
undiscounted cash flows (without interest charges) that the
asset is expected to generate. If it is determined that an asset
is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded in the amount
by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair
value. No impairments were recorded for long-lived assets during
2003 or 2002.

Assets to be disposed of and for which management
has committed to a plan to dispose of the assets, whether
through sale or abandonment, are reported at the lower of
carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Management has
no assets that are deemed held for sale as of January 3,
2004.

Marketable
and Non-Marketable Securities

Marketable Securities

Management considers all of its investments in
marketable securities as available-for-sale. Marketable
securities are stated at fair value, with the unrealized gains
and losses reported as a component of stockholders’



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

January 3, 2004

equity until realized. The cost of securities
sold is determined using the specific identification method when
computing realized gains and losses.

Non-Marketable Securities

Cadence’s non-marketable securities include
investments in privately-held companies that Cadence makes
either directly, or indirectly through venture capital limited
partnerships. Cadence owns limited partnership interest in two
venture capital limited partnerships, Telos Venture Partners,
L.P., or Telos I, and Telos Venture Partners II, L.P.,
or Telos II, and together with Telos I referred to as
Telos, that invest in early stage companies with innovative
technologies. Cadence and certain of its deferred compensation
trusts are the sole limited partners of Telos I and Cadence
is the sole limited partner of Telos II. The partnership
agreements governing Telos, which are substantially the same,
require Cadence to meet capital calls principally for the
purpose of funding investments that are recommended by the
applicable Telos general partner, and approved by the Telos
advisory committee as being consistent with the
partnership’s limitations and stated purposes. The Telos
general partner, which is not affiliated with Cadence, manages
the partnerships and may be removed by Cadence without cause.
For both partnerships, the advisory committee is comprised
solely of Cadence’s Chief Executive Officer and
Cadence’s Chairman of the Board of Directors. As of
January 3, 2004, Cadence had contributed $83.0 million
to these Telos partnerships and is contractually committed to
contribute to these partnerships up to an additional
$44.0 million. Cadence’s commitments expire
concurrently with the termination date of each partnership,
which, in the case of Telos I is December 31, 2005
and, in the case of Telos II, is July 3, 2012.

The investments made by Telos and directly by
Cadence are accounted for using either the cost or equity method
of accounting. Cadence accounts for investments made by Telos as
if Cadence had directly made the investment and accordingly, all
investments recorded on the equity method of accounting are
adjusted to reflect Cadence’s share of the investee’s
income (loss).

Cadence’s non-marketable securities held by
Telos, or Cadence directly, are not publicly-traded and,
therefore, there is no established market for these securities.
To determine the fair market value of these investments, Cadence
uses the most recent round of financing involving new
non-strategic investors or estimates of current market value. It
is Cadence’s policy to review the fair value of these
investments held by Telos, as well as its direct investments, on
a regular basis to determine whether the carrying value of the
investments in these companies are other-than-temporarily
impaired. This evaluation includes, but is not limited to,
reviewing each company’s cash position, financing needs,
earnings/revenue outlook, operational performance,
management/ownership changes and competition. In the case of
privately-held companies, this evaluation is based on
information that Cadence requests from these companies. This
information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as
U.S. publicly-traded companies and as such, the basis for
these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of
the data received from these companies. If Cadence believes the
carrying value of a company is in excess of fair value, and this
difference is other-than-temporary, it is Cadence’s policy
to write-down the investments to reduce its carrying value to
fair value.

Equity Method Investments

All investments accounted for by Cadence under
the equity method of accounting are held in the form of voting
preferred stock or convertible debt of privately-held companies.
Cadence’s application of the equity method of accounting is
in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue
No. 99-10, “Percentage Used to Determine the Amount of
Equity Method Losses”, approach (a). Accordingly, the
portion of equity method loss or income recorded by Cadence is
based on its’ percentage ownership of each investee’s
preferred stock or convertible debt available to absorb losses
or with contractual rights to income. Its level of participation
in future financings of its equity method investees may impact
Cadence’s proportional share in future income or losses.
Cadence records its interest in equity method gains and losses
in the quarter

following incurrence because it is not
practicable to obtain investee financial statements prior to the
issuance of Cadence’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Cost Method Investments

Investments accounted for by Cadence under the
cost method of accounting are carried at historical cost and
Cadence periodically evaluates the fair value of each investment
to determine if an other-than-temporary decline in value has
occurred.

Deferred
Revenue

Deferred revenue arises when customers are billed
for products and/or services in advance of delivery and
completion of the earnings process. Cadence’s deferred
revenue consists primarily of unearned revenue on maintenance
and product licenses for which revenue is recognized in
installments over the duration of the license. Maintenance on
perpetual licenses is generally renewed annually, billed in full
in advance, and earned over multiple periods over the ensuing
12-month maintenance term. Product licenses recognized as
revenue over multiple periods and maintenance on term licenses
are generally billed quarterly in advance and earned over
multiple periods over the ensuing license period.

Stock-Based
Compensation

At January 3, 2004, Cadence has six
stock-based employee compensation plans (excluding director
plans). Cadence accounts for these plans under the recognition
and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board, or
APB, Opinion No. 25 “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees”, and related interpretations. Under APB Opinion
No. 25, compensation expense is recognized if an
option’s exercise price on the measurement date is below
the fair value of the Company’s common stock. The
compensation, if any, is amortized to expense over the vesting
period.

The pro forma information illustration of the
financial results of operations as if Cadence had accounted for
its grants of employee stock options under the fair value method
of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation”, was estimated at the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model. Cadence used expected
volatility, as well as other economic data, to estimate the
volatility for fiscal 2003 option grants because management
believes the amount yielded by this method is more
representative of prospective trends. In prior periods, Cadence
used historical trading volatility. Cadence determined the
estimated fair values of its options granted and shares
purchased under its employee stock purchase plans, or ESPPs, for
the years ended January 3, 2004, December 28, 2002,
and December 29, 2001 using the following weighted average
assumptions assuming a dividend yield of zero for all periods:

The following table illustrates the effect on net
income (loss) and income (loss) per share if Cadence had applied
the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” to
stock-based compensation:

Comprehensive
Income

Other comprehensive income includes foreign
currency translation gains and losses and unrealized gains and
losses on marketable securities that are available-for-sale that
have been excluded from net income and reflected instead in
stockholders’ equity. Cadence has reported the components
of comprehensive income on its Consolidated Statements of
Stockholders’ Equity.

Revenue
Recognition

Cadence classifies revenue by the three sources
from which it is earned: Product; Maintenance; and Services.
Product revenue includes fees associated with the licensing of
Cadence’s software and sale or lease of its hardware
products. Maintenance revenue includes fees associated with
providing technical support for Cadence’s products.
Services revenue includes fees received for performing
methodology and design services.

Cadence applies the provisions of SOP 97-2,
“Software Revenue Recognition,” as amended by
SOP 98-9, “Modification of SOP 97-2, Software
Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions,”
to all product revenue transactions where the software is not
incidental. Cadence also applies the provisions of
SFAS, No. 13, “Accounting for Leases,” to
all hardware lease transactions. While these statements govern
the basis for revenue recognition, Cadence exercises significant
judgment and uses estimates in connection with the determination
of the amount of product, service and maintenance revenue and
deferred revenue to be recognized in each accounting period.
Material differences may result in the amount and timing of
Cadence’s revenue for any period if its management made
different judgments or utilized different estimates.



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

January 3, 2004

Product revenue

The timing of product revenue recognition will
differ depending on the license types and the individual terms
and conditions associated with each particular license
agreement. Cadence licenses software using three different
license types:

•

Subscription licenses — software
    licensed for a specific time period, generally two to three
    years, with no contractual rights to return and limited rights
    to remix within the licensed software and to unspecified future
    technology. In general, revenue associated with subscription
    licenses is recognized over multiple periods over the term of
    the license commencing upon the effective date of the license
    and initial delivery of the licensed product.

•

Term licenses — software licensed for a
    specific time period, generally two to three years, with no
    contractual rights to return and, generally, limited rights to
    remix within the licensed software but no right to remix the
    licensed software for unspecified future technology. In general,
    revenue associated with term licenses is recognized upon the
    effective date of the license, determination that the fee is
    fixed or determinable and other revenue recognition criteria
    have been met.

•

Perpetual licenses — software licensed
    on a perpetual basis with no contractual right to return,
    exchange or remix the licensed software. In general, revenue
    associated with perpetual licenses is recognized upon the
    effective date of the license, when collection is determined to
    be probable and other revenue recognition criteria have been met.

Occasionally, customers may request and Cadence
may agree to modify the terms of an existing arrangement for
which revenue is being recognized over multiple periods. The
modifications to the arrangement may include changes in access
to technology, payment terms or other license terms. In these
situations, Cadence accounts for the modified arrangement as a
new transaction and recognizes revenue when all other revenue
recognition criteria have been met.

Maintenance revenue

Maintenance revenue consists of fees for
providing technical support and software updates on a
when-and-if available basis. Cadence recognizes all maintenance
revenue over multiple periods over the maintenance term under
each software license agreement. For subscription licenses,
Cadence allocates a portion of the revenue to maintenance
revenue based on the estimated fair value of the maintenance.

Services revenue

Services revenue consists primarily of revenue
received for performing methodology and design services. Service
arrangements include time and material, defined level of effort
and fixed bid. Revenue from service contracts is recognized
either on the time and materials method as work is performed or
on the percentage-of-completion method. For contracts with fixed
or not-to-exceed fees on a monthly basis, Cadence estimates the
percentage-of-completion, which is based on the completion of
milestones relating to the arrangement. Cadence has a history of
accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to
complete projects. If different conditions were to prevail such
that accurate estimates could not be made, then the use of the
completed contract method would be required and the recognition
of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was
completed. This change could have a material impact on
Cadence’s results of operations. For small fixed-price
projects, such as training classes and small, standard
methodology service engagements of approximately $10,000 or
less, revenue is recognized when the work is completed.

Revenue Recognition Criteria

Cadence recognizes revenue when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, the element has been
delivered, the fee is fixed or determinable, collection of the
resulting receivable is probable, and vendor-

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

January 3, 2004

specific objective evidence of fair value, or
VSOE, exists. A discussion about these revenue recognition
criteria and their applicability to Cadence’s transactions
follows:

Persuasive evidence of an
arrangement

— For
subscription and term licenses and hardware leases, Cadence uses
the signed contract as evidence of an arrangement. For perpetual
licenses, hardware sales, maintenance renewals and small
fixed-price service projects, such as training classes and
small, standard methodology service engagements of approximately
$10,000 or less, Cadence uses a purchase order as evidence of an
arrangement. For all other service engagements, Cadence uses a
signed professional services agreement and a statement of work
to evidence an arrangement. Sales through Cadence’s
Japanese distributor, Innotech, are evidenced by a master
agreement governing the relationship, together with binding
purchase orders from the distributor on a
transaction-by-transaction basis.

Product
delivery

— Software and the
corresponding keys are generally delivered to customers
electronically. Occasionally, Cadence will deliver the software
on a CD-ROM with standard transfer terms of FOB shipping point.
Cadence’s software license agreements generally do not
contain acceptance provisions. With respect to hardware,
delivery of an entire system is deemed to occur upon
installation.

Fee is fixed or
determinable

— Cadence
assesses whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of
the arrangement, primarily based on the payment terms associated
with the transaction. Cadence’s payment terms for perpetual
licenses is generally net 30 days; however, payment terms
may vary based on the country in which the agreement is
executed. Cadence generally uses installment contracts for term
and subscription licenses for customers for which it has
established a history of collecting under the original contract
without providing concessions on payments, products or services.
Cadence’s installment contracts have payment periods that
are equal to or less than the time period of the licenses, the
payments are generally collected quarterly, and periodic
payments are generally made in equal or nearly equal
installments. When the periodic payments are less than equal or
near equal, then revenue under such license arrangements is
recognized when payments under the contract become due and
payable. If Cadence no longer had a history of collecting under
the original contract without providing concessions on term
licenses, revenue from term licenses would be required to be
recognized when payments under the installment contract become
due and payable. These changes could have a material impact on
Cadence’s results of operations.

Collection is
probable

— Cadence assesses
collectibility at the outset of the arrangement based on a
number of factors, including the customer’s past payment
history and its current creditworthiness. If in Cadence’s
judgment collection of a fee is not probable, Cadence defers the
revenue until the uncertainty is removed, which generally means
revenue is recognized upon receipt of cash payment.

Vendor-Specific Objective
Evidence

— Cadence’s
VSOE for certain product elements of an arrangement is based
upon the pricing for comparable transactions when the element is
sold separately. VSOE for maintenance is generally based upon
the customer’s stated annual renewal rates. VSOE for
services is generally based on the price charged when the
services are sold separately. For multiple element arrangements,
VSOE must exist to allocate the total fee among all delivered
and undelivered elements in the arrangement. If VSOE does not
exist for all elements to support the allocation of the total
fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of the
arrangement, revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist
for the undelivered elements, or until all elements are
delivered, whichever is earlier. If VSOE of all undelivered
elements exists but VSOE does not exist for one or more
delivered elements, revenue is recognized using the residual
method. Under the residual method, the VSOE of the undelivered
elements is deferred, and the remaining portion of the
arrangement fee is recognized as revenue.

In September 2002, Cadence acquired
IBM’s Test Design Automation, or TDA, business. Concurrent
with the acquisition, Cadence licensed software to IBM and
entered into an agreement to provide services. In connection
with these transactions, Cadence considered
SFAS No. 141, “Business Combination”, and
EITF Issue No. 98-3, “Determining Whether a
Nonmonetary Transaction Involves Receipt of Productive Assets of



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

January 3, 2004

a Business”, to determine whether the
acquisition of the TDA business qualified for accounting as a
purchase business combination. In addition, Cadence considered
APB Opinion No. 29, “Accounting for Nonmonetary
Transactions” and EITF Issue No. 01-02,
“Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 29” to
determine whether the concurrent transactions were appropriately
recorded at their respective fair values. In concluding that the
fair values were reasonably determinable, Cadence considered its
recent history of cash sales for similar products or services in
similar sized transactions with similar terms. Approximately 3%
of revenue recognized in 2002 resulted from this concurrent
transaction.

In September 2003, Cadence entered into a
license to use and resell certain technology from IBM. During
December 2003 and January 2004, Cadence sold hardware,
services and licensed software to IBM. These transactions were
separately negotiated, settled in cash, recorded at terms
Cadence considers to be arms-length and were not deemed to be
concurrent. Cadence recognized revenue, arising from these
transactions, totaling approximately 4% of total revenue in 2003.

Sales
of Installment Contract Receivables

Cadence transfers installment contract
receivables on a non-recourse basis to third party financing
institutions. These transfers are recorded as sales and
accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 140,
“Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
and Extinguishments of Liabilities.” Cadence transferred
accounts receivable totaling $87.4 million in 2003,
$182.0 million in 2002 and $235.8 million in 2001, to
financing institutions on a non-recourse basis. Cadence recorded
losses on the sale of receivables in Other income (loss), net,
in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations of
$5.0 million in 2003, $18.8 million in 2002 and
$20.9 million in 2001. When Cadence sells receivables, it
retains the servicing rights to the underlying accounts
receivable. The fair value of the retained servicing rights has
not been material. For 2001, Cadence has restated its
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows to include proceeds from
the sale of receivables as a component of cash flows from
operating activities rather than as a component of cash flows
from financing activities, which is consistent with the guidance
of SFAS No. 95, “Statement of Cash Flows.”

Accounting
for Income Taxes

Cadence uses the asset and liability method to
account for income taxes. Cadence is required to estimate its
income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates.
This process involves estimating actual current tax liabilities
together with assessing temporary differences resulting from
differing treatment of items, such as deferred revenue, for tax
and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred
tax assets and liabilities, which are measured using enacted tax
rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date. Cadence then assesses the
likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from
future taxable income, and to the extent it believes that
recovery is not likely, Cadence must establish a valuation
allowance. To the extent Cadence establishes a valuation
allowance for deferred tax assets or increases this allowance in
a period, Cadence may need to include an expense within the tax
provision in its Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Significant management judgment is required in
determining the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets
and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net
deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance is based on
estimates of taxable income for each jurisdiction in which
Cadence operates and the period over which deferred tax assets
will be recoverable. In the event that actual results differ
from these estimates or Cadence adjusts these estimates in
future periods, Cadence may need to establish an additional
valuation allowance, which could materially affect its financial
position and results of operations.

Restructuring
Charges

Cadence accounts for restructuring charges in
accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100,
“Restructuring and Impairment Charges.” Since 2001,
Cadence has undertaken significant restructuring initiatives.
The individual components of the restructuring activities
initiated prior to fiscal year 2003 were accounted for in
accordance with EITF No. 94-3, “Liability
Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other
Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring)”, and EITF No. 88-10 “Costs
Associated with Lease Modifications or Terminations.” For
restructuring activities initiated after fiscal year 2002,
Cadence accounted for the facilities and asset-related portions
of this restructuring in accordance with SFAS No. 146
“Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities.” The severance and benefits charges were
accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 112
“Employers’ Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits — An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 5
and 43.”

These restructuring initiatives have required
Cadence to make a number of estimates and assumptions related to
losses on excess facilities vacated or consolidated,
particularly the timing of subleases and sublease terms. Closure
and space reduction costs included in the restructuring charges
include payments required under leases less any applicable
estimated sublease income after the facilities are abandoned,
lease buyout costs and costs to maintain facilities during the
period after abandonment.

In addition, Cadence has recorded estimated
provisions for termination benefits and outplacement costs,
long-term asset write-downs, and other restructuring costs.
Cadence regularly evaluates the adequacy of its restructuring
accrual, and adjusts the balance based on changes in estimates
and assumptions. Cadence may incur future charges for new
restructuring activities as well as for changes in estimates to
amounts previously recorded.

Concentrations
of Credit Risk

Financial instruments, including derivative
financial instruments, that may potentially subject Cadence to
concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of cash, cash
equivalents, short-term investments, long-term investments,
accounts receivable and forward contracts. Concentration of
credit risk related to accounts receivable is limited, due to
the varied customers comprising Cadence’s customer base and
their dispersion across geographies. Credit exposure related to
the forward contracts is limited to the realized and unrealized
gains on these contracts. As noted in Note 8, Cadence
issued options and warrants to hedge potential dilution of the
convertible notes. Changes in the fair value of these
convertible notes hedge and warrant transactions will not be
recognized as long as the instruments remain classified in
equity. All financial instruments are executed with financial
institutions with strong credit ratings, which minimizes risk of
loss due to nonpayment.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

The fair value of Cadence’s cash and cash
equivalents, short-term and long-term investments, receivables,
accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and deferred revenue
approximate their carrying value due to the short-term nature of
these instruments. The fair market values of Cadence’s
convertible notes and capital lease obligations and installment
contract receivables approximate their carrying values based
upon current market rates of interest.

Advertising

Cadence expenses the production costs of
advertising as incurred. Advertising expense was approximately
$10.5 million, $13.4 million and $19.3 million
for the fiscal years ended 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively,
and is included in Marketing and sales in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

NOTE 4. RESTATEMENT

During 2003, Cadence restated its Consolidated
Financial Statements as of and for the fiscal year ended
December 28, 2002 as discussed in more detail below. While
certain adjustments impacting Cadence’s Consolidated
Financial Statements for periods prior to fiscal 2002 were also
identified, the Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal
2001 were not materially affected by the adjustments discussed
below, and a firm that is no longer in existence audited the
Consolidated Financial Statements for that year. Accordingly, no
adjustments have been made to Cadence’s fiscal 2001
Consolidated Financial Statements for these items. However, as
described in Note 2, the 2001 Consolidated Financial
Statements were restated to correct certain classification
errors. In order for the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
December 28, 2002 to be properly stated, Cadence has
recorded the cumulative effect of $11.9 million for all
years prior to fiscal 2002 to opening retained earnings for
fiscal 2002 as follows:

Restated fiscal 2002 Consolidated Financial
Statements reflect the following adjustments as well as the
related decrease to the provision for income taxes of
approximately $2.3 million:

Equity
Investments

Cadence reviewed equity investments made directly
by Cadence or through its venture capital investment
partnerships and determined that it had the ability to exercise
significant influence over certain investee companies because
Cadence held more than 20% of an entity’s voting shares.
For certain investments in which Cadence held less than 20% of
the voting shares, Cadence determined it had the ability to
exercise significant influence because of its board
representation, or commercial or technology relationships
material to the investee company. Based on these facts, Cadence
determined that the equity method of accounting should have been
previously applied to certain investments rather than the cost
method. Other income reflected in Cadence’s restated
consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2002, before the
effects of income taxes, has been increased by approximately
$0.2 million for this item, other assets have decreased by
$17.7 million and retained earnings has decreased by
$17.9 million as of and for the year ended
December 28, 2002.



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Deferred
Compensation

Cadence determined that stock awards made to
employees acquired in two business combinations were variable
awards. Cadence had previously accounted for these employee
stock-based awards as fixed awards. Cadence also determined that
forfeitures relating to certain stock option awards were not
accounted for in the correct periods. To correct these errors,
Cadence reduced deferred stock compensation by
$5.4 million, increased additional paid-in-capital by
$2.8 million, increased goodwill by $0.8 million,
increased stock-based compensation expense by $6.5 million
and decreased retained earnings by $0.9 million, before the
effects of income taxes, as of and for the year ended
December 28, 2002.

Revenue

Cadence identified errors for a number of revenue
transactions relating to recurring automated entries that
resulted in revenue being recognized in excess of customer
deposits and from a terminated license agreement that had not
been appropriately removed from the system, resulting in a
reduction of revenue for the year ended December 28, 2002,
totaling approximately $5.1 million, an increase in
deferred revenue of approximately $6.0 million and a
decrease in retained earnings of $0.9 million, before the
effects of income taxes, as of December 28, 2002.

Internally
Developed Software

Cadence determined that it improperly capitalized
certain costs related to internally developed software. The
effect of this adjustment increased operating expenses by
$2.5 million for the year ended December 28, 2002 and
reduced property, plant and equipment, net by approximately
$2.6 million and decreased retained earnings by
$0.1 million, before the effects of income taxes, as of
December 28, 2002.

acquired and liabilities assumed have been included in
Cadence’s Consolidated Financial Statements from the date
of the acquisition.

Acquisitions

Verplex Systems, Inc.

In August 2003, Cadence acquired Verplex
Systems, Inc., or Verplex, a privately-held developer of
verification technology. Cadence purchased Verplex to acquire
key personnel and technology. The aggregate initial purchase
price was $87.6 million, which included the payment of
cash, the fair value of assumed options and acquisition costs.
The purchase price and goodwill will increase if certain
performance goals related to bookings and product development
are achieved over a period of approximately three years
following the acquisition.

amortization period for the acquired intangibles:

The $56.5 million of goodwill was assigned
to the Product segment. The goodwill is not expected to be
deductible for income tax purposes.

Distribution Rights of Innotech
    Corporation

In June 2003, Cadence acquired distribution
rights to certain customers, certain assets and key personnel
from Innotech Corporation, or Innotech, a publicly-traded
developer and distributor of software, electronic devices and
semiconductor manufacturing equipment in Japan. Concurrent with
this acquisition, Cadence also modified its distributor
agreement with Innotech. Prior to the acquisition, Cadence
licensed most of its software products in Japan through
Innotech, of which Cadence was, and continues to be, a 15%
stockholder. Cadence now directly licenses its software products
to customers for which Cadence acquired the distribution rights
from Innotech.

Cadence considered SFAS No. 141,
“Business Combinations,” and EITF Issue No. 98-3,
“Determining Whether a Nonmonetary Transaction Involves
Receipt of Productive Assets or of a Business,” in
concluding that a business was acquired in this transaction.
Cadence also determined that the modification to the distributor
arrangement and the agreement to acquire a portion of
Innotech’s business should be combined for the purposes of
determining the total initial purchase price, as both of these
agreements with Innotech were entered into concurrently.

The aggregate purchase price of this acquisition
was $78.7 million, which includes cash and acquisition
costs. The estimated fair values of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed have been determined through established
valuation techniques and included in Cadence’s Consolidated
Financial Statements from the date of acquisition.

Get2Chip.com, Inc.

In April 2003, Cadence acquired Get2Chip.com,
Inc., or Get2Chip, a privately-held developer of nanometer-scale
synthesis technology. Cadence purchased Get2Chip to acquire key
personnel and technology. The aggregate initial purchase price
was $80.5 million, which included the payment of cash, the
fair value of assumed options and acquisition costs. The
purchase price and goodwill will increase if certain performance
goals related to bookings are achieved over a period of
approximately three years following the acquisition.

The following table summarizes the preliminary
allocation of the purchase price for Get2Chip and the estimated
amortization period for the acquired intangibles:

The $58.7 million of goodwill was assigned
to the Product segment. The goodwill is not expected to be
deductible for income tax purposes.

Celestry Design Technologies, Inc.

In January 2003, Cadence acquired Celestry Design
Technologies, Inc., or Celestry, a privately-held developer of
silicon modeling products and full-chip circuit simulation
technology. Cadence purchased

Celestry to acquire key personnel and technology.
The aggregate initial purchase price was $65.7 million,
which included the payment of cash, the fair value of assumed
options and acquisition costs. The purchase price and goodwill

and product development are achieved over a period of
approximately two years following the acquisition.

allocation of the purchase price for Celestry and the estimated
amortization period for the acquired intangibles:

The $40.6 million of goodwill was assigned
to the Product segment. The goodwill is not expected to be
deductible for income tax purposes.

Other 2003 Acquisitions

For the year ended January 3, 2004, Cadence
also acquired two other companies for an initial aggregate
purchase price of $18.9 million, which included the payment
of cash and acquisition costs. The purchase price and goodwill
will increase if certain performance goals related to revenue,
product proliferation, product development and/or employee
retention are achieved over a period of approximately three or
four years following the acquisition.

Goodwill of $9.6 million recorded in
connection with these acquisitions was assigned to the Product
segment and is not expected to be deductible for income tax
purposes.

Comparative pro forma financial information for
acquisitions completed in 2003 has not been presented because
the results of operations were not material to Cadence’s
Consolidated Financial Statements.

2003 Acquisition-Related Earnouts

For the year ended January 3, 2004, Cadence
paid $2.4 million in cash and recorded an additional
3.7 million shares valued at $57.7 million related to
acquisition earnouts. Cadence recorded $52.3 million in
additional goodwill consisting of $2.4 million in cash and
$49.9 million representing 3.2 million shares. Cadence
also recorded additional deferred stock compensation of $7.8
million representing 0.4 million shares for earnouts
achieved during 2003. In addition, Cadence recorded
$0.5 million in deferred stock compensation for estimated
future earnouts. The additional goodwill and deferred stock
compensation related to the achievement of certain performance
goals related to one or more of the following criteria: revenue,
bookings, product proliferation, product development and
employee retention. The goodwill is not expected to be
deductible for income tax purposes.

2002 Acquisitions

IBM TDA

In September 2002, Cadence acquired IBM’s
Test Design Automation, or TDA, business and paid a total cash
purchase price of approximately $70.0 million. Concurrent
with the acquisition, Cadence licensed software to IBM under
subscription and term licenses, and entered into an agreement to
provide services. Payments for these arrangements are to be paid
over the duration of the respective contracts under
Cadence’s standard payment terms. Cash expected to be paid
by IBM will be significantly in excess of the cash paid by
Cadence for the TDA business. The software licenses and services
transactions were determined to have fair value based upon
pricing for comparable transactions. Cadence purchased
IBM’s TDA business to acquire key technology and personnel.

The following table summarizes the allocation of
the purchase price of the TDA business and the estimated
amortization period for the acquired intangibles:

The $38.9 million of goodwill was assigned
to the Product segment. For tax purposes, $19.9 million of
the goodwill is expected to be deductible.

Simplex Solutions, Inc.

In June 2002, Cadence acquired 100% of the
outstanding common stock of Simplex Solutions, Inc., a
publicly-traded company that provides software and services for
the design and verification of ICs. The aggregate purchase price
was $329.7 million, which included the issuance of
approximately 14.6 million shares of Cadence common stock,
valued at $267.3 million, 4.5 million shares of
Cadence common stock issuable on the exercise of assumed
options, with a fair value of $46.4 million, and
acquisition costs of $16.0 million. The value of the common
stock issued was determined based on the average market price of
Cadence’s common stock for the five day trading period
including two trading days before and after June 3, 2002 as
a result of a pricing collar in the merger agreement. The collar
provided that if the 10-day average of Cadence’s common
stock as of the second trading day prior to Simplex’s
stockholders meeting fell below $19.47, then, for purposes of
the exchange ratio, the Cadence stock price would be fixed at
such threshold amount. June 3, 2002 was the first day on
which the 10-day average fell below the threshold, which average
continued to decline until Simplex’s stockholders meeting,
and thus was the date the number of shares of Cadence common
stock to be issued in the merger became fixed. Cadence purchased
Simplex to acquire key personnel and technology.

to the Product and Services segments in the amounts of
$115.1 million and $110.1 million, respectively. None
of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

Other 2002 Acquisitions

For the year ended December 28, 2002,
Cadence also acquired: (i) four companies;
(ii) substantially all of the assets of one company; and
(iii) the assets of one division of another company. The
initial aggregate purchase price for these acquisitions was
$61.6 million, of which $33.5 million was cash and the
remainder related to the issuance of shares of Cadence common
stock with a fair value of $28.1 million. Certain of these
acquisitions also include contingent earnouts for which the
amounts earned have not yet been determined.

Goodwill recognized in these transactions was
$39.3 million, all of which was assigned to the Product
segment. Of the total goodwill, $8.5 million is expected to
be deductible for tax purposes.

Comparative pro forma financial information for
all 2002 acquisitions has not been presented because the results
of operations were not material to Cadence’s Consolidated
Financial Statements.

2002 Acquisition-Related Earnouts

For the year ended December 28, 2002,
Cadence recorded an additional 12.8 million shares, valued at
$204.7 million related to acquisition earnouts. Cadence
recorded $181.2 million in additional goodwill representing
11.3 million shares. Cadence also recorded additional deferred
stock compensation of $23.5 million representing
1.5 million shares for earnouts achieved during 2002. In
addition, Cadence recorded $4.6 million in deferred stock
compensation for estimated future earnouts. The additional
goodwill and deferred stock compensation related to the
achievement of certain performance goals related to one or more
of the following criteria: bookings, product proliferation,
product development and employee retention resulting from
acquisitions. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for
income tax purposes.

2001 Acquisition

In December 2001, Cadence acquired Silicon
Perspective Corporation, or SPC, a privately-held design
technology firm, for approximately 5.4 million shares of
Cadence common stock, valued at $129.4 million,
0.8 million shares of stock issuable upon the exercise of
assumed options with a fair value of $2.0 million, and
acquisition costs of $3.3 million, for a total initial
purchase price of $134.7 million

.

In addition,
Cadence recorded $27.4 million in deferred stock
compensation representing 1.4 million shares of Cadence
common stock to be issued to former SPC employee shareholders.

Write-off of Acquired In-Process
    Technology

Acquired in-process technology charges represent
in-process technology that had not reached technological
feasibility at the time of acquisition and had no probable
alternative future use.

For acquisitions completed during 2003, 2002 and
2001 the purchase price allocated to acquired in-process
technology was determined through established valuation
techniques. The acquired in-process technology was immediately
expensed because technological feasibility had not been
established, and no future alternative use exists. The write-off
of acquired in-process technology is a component of operating
expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Described below are the write-offs of acquired
in-process technology charges in 2003, 2002 and 2001.

NOTE 6. GOODWILL AND ACQUIRED
INTANGIBLES

Goodwill

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill
for the years ended December 28, 2002 and January 3,
2004 are as follows:



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

January 3, 2004

During the year ended January 3, 2004,
Cadence recorded other adjustments of $2.2 million in the
carrying amount of goodwill primarily as a result of an
$8.9 million reduction from previous estimates to
contingent earnout relating to acquisitions offset by
adjustments to the initial purchase price relating to certain
acquisitions made during 2003 totaling $6.7 million.

During 2001, Cadence recorded a charge of
$25.8 million related to the impairment of goodwill and
acquired intangibles associated with the acquisition of Diablo
Research Company LLC, or Diablo. This impairment was due to the
decline in business conditions generally and the wireless
communications industry in particular. The impairment was
calculated as the difference between the carrying value of the
intangible assets associated with Diablo’s acquisition and
the fair value of those assets.

Acquired
Intangibles, net

Acquired intangibles with finite lives as of
January 3, 2004 and December 28, 2002 are classified as

Investments

The following tables summarize Cadence’s
investment activities as of January 3, 2004 and
December 28, 2002 (restated):

Marketable
Securities

There were no net recognized gains or losses on
marketable securities during the year ended January 3,
2004. Net recognized gains on marketable securities were
$9.2 million for the year ended December 28, 2002 and
$17.7 million for the year ended December 29, 2001.

Non-Marketable
Securities

Cadence uses either the cost or equity method of
accounting to account for its long-term, non-marketable
investment securities which are included in Other assets in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. There were no realized gains or
losses on the sale of non-marketable investments during the year
ended January 3, 2004. Cadence recorded investment gains of
$15.7 million during the year ended December 28, 2002.
There were no realized gains or losses on the sale of
non-marketable investments during the year ended
December 29, 2001. If Cadence determines that an
other-than-temporary decline exists in a non-marketable equity
security, Cadence writes down the investment to its fair value
and records the related write-down as an investment loss in its
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Cost
Method Investments

Cadence recorded write-downs due to
other-than-temporary declines in value of non-marketable
securities carried on the cost basis of $4.8 million during
the year ended January 3, 2004, $14.1 million during
the year ended December 28, 2002 and $6.0 million during
the year ended December 29, 2001.

Equity
Method Investments

During 2003 and 2002, Cadence’s voting
interest ranged from approximately 10% to 25% of the following
privately-held companies: CoWare, Inc., Neolinear, Inc., Fyre
Storm, Inc., Ammocore Technology, Inc., Theta Microelectronics,
Inc., Hierarchical Design, Inc., iReady Corporation and
Coventor, Inc.

The following table presents
(unaudited) summary financial data of our equity method
investments:

In accordance with the equity method of
accounting, Cadence records its proportional share of the
investee gains or losses in Other income (loss). Cadence’s
proportional share of net losses were $10.9 million in
2003, $9.4 million in 2002 and $1.2 million in 2001.
Cadence’s proportional share of net losses for 2001 does
not include losses for equity investments in connection with the
restatement described in Note 4. As of January 3, 2004, the
difference between the carrying value of Cadence’s
investment in the investee and Cadence’s share of the
underlying net assets of the investee are immaterial.

NOTE 8. CONVERTIBLE NOTES

In August 2003, Cadence issued
$420.0 million principal amount of Zero Coupon Zero Yield
Senior Convertible Notes due 2023, or the Notes, to two initial
purchasers in a private offering for resale to qualified
institutional buyers pursuant to SEC Rule 144A. Cadence
received net proceeds of approximately $408.5 mil-

lion after transaction fees of approximately
$11.5 million that have been recorded in other long-term
assets and are being amortized to interest expense using the
straight-line method over five years, which is the duration
of the first redemption period. The Notes were issued by Cadence
at par and bear no interest. The Notes are convertible into
Cadence common stock initially at a conversion price of $15.65
per share, which would result in an aggregate of
26.8 million shares issued upon conversion, subject to
adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Cadence may
redeem for cash all or any part of the Notes on or after
August 15, 2008 for 100.00% of the principal amount. The
holders may require Cadence to repurchase for cash all or any
portion of their Notes on August 15, 2008 for 100.25% of
the principal amount, on August 15, 2013 for 100.00% of the
principal amount or on August 15, 2018 for 100.00% of the
principal amount. The Notes do not contain restrictive financial
covenants.

Each $1,000 of principal of the Notes will
initially be convertible into 63.8790 shares of Cadence common
stock, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified
events. Holders of the Notes may convert their Notes prior to
maturity only if: (1) the price of Cadence’s common
stock reaches $22.69 during periods of time specified by the
Notes, (2) specified corporate transactions occur,
(3) the Notes have been called for redemption or
(4) the trading price of the Notes falls below a certain
threshold. As this fourth conversion feature is linked to the
trading price of the Notes, which are traded in an observable
market that differs from the one in which Cadence’s common
stock is traded, the conversion feature meets the definition of
a derivative that must be accounted for separately at fair
value. The fair value of this conversion feature was not
material at inception of the Notes or at January 3, 2004.

In addition, in the event of a significant change
in Cadence’s corporate ownership or structure, the holders
may require Cadence to repurchase all or any portion of their
Notes for 100% of the principal amount. Upon a significant
change in Cadence’s corporate ownership or structure, in
certain circumstances, Cadence may choose to pay the repurchase
price in cash, shares of Cadence’s common stock or a
combination of cash and shares of Cadence’s common stock.

Cadence has agreed to file a shelf registration
statement with respect to the resale of the Notes and the common
stock issuable upon the conversion of the Notes with the SEC
within 90 days from the initial issuance of the Notes. In
the event Cadence does not file a shelf registration statement
with the SEC within such time or the shelf registration
statement is not declared effective by the SEC within
180 days from the initial issuance of the Notes or, after
effectiveness, Cadence suspends its use beyond certain permitted
periods, Cadence is obligated to pay liquidated damages to the
holders of the Notes. In November 2003, Cadence filed with the
SEC a resale registration statement with respect to the Notes.
This registration statement was not declared effective by the
SEC within the 180-day period, and has not yet been declared
effective as of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K. As a result, on February 12, 2004, Cadence
began to incur liquidated damages at a penalty rate of
approximately $2,900 per day for the first 90 days,
accruing daily. After the first 90 days, the penalty rate
doubles until it ceases to accrue upon the date the registration
statement becomes effective or is no longer suspended from use.
As of the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K,
the registration statement had not become effective.

Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes,
Cadence entered into convertible notes hedge transactions with
JP Morgan Chase Bank whereby Cadence has the option to
purchase up to 26.8 million shares of Cadence’s common
stock at a price of $15.65 per share. These options expire on
August 15, 2008 and must be settled in net shares. The cost
of the convertible notes hedge transactions to Cadence was
approximately $134.6 million.

In addition, Cadence sold warrants to JP Morgan
Chase Bank for the purchase of up to 26.8 million shares of
Cadence’s common stock at a price of $23.08 per share. The
warrants expire on various dates from February 2008 through May
2008 and must be settled in net shares. Cadence received
approximately $56.4 million in cash proceeds for the sales
of these warrants.



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

January 3, 2004

The costs incurred in connection with the
convertible notes hedge transactions and the proceeds from the
sale of the warrants are included as a net reduction in common
stock and capital in excess of par in the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 3, 2004, in
accordance with the guidance in EITF Issue No. 00-19,
“Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed
to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own
Stock.” Subsequent changes in the fair value of these
convertible notes hedge and warrant transactions will not be
recognized as long as the instruments remain classified in
equity.

Prior to conversion, the Notes have no impact on
the calculation of basic or dilutive earnings per share, or EPS,
unless the price of Cadence’s common stock reaches $22.69,
or the contingent conversion price, during certain quarterly
conversion periods until August 2018, and then at any time
thereafter until maturity or earlier redemption or repurchase.
For any quarterly conversion period through August 2018 or any
time after August 2018 in which the price of Cadence’s
common stock reaches the contingent conversion price, Cadence
will use the “as if converted” method to calculate the
effect on diluted EPS, which will have the effect of increasing
the number of outstanding shares by 26.8 million.

Because Cadence entered into the Notes hedge
transactions and the sale of the warrants, upon conversion of
the Notes there is no impact on basic or dilutive EPS, except as
described above under the “as if converted” method,
unless the price of Cadence’s common stock exceeds the
warrant strike price of $23.08 per share. Up to $23.08 per
share, in connection with any conversion, the operation of the
Notes hedge transactions and sale of the warrants would
effectively result in no impact on basic or dilutive EPS. In the
event Cadence’s common stock exceeds $23.08 per share, for
the first $1.00 the price exceeds $23.08, there would be
dilution of approximately 1.1 million shares and the impact
on the calculation of EPS will vary depending on when during the
quarter the $23.08 per share price is reached. As this
share price continues to increase, dilution would continue to
occur but at a declining rate. If these transactions settle in
Cadence’s favor, Cadence could be exposed to credit risk
related to the other party to the transactions.

Subsequent to the issuance of the Notes, Cadence
terminated its senior credit facilities.

NOTE 9. CREDIT FACILITIES

Cadence was party to two syndicated, senior
unsecured credit facilities, referred to as the Credit
Facilities. The first Credit Facility was a $187.5 million,
three-year revolving credit facility. The other Credit Facility
was a $187.5 million 364-day revolving credit facility.

At December 28, 2002, Cadence was in
compliance with the covenants in the Credit Facilities and had
outstanding borrowings of $52.0 million.

Subsequent to the issuance of the Convertible
Notes, Cadence terminated the Credit Facilities.

NOTE 10. LEASE COMMITMENTS

Equipment and facilities are leased under various
capital and operating leases expiring at various dates through
the year 2025. Certain of these leases contain renewal options.
Rental expense was $23.3 million for 2003,
$23.3 million for 2002 and $25.6 million for 2001.

The cost of equipment under capital leases
included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as property, plant
and equipment was $6.6 million at January 3, 2004 and
$6.3 million at December 28, 2002. Accumulated
amortization of the leased equipment was $6.2 million at
January 3, 2004 and $4.7 million at December 28,
2002.

NOTE 11. CONTINGENCIES

Legal Proceedings

From time to time, Cadence is involved in various
disputes and litigation matters that arise in the ordinary
course of business. These include disputes and lawsuits related
to intellectual property, mergers and acquisitions, licensing,
contract law, distribution arrangements and employee relations
matters. Periodically, Cadence reviews the status of each
significant matter and assesses its potential financial
exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal
proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be
estimated, Cadence accrues a liability for the estimated loss at
the low end of the range. Legal proceedings are subject to
uncertainties, and the outcomes are difficult to predict.
Because of such uncertainties, accruals are based only on the
best information available at the time. As additional
information becomes available, Cadence reassesses the potential
liability related to pending claims and litigation and may
revise estimates.

While the outcome of any disputes and litigation
matters cannot be predicted with any certainty, management does
not believe that the outcome of any current matters will have a
material adverse effect on Cadence’s consolidated financial
position or results of operations.

Other Contingencies

Cadence provides its customers with a warranty on
sales of hardware products for a 90-day period. Such warranties
are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 5,
“Accounting for Contingencies.” To date, Cadence has
not incurred any significant costs related to warranty
obligations.

Cadence’s product license and services
agreements include a limited indemnification provision for
claims from third parties relating to Cadence’s
intellectual property. Such indemnification provisions are
accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 5. The
indemnification is generally limited to the amount paid by the
customer. To date, claims under such indemnification provisions
have not been significant.

From time to time, Cadence has, and may in the
future, provide guarantees to third parties on behalf of a
foreign subsidiary. These guarantees are generally related to
maintaining operations in a certain locality or to secure leases
or other operating obligations of a subsidiary. The maximum
exposure on these guarantees is not significant, either
individually or in the aggregate.

Net Income per Share

Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by
dividing net income (loss), the numerator, by the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding, the
denominator, during the period. Diluted net income per share

common shares, if dilutive, computed using the treasury stock
method of accounting.

Option Plans

Cadence’s 2000 Non-Statutory Equity
Incentive Plan, referred to as the 2000 Plan, provides for the
issuance of non-qualified options, stock bonuses and rights to
acquire restricted stock to its employees and consultants who
are not executive officers, directors or beneficial owners of
10% or more of Cadence common stock. The number of shares
available for issuance under the 2000 Plan is
50,000,000 shares. Options granted under the 2000 Plan have
an exercise price not less than the fair market value of the
stock on the date of grant and become exercisable over period of
up to four years, generally with one-fourth of the shares
vesting one year from the vesting commencement date with respect
to the initial grants, and the remaining shares vesting in 36
equal monthly installments thereafter. Options under the 2000
Plan generally expire ten years from the date of grant.

Cadence’s 1997 Non-Statutory Stock Option
Plan, referred to as the 1997 Plan, provides for the issuance of
non-qualified options to its employees to purchase up to
30,000,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price not
less than the fair market value of the stock on the date of
grant. Options granted under the 1997 Plan become exercisable
over periods up to five years, with, generally, one-fifth of the
shares vesting one year from the vesting commencement date with
respect to initial grants, and the remaining shares vesting in
48 equal monthly installments. Options under the 1997 Plan
generally expire ten years from the date of grant.

Cadence’s 1993 Non-Statutory Stock Option
Plan, referred to as the 1993 Non-Statutory Plan, provides for
the issuance of non-qualified options and incentive stock to
Cadence employees and consultants who are not executive
officers, directors or beneficial owners of 10% or more of
Cadence’s common stock to purchase up to
24,750,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price not
less than the fair market value of the stock on the date of
grant. Options granted under the 1993 Non-Statutory Plan
generally become exercisable over a four year period, with
one-fourth of the shares vesting one year from the vesting
commencement date, and the remaining shares vesting in 36 equal
monthly installments. Options under the 1993 Non-Statutory Plan
generally expire ten years from the date of grant. Awards of
incentive stock granted under the 1993 Non-Statutory Stock
Option Plan vest at times and installments approved by the Board
of Directors, on the basis of continued employment, passage of
time and/or performance criteria.

Cadence’s 1987 Employee Stock Option Plan,

become exercisable over periods of up to five years and
generally expire five to ten years from the date of grant.

Under the 1995 and 1993 Directors’ Stock
Option Plans, referred to as the Directors’ Plans, Cadence
may grant non-qualified options to its non-employee directors
for up to 3,032,502 shares of common stock at an exercise price
not less than the fair market value of the stock on the date of
grant. Options granted under the Directors’ Plans have
terms of up to ten years. Certain of the option grants vest one
year from the date of grant, and other option grants vest
one-third on the date which is one year from the date of grant
and two-thirds ratably over the subsequent two years.

Cadence has assumed certain options granted to
employees of acquired companies, referred to as Acquired
Options. The Acquired Options were assumed by Cadence outside of
its stock option plans, and each option is administered under
the terms of the respective original plan of the acquired
entity. All of the Acquired Options have been adjusted to
effectuate the price conversion under the terms of the
acquisition agreement between Cadence and the relevant acquired
company. The Acquired Options generally become exercisable over
a four or five year period and generally expire between five and
ten years from the date of grant. No additional options will be
granted under any of the acquired companies’ plans.

A summary of the status of all of Cadence’s
stock option plans as of and during the years ended
January 3, 2004, December 28, 2002, and

A summary of the status of all of Cadence’s
stock option plans at January 3, 2004 follows:

Stock Repurchase Plan

On August 1, 2001, Cadence authorized a
share repurchase program under which repurchased shares with a
value of up to $500.0 million are used for general
corporate purposes, including the share issuance requirements of
Cadence’s employee stock option and purchase plans and
acquisitions. Under this program, Cadence spent
$213.8 million to repurchase 17.4 million shares
during the year ended January 3, 2004. As of
January 3, 2004, the remaining repurchase authorization
under this program totaled $217.0 million.

Employee Stock Purchase Plans

On July 1, 2001, Cadence adopted two
employee stock purchase plans to allow employees of Tality, the
former name of Cadence’s design services subsidiary, to
participate in Cadence’s employee stock purchase program.
The two plans included the 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan,
which was a qualified employee stock purchase plan under the
Internal Revenue Code terminated in January 2003, and the 2001
Non-Qualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan, referred to the 2001
Non-Qualified ESPP, which is an employee stock purchase plan not
qualified under the Internal Revenue Code and primarily used for
Tality employees located outside the United States. Tality, now
Cadence Design Foundry, employees, including officers and
employee directors of Tality, but excluding 5% or greater
stockholders, are eligible to participate if they are regular
employees who work 20 hours or more per week. Under
Cadence’s 2001 Non-Qualified ESPP, eligible employees,
which are generally Cadence’s non-U.S. Design Foundry
employees, may purchase shares of Cadence common stock during
offering periods (not to exceed 27 months) and on purchase
dates as determined by the Board. The purchase price of such
shares is equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of
Cadence common stock on (i) the first day of the offering
period, or (ii) the last day of the applicable purchase
period. The total shares authorized under the 2001 Non-Qualified
ESPP are 750,000 and as of the end of fiscal year 2003,
588,298 shares remained available for issuance.

In November 1998, the Board of Directors adopted,
and the stockholders subsequently approved, Cadence’s
Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which amended
and restated the 1990 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, referred to
as the Employee Plan. Subsequent amendments approved by the
Board of Directors and stockholders increased the number of
shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the
Employee Plan to 29,500,000 shares. On October 29,
2003, the Board approved amendments to the Employee Plan to
increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for
issuance under the Employee Plan by 9,000,000 shares for a
total of 38,500,000 shares, subject to stockholder approval
at the 2004 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

January 3, 2004

Under the terms of the Employee Plan, employees
can choose to have up to 12% of their annual base earnings plus
bonuses withheld to purchase Cadence common stock. The purchase
price of the stock is 85% of the lower of the fair market value
of Cadence common stock as of the (i) first day of the
offering period or (ii) last day of the applicable purchase
period. The offering periods provide for concurrent
24 month offering periods with a new 24 month offering
period starting every six months. Each offering period will be
divided into four consecutive six-month purchase periods.

The following table presents the common shares
issued under Cadence’s employee stock purchase plans:

Reserved for Future Issuance

At January 3, 2004, Cadence had reserved the
following shares of authorized but unissued common stock for
future issuance:

*

Includes both shares reserved for
    (i) issuance upon exercise of future option grants and
    (ii) outstanding but unexercised options to purchase common
    stock.

**

Includes 9.0 million shares reserved for
    issuance by the Board of Directors subject to stockholder
    approval.

Stockholder Rights Plan

Cadence has a stockholder rights plan to protect
its stockholders’ rights in the event of a proposed or
actual acquisition of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of
Cadence common stock. As amended in February 2000, each share of
Cadence common stock carries a right to purchase one
one-thousandth (1/1000) of a share of Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of Cadence at a price of $240.00 per one one-thousandth of
a share, subject to adjustment. The rights are subject to
redemption at the option of the Board of Directors at a price of
$0.01 per right until the occurrence of certain events. The
rights expire on February 20, 2006.

Deferred Stock Compensation

In 2003, Cadence recorded deferred stock
compensation resulting from Cadence’s acquisition of
CadMOS, Silicon Perspective Corporation, or SPC, Plato Design
Systems Incorporated, or Plato, Simplex,



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Celestry, Get2Chip, Verplex and QDA, Inc.
Deferred stock compensation resulting from these acquisitions
represents the intrinsic value of the stock option grants to
employees of the acquired companies multiplied by the percentage
of the remaining vesting period divided by the total vesting
period. Cadence considers certain stock awards to employees of
SPC and Plato to be variable awards. Accordingly, compensation
cost is adjusted each period for increases or decreases in the
intrinsic value of the shares until the final measurement date.

Restricted Stock

During 2003, Cadence issued 1,681,000 shares
of restricted stock to certain key employees. The restrictions
on the restricted stock awards granted to key employees lapse
over a period of 36 months. The fair value of the
restricted stock awards granted was $25.7 million. The fair
value of the restricted stock awards was recorded as a component
of deferred stock compensation and is amortized to stock-based
compensation expense as the restrictions lapse.

Cadence’s SPC Plan provides for the issuance
of restricted shares of Cadence common stock to former employees
of SPC, who are now Cadence employees, upon the satisfaction of
certain performance-based criteria as payment of additional
purchase consideration in connection with Cadence’s
acquisition of SPC. Restricted shares were first issued under
the SPC Plan in February 2003 and 50% of such issued shares
vested immediately. The remaining 50% vested in 12 equal monthly
installments beginning in January 2003 and were fully vested on
December 31, 2003. The second issue date was in March 2004,
and such issued shares were fully vested as of December 31,
2003. An aggregate of 1.6 million shares were issued under
the SPC Plan.

Additions to deferred compensation included in
the accompanying Statements of Stockholders’ Equity
consists of the following for the years ended January 3,
2004 and December 28, 2002:

For fixed awards Cadence amortizes deferred stock
compensation to expense using the straight-line method over the
period that the stock options and restricted stock vest, which
is generally up to four years. For variable awards stock-based
compensation expense is recognized on an accelerated basis in
accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 28,
“Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other
Variable Stock Option or Award Plans”. For the year ended
January 3, 2004, December 28, 2002 and
December 29, 2001 Cadence recorded deferred compensation
expense of $41.1 million, $44.0 million and
$17.9 million, respectively.

The provision for income taxes differs from the
amount estimated by applying the statutory federal income tax
rate of 35% to income before provision for income taxes as

The components of deferred tax assets and
liabilities consisted of the following:

Cadence provides for U.S. income taxes on
the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the earnings are
considered permanently invested outside of the United States. At
January 3, 2004, the cumulative amount of earnings upon
which U.S. income taxes have not been provided are
approximately $450 million. At January 3, 2004, the
unrecognized deferred tax liability for these earnings was
approximately $80 million.

As of January 3, 2004, Cadence had total net
deferred tax assets of approximately $89.5 million.
Realization of the deferred tax assets will depend on generating
sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character prior to
the expiration of certain net operating loss, capital loss and
tax credit carryforwards. Although realization is not assured,
management believes that it is more likely than not that the net
deferred tax assets will be realized.

The valuation allowance for equity decreased by
$5.8 million in 2003 due to Cadence projecting sufficient
taxable income including the deduction of stock option
deductions to utilize certain net operating losses and research
and development tax credits in the future.

As of January 3, 2004, Cadence has federal
and California net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$19.1 million and $25.1 million, respectively,
available to reduce future taxable income. The federal net
operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates from
2004 through 2023. The California net operating loss
carryforwards will expire at various dates from 2004 through
2013.

As of January 3, 2004, Cadence has federal

year 2012 through 2023. Cadence also has
California research and experimental tax credits of
$1.4 million, net of federal benefit, which do not expire
and carry forward indefinitely until utilized.

The IRS and other tax authorities regularly
examine Cadence’s income tax returns. The IRS recently
completed its field examination of Cadence’s federal income
tax returns for the fiscal years ended 1997 through 1999 and has
issued a Revenue Agent’s Report, referred to as the RAR, in
which the IRS proposes to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for
the three-year period of approximately $143 million, plus
interest, which interest will accrue until the matter is
resolved. This interest is compounded daily at rates published
by the IRS, which rates have been between four and nine percent
since 1997, and adjusts quarterly. The IRS may also make similar
claims for years subsequent to 1999 in future examinations. The
RAR is not a final Statutory Notice of Deficiency, and Cadence
has protested certain of the proposed adjustments with the IRS.

The most significant of the disputed adjustments
relates to transfer pricing arrangements that Cadence has with a
foreign subsidiary. Cadence believes that the proposed IRS
adjustments are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws, and
that Cadence has meritorious defenses to the proposed
adjustments. Cadence intends to challenge these proposed
adjustments vigorously.

Significant judgment is required in determining
Cadence’s provision for income taxes. In determining the
adequacy of Cadence’s provision for income taxes, Cadence
has assessed the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from
these examinations, including the current IRS assessments.
However, the ultimate outcome of tax examinations cannot be
predicted with certainty, including the total amount payable or
the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues.
In addition, Cadence cannot be assured that such amount will not
be materially different than that which is reflected in
Cadence’s historical income tax provisions and accruals.
Should the IRS or other tax authorities assess additional taxes
as a result of a current or a future examination, Cadence may be
required to record charges to operations in future periods that
could have a material impact on the results of operations,
financial position or cash flows in the period or periods
recorded.

NOTE 14. EMPLOYEE AND DIRECTOR
BENEFIT PLANS

Cadence maintains a 401(k) savings plan to
provide retirement benefits through tax-deferred salary
deductions for all of its U.S. employees. Cadence may make
discretionary contributions, as determined by the Board of
Directors, which cannot exceed a specified percentage of the
annual aggregate salaries of those employees eligible to
participate. Cadence made total contributions to the plan of
$5.8 million for 2003, $10.4 million for 2002 and
$10.5 million for 2001.

As part of its overall investment strategy,
Cadence invests in Telos. Cadence and the Cadence 1996 Deferred
Compensation Venture Investment Plan, or the 1996 Plan, are the
sole limited partners of Telos I. Directors may elect to
defer compensation payable to them under Cadence’s 1996
Deferred Compensation Venture Investment Plan and 2002 Deferred
Compensation Venture Investment Plan. Compensation deferred
under the plans is invested in Telos. The Telos general partner
recommends investments by Telos, which investments are subject
to the approval of the advisory committee, comprised of
Cadence’s Chief Executive Officer and Cadence’s
Chairman of the Board of Directors.

Executive Officers and Directors may also elect
to defer compensation payable to them, including income realized
upon the exercise of non-qualified stock options, under
Cadence’s 1994 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan.
Deferred compensation payments are held in accounts with values
indexed to the performance of selected mutual funds, employee
self-directed accounts or money market accounts.

NOTE 15. STATEMENT OF CASH
FLOWS

The supplemental cash flow information for 2003,
2002 and 2001 is as follows:

NOTE 16. LEGAL SETTLEMENTS

Mentor Graphics Settlement

In September 2003, Cadence entered into a
settlement with Mentor Graphics Corporation, pursuant to which
Cadence, Mentor and their respective affiliated parties settled
all outstanding litigation between the companies and such
affiliated parties relating to emulation and acceleration
systems. The companies also agreed that, for a period of seven
years, neither will sue the other over patented emulation and
acceleration technology. Mentor also paid Cadence
$18.0 million in cash as part of the settlement. Net of
related legal costs, Cadence recorded $14.5 million during
the year ended January 3, 2004, for the settlement.

Avant! Civil Settlement

In November 2002, Cadence announced the
settlement of civil litigation filed against Avant! seeking
damages related to theft of Cadence intellectual property,
including software code, as well as other trade secrets. The
settlement with Avant!, its parent corporation
Synopsys, Inc. and several individuals included an
agreement to dismiss all pending claims and counterclaims in the
litigation and required the payment to Cadence of
$265.0 million, which was received in the fourth quarter of
2002.

Avant! Criminal Restitution

In July 2001, Avant! was ordered to pay Cadence
$195.4 million in criminal restitution after Avant! entered
a plea of no contest and was found guilty by the Superior Court
of the State of California of conspiracy to take and use
Cadence’s trade secrets. This conspiracy included the theft
by Avant! and certain individuals of Cadence intellectual
property, including software code, as well as other trade
secrets. As of December 29, 2001, approximately
$196.0 million, consisting of all of the restitution award
plus interest was received.

NOTE 17. RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER
CHARGES

Cadence initiated separate plans of restructuring
in each of the past three years, in an effort to improve its
revenue per employee, reduce operating expenses and improve
operating margins and cash flows.

The first of these plans of restructuring, which
was announced in 2001, or the 2001 Restructuring, was intended
to reduce costs by eliminating excess personnel and
consolidating facilities and resources. The



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

January 3, 2004

restructuring activities were in response to the
severe economic downturn in the electronics industry. The
restructuring was primarily aimed at reducing excess personnel
and capacity costs within the design services portion of
Cadence’s business (formerly Tality) throughout the world.
The 2001 Restructuring was substantially completed within
12 months after Cadence’s commitment to the plan,
except for remaining facilities-related charges from facilities
vacated pursuant to the plan.

During 2002 Cadence commenced a new plan of
restructuring, or the 2002 Restructuring, intended to further
reduce costs by eliminating excess personnel and consolidating
facilities and resources due to the continued economic downturn
in the electronics industry, to align the cost structure of
Cadence’s design services business with its expected
revenues. The 2002 Restructuring costs resulted from involuntary
terminations, the abandonment of long-lived assets and vacated
facilities. These costs primarily related to Cadence’s
design services business and certain other
business/infrastructure groups.

Cadence accounted for all restructuring charges
incurred through 2002 in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 100 and EITF No. 94-3. All 2002 and 2003
asset impairments or abandonments were accounted for in
accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”, while 2001
asset abandonments were accounted for in accordance with
SFAS No. 121, “Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed
of.”

In 2003, Cadence announced an additional plan of
restructuring, or the 2003 Restructuring, intended to reduce
costs and realize efficiencies by eliminating excess personnel
and consolidating facilities and resources throughout the
company to align Cadence’s cost structure with expected
revenues. The facilities and asset-related portions of this
restructuring were accounted for in accordance with
SFAS No. 146 “Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities.” The severance and
benefits charges were accounted for in accordance with
SFAS No. 112 “Employers’ Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits — An Amendment of FASB
Statements No. 5 and 43.”

Closure and space reduction costs included in
restructuring were comprised of payments required under leases
less any applicable estimated sublease income after the
properties were abandoned, lease buyout costs and costs to
maintain facilities during the period after abandonment. To
estimate the lease loss, which is the loss after Cadence’s
cost recovery efforts from subleasing a building, certain
assumptions were made related to the: (1) time period over
which the relevant building would remain vacant,
(2) sublease terms, and (3) sublease rates, including
common area charges.

Since 2001, Cadence has recorded facilities
consolidation charges related to space reductions or closures of
32 sites, of $83.0 million. As of January 3, 2004, 22
of these sites had been vacated and space reductions occurred at
the remaining ten sites.

As of January 3, 2004, Cadence has accrued
the low end of the lease loss range related to all worldwide
restructuring activities initiated since 2001, which is
estimated to be $23.2 million. This amount will be adjusted
in the future based upon changes in the assumptions used to
estimate the lease loss. As of January 3, 2004, Cadence has
estimated that the high end of the lease loss range could be as
much as $47.8 million if sublease rental rates decrease in
applicable markets or if it takes longer than currently expected
to find a suitable tenant to sublease the facilities.



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

January 3, 2004

Restructuring and other charges incurred by plan
of restructuring for fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001 are as
follows:

Total restructuring and other costs accrued as of
January 3, 2004 were $59.6 million, consisting of
$24.8 million in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities
and $34.8 million in Other long-term liabilities in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The components of the 2003 and 2002 charges to
each plan of restructuring are discussed below.

Restructuring

The 2003 Restructuring will result in the
termination of employment for approximately 635 employees. Costs
resulting from this restructuring included severance payments,
severance-related benefits and outplacement services. All
terminations and termination benefits associated with this
restructuring were communicated to the affected employees prior
to January 3, 2004, with all termination benefits expected
to be paid by January 1, 2005.

Of the $25.7 million of asset-related costs
incurred in conjunction with the 2003 Restructuring,
$11.2 million was directly related to restructuring and
$14.5 million was for other charges. The $11.2 million
of asset-related restructuring charges primarily related to a
fee owed to a government agency due to a reduction in headcount
at a foreign facility, write-off of leasehold improvements for
facilities, disposal of excess equipment and contract
termination costs.

The $14.5 million of other charges was
primarily related to the write-downs of internally developed and
purchased software. As a result of the restructuring efforts,
Cadence eliminated budgeted expenditures for certain internally
developed software projects. As such, Cadence determined that it
was no longer probable that the computer software being
developed for internal purposes would be completed and placed
into service. During the year, Cadence also determined that it
would not integrate certain technology relating to purchased
software, that had been previously capitalized, into any of our
future products. Accordingly, Cadence recognized a charge to
reduce the value of the internally developed software and
purchased software to zero.

The $10.9 million of net facilities charges
incurred under the 2003 Restructuring primarily related to space
reductions at six sites and closure of five sites, along with
further consolidation of two previously

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

January 3, 2004

downsized sites. Cadence accrued facilities
charges as part of the 2003 Restructuring at the time it ceased
use of the vacated space.

The following table presents the activity
associated with restructuring and other charges related to the
2003 Restructuring for the fiscal year ended January 3,
2004:

Restructuring

The 2002 Restructuring resulted in the
termination of employment for approximately 1,370 employees.
While such terminations were across various business functions,
operating units and geographic regions, the
communications-related areas within the design services business
were most affected. Costs resulting from the restructuring
included severance benefits, notice pay and outplacement
services. All terminations and termination benefits were
communicated to the affected employees prior to
December 28, 2002. During 2003, Cadence incurred an
additional $0.8 million in severance and benefits related
to terminations under the 2002 Restructuring.

During 2003, Cadence incurred $0.4 million
of additional asset-related charges under the 2002 Restructuring
for contract termination costs. Asset-related and other
restructuring charges of $35.2 million incurred during 2002
under the 2002 Restructuring were connected with leasehold
improvements for facilities, and the abandonment of long-lived
fixed assets, including software licenses and contract
termination costs.

During 2003, Cadence recorded $1.5 million
of additional facilities charges under the 2002 Restructuring,
primarily associated with changes to lease loss estimates
related to sites included in the plan. Facilities consolidation
charges of $32.4 million recorded during 2002 under the
2002 Restructuring were primarily connected with the further
downsizing of four previously downsized sites and the downsizing
and closing of 16 additional sites.

The following table presents activity associated
with restructuring and other charges related to the 2002
Restructuring for the fiscal years 2003 and 2002:

Restructuring

Facilities-related charges recorded under the
2001 Restructuring were $1.8 million in 2003 and
$14.5 million during 2002, primarily connected with changes
in lease loss estimates, due to reductions in estimated sublease
income caused by deterioration in local real estate markets
where facilities included in the plan are located.

The following table presents the activity
associated with restructuring and other charges related to the
2001 Restructuring for the fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001.
Restructuring activity associated with restructurings initiated
prior to 2001 was immaterial for the years presented, and thus
are not shown separately.

The excess facilities adjustment of
$0.5 million in 2001 relates to an adjustment to the
charges associated with the removal and storage of excess
furniture and equipment from facilities included in the 2001
Restructuring.

NOTE 18. OTHER INCOME (LOSS),
NET

Other income (loss), net for each of 2003, 2002
and 2001 is as follows:

In 2003, the Other loss of $10.4 million is
comprised of $4.8 million impairment on investments,
$5.0 million loss on sales of accounts receivable and
$0.6 million of Other loss, net. In 2002, the Other loss of
$8.7 million is comprised of $14.1 million of
impairment of investments, $15.1 million of loss on sales
of accounts receivable, $24.9 million gain on sale of
investments and $4.4 million of Other loss, net. In 2001,
the Other loss of $1.5 million is comprised of
$21.8 million of loss on sales of accounts receivable,
$6.0 million of impairment of investments,
$23.6 million gain on sale of investments and
$2.7 million of Other income, net.

NOTE 19. SEGMENT REPORTING

Cadence’s chief operating decision maker is
its President and Chief Executive Officer, or CEO.
Cadence’s CEO reviews Cadence’s consolidated results
within three segments: Product, Services and Maintenance.

The Product segment includes revenue and
associated costs from software licensing, hardware sales and
hardware leases. The Services segment includes revenue and
associated costs to provide methodology and design services
either to assist companies in developing electronic designs or
to assume responsibility for the design effort for customers
that outsource this work. The Maintenance segment includes
revenue and associated costs primarily for a technical support
organization. Maintenance agreements are offered to customers
either as part of Cadence’s product license agreements or
separately.

Segment income (loss) from operations is defined
as gross margin under generally accepted accounting principles,
less operating expenses (Marketing and sales, Research and
development and General and administrative), Amortization of
deferred stock compensation, Legal settlements, Restructuring
and other charges, Write-off of acquired in-process technology,
Impairment of goodwill, Interest expense and Other income
(loss), net. Profitability information about Cadence’s
segments is available only to the extent of gross margin by
segment and write-off of acquired in-process technology.
Operating expenses, Amortization of deferred stock compensation,
Legal settlements, Restructuring and other charges, Write-off of
acquired in-process technology, Impairment of goodwill, Interest
expense and Other income (loss), net are managed on a functional
basis. Cadence does not identify or allocate Operating expenses,
Amortization of deferred stock compensation, Legal settlements,
Restructuring and other charges, Write-off of in-process
technology, Impairment of goodwill, Interest expense and Other
income (loss), net because the information is not available by
segment and is not reviewed by Cadence’s CEO to make
decisions about resources to be allocated among the segments or
to assess their performance. There are no differences between
the accounting policies

used to measure profit and loss for segments and
those used on a consolidated basis. Revenue is defined as
revenue from external customers with no inter-segment revenue.

Cadence does not identify or allocate its assets,
including capital expenditures, by operating segment.
Accordingly, assets are not being reported by segment because
the information is not available by segment and is not reviewed
by Cadence’s CEO to make decisions about resources to be
allocated among the segments or to assess their performance.
Depreciation and amortization of purchased software is allocated
among the segments to determine each segment’s gross margin.

The following tables present information about
reported segments for the years ended January 3, 2004,
December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001:



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

January 3, 2004

Internationally, Cadence markets and supports its
products and services primarily through its subsidiaries. Until
June 28, 2003, Cadence licensed most of its software
products in Japan through Innotech Corporation, of which Cadence
is an approximately 15% stockholder. In June 2003, Cadence
purchased certain assets from Innotech, including distribution
rights for certain customers in Japan. Since June 2003, Cadence
directly licenses its software products to customers for which
Cadence acquired the distribution rights from Innotech.

Revenue is attributed to geography based on the
country in which the customer is domiciled. In 2003, 2002 and
2001, no one customer accounted for more than 10% of total
revenue. Long-lived assets are attributed to geography based on
the country where the assets are located.

by geography for years ended January 3, 2004,
December 28, 2002, and December 29, 2001:
