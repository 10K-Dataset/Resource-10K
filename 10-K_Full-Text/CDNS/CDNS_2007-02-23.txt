Factors
    Driving the Electronic Design Automation Industry

Communications, business productivity and consumer electronics
    markets drove growth in the electronics industry for most of the
    past decade. However, in recent years, the consumer market has
    been the fastest growing end market for electronics and the most
    influential in setting expectations for rapid change, low cost,
    miniaturization and increasing functionality.

Electronic systems companies respond to these demands by
    combining subsystems – such as radio frequency
    wireless communication, or RF, video signal processing, and
    embedded computing – onto a single silicon chip,
    creating a system-on-chip, or SoC, or onto multiple chips in a
    single chip package in a format referred to as
    system-in-package, or SiP. These trends toward subsystem
    integration have required chip makers to find solutions to
    challenges previously addressed by system companies, such as
    verifying system-level functionality and hardware-software
    interoperability.



SoC designs put many more transistors on each chip, increasing
    the need for tight control over power consumption. This is done
    not only to increase battery life in portable devices, but also
    to minimize energy cost and limit heat generation, which
    threaten the reliability of a device. Evolving semiconductor
    manufacturing processes with smaller features (transistors and
    wires) and lower supply voltages address both of these issues to
    some degree, but introduce new challenges of their own.
    Contemporary portable electronic devices contain chips in which
    individual features can be as small as 65 nanometers –
    about 6/100,000ths of a millimeter. Because of atomic level
    interactions in the transistors, these chips continue to consume
    power from the battery even when the device is switched off. To
    overcome these issues, specific “low power” design
    techniques must be developed and must be integrated throughout
    the design flow, from logic design and verification through
    physical implementation.

Variability in the processes used to manufacture silicon chips
    has become so pervasive at 65 nanometers and below that
    traditional connections between design and manufacturing teams
    are insufficient to ensure chip performance and yield.
    Integrating detailed models of the manufacturing process into
    the chip design environment is desirable so engineers can craft
    the design to avoid or overcome these manufacturing process
    variations. Similarly, manufacturing teams can optimize their
    processes if, along with the design, they are provided with
    information about the most critical parts of the chip. However,
    sharing information between design and manufacturing processes
    is complicated because current data formats used to describe the
    chip design differ from data formats used to describe the
    manufacturing process and control the manufacturing equipment.
    Moreover, design and manufacturing often takes place within two
    separate companies – one company designs the chip
    while another company manufactures it.

These trends pose significant new challenges for the electronics
    design processes. Specifically, product performance and size
    requirements of the mobile consumer electronics market require
    microelectronic systems to be smaller, consume less power and
    provide multiple functions all in one SoC or SiP package. This
    requires designers to pay close attention to many electrical,
    physical and manufacturing effects that were inconsequential in
    previous generations of chip designs. The design challenge
    becomes more complex with each new generation of electronics,
    and providers of EDA solutions must deliver products that
    address these technical challenges, while improving the
    efficiency and productivity of the design process.

Operating
    Segment

Our chief operating decision maker is our President and Chief
    Executive Officer, or CEO. Our CEO reviews our consolidated
    results within only one operating segment.

Products

Our products are engineered to improve our customers’
    design productivity and resulting design quality by providing a
    comprehensive set of EDA design products. Product revenues
    include all fees earned from granting licenses to use our
    software, and from sales and leases of our hardware products,
    and exclude revenues derived from maintenance and services. We
    offer customers three license types for our software: perpetual,
    term and subscription. See “Software Licensing
    Arrangements” below for additional discussion of our
    license types.

Product revenue was $982.7 million, or 66% of our total
    revenue, in 2006, $851.5 million, or 64% of our total
    revenue, in 2005 and $729.8 million, or 61% of our total
    revenue, in 2004.

Product
    Strategy

With the addition of emerging nanometer design considerations to
    the already burgeoning set of traditional design tasks, complex
    SoC or IC design can no longer be accomplished using a
    collection of discrete design tools. What previously consisted
    of sequential design activities must be merged and accomplished
    nearly simultaneously without time-consuming data translation
    steps. We combine our design technologies into
    “platforms” for four major design activities:
    functional verification, digital IC design, custom IC design and
    system interconnect. The four
    Cadence

®

design platforms are
    Incisive

®

functional verification,
    Encounter

®

digital IC design,
    Virtuoso

®

custom design and
    Allegro

®

system interconnect platforms. In addition, we augment these
    platform product offerings with a comprehensive set of design
    for manufacturing, or DFM, products that service both the
    digital and custom IC design flows. These four platforms,
    together with our DFM products, comprise our primary product
    lines.



Incisive
    Functional Verification Platform

The Incisive functional verification platform enables our
    customers to employ enterprise-level verification process
    automation, including verification planning, management and
    process tracking, with coordination of all verification
    activities across teams of specialists and different execution
    platforms.

The Incisive platform is tailored for three customer segments:

•

Design engineers using traditional hardware description
    languages and testing techniques;

•

Design teams that are also responsible for verification and need
    more automation; and

•

Multi-specialist enterprise teams comprised of systems,
    software, hardware verification, system validation, and logic
    design teams.

The Incisive platform includes verification process automation
    technologies, methodologies, and verification intellectual
    property, or IP, for many standard protocols. Products include:

•

The Incisive Design Team and Enterprise Manager, which automates
    and guides the verification process and then analyzes data, from
    planning to closure;

•

The Incisive Design Team and Enterprise Simulator, which offers
    mixed-language support, dynamic assertion checking,
    transaction-level support, HDL analysis and a complete debug
    environment;

•

The Incisive Formal Verifier, which shortens design and
    verification time while improving design quality by providing a
    formal means of verifying RTL functional correctness with
    assertions, without the need of testbench simulation, and also
    provides an effective means of providing predictable, fast RTL
    block bring-up and assertion-based verification; and

•

The
    Palladium

®

and
    Extreme

®

series of emulation and acceleration solutions, which accelerate
    the verification process and enable first working silicon with
    first working software.

The Incisive Plan-to-Closure methodology (supported by technical
    field experts) is designed to enable the scalable deployment of
    best practices and to mitigate our customers’ language,
    technology and methodology adoption risks.

Encounter
    Digital IC Design Platform

The Encounter digital IC design platform enables our
    customers to implement all aspects of their digital
    nanometer-scale designs. It is based on a single user interface
    and unified in-memory data model, and is specifically designed
    to facilitate the analysis and optimization of chip performance,
    power consumption, and silicon area and manufacturability
    throughout our customers’ design processes. The Encounter
    platform is comprised of the following core technologies:

•

Silicon virtual prototyping for enabling designers to plan the
    complete implementation of a chip before committing to a
    specific design strategy;

•

Global register transfer level, or RTL, and physical synthesis
    for creating and physically locating logic on the chip, while
    simultaneously optimizing performance, power, cost and yield;

•

Signal integrity and yield-aware routing for connecting high
    performance physical interconnect between the logic gates;

•

Signal integrity and nanometer delay analysis;

•

Comprehensive design-for-test capability as well as post-silicon
    test diagnostics; and

•

Logic equivalence checking and design constraint management
    capability for designers to verify that their RTL specification
    is equivalent to the final IC layout.

Unlike traditional “front-end/back-end” systems, the
    Encounter platform does not require customers to perform
    time-consuming translations between common tasks such as
    placement, power distribution, routing, and timing and crosstalk
    analysis. The Encounter platform supports hierarchical designs,
    with support for designs containing hundreds of millions of
    transistors on a single chip. Since 2005, the Encounter platform
    has been offered in three levels: Encounter L, XL and GXL. These
    levels are scaled to provide customers with technologies
    tailored to specific degrees of design complexity in the
    digital IC space.



Virtuoso
    Custom Design Platform

The Virtuoso custom design platform enables design
    predictability by ensuring that the circuit design
    representation will perform correctly in the final manufactured
    chip. With the Virtuoso platform, designers are able to deliver
    silicon-accurate analog, custom digital, RF, and mixed-signal
    designs, while addressing the growing number of physical effects
    in package, power grid, interconnect, devices and substrate
    employing a “top-down” language-based design.

The Virtuoso platform reduces design time by providing:

•

Reference flows for analog, mixed-signal, RF and analog-digital
    integration focused at the wireless and analog/mixed-signal
    markets;

•

Automatic analog circuit sizing and optimization (including
    yield optimization);

•

Multi-mode simulation (digital, analog and RF) using a common
    syntax and model, and common equations;

•

Fast custom layout technologies;

•

Process migration technology;

•

Electrical vs. physical effects analysis; and

•

Physical design integration and silicon analysis for complex
    custom, cell-based and mixed custom designs.

The
    OpenAccess

tm

database (described below in “Third Party Programs and
    Initiatives”) is used as a mechanism for integration across
    the Virtuoso platform.

With the 2006 introduction of the Virtuoso 6.1.0 platform
    we completed our Virtuoso platform product segmentation which
    began in 2005. The Virtuoso L, XL and GXL offerings provide
    our customers with a diverse set of custom design capabilities
    for entry-level design to the most complex DFM-aware designs.

Allegro
    System Interconnect Design Platform

The Allegro system interconnect design platform enables design
    teams to design high-performance interconnect across the domains
    of IC, package and printed circuit board, or PCB, reducing cost
    and time to market. The system interconnect – between
    input-output buffers and across ICs, packages and
    PCBs – can be optimized through the platform’s
    co-design methodology, reducing both hardware costs and design
    cycles. Designers use the Allegro platform’s
    constraint-driven methodology and advanced capabilities for
    design capture, signal integrity and physical implementation.
    Silicon design-in kits speed time to market by allowing IC
    companies to shorten new device adoption time and allowing
    systems companies to accelerate PCB system design cycles. In
    2006, with the release of our SiP products, we have entered an
    emerging market designed to accelerate products to market where
    designers are looking for alternatives between SoCs and PCBs. In
    2006, the Allegro L, XL and GXL products were introduced
    along with the XL and GXL offerings for Cadence’s SiP
    products.

The system interconnect product group includes the Allegro
    system interconnect platform, the
    OrCAD

®

product line of PCB design products which are engineered for
    individual or small design team productivity and a family of IC
    packaging and SiP technologies. The OrCAD product line is
    marketed worldwide through a network of alternative channel
    partners.

Design
    for Manufacturing

The physical layout of each IC requires detailed analysis and
    optimization to ensure that the design can be manufactured in
    volume while performing as expected. Some of our products that
    deliver DFM capabilities for nanometer SoC design include:

•

Fire &
    Ice

®

QX and
    Assura

®

RCX extraction products, which take the designer’s physical
    representation of an IC and extract the electrical properties of
    that design representation to enable further analyses, such as
    simulation and timing analysis;



•

Products in the
    VoltageStorm

®

family, which analyze on-chip power distribution for digital,
    analog and SoC designs. VoltageStorm detects unanticipated
    voltage drop, enabling the customer to correct fatal conditions,
    thereby preventing extensive troubleshooting and delay during
    initial manufacturing;

•

Our physical verification products, including Cadence Physical
    Verification System, Assura,
    Diva

®

and
    Dracula

®

,
    which perform manufacturing design rule checks to ensure the
    proposed design meets the requirements of the foundry’s
    manufacturing process rules;

•

Mask data preparation tools, such as MaskCompose and QuickView,
    which help customer mask shops create mask and reticle layouts
    for chips being manufactured in nanometer processes; and

•

Design Virtual Interconnect Predictor, which helps customers
    understand the impact of chemical-metal planarization, one of
    the major steps in the semiconductor manufacturing process, on
    their chip performance at advanced silicon geometries.

Kits

Today’s growing silicon complexity creates an array of
    design challenges for semiconductor and systems design teams.
    Among these challenges is the application of EDA technologies to
    overcome design hurdles in certain key markets driving the
    semiconductor industry, particularly the wireless and digital
    personal entertainment segments. Cadence kits are designed to
    allow companies in these sectors to achieve shorter, more
    predictable design cycles and greater design productivity by
    greatly simplifying the application and integration of EDA
    technologies and verification IP to address major design
    challenges in these markets: analog-mixed signal, or AMS, RF,
    SiP, low power and verification.

Each kit addresses application-specific design issues by
    combining a verified methodology and enabling standards-based
    IP – all applied to a segment representative design
    and delivered with application consulting. Following the
    introduction of the AMS Methodology and RF Design Methodology
    Kits, in 2006 we introduced the RF SiP Methodology Kit and the
    Functional Verification Kit for ARM.

Verification
    and Application Specific Programming Services

We offer verification and application specific programming, or
    ASP, services through

Time-to-Market

Engineering, or TtME, services. Our TtME offering provides
    customers with consulting services, project services and/or
    complete turnkey services for verification acceleration and
    system emulation. QuickCycles allows customers access to our
    Palladium simulation acceleration and emulation products on a
    pay-as-you-go basis, either on the customer internet site or
    remotely over a high-speed, secure network connection.

Third
    Party Programs and Initiatives

We recognize that certain of our customers may also use
    internally-developed design tools or design tools provided by
    other EDA companies, as well as IP available from multiple
    suppliers. We support the integration of third party design
    products through our OpenAccess Initiative and
    Connections

®

and OpenChoice programs. OpenAccess is a full-featured EDA
    database that supports access and manipulation of its internal
    EDA data via a fully documented and freely available programming
    interface. This provides an open application program interface
    through which applications developed by our customers, by their
    other EDA vendors, or by university research groups can all
    operate within a single database and with our products. We have
    licensed the OpenAccess database to the OpenAccess Coalition,
    which is operated by the Silicon Integration Initiative, or Si2,
    an organization of EDA, electronic system and semiconductor
    industry leaders focused on improving productivity and reducing
    cost in creating and producing integrated silicon systems.

The Connections Program provides other EDA companies with access
    to our products to ensure that our products work well with those
    third party tools. Over 130 EDA providers are members of the
    Connections Program. The OpenChoice program was instituted to
    enable interoperability and facilitate open collaboration with
    leading providers of library, processor, memory core and
    verification IP to build, validate and deliver accurate models
    optimized for Cadence design and verification solutions. The
    program aims to ensure IP quality and provide our customers with
    access to optimized IP. A key component of the OpenChoice
    program is to assist and support library



providers in the integration of our design and verification
    products and model formats into customer-owned tooling, or COT,
    library solutions.

In 2006, we formed the Power Forward Initiative with a group of
    22 electronics industry leaders who recognized the urgent need
    for an automated, power-aware design infrastructure to
    facilitate the production of ICs that consume significantly less
    power. The goal of the group is to participate in the refinement
    and standardization of the Common Power Format, or CPF. CPF is a
    specification language that holistically captures low-power
    design intent so that it can be communicated consistently
    throughout the IC design process. We have contributed the CPF
    specification to Si2, which will manage the standardization,
    maintenance and distribution of CPF for the benefit of the
    electronics industry.

In addition, we work with vendors of Application Specific
    Integrated Circuits, or ASICs, to ensure predictable and smooth
    handoff of design data from mutual customers to ASIC
    implementation. These programs foster relationships throughout
    the silicon design chain with leading IP partners, silicon
    manufacturers and library provider partners to support both ASIC
    and COT solutions for our customers. They are integral to
    providing complete design chain solutions to IC and electronic
    systems designers who depend on coordinated offerings from
    multiple suppliers.

Maintenance

We provide technical support to our customers to facilitate
    their use of our software and hardware products. A high level of
    customer service and support is critical to the adoption and
    successful use of our products.

We have a global customer support organization and specialized
    field application engineering teams located in each of our
    operating regions to provide assistance to customers where and
    when they need it.

Standard maintenance support includes three major components:
    our
    Sourcelink

®

online support portal, which provides 24 hour access to
    real-time technical information on our products; contact center
    support (telephone, email and web access to our support
    engineers); and software updates (periodic updates with
    regression-tested critical fixes and updated functionality
    available via CDs or secure internet download).

Maintenance is offered to customers as an integral,
    non-cancelable component of our subscription license agreements,
    or as a separate agreement subject to annual renewal for our
    term and perpetual license customers.

Some of our customers have relocated, or expanded the presence
    of their design teams, away from their headquarters or
    historical locations to locations in emerging growth regions.
    Accordingly, to provide responsive and effective support for
    these customers, we expect to continue expanding the presence of
    our own support and application engineering teams in these
    emerging growth regions.

Maintenance revenue was $366.3 million, or 25% of our total
    revenue, in 2006, $351.5 million, or 26% of our total
    revenue, in 2005 and $330.7 million, or 28% of our total
    revenue, in 2004. We expect that maintenance revenue in 2007
    will be generated predominantly from backlog.

Services

We offer a number of fee-based services, including education and
    engineering services related to IC design and methodology. These
    services may be sold separately or sold and performed in
    conjunction with the sale, lease or license of our products.

Services revenue was $134.9 million, or 9% of our total
    revenue, in 2006, $126.2 million, or 9% of our total
    revenue, in 2005 and $137.0 million, or 11% of our total
    revenue, in 2004.

Education
    Services

Our education services include Internet, classroom and custom
    courses, the content of which ranges from how to use the most
    recent features of our EDA products to instruction in the latest
    IC design techniques.



Engineering
    Services

We offer engineering services and reusable design technologies
    to aid customers with the design of complex ICs. We focus our
    offerings primarily on SoC devices, including both ASICs and
    Application Specific Standard Parts, and on analog and mixed
    signal ICs. The customers for these services primarily consist
    of semiconductor and systems companies developing products for
    the communications, computing and consumer markets. We offer
    engineering capabilities to assist customers from product
    concept through volume manufacturing.

We also make our design IP portfolio available to customers as
    part of our technology and services solutions. These reusable
    design and methodology components enable us to more efficiently
    deliver our services, and allow our customers to reduce the
    design complexity and time to market for the development of
    complex SoCs.

In our design and methodology service practices, we leverage our
    cumulative experience and knowledge of design practices across
    many customers and different design environments to improve our
    own service teams’ and our customers’ productivity. We
    work with customers using outsourcing, consultative and
    collaborative models depending on their projects and needs. Our
    Virtual Computer-Aided Design, or VCAD, model enables our
    engineering teams at one or more of our locations to virtually
    work

“side-by-side”

with our customers’ teams located elsewhere during the
    course of their design and engineering projects through a secure
    private network infrastructure.

Through collaboration with our customers, we are able to design
    advanced ICs and gain direct and early visibility to industry
    design issues that may not be addressed adequately by
    today’s EDA solutions. This enables us to accelerate the
    development of new software technology and products to meet the
    market’s current and future design requirements.

Marketing
    and Sales

We generally use a direct sales force consisting of sales people
    and applications engineers to market our products and provide
    maintenance and services to existing and prospective customers.
    Applications engineers provide technical pre-sales and
    post-sales support for software products. Due to the complexity
    of many of our EDA products and the electronic design process in
    general, the sales cycle is generally long, requiring three to
    six months or more. During the sales cycle, our direct sales
    force generally provides technical presentations, product
    demonstrations and support for

on-site

customer evaluation of our software. We also use traditional
    marketing approaches to promote our products and services,
    including advertising, direct mail, telemarketing, trade shows,
    public relations and the Internet. As EDA products mature and
    become widely understood by the marketplace, we selectively
    utilize value added resellers to broaden our reach and reduce
    cost of sales. All OrCAD and selected Incisive products are
    primarily marketed through these channels. With respect to
    international sales, we generally market and support our
    products and services through our subsidiaries.

Software
    Licensing Arrangements

We sell software using three license types: subscription, term
    and perpetual. Customers who prefer to license technology for a
    specified, limited period of time will choose either a
    subscription or term license, and customers who prefer to have
    the right to use the technology continuously without time
    restriction will choose a perpetual license. Customers who
    desire rights to remix in new technology during the life of the
    contract will select a subscription license, which allows them
    limited access to unspecified new technology on a

when-and-if-available

basis, as opposed to a term or perpetual license which does not
    include remix rights to new technology. Payment terms for
    subscription and term licenses generally provide for payments to
    be made in installments over the license period and payment
    terms for perpetual licenses generally are net 30 days.

Our revenue recognition depends on a number of contract-specific
    terms and conditions, including the license type, payment terms,
    creditworthiness of the customer and other factors as more fully
    described in this Annual Report under the heading “Critical
    Accounting Estimates” under Item 7,
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations.” Revenue associated
    with subscription licenses is recognized over multiple periods
    during the license term, whereas product revenue associated with
    term and perpetual licenses is generally recognized upon the
    later of the effective date of the license or delivery of the
    product, assuming all



other criteria for revenue recognition have been met. Although
    it can vary from quarter to quarter, approximately two-thirds of
    our product revenue was recognized from backlog during each of
    the past three years.

Our revenue and results of operations may miss expectations due
    to a shortfall in product revenue generated from current
    transactions or variance in the actual mix of license types
    executed in any given period, and due to other contract-specific
    terms and conditions as discussed above. We are subject to
    greater credit risk on subscription and term licenses, as
    compared to perpetual licenses, due to the installment payment
    terms generally associated with those license types. Otherwise,
    the particular risks to us of one license type versus another
    type do not vary considerably.

From time to time we sell receivables generated by our licenses
    with installment payment terms to third party financing
    institutions on a non-recourse or limited-recourse basis.

For a further description of our license agreements, revenue
    recognition policies and results of operations, please refer to
    the discussion under the heading “Critical Accounting
    Estimates” under Item 7, “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.”

Research
    and Development

Our investment in research and development was
    $460.1 million in 2006, $390.7 million in 2005 and
    $368.1 million in 2004.

The primary areas of our research and development include SoC
    design, the design of silicon devices in the nanometer range,
    high-performance IC packaging, SiP and PCB design, system-level
    modeling and verification, high-performance logic verification
    technology and hardware/software co-verification. Because the
    electronics industry combines rapid innovation with rapidly
    increasing design and manufacturing complexity, we make
    significant investments in enhancing our current products, as
    well as creating new products and technologies and integrating
    those products and technologies together into segmented
    solutions.

Our future performance depends largely on our ability to
    maintain and enhance our current product development and
    commercialization to meet advancing semiconductor manufacturing
    capability and design complexity, develop, acquire or interface
    to new products from third parties, and develop solutions that
    meet increasingly demanding productivity, quality,
    predictability and cost requirements. In addition to our
    research and development team, we maintain Cadence Laboratories,
    an advanced research group responsible for exploring specific
    new technologies, moving those technologies into product
    development and maintaining strong industry relationships.

Manufacturing
    and Distribution

Our software production consists of configuring the
    customer’s order, outsourcing the recording of the product
    electronically or on CD-ROM, and producing customer-unique
    access keys that allow customers to use licensed products.
    Software and documentation are primarily distributed to
    customers by secure electronic delivery. User manuals and other
    documentation are generally available by secure electronic
    delivery or on CD-ROM, but are occasionally supplied in hard
    copy format.

Cadence performs final assembly and test of its hardware
    verification, acceleration and emulation products in
    San Jose, California. Subcontractors manufacture all major
    subassemblies, including all individual PCBs and custom ICs, and
    supply them to us for qualification and testing prior to their
    incorporation into the assembled product.

Proprietary
    Technology

Our success depends, in part, upon our proprietary technology.
    We generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade
    secret laws, licenses and restrictive agreements to establish
    and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products.
    Many of our products include software or other intellectual
    property licensed from third parties. We may have to seek new
    licenses or renew existing licenses for this third party
    software and other intellectual property in the future. As part
    of performing design and methodology services for customers, our
    design



and methodology services business licenses certain software and
    other intellectual property of third parties, including that of
    our competitors.

Competition

We compete in the EDA market for products and maintenance
    primarily with three companies: Synopsys, Inc., Mentor Graphics
    Corporation and Magma Design Automation, Inc. We also compete
    with numerous smaller EDA companies, with manufacturers of
    electronic devices that have developed or have the capability to
    develop their own EDA products, and with numerous electronics
    design and consulting companies. We generally compete on the
    basis of product quality, product features, integration in a
    platform or compatibility with other tools, price, payment terms
    and maintenance offerings.

Our maintenance business flows directly from our product
    business. The competitive issues associated with our maintenance
    business are substantially the same as those for our product
    business in that every maintenance contract is the direct result
    of a product contract, and once we have entered into a product
    contract, maintenance is generally purchased by the customer to
    ensure access to bug fixes and service releases, as and when
    they are made available, and other continued support.

Certain competitive factors in the design and methodology
    services business as described herein differ from those of the
    products and maintenance businesses. While we do compete with
    other EDA companies in the design and methodology services
    business, we compete more with independent design and
    methodology service businesses. These companies vary greatly in
    focus, geographic location, capability, cost structure and
    pricing. In addition, manufacturers of electronic devices may be
    reluctant to purchase services from independent vendors, such as
    Cadence, because they wish to promote their own internal design
    departments. We compete with these companies by focusing on the
    design of complex analog and digital ICs. It is our strategy to
    use design and methodology services as a differentiator to
    further promote our products and maintenance businesses.

Backlog

Our backlog on December 30, 2006 was approximately
    $1.9 billion, as compared to $1.8 billion on
    December 31, 2005. Backlog consists of revenue to be
    recognized in future fiscal periods after December 30, 2006
    from:

•

Subscription licenses for software products;

•

Sale or lease of hardware;

•

Maintenance contracts on hardware and software products;

•

Orders for hardware and software products sold on perpetual and
    term licenses on which customers have delivery dates after
    December 30, 2006;

•

Licenses with payments that are outside our customary
    terms; and

•

The undelivered portion of design and methodology services
    contracts.

The substantial majority of our backlog is generated by our
    product and maintenance businesses because customer licenses
    generally include both product and maintenance components.
    Historically, we have not experienced significant cancellations
    of our contracts with customers. However, we often reschedule
    the required completion dates of design and methodology services
    contracts which, at times, defers revenue recognition under
    those contracts beyond the original expected completion date.
    Changes in customer license types or payment terms also can
    impact the timing of revenue recognition.

Revenue
    Seasonality

Historically, orders and revenue have been lowest in our first
    quarter and highest in our fourth quarter, with a material
    decline between the fourth quarter of one year and the first
    quarter of the next year. We expect the first quarter will
    remain our lowest quarter for orders and revenues; orders and
    revenues in other quarters will vary based on the particular
    timing and type of licenses entered into with large customers.



International
    Operations

We have approximately 60 sales offices, design centers and
    research and development facilities located around the world. We
    consider customer sales and support requirements, the
    availability of a skilled workforce, and costs and efficiencies,
    among other relative benefits, when determining what operations
    to locate internationally. For additional information regarding
    our international operations, see the discussion under the
    heading “

The effect of foreign exchange rate
    fluctuations and other risks to our international operations may
    seriously harm our financial condition”

in
    Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Note 21 to our
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Employees

As of December 30, 2006, we employed approximately 5,200
    individuals, with approximately 1,900 in sales, services,
    marketing, support and manufacturing activities, approximately
    2,700 in product research and development and approximately 600
    in management, administration and finance. None of our employees
    are represented by a labor union, and we have experienced no
    work stoppages. We believe that our employee relations are good.

Item 1A. Risk
    Factors

Our business faces many risks.  Described below are
    what we believe to be the material risks that we face. If any of
    the events or circumstances described in the following risks
    actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of
    operations could suffer.

Risks
    Related to Our Business

We are
    subject to the cyclical nature of the integrated circuit and
    electronics systems industries, and any

downturn in these industries may reduce our
    revenue.

Purchases of our products and services are dependent upon the
    commencement of new design projects by IC manufacturers and
    electronics systems companies. The IC and electronics systems
    industries are cyclical and are characterized by constant and
    rapid technological change, rapid product obsolescence and price
    erosion, evolving standards, short product life cycles and wide
    fluctuations in product supply and demand.

The IC and electronics systems industries have experienced
    significant downturns, often connected with, or in anticipation
    of, maturing product cycles of both these industries’ and
    their customers’ products and a decline in general economic
    conditions. These downturns have been characterized by
    diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high
    inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling
    prices. Any economic downturn in the industries we serve could
    harm our business, operating results or financial condition.

Our
    failure to respond quickly to technological developments could
    make our products
    uncompetitive and obsolete.

The industries in which we compete experience rapid technology
    developments, changes in industry standards, changes in customer
    requirements and frequent new product introductions and
    improvements. Currently, the industries we serve are
    experiencing several revolutionary trends:

•

Migration to nanometer design: the size of features such as
    wires, transistors and contacts on ICs continuously shrink due
    to the ongoing advances in semiconductor manufacturing
    processes. Process feature sizes refer to the width of the
    transistors and the width and spacing of interconnect on the IC.
    Feature size is normally identified by the transistor length,
    which is shrinking rapidly to 65 nanometers and smaller. This is
    commonly referred to in the semiconductor industry as the
    migration to nanometer design. It represents a major challenge
    for participants in the semiconductor industry, from IC design
    and design automation to design of manufacturing equipment and
    the manufacturing process itself. Shrinkage of transistor length
    to such proportions is challenging the industry in the
    application of more complex physics and chemistry that is needed
    to realize advanced silicon devices. For EDA tools, models of
    each component’s electrical properties and behavior become
    more complex as do requisite analysis, design and verification
    capabilities. Novel design tools and methodologies must be
    invented quickly to remain competitive in the design of
    electronics in the smallest nanometer ranges.



•

The challenges of nanometer design are leading some customers to
    work with older, less risky manufacturing processes. This may
    reduce their need to upgrade their EDA products and design flows.

•

The ability to design

system-on-a-chip

devices, or SoCs, increases the complexity of managing a design
    that, at the lowest level, is represented by billions of shapes
    on the fabrication mask. In addition, SoCs typically incorporate
    microprocessors and digital signal processors that are
    programmed with software, requiring simultaneous design of the
    IC and the related software embedded on the IC.

•

With the availability of seemingly endless gate capacity, there
    is an increase in design reuse, or the combining of

off-the-shelf

design IP with custom logic to create ICs. The unavailability of
    high-quality design IP that can be reliably incorporated into a
    customer’s design with Cadence IC implementation products
    and services could reduce demand for our products and services.

•

Increased technological capability of the Field-Programmable
    Gate Array, which is a programmable logic chip, creates an
    alternative to IC implementation for some electronics companies.
    This could reduce demand for Cadence’s IC implementation
    products and services.

•

A growing number of low-cost design and methodology services
    businesses could reduce the need for some IC companies to invest
    in EDA products.

If we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these
    developments, we may lose our competitive position, and our
    products or technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete.
    To compete successfully, we must develop or acquire new products
    and improve our existing products and processes on a schedule
    that keeps pace with technological developments and the
    requirements for products addressing a broad spectrum of
    designers and designer expertise in our industries. We must also
    be able to support a range of changing computer software,
    hardware platforms and customer preferences. We cannot guarantee
    that we will be successful in this effort.

We
    have experienced varied operating results, and our operating
    results for any particular fiscal period are affected by the
    timing of significant orders for our software products,
    fluctuations in customer preferences for license types and the
    timing of revenue recognition under those license
    types.

We have experienced, and may continue to experience, varied
    operating results. In particular, we have experienced net losses
    for some past periods and we may experience net losses in future
    periods. Various factors affect our operating results and some
    of them are not within our control. Our operating results for
    any period are affected by the timing of significant orders for
    our software products because a significant number of licenses
    for our software products are in excess of $5.0 million.

Our operating results are also affected by the mix of license
    types executed in any given period. We license software using
    three different license types: subscription, term and perpetual.
    Product revenue associated with term and perpetual licenses is
    generally recognized at the beginning of the license period,
    whereas product revenue associated with subscription licenses is
    recognized over multiple periods during the term of the license.
    Revenue may also be deferred under term and perpetual licenses
    until payments become due and payable from customers with
    nonlinear payment terms or as cash is collected from customers
    with lower credit ratings. In addition, revenue is impacted by
    the timing of license renewals, the extent to which contracts
    contain flexible payment terms and the mix of license types
    (i.e., perpetual, term or subscription) for existing customers,
    which changes could have the effect of accelerating or delaying
    the recognition of revenue from the timing of recognition under
    the original contract.

We plan operating expense levels primarily based on forecasted
    revenue levels. These expenses and the impact of long-term
    commitments are relatively fixed in the short term. A shortfall
    in revenue could lead to operating results below expectations
    because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed
    expenses in response to these short-term business changes.

You should not view our historical results of operations as
    reliable indicators of our future performance. If revenue or
    operating results fall short of the levels expected by public
    market analysts or investors, the trading price of our common
    stock could decline dramatically.



Our
    future revenue is dependent in part upon our installed customer
    base continuing to license or buy additional products,
    renew maintenance agreements and purchase additional
    services.

Our installed customer base has traditionally generated
    additional new license, service and maintenance revenues. In
    future periods, customers may not necessarily license or buy
    additional products or contract for additional services or
    maintenance. Maintenance is generally renewable annually at a
    customer’s option, and there are no mandatory payment
    obligations or obligations to license additional software. If
    our customers decide not to renew their maintenance agreements
    or license additional products or contract for additional
    services, or if they reduce the scope of the maintenance
    agreements, our revenue could decrease, which could have an
    adverse effect on our results of operations.

We may
    not receive significant revenue from our current research and
    development efforts for several years, if at
    all.

Internally developing software products, integrating acquired
    software products and integrating intellectual property into
    existing platforms is expensive, and these investments often
    require a long time to generate returns. Our strategy involves
    significant investments in software research and development and
    related product opportunities. We believe that we must continue
    to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research
    and development efforts to maintain our competitive position.
    However, we cannot predict that we will receive significant, if
    any, revenue from these investments.

Our
    failure to attract, train, motivate and retain key employees may
    make us less competitive in our industries and therefore harm
    our results of operations.

Our business depends on the efforts and abilities of our
    employees. The high cost of training new employees, not fully
    utilizing these employees, or losing trained employees to
    competing employers could reduce our gross margins and harm our
    business or operating results. Competition for highly skilled
    employees can be intense, particularly in geographic areas
    recognized as high technology centers such as the Silicon Valley
    area, where our principal offices are located, and the other
    locations where we maintain facilities. If economic conditions
    continue to improve and job opportunities in the technology
    industry become more plentiful, we may experience increased
    employee attrition and increased competition for skilled
    employees. To attract, retain and motivate individuals with the
    requisite expertise, we may be required to grant large numbers
    of stock options or other stock-based incentive awards, which
    may be dilutive to existing stockholders and increase
    compensation expense. We may also be required to pay key
    employees significant base salaries and cash bonuses, which
    could harm our operating results.

In addition, the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules require stockholder
    approval for new equity compensation plans and significant
    amendments to existing plans, including increases in shares
    available for issuance under such plans, and prohibit NASDAQ
    member organizations from giving a proxy to vote on equity
    compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has
    given voting instructions. These regulations could make it more
    difficult for us to grant equity compensation to employees in
    the future. To the extent that these regulations make it more
    difficult or expensive to grant equity compensation to
    employees, we may incur increased compensation costs or find it
    difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, which could
    materially and adversely affect our business.

We
    have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and
    businesses and may not realize the expected benefits of these
    acquisitions.

We have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and
    businesses in the future. While we expect to carefully analyze
    each potential acquisition before committing to the transaction,
    we may not be able to integrate and manage acquired products and
    businesses effectively. In addition, acquisitions involve a
    number of risks. If any of the following events occurs after we
    acquire another business, it could seriously harm our business,
    operating results or financial condition:

•

Difficulties in combining previously separate businesses into a
    single unit;

•

The substantial diversion of management’s attention from

day-to-day

business when evaluating and negotiating these transactions and
    integrating an acquired business;

•

The discovery, after completion of the acquisition, of
    liabilities assumed from the acquired business or of assets
    acquired for which we cannot realize the anticipated value;



•

The failure to realize anticipated benefits such as cost savings
    and revenue enhancements;

•

The failure to retain key employees of the acquired business;

•

Difficulties related to integrating the products of an acquired
    business in, for example, distribution, engineering and customer
    support areas;

•

Unanticipated costs;

•

Customer dissatisfaction with existing license agreements with
    Cadence which may dissuade them from licensing or buying
    products acquired by Cadence after the effective date of the
    license; and

•

The failure to understand and compete effectively in markets in
    which we have limited experience.

In a number of our previously completed acquisitions, we have
    agreed to make future payments, or earnouts, based on the
    performance of the businesses we acquired. The performance goals
    pursuant to which these future payments may be made generally
    relate to achievement by the acquired business of certain
    specified bookings, revenue, product proliferation, product
    development or employee retention goals during a specified
    period following completion of the applicable acquisition.
    Future acquisitions may involve issuances of stock as full or
    partial payment of the purchase price for the acquired business,
    grants of incentive stock or options to employees of the
    acquired businesses (which may be dilutive to existing
    stockholders), expenditure of substantial cash resources or the
    incurrence of material amounts of debt.

The specific performance goal levels and amounts and timing of
    contingent purchase price payments vary with each acquisition.
    In connection with our acquisitions completed prior to
    December 30, 2006, we may be obligated to pay up to an
    aggregate of $4.8 million in cash during the next
    12 months and an additional $2.0 million in cash in
    periods after the next 12 months through August 2008 if
    certain performance goals related to one or more of the criteria
    mentioned above are achieved in full.

The
    competition in our industries is substantial and we may not be
    able to continue to successfully compete in our
    industries.

The EDA market and the commercial electronics design and
    methodology services industries are highly competitive. If we
    fail to compete successfully in these industries, it could
    seriously harm our business, operating results or financial
    condition. To compete in these industries, we must identify and
    develop or acquire innovative and cost-competitive EDA products,
    integrate them into platforms and market them in a timely
    manner. We must also gain industry acceptance for our design and
    methodology services and offer better strategic concepts,
    technical solutions, prices and response time, or a combination
    of these factors, than those of other design companies and the
    internal design departments of electronics manufacturers. We
    cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully
    in these industries. Factors that could affect our ability to
    succeed include:

•

The development by others of competitive EDA products or
    platforms and design and methodology services, which could
    result in a shift of customer preferences away from our products
    and services and significantly decrease revenue;

•

Decisions by electronics manufacturers to perform design and
    methodology services internally, rather than purchase these
    services from outside vendors due to budget constraints or
    excess engineering capacity;

•

The challenges of developing (or acquiring externally-developed)
    technology solutions that are adequate and competitive in
    meeting the requirements of next-generation design challenges;

•

The significant number of current and potential competitors in
    the EDA industry and the low cost of entry;

•

Intense competition to attract acquisition targets, which may
    make it more difficult for us to acquire companies or
    technologies at an acceptable price or at all; and

•

The combination of or collaboration among many EDA companies to
    deliver more comprehensive offerings than they could
    individually.

We compete in the EDA products market primarily with Synopsys,
    Inc., Mentor Graphics Corporation and Magma Design Automation,
    Inc. We also compete with numerous smaller EDA companies, with
    manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed or have
    the capability to develop their own EDA products, and with
    numerous electronics design and consulting companies.
    Manufacturers of electronic devices may be reluctant to



purchase design and methodology services from independent
    vendors such as us because they wish to promote their own
    internal design departments.

We may
    need to change our pricing models to compete
    successfully.

The highly competitive markets in which we compete can put
    pressure on us to reduce the prices of our products. If our
    competitors offer deep discounts on certain products in an
    effort to recapture or gain market segment share or to sell
    other software or hardware products, we may then need to lower
    our prices or offer other favorable terms to compete
    successfully. Any such changes would be likely to reduce our
    profit margins and could adversely affect our operating results.
    Any substantial changes to our prices and pricing policies could
    cause sales and software license revenues to decline or be
    delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust
    to the new pricing policies. Some of our competitors may bundle
    products for promotional purposes or as a long-term pricing
    strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product
    implementations. These practices could, over time, significantly
    constrain the prices that we can charge for our products. If we
    cannot offset price reductions with a corresponding increase in
    the number of sales or with lower spending, then the reduced
    license revenues resulting from lower prices could have an
    adverse effect on our results of operations.

We
    rely on our proprietary technology as well as software and other
    intellectual property rights licensed to us by third parties,
    and we cannot assure you that the precautions taken to protect
    our rights will be adequate or that we will continue to be able
    to adequately secure such intellectual property rights from
    third parties.

Our success depends, in part, upon our proprietary technology.
    We generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade
    secret laws, licenses and restrictive agreements to establish
    and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products.
    Despite precautions we may take to protect our intellectual
    property, third parties have tried in the past, and may try in
    the future, to challenge, invalidate or circumvent these
    safeguards. The rights granted under our patents or attendant to
    our other intellectual property may not provide us with any
    competitive advantages and there is no guarantee that patents
    will be issued on any of our pending applications and future
    patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology.
    Furthermore, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our
    proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as
    applicable law protects these rights in the United States. Many
    of our products include software or other intellectual property
    licensed from third parties. We may have to seek new or renew
    existing licenses for such software and other intellectual
    property in the future. Our design and methodology services
    business holds licenses to certain software and other
    intellectual property owned by third parties, including that of
    our competitors. Our failure to obtain, for our use, software or
    other intellectual property licenses or other intellectual
    property rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in
    litigation over these licenses or rights, could seriously harm
    our business, operating results or financial condition.

We
    could lose key technology or suffer serious harm to our business
    because of the infringement of our intellectual property rights
    by third parties or because of our infringement of the
    intellectual property rights of third parties.

There are numerous patents in the EDA industry and new patents
    are being issued at a rapid rate. It is not always practicable
    to determine in advance whether a product or any of its
    components infringes the patent rights of others. As a result,
    from time to time, we may be compelled to respond to or
    prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to protect
    our rights or defend a customer’s rights. For example, on
    November 8, 2006, an individual filed suit against us,
    Magma Design Automation, Inc., Dynalith Systems, Inc., Altera
    Corp., Mentor Graphics Corp. and Aldec, Inc. in the United
    States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The
    suit alleges that certain products of Cadence and the other
    defendants infringe a patent for an electronic simulation and
    emulation system owned by the plaintiff. The plaintiff seeks
    unspecified damages and attorneys’ fees and costs. We
    dispute the plaintiff’s claims and intend to defend the
    lawsuit vigorously.

Intellectual property infringement claims, regardless of merit,
    could consume valuable management time, result in costly
    litigation, or cause product shipment delays, all of which could
    seriously harm our business, operating results or financial
    condition. In settling these claims, we may be required to enter
    into royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties
    claiming infringement. These royalty or licensing agreements, if
    available, may not have terms favorable to us. Being compelled
    to enter into a license agreement with unfavorable



terms could seriously harm our business, operating results or
    financial condition. Any potential intellectual property
    litigation could compel us to do one or more of the following:

•

Pay damages (including the potential for treble damages),
    license fees or royalties (including royalties for past periods)
    to the party claiming infringement;

•

Stop licensing products or providing services that use the
    challenged intellectual property;

•

Obtain a license from the owner of the infringed intellectual
    property to sell or use the relevant technology, which license
    may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all; or

•

Redesign the challenged technology, which could be
    time-consuming and costly, or not be accomplished.

If we were compelled to take any of these actions, our business
    or results of operations may suffer.

If our
    security measures are breached and an unauthorized party obtains
    access to customer data, our information systems may be
    perceived as being unsecure and customers may curtail or stop
    their use of our products and services.

Our products and services involve the storage and transmission
    of customers’ proprietary information, and breaches of our
    security measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of
    this information, litigation and potential liability. Because
    techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage
    information systems change frequently and generally are not
    recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to
    anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive
    measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security
    occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our
    security measures could be harmed and we could lose existing
    customers and our ability to obtain new customers.

We may
    not be able to effectively implement our restructuring
    activities, and our restructuring activities may not result in
    the expected benefits, which would negatively impact our future
    results of operations.

The EDA market and the commercial electronics design and
    methodology services industries are highly competitive and
    change quickly. We have responded to increased competition and
    changes in the industries in which we compete, in part, by
    restructuring our operations and at times reducing the size of
    our workforce. Despite our restructuring efforts in prior years,
    we may not achieve all of the operating expense reductions and
    improvements in operating margins and cash flows anticipated
    from those restructuring activities in the periods contemplated.
    Our inability to realize these benefits may result in an
    inefficient business structure that could negatively impact our
    results of operations.

As part of our restructuring activities in prior years, we have
    reduced the workforce in certain revenue-generating portions of
    our business. These reductions in staffing levels could require
    us to forego certain future opportunities due to resource
    limitations, which could negatively affect our long-term
    revenues.

We cannot assure you that we will not be required to implement
    further restructuring activities or reductions in our workforce
    based on changes in the markets and industries in which we
    compete or that any future restructuring efforts will be
    successful.

The
    long sales cycle of our products and services makes the timing
    of our revenue difficult to predict and may cause our operating
    results to fluctuate unexpectedly.

We have a long sales cycle that generally extends at least three
    to six months. The length of the sales cycle may cause our
    revenue or operating results to vary from quarter to quarter.
    The complexity and expense associated with our business
    generally require a lengthy customer education, evaluation and
    approval process. Consequently, we may incur substantial
    expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to
    develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements
    or revenue and may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities.



In addition, sales of our products and services may be delayed
    if customers delay approval or commencement of projects because
    of:

•

The timing of customers’ competitive evaluation
    processes; or

•

Customers’ budgetary constraints and budget cycles.

Long sales cycles for acceleration and emulation hardware
    products subject us to a number of significant risks over which
    we have limited control, including insufficient, excess or
    obsolete inventory, variations in inventory valuation and
    fluctuations in quarterly operating results.

Also, because of the timing of large orders and our
    customers’ buying patterns, we may not learn of bookings
    shortfalls, revenue shortfalls, earnings shortfalls or other
    failures to meet market expectations until late in a fiscal
    quarter. These factors may cause our operating results to
    fluctuate unexpectedly.

The
    effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and other risks to
    our international operations may seriously harm our financial
    condition.

We have significant operations outside the United States. Our
    revenue from international operations as a percentage of total
    revenue was approximately 48% in 2006, 54% in 2005 and 50% in
    2004. We expect that revenue from our international operations
    will continue to account for a significant portion of our total
    revenue. We also transact business in various foreign
    currencies. Recent economic and political uncertainty and the
    volatility of foreign currencies in certain regions, most
    notably the Japanese yen, European Union euro, British pound and
    Indian rupee have had, and may in the future have, a harmful
    effect on our revenue or operating results.

Fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the United States
    dollar and the currencies of other countries in which we conduct
    business could seriously harm our business, operating results or
    financial condition. For example, if there is an increase in the
    rate at which a foreign currency exchanges into United States
    dollars, it will take more of the foreign currency to equal the
    same amount of United States dollars than before the rate
    increase. If we price our products and services in the foreign
    currency, we will receive fewer United States dollars than we
    did before the rate increase went into effect. If we price our
    products and services in United States dollars, an increase in
    the exchange rate will result in an increase in the price for
    our products and services compared to those products of our
    competitors that are priced in local currency. This could result
    in our prices being uncompetitive in markets where business is
    transacted in the local currency.

Exposure to foreign currency transaction risk can arise when
    transactions are conducted in a currency different from the
    functional currency of one of our subsidiaries. A
    subsidiary’s functional currency is generally the currency
    in which it primarily conducts its operations, including product
    pricing, expenses and borrowings. Although we attempt to reduce
    the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, significant
    exchange rate movements may hurt our results of operations as
    expressed in United States dollars.

Our international operations may also be subject to other risks,
    including:

•

The adoption or expansion of government trade restrictions;

•

Limitations on repatriation of earnings;

•

Limitations on the conversion of foreign currencies;

•

Reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some
    countries;

•

Recessions in foreign economies;

•

Longer collection periods for receivables and greater difficulty
    in collecting accounts receivable;

•

Difficulties in managing foreign operations;

•

Political and economic instability;

•

Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;

•

Tariffs and other trade barriers; and

•

United States and other governments’ licensing requirements
    for exports, which may lengthen the sales cycle or restrict or
    prohibit the sale or licensing of certain products.

We have offices throughout the world, including key research and
    development facilities outside of the United States. Our
    operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations
    throughout the world. Activities that



interfere with our international connectivity, such as computer
    “hacking” or the introduction of a virus into our
    computer systems, could significantly interfere with our
    business operations.

Our
    operating results could be adversely affected as a result of
    changes in our effective tax rates.

Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by
    the following:

•

Earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we are
    taxed at lower rates as compared to the United States federal
    and state statutory tax rates;

•

An increase in expenses not deductible for tax purposes,
    including certain stock-based compensation, write-offs of
    acquired in-process research and development and impairment of
    goodwill;

•

Changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and
    liabilities;

•

Changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws;

•

New accounting standards or interpretations of such standards;

•

A change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest foreign
    earnings outside the United States; or

•

Results of tax examinations by the Internal Revenue Service, or
    IRS, and state and foreign tax authorities.

Any significant change in our future effective tax rates could
    adversely impact our results of operations for future periods.

We
    have received examination reports from the Internal Revenue
    Service proposing deficiencies in certain of our tax returns,
    and the outcome of current and future tax examinations may have
    a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash
    flows.

The IRS and other tax authorities regularly examine our income
    tax returns. In November 2003, the IRS completed its field
    examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years
    1997 through 1999 and issued a Revenue Agent’s Report, or
    RAR, in which the IRS proposes to assess an aggregate tax
    deficiency for the three-year period of approximately
    $143.0 million. The most significant of the disputed
    adjustments for the tax years 1997 through 1999 relates to
    transfer pricing arrangements that we have with a foreign
    subsidiary. We have filed a protest to certain of the proposed
    adjustments with the Appeals Office of the IRS where the matter
    is currently being considered.

In July 2006, the IRS completed its field examination of our
    federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2002
    and issued an RAR, in which the IRS proposes to assess an
    aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year period of
    approximately $324.0 million. In November 2006, the IRS
    revised the proposed aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year
    period to be approximately $318.0 million. The IRS is
    contesting our qualification for deferred recognition of certain
    proceeds received from restitution and settlement in connection
    with litigation during the period. The proposed tax deficiency
    for this item is approximately $152.0 million. The
    remaining proposed tax deficiency of approximately
    $166.0 million is primarily related to proposed adjustments
    to our transfer pricing arrangements that we have with foreign
    subsidiaries and to our deductions for foreign trade income. The
    IRS took similar positions with respect to our transfer pricing
    arrangements in the prior examination period and may make
    similar claims against our transfer pricing arrangements in
    future examinations. We have filed a timely protest with the IRS
    and will seek resolution of the issues through the Appeals
    Office of the IRS.

We believe that the proposed IRS adjustments are inconsistent
    with applicable tax laws and we are challenging these proposed
    adjustments vigorously. The RARs are not final Statutory Notices
    of Deficiency but the IRS imposes interest on the proposed
    deficiencies until the matters are resolved. Interest is
    compounded daily at rates published by the IRS, which rates are
    adjusted quarterly and have been between four and ten percent
    since 1997.

Significant judgment is required in determining our provision
    for income taxes. The calculation of our tax liabilities
    involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of
    complex tax regulations. In determining the adequacy of our
    provision for income taxes, we regularly assess the likelihood
    of adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations including
    the RARs for the tax years 1997 through 2002. We provide for tax
    liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets unless we
    consider it probable that additional taxes will not be due.
    However, the ultimate outcome of tax examinations, including the
    total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon
    resolution of these issues, cannot be predicted with certainty.
    In addition, we cannot assure you that such amount



will not be materially different than that which is reflected in
    our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Should the
    IRS or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result
    of a current or a future examination, we may be required to
    record charges to operations in future periods that could have a
    material impact on the results of operations, financial position
    or cash flows in the applicable period or periods.

Forecasting
    our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject
    to uncertainty, and material differences between forecasted and
    actual tax rates could have a material impact on our results of
    operations.

Forecasts of our income tax position and resultant effective tax
    rate are complex and subject to uncertainty because our income
    tax position for each year combines the effects of a mix of
    profits and losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in tax
    jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates, as well as
    benefits from available deferred tax assets, the impact of
    various accounting rules and changes to these rules and costs
    resulting from tax audits. To forecast our global tax rate,
    pre-tax profits and losses by jurisdiction are estimated and tax
    expense by jurisdiction is calculated. If the mix of profits and
    losses, our ability to use tax credits, or effective tax rates
    by jurisdiction is different than those estimates, our actual
    tax rate could be materially different than forecasted, which
    could have a material impact on our results of operations.

Failure
    to obtain export licenses could harm our business by rendering
    us unable to ship products and transfer our technology outside
    of the United States.

We must comply with regulations of the United States Department
    of Commerce and of certain other countries in shipping our
    software products and transferring our technology outside the
    United States and to foreign nationals. Although we have not had
    any significant difficulty complying with such regulations so
    far, any significant future difficulty in complying could harm
    our business, operating results or financial condition.

Errors
    or defects in our products and services could expose us to
    liability and harm our reputation.

Our customers use our products and services in designing and
    developing products that involve a high degree of technological
    complexity, each of which has its own specifications. Because of
    the complexity of the systems and products with which we work,
    some of our products and designs can be adequately tested only
    when put to full use in the marketplace. As a result, our
    customers or their end users may discover errors or defects in
    our software or the systems we design, or the products or
    systems incorporating our design and intellectual property may
    not operate as expected. Errors or defects could result in:

•

Loss of customers;

•

Loss of market segment share;

•

Failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance;

•

Diversion of development resources to resolve the problem;

•

Loss of or delay in revenue;

•

Increased service costs; and

•

Liability for damages.

If we
    become subject to unfair hiring claims, we could be prevented
    from hiring needed employees, incur liability for damages and
    incur substantial costs in defending ourselves.

Companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with
    competitors frequently claim that these competitors have engaged
    in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these
    persons would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets.
    These claims could prevent us from hiring employees or cause us
    to incur liability for damages. We could also incur substantial
    costs in defending ourselves or our employees against these
    claims, regardless of their merits. Defending ourselves from
    these claims could also divert the attention of our management
    away from our operations.

Our
    business is subject to the risk of earthquakes, floods and other
    natural catastrophic events.

Our corporate headquarters, including certain of our research
    and development operations and certain of our distribution
    facilities, is located in the Silicon Valley area of Northern
    California, which is a region known to experience seismic
    activity. In addition, several of our facilities, including our
    corporate headquarters, certain of our



research and development operations, and certain of our
    distribution operations, are in areas of San Jose,
    California that have been identified by the Director of the
    Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, as being located
    in a special flood area. The areas at risk are identified as
    being in a one hundred year flood plain, using FEMA’s Flood
    Hazard Boundary Map or the Flood Insurance Rate Map. If
    significant seismic or flooding activity were to occur, our
    operations may be interrupted, which would adversely impact our
    business and results of operations.

We
    maintain research and development and other facilities in parts
    of the world that are not as politically stable as the United
    States, and as a result we may face a higher risk of business
    interruption from acts of war or terrorism than businesses
    located only or primarily in the United States.

We maintain international research and development and other
    facilities, some of which are in parts of the world that are not
    as politically stable as the United States. Consequently, we may
    face a greater risk of business interruption as a result of
    terrorist acts or military conflicts than businesses located
    domestically. Furthermore, this potential harm is exacerbated
    given that damage to or disruptions at our international
    research and development facilities could have an adverse effect
    on our ability to develop new or improve existing products as
    compared to other businesses which may only have sales offices
    or other less critical operations abroad. We are not insured for
    losses or interruptions caused by acts of war or terrorism.

Risks
    Related to Our Securities and Indebtedness

Our
    debt obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect
    our business, operating results or financial condition, and
    could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such
    indebtedness.

We have a substantial level of debt. As of December 30,
    2006, we had $758.4 million of outstanding indebtedness as
    follows:

•

$250.0 million related to our 1.375% Convertible
    Senior Notes due 2011, or the 2011 Notes;

•

$250.0 million related to our 1.500% Convertible
    Senior Notes due 2013, or the 2013 Notes and, together with the
    2011 Notes, the Convertible Senior Notes;

•

$230.4 million related to our Zero Coupon Zero Yield Senior
    Convertible Notes due 2023, or 2023 Notes; and

•

$28.0 million related to the term loan incurred by our
    wholly-owned Irish subsidiary Castlewilder, or the Term Loan,
    which we have guaranteed.

The level of our indebtedness, among other things, could:

•

Make it difficult for us to satisfy our payment obligations on
    our debt as described below;

•

Make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our
    business;

•

Reduce funds available for use in our operations;

•

Make it difficult for us to incur additional debt or obtain any
    necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital
    expenditures, debt service, acquisitions or general corporate
    purposes;

•

Limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in
    our business;

•

Make us more vulnerable in the event of an increase in interest
    rates if we must incur new debt to satisfy our obligations under
    the Convertible Senior Notes, the 2023 Notes or the Term
    Loan; or

•

Place us at a possible competitive disadvantage relative to less
    leveraged competitors and competitors that have greater access
    to capital resources.

If we experience a decline in revenue due to any of the factors
    described in this section entitled “Risk Factors,” or
    otherwise, we could have difficulty paying amounts due on our
    indebtedness. In the case of the 2023 Notes, although they
    mature in 2023, the holders of the 2023 Notes may require us to
    repurchase for cash all or any portion of the 2023 Notes on
    August 15, 2008 for 100.25% of the principal amount,
    August 15, 2013 for 100.00% of the principal amount and
    August 15, 2018 for 100.00% of the principal amount. As a
    result, although the 2023 Notes mature in 2023, the holders may
    require us to repurchase the 2023 Notes at an additional premium
    in 2008, which makes it probable that we will be required to
    repurchase the 2023 Notes in 2008 if they have not first been
    repurchased by us or are not otherwise converted.



If we are prohibited from paying our outstanding indebtedness,
    we could try to obtain the consent of the lenders under those
    arrangements to make such payment, or we could attempt to
    refinance the borrowings that contain the restrictions. If we do
    not obtain the necessary consents or refinance the borrowings,
    we may be unable to satisfy our outstanding indebtedness. Any
    such failure would constitute an event of default under our
    indebtedness, which could, in turn, constitute a default under
    the terms of any other indebtedness then outstanding.

If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise
    obtain funds necessary to make required payments, or if we fail
    to comply with the various requirements of our indebtedness, we
    would be in default, which would permit the holders of our
    indebtedness to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness and
    could cause defaults under our other indebtedness as well. Any
    default under our indebtedness could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, operating results and financial
    condition. In addition, a material default on our indebtedness
    could suspend our eligibility to register securities using
    certain registration statement forms under SEC guidelines that
    permit incorporation by reference of substantial information
    regarding us, which could potentially hinder our ability to
    raise capital through the issuance of our securities and will
    increase the costs of such registration to us.

Conversion
    of the 2023 Notes or the Convertible Senior Notes will dilute
    the ownership interests of existing stockholders.

The terms of the 2023 Notes and the Convertible Senior Notes
    permit the holders to convert the 2023 Notes and the Convertible
    Senior Notes into shares of our common stock. The 2023 Notes are
    convertible into our common stock initially at a conversion
    price of $15.65 per share, which would result in an
    aggregate of approximately 14.7 million shares of our
    common stock being issued upon conversion, subject to adjustment
    upon the occurrence of specified events. The terms of the
    Convertible Senior Notes stipulate a net share settlement, which
    upon conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes requires us to
    pay the principal amount in cash and the conversion premium, if
    any, in shares of our common stock based on a daily settlement
    amount, calculated on a proportionate basis for each day of the
    relevant 20

trading-day

observation period. The initial conversion rate for the
    Convertible Senior Notes is 47.2813 shares of our common
    stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes,
    equivalent to a conversion price of approximately
    $21.15 per share of our common stock. The conversion price
    is subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted
    for accrued interest, except in limited circumstances. The
    conversion of some or all of the 2023 Notes or the Convertible
    Senior Notes will dilute the ownership interest of our existing
    stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the common stock
    issuable upon conversion could adversely affect prevailing
    market prices of our common stock.

Prior to the conversion of the 2023 Notes, if the trading price
    of our common stock exceeds $22.69 per share over specified
    periods, basic net income per share will be diluted. We may
    redeem for cash all or any part of the 2023 Notes on or after
    August 15, 2008 for 100.00% of the principal amount. The
    holders of the 2023 Notes may require us to repurchase for cash
    all or any portion of their 2023 Notes on August 15, 2008
    for 100.25% of the principal amount, on August 15, 2013 for
    100.00% of the principal amount, or on August 15, 2018 for
    100.00% of the principal amount, by providing to the paying
    agent a written repurchase notice. The repurchase notice must be
    delivered during the period commencing 30 business days prior to
    the relevant repurchase date and ending on the close of business
    on the business day prior to the relevant repurchase date. We
    may redeem for cash all or any part of the 2023 Notes on or
    after August 15, 2008 for 100.00% of the principal amount,
    except for those 2023 Notes that holders have required us to
    repurchase on August 15, 2008 or on other repurchase dates,
    as described above.

Each $1,000 of principal of the 2023 Notes is initially
    convertible into 63.879 shares of our common stock, subject to
    adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders of
    the 2023 Notes may convert their 2023 Notes prior to maturity
    only if:

•

The price of our common stock reaches $22.69 during certain
    periods of time specified in the 2023 Notes;

•

Specified corporate transactions occur;

•

The 2023 Notes have been called for redemption; or

•

The trading price of the 2023 Notes falls below a certain
    threshold.

As a result, although the 2023 Notes mature in 2023, the holders
    may require us to repurchase their notes at an additional
    premium in 2008, which makes it probable that we will be
    required to repurchase the 2023 Notes in 2008



if they have not first been repurchased by us or are not
    otherwise converted. As of December 30, 2006, none of the
    conditions allowing holders of the 2023 Notes to convert had
    been met.

Each $1,000 of principal of the Convertible Senior Notes is
    initially convertible into 47.2813 shares of our common
    stock, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified
    events. Holders of the Convertible Senior Notes may convert
    their notes at their option on any day prior to the close of
    business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding
    December 15, 2011 in the case of the 2011 Notes and
    December 15, 2013 in the case of the 2013 Notes, in each
    case only if:

•

The price of our common stock reaches $27.50 during certain
    periods of time specified in the Convertible Senior Notes;

•

Specified corporate transactions occur; or

•

The trading price of the Convertible Senior Notes falls below a
    certain threshold.

On and after November 2, 2011, in the case of the 2011
    Notes, and November 1, 2013, in the case of 2013 Notes,
    until the close of business on the scheduled trading day
    immediately preceding the maturity date of such Convertible
    Senior Notes, holders may convert their Convertible Senior Notes
    at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. As of
    December 30, 2006, none of the conditions allowing holders
    of the Convertible Senior Notes to convert had been met.

Although the conversion price of the 2023 Notes is currently
    $15.65 per share, the hedge and warrant transactions that
    we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2023
    Notes effectively increased the conversion price of the 2023
    Notes until various dates in 2008 to approximately
    $23.08 per share, which would result in an aggregate
    issuance upon conversion prior to August 15, 2008 of
    approximately 10.2 million shares of our common stock. We
    entered into hedge and warrant transactions to reduce the
    potential dilution from the conversion of the 2023 Notes;
    however, we cannot guarantee that such hedge and warrant
    instruments will fully mitigate the dilution. In addition, the
    existence of the 2023 Notes may encourage short selling by
    market participants because the conversion of the 2023 Notes
    could depress the price of our common stock.

Although the conversion price of the Convertible Senior Notes is
    currently $21.15 per share, we entered into hedge and separate
    warrant transactions to reduce the potential dilution from the
    conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes. However, we cannot
    guarantee that such hedges and warrant instruments will fully
    mitigate the dilution. In addition, the existence of the
    Convertible Senior Notes may encourage short selling by market
    participants because the conversion of the Convertible Senior
    Notes could depress the price of our common stock.

At the
    option of the 2023 Noteholders and the Convertible Senior
    Noteholders under certain circumstances, we may be required to
    repurchase the 2023 Notes and the Convertible Senior Notes, as
    the case may be, in cash or shares of our common
    stock.

Under the terms of the 2023 Notes and the Convertible Senior
    Notes, we may be required to repurchase the 2023 Notes and the
    Convertible Senior Notes following a “fundamental
    change” in our corporate ownership or structure, such as a
    change of control in which substantially all of the
    consideration does not consist of publicly traded securities,
    prior to maturity of the 2023 Notes and the Convertible Senior
    Notes, as the case may be. Following a fundamental change, in
    certain circumstances, we may choose to pay the repurchase price
    of the 2023 Notes in cash, shares of our common stock or a
    combination of cash and shares of our common stock. If we choose
    to pay all or any part of the repurchase price of the 2023 Notes
    in shares of our common stock, this would result in dilution to
    the holders of our common stock. The repurchase price for the
    Convertible Senior Notes in the event of a fundamental change
    must be paid solely in cash. These repayment obligations may
    have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a
    takeover of our company that may otherwise be beneficial to
    investors.

Hedge
    and warrant transactions entered into in connection with the
    issuance of the Convertible Senior

Notes and the 2023 Notes may
    affect the value of our common stock.

We entered into hedge transactions with various financial
    institutions, at the time of issuance of the Convertible Senior
    Notes and the 2023 Notes, with the objective of reducing the
    potential dilutive effect of issuing our common stock upon
    conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes and the 2023 Notes.
    We also entered into separate warrant transactions with the same
    financial institutions. In connection with our hedge and warrant
    transactions, these



financial institutions purchased our common stock in secondary
    market transactions and entered into various

over-the-counter

derivative transactions with respect to our common stock. These
    entities or their affiliates are likely to modify their hedge
    positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of
    the Convertible Senior Notes and the 2023 Notes by purchasing
    and selling shares of our common stock, other of our securities
    or other instruments they may wish to use in connection with
    such hedging. Any of these transactions and activities could
    adversely affect the value of our common stock and, as a result,
    the number of shares and the value of the common stock holders
    will receive upon conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes and
    the 2023 Notes. In addition, subject to movement in the price of
    our common stock, if the hedge transactions settle in our favor,
    we could be exposed to credit risk related to the other party
    with respect to the payment we are owed from such other party.

Rating
    agencies may provide unsolicited ratings on the Convertible
    Senior Notes that could reduce the market value or liquidity of
    our common stock.

We have not requested a rating of the Convertible Senior Notes
    from any rating agency and we do not anticipate that the
    Convertible Senior Notes will be rated. However, if one or more
    rating agencies independently elects to rate the Convertible
    Senior Notes and assigns the Convertible Senior Notes a rating
    lower than the rating expected by investors, or reduces such
    rating in the future, the market price or liquidity of the
    Convertible Senior Notes and our common stock could be harmed.
    Should a decline in the market price of the Convertible Senior
    Notes result, as compared to the price of our common stock, this
    may trigger the right of the holders of the Convertible Senior
    Notes to convert the Convertible Senior Notes into cash and
    shares of our common stock.

Anti-takeover
    defenses in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and
    certain provisions under Delaware law could prevent an
    acquisition of our company or limit the price that investors
    might be willing to pay for our common stock.

Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain
    provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law that apply to
    us could make it difficult for another company to acquire
    control of our company. For example:

•

Our certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors
    to issue, at any time and without stockholder approval,
    preferred stock with such terms as it may determine. No shares
    of preferred stock are currently outstanding. However, the
    rights of holders of any of our preferred stock that may be
    issued in the future may be superior to the rights of holders of
    our common stock.

•

Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law
    generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any
    business combination with a person owning 15% or more of its
    voting stock, or who is affiliated with the corporation and
    owned 15% or more of its voting stock at any time within three
    years prior to the proposed business combination, for a period
    of three years from the date the person became a 15% owner,
    unless specified conditions are met.

All or any one of these factors could limit the price that
    certain investors would be willing to pay for shares of our
    common stock and could delay, prevent or allow our board of
    directors to resist an acquisition of our company, even if a
    proposed transaction were favored by a majority of our
    independent stockholders.

Item 2.
    Properties

Our headquarters is located in San Jose, California, and we
    own the related land and buildings. We also own buildings in
    India. As of December 30, 2006, the total square footage of
    our owned buildings was approximately 925,000.

In January 2007, we completed the sale of certain of our land
    and buildings in San Jose, California, representing 262,500
    of our square footage owned as of December 30, 2006.
    Concurrently with the sale, we leased back from the purchaser
    all available space in the buildings. The lease agreement
    includes an initial term of two years, with two options to
    extend the lease for six months each.



We lease additional facilities for our sales offices in the
    United States and various foreign countries, and for our
    research and development and design and methodology services
    facilities worldwide. We sublease certain of these facilities
    where space is not fully utilized or has been involved in
    restructuring activities.

We believe that these facilities and the undeveloped land we own
    adjacent to our current headquarters are adequate for our
    current needs and that suitable additional or substitute space
    will be available as needed to accommodate any expansion of our
    operations.

Item 3.
    Legal Proceedings

From time to time, we are involved in various disputes and
    litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of
    business. These include disputes and lawsuits related to
    intellectual property, mergers and acquisitions, licensing,
    contract law, distribution arrangements and employee relations
    matters. Periodically, we review the status of each significant
    matter and assess its potential financial exposure. If the
    potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered
    probable and the amount or the range of loss can be estimated,
    we accrue a liability for the estimated loss in accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or
    SFAS, No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies.”
    Legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties, and the outcomes
    are difficult to predict. Because of such uncertainties,
    accruals are based only on the best information available at the
    time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess
    the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation
    matters and may revise estimates.

On November 8, 2006, an individual filed suit against us,
    Magma Design Automation, Inc., Dynalith Systems, Inc., Altera
    Corp., Mentor Graphics Corp. and Aldec, Inc. in the United
    States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The
    suit alleges that certain products of Cadence and the other
    defendants infringe a patent for an electronic simulation and
    emulation system owned by the plaintiff. The plaintiff seeks
    unspecified damages and attorneys’ fees and costs. We
    dispute the plaintiff’s claims and intend to defend the
    lawsuit vigorously.

While the outcome of these disputes and litigation matters
    cannot be predicted with any certainty, management does not
    believe that the outcome of any current matters will have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position
    or results of operations.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with
    the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included
    elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Certain of such statements, including, without limitation,
    statements regarding the extent and timing of future revenues
    and expenses and customer demand, statements regarding the
    deployment of our products, statements regarding our reliance on
    third parties and other statements using words such as
    “anticipates,” “believes,”
    “could,” “estimates,” “expects,”
    “intends,” “may,” “plans,”
    “should,” “will” and “would,” and
    words of similar import and the negatives thereof, constitute
    forward-looking statements. These statements are predictions
    based upon our current expectations about future events. Actual
    results could vary materially as a result of certain factors,
    including but not limited to, those expressed in these
    statements. We refer you to the “Competition,”
    “Proprietary Technology,” “Risk Factors,”
    “Results of Operations,” “Disclosures About
    Market Risk” and “Liquidity and Capital
    Resources” sections contained in this Annual Report and the
    risks discussed in our other SEC filings, which identify
    important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual
    results to differ materially from those contained in the
    forward-looking statements.

We urge you to consider these factors carefully in evaluating
    the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report.
    All subsequent written or spoken forward-looking statements
    attributable to our company or persons acting on our behalf are
    expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary
    statements. The forward-looking statements included in this
    Annual Report are made only as of the date of this Annual
    Report. We do not intend, and undertake no obligation, to update
    these forward-looking statements.

Overview

We develop electronic design automation, or EDA, software and
    hardware. We license software, sell or lease hardware
    technology, provide maintenance for our software and hardware
    and provide design and methodology services throughout the world
    to help manage and accelerate electronics product development
    processes. Our broad range of products and services are used by
    the world’s leading electronics companies to design and
    develop complex integrated circuits, or ICs, and personal and
    commercial electronics systems.



With the addition of emerging nanometer design considerations to
    the already burgeoning set of traditional design tasks, complex
    SoC or IC design can no longer be accomplished using a
    collection of discrete design tools. What previously consisted
    of sequential design activities must be merged and accomplished
    nearly simultaneously without time-consuming data translation
    steps. We combine our design technologies into
    “platforms” for four major design activities:
    functional verification, digital IC design, custom IC design and
    system interconnect. The four Cadence design platforms are
    Incisive functional verification, Encounter digital IC design,
    Virtuoso custom design and Allegro system interconnect
    platforms. In addition, we augment these platform product
    offerings with a comprehensive set of DFM products that service
    both the digital and custom IC design flows. These four
    platforms, together with our DFM products, comprise our primary
    product lines.

Functional verification was the fastest growing product group of
    our business in 2006, driven by our Incisive verification
    solutions. We offer a complete solution for verification
    management from planning to closure. During 2006, we also
    introduced a significant upgrade of our Virtuoso platform. An
    early adopter program for this platform helped stimulate demand.
    This release is the most significant upgrade to the custom
    product line in many years. Finally, in late 2006 we introduced
    the Logic Design Team solution, which combines technology from
    our Incisive verification and Encounter digital design platforms
    to create an integrated, front-end environment for logic
    designers.

We have identified certain items that management uses as
    performance indicators to manage our business, including
    revenue, certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow
    from operations, and we describe these items more fully below
    under the heading “Results of Operations” below.

Critical
    Accounting Estimates

In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we make
    assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant
    impact on our revenue, operating income and net income, as well
    as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. We base our assumptions, judgments
    and estimates on historical experience and various other factors
    that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual
    results could differ materially from these estimates under
    different assumptions or conditions. At least quarterly, we
    evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates and make
    changes accordingly. We believe that the assumptions, judgments
    and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue
    recognition, accounting for income taxes, restructuring charges
    and valuation of stock-based awards have the greatest potential
    impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements; therefore, we
    consider these to be our critical accounting estimates.
    Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative
    to our critical accounting estimates have not differed
    materially from actual results. For further information on our
    significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to our
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue
    recognition

We apply the provisions of Statement of Position, or SOP,

97-2,

“Software Revenue Recognition,” as amended by

SOP 98-9,

“Modification of

SOP 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain
    Transactions,” to all product revenue transactions where
    the software is not incidental. We also apply the provisions of
    SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for Leases,” to all
    hardware lease transactions. We recognize revenue when
    persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has
    been delivered, the fee is fixed or determinable, collection of
    the resulting receivable is probable, and vendor-specific
    objective evidence of fair value, or VSOE, exists.

We license software using three different license types:

•

Subscription licenses;

•

Term licenses; and

•

Perpetual licenses.

Subscription licenses

– Our subscription
    license arrangements offer our customers the right to:

•

Access and use all software products delivered at the outset of
    an arrangement throughout the entire term of the arrangement,
    generally two to three years, with no rights to return;



•

Use unspecified additional software products that become
    commercially available during the term of the
    arrangement; and

•

Remix among the software products delivered at the outset of the
    arrangement, as well as the right to remix into other
    unspecified additional software products that may become
    available during the term of the arrangement, so long as the
    cumulative value of all products in use does not exceed the
    total license fee determined at the outset of the arrangement.
    These remix rights may be exercisable multiple times during the
    term of the arrangement. The right to remix all software
    products delivered pursuant to the license agreement is not
    considered an exchange or return of software because all
    software products have been delivered and the customer has the
    continuing right to use them.

In general, revenue associated with subscription licenses is
    recognized ratably over the term of the license commencing upon
    the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery
    of the software product. Subscription license revenue is
    allocated to product and maintenance revenue. The allocation to
    maintenance revenue is based on vendor specific objective
    evidence, or VSOE, of fair value of the undelivered maintenance
    that was established in connection with the sale of our term
    licenses.

Term licenses

– Our term license arrangements
    offer our customers the right to:

•

Access and use all software products delivered at the outset of
    an arrangement throughout the entire term of the arrangement,
    generally two to three years, with no rights to return; and

•

Remix among the software products delivered at the outset of the
    arrangement, so long as the cumulative value of all products in
    use does not exceed the total license fee determined at the
    outset of the arrangement. These remix rights may be exercisable
    multiple times during the term of the arrangement.

The right to remix all software products delivered pursuant to
    the license agreement is not considered an exchange or return of
    software because all software products have been delivered and
    the customer has the continuing right to use them. In general,
    revenue associated with term licenses is recognized upon the
    later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of
    the software product.

Perpetual licenses

– Our perpetual licenses
    consist of software licensed on a perpetual basis with no right
    to return or exchange the licensed software. In general, revenue
    associated with perpetual licenses is recognized upon the later
    of the effective date of the license or delivery of the licensed
    product.

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement

–
    Generally, we use a contract signed by the customer as evidence
    of an arrangement for subscription and term licenses and
    hardware leases. If a contract signed by the customer does not
    exist, we have historically used a purchase order as evidence of
    an arrangement for perpetual licenses, hardware sales,
    maintenance renewals and small fixed-price service projects,
    such as training classes and small methodology service
    engagements of approximately $10,000 or less. For all other
    service engagements, we use a signed professional services
    agreement and a statement of work to evidence an arrangement. In
    cases where both a signed contract and a purchase order exist,
    we consider the signed contract to be the most persuasive
    evidence of the arrangement. Sales through our distributors are
    evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship,
    together with binding purchase orders from the distributor on a

transaction-by-transaction

basis.

Product delivery

– Software and the
    corresponding access keys are generally delivered to customers
    electronically. Electronic delivery occurs when we provide the
    customer access to the software. Occasionally, we will deliver
    the software on a compact disc with standard transfer terms of

free-on-board,

or F.O.B., shipping point. Our software license agreements
    generally do not contain conditions for acceptance. With respect
    to hardware, delivery of an entire system is deemed to occur
    upon its successful installation. For certain hardware products,
    installation is the responsibility of the customer, as the
    system is fully functional at the time of shipment. For these
    products, delivery is deemed to be complete when the products
    are shipped with freight terms of F.O.B. shipping point.

Fee is fixed or determinable

– We assess
    whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the
    arrangement, primarily based on the payment terms associated
    with the transaction. We have established a history of
    collecting under the original contract without providing
    concessions on payments, products or services. For our
    installment contracts that do not include a substantial up front
    payment, we may only determine that a fee is fixed or
    determinable if the arrangement has payment periods that are
    equal to or less than the term of the licenses and the



payments are collected in equal or nearly equal installments,
    when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement.

Significant judgment is involved in assessing whether a fee is
    fixed or determinable. We must also make these judgments when
    assessing whether a contract amendment to a term arrangement
    (primarily in the context of a license extension or renewal)
    constitutes a concession. Our experience has been that we are
    able to determine whether a fee is fixed or determinable for
    term licenses. While we do not expect that experience to change,
    if we no longer were to have a history of collecting under the
    original contract without providing concessions on term
    licenses, revenue from term licenses would be required to be
    recognized when payments under the installment contract become
    due and payable. Such a change could have a material impact on
    our results of operations.

Collection is probable

– We assess the
    probability of collecting from each customer at the outset of
    the arrangement based on a number of factors, including the
    customer’s payment history and its current
    creditworthiness. We have concluded that collection is not
    probable for license arrangements executed with customers in
    certain countries. If in our judgment collection of a fee is not
    probable, we defer the revenue until the uncertainty is removed,
    which generally means revenue is recognized upon our receipt of
    cash payment. Our experience has been that we are able to
    estimate whether collection is probable. While we do not expect
    that experience to change, if we were to determine that
    collection is not probable for any license arrangement,
    particularly those with installment payment terms, revenue from
    such license would be recognized generally upon the receipt of
    cash payment. Such a change could have a material impact on our
    results of operations.

Vendor-specific objective evidence of fair
    value

– Our VSOE for certain product elements of
    an arrangement is based upon the pricing in comparable
    transactions when the element is sold separately. VSOE for
    maintenance is generally based upon the customer’s stated
    annual renewal rates. VSOE for services is generally based on
    the price charged when the services are sold separately. For
    multiple element arrangements, VSOE must exist to allocate the
    total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of a term
    or perpetual license arrangement. If VSOE does not exist for all
    elements to support the allocation of the total fee among all
    delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement, revenue
    is deferred until such evidence does exist for the undelivered
    elements, or until all elements are delivered, whichever is
    earlier. If VSOE of all undelivered elements exists but VSOE
    does not exist for one or more delivered elements, revenue is
    recognized using the residual method. Under the residual method,
    the VSOE of the undelivered elements is deferred, and the
    remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as
    revenue as the elements are delivered. Our experience has been
    that we are able to estimate VSOE.

Finance fee revenue

– Finance fees result from
    discounting to present value the product revenue derived from
    our installment contracts in which the payment terms extend
    beyond one year from the effective date of the contract. Finance
    fees are recognized using a method that approximates the
    effective interest method over the relevant license term and are
    classified as product revenue. Finance fee revenue represented
    approximately 2% of total revenue for each of the years ended
    December 30, 2006, December 31, 2005 and
    January 1, 2005. Upon the sale of an installment contract,
    we recognize the remaining finance fee revenue associated with
    the installment contract.

Services revenue

– Services revenue consists
    primarily of revenue received for performing design and
    methodology services. These services are not related to the
    functionality of the products licensed. Revenue from service
    contracts is recognized either on the time and materials method,
    as work is performed, or on the

percentage-of-completion

method. For contracts with fixed or

not-to-exceed

fees, we estimate on a monthly basis the

percentage-of-completion,

which is based on the completion of milestones relating to the
    arrangement. We have a history of accurately estimating project
    status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of
    internal and external factors can affect our estimates,
    including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and
    specification and testing requirement changes. If different
    conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could
    not be made, then the use of the completed contract method would
    be required and the recognition of all revenue and costs would
    be deferred until the project was completed. Such a change could
    have a material impact on our results of operations.



Accounting
    for income taxes

We provide for the effect of income taxes in our Consolidated
    Financial Statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
    “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Under
    SFAS No. 109, income tax expense (benefit) is
    recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the
    current year, and for deferred tax assets and liabilities for
    the tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an
    entity’s financial statements or tax returns.

We must make significant assumptions, judgments and estimates to
    determine our current provision for income taxes, our deferred
    tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be
    recorded against our deferred tax assets. Our judgments,
    assumptions and estimates relating to the current provision for
    income taxes take into account current tax laws, our
    interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of
    current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax
    authorities. Changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax
    laws and developments in current and future tax audits could
    significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in
    our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Our
    assumptions, judgments and estimates relating to the value of
    our net deferred tax assets take into account predictions of the
    amount and category of future taxable income from potential
    sources including tax planning strategies that would, if
    necessary, be implemented to prevent a loss carryforward or tax
    credit carryforward from expiring unused. Actual operating
    results and the underlying amount and category of income in
    future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and
    estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate, thus
    materially affecting our consolidated financial position or
    results of operations.

Restructuring
    charges

We account for restructuring charges in accordance with SEC
    Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100, “Restructuring
    and Impairment Charges,” as amended. From fiscal 2001
    through fiscal 2005, we undertook significant restructuring
    initiatives. All restructuring activities initiated prior to
    fiscal 2003 were accounted for in accordance with Emerging
    Issues Task Force, or EITF,

No. 94-3,

“Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination
    Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain
    Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)” and EITF

No. 88-10,

“Costs Associated with Lease Modifications or
    Terminations.” For restructuring activities initiated after
    fiscal 2002, we accounted for the leased facilities in
    accordance with SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for
    Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.” In
    addition, for all periods presented, we accounted for the
    asset-related portions of these restructurings in accordance
    with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment
    or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” For all periods
    presented, the severance and benefits charges were accounted for
    in accordance with SFAS No. 112, “Employers’
    Accounting for Postemployment Benefits – An Amendment
    of FASB Statements No. 5 and 43.”

These restructuring initiatives have required us to make a
    number of estimates and assumptions related to losses on excess
    facilities vacated or consolidated, particularly estimating
    when, if at all, we will be able to sublet vacated facilities
    and, if we do, the sublease terms. Closure and space reduction
    costs that are part of our restructuring charges include
    payments required under leases, less any applicable estimated
    sublease income after the facilities are abandoned, lease buyout
    costs and certain contractual costs to maintain facilities
    during the abandonment period.

We regularly evaluate the adequacy of our restructuring accrual,
    and adjust the balance based on changes in estimates and
    assumptions. We may incur future charges for new restructuring
    activities as well as changes in estimates to amounts previously
    recorded.

Valuation
    of stock-based awards

We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with the
    fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R,
    “Share-Based Payment.” Under SFAS No. 123R,
    stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date
    based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense
    over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of
    stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment,
    including estimating the expected volatility of our stock, the
    expected term of stock options, the risk-free interest rate for
    the period, expected dividends and expected forfeitures. The
    computation of the expected volatility assumption used in the
    Black-Scholes pricing model for option grants is based on
    implied volatility calculated using an average of the volatility
    of publicly traded



options for our common stock and our 2023 Notes. We use this
    approach to determine volatility because options for our common
    stock are actively traded, the market prices of both the traded
    options and underlying shares are measured at a similar point in
    time to each other and on a date reasonably close to the grant
    date of the employee stock options, the traded options have
    exercise prices that are both

near-the-money

and close to the exercise price of the employee stock options,
    and the remaining maturities of the traded options on which the
    estimate is based are at least one year. When establishing the
    expected life assumption, we review annual historical employee
    exercise behavior with respect to option grants having similar
    vesting periods. In addition, judgment is also required in
    estimating the amount of stock-based awards that we expect to be
    forfeited. We calculate a separate expected forfeiture rate for
    both stock options and restricted stock issuances based on
    historical trends. The valuation of all options and the expected
    forfeiture rates for options and restricted stock are calculated
    based on one employee pool as there is no significant difference
    in exercise behavior between classes of employees. If actual
    results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based
    compensation expense and our results of operations could be
    materially affected.

Results
    of Operations

We primarily generate revenue from licensing our EDA software,
    selling or leasing our hardware technology, providing
    maintenance for our software and hardware and providing design
    and methodology services. We principally utilize three license
    types: subscription, term and perpetual. The different license
    types provide a customer with different terms of use for our
    products, such as:

•

The right to access new technology;

•

The duration of the license; and

•

Payment terms.

Customer decisions regarding these aspects of license
    transactions determine the license type, timing of revenue
    recognition and potential future business activity. For example,
    if a customer chooses a fixed term of use, this will result in
    either a subscription or term license. A business implication of
    this decision is that, at the expiration of the license period,
    the customer must decide whether to continue using the
    technology and therefore renew the license agreement. Because
    larger customers generally use products from two or more of our
    five product groups, rarely will a large customer completely
    terminate its relationship with us at expiration of the license.
    See the discussion under the heading “Critical Accounting
    Estimates” above for  an additional description of license
    types and timing of revenue recognition.

A substantial portion of our revenue is recognized over multiple
    periods. As a result, we do not believe that pricing volatility
    has been a material component of the change in our revenue from
    period to period.

The amount of revenue recognized in future periods will depend
    on, among other things, the terms and timing of our contract
    renewals or additional product sales with existing customers,
    the size of such transactions and sales to new customers.

The value and duration of contracts, and consequently product
    revenue recognized, is affected by the competitiveness of our
    products. Product revenue recognized in any period is also
    affected by the extent to which customers purchase subscription,
    term or perpetual licenses, and the extent to which contracts
    contain flexible payment terms. The timing of revenue
    recognition is also affected by changes in the extent to which
    existing contracts contain flexible payment terms and by changes
    in contractual arrangements (e.g., subscription to term)
    with existing customers.

Revenue
    and Revenue Mix

We analyze our software and hardware businesses by product
    group, combining revenues for both product and maintenance
    because of their interrelationship. We have formulated a design
    solution strategy that combines our design technologies into
    “platforms,” which are included in the various product
    groups described below.

Our product groups are:

Functional Verification:

Products in this group,
    which include the Incisive functional verification platform, are
    used to verify that the high level, logical specification of an
    IC design is correct.



Digital IC Design:

Products in this group, which
    include the Encounter digital IC design platform, are used to
    accurately convert the high-level, logical specification of a
    digital IC into a detailed physical blueprint and then detailed
    design information showing how the IC will be physically
    implemented. This data is used for creation of the photomasks
    used in chip manufacture.

Custom IC Design:

Our custom design products, which
    include the Virtuoso custom design platform, are used for ICs
    that must be designed at the transistor level, including analog,
    radio frequency, memories, high performance digital blocks and
    standard cell libraries. Detailed design information showing how
    an IC will be physically implemented is used for creation of the
    photomasks used in chip manufacture.

System Interconnect:

This product group consists of
    our PCB and IC package design products, including the Allegro
    and OrCAD products. The Allegro system interconnect platform
    offering focuses on system interconnect design platform, which
    enables consistent co-design of ICs, IC packages and PCBs, while
    the OrCAD line focuses on cost-effective, entry-level PCB
    solutions.

Design for Manufacturing:

Included in this product
    group are our physical verification and analysis products. These
    products are used to analyze and verify that the physical
    blueprint of the integrated circuit has been constructed
    correctly and can be manufactured successfully.

Revenue
    by Year

The following table shows our revenue for the fiscal years 2006,
    2005 and 2004 and the percentage change in revenue between years:

    compared to 2005

Product revenue was higher in 2006, as compared to 2005,
    primarily because of increased revenue from licenses for
    Functional Verification and Custom IC Design products, partially
    offset by a small decrease in revenue from licenses for Design
    for Manufacturing products. Functional verification was the
    fastest growing platform in 2006. Services revenue increased in
    2006 as compared to 2005 due to an increase in utilization and
    realization rates for our services personnel.

    compared to 2004

Product revenue was higher in 2005, as compared to 2004,
    primarily because of increased revenue from licenses for Digital
    IC Design, Functional Verification and Custom IC products.
    Services revenue was lower in 2005, as compared to 2004, due to
    our reduced capacity to satisfy demand for our design services
    after having implemented certain restructuring activities.

As described under the heading “Critical Accounting
    Estimates” above, certain of our licenses allow customers
    the ability to remix among software products. Additionally, we
    have licensed a combination of our products to customers with
    the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be
    determined at a later date. For these arrangements, we estimate
    the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the
    expected usage of our products by these customers. The actual
    usage of our products by these customers may differ and
    therefore the revenue allocated in the above table may differ.

Although we believe the methodology of allocating revenue to
    product groups is reasonable, there can be no assurance that
    such allocated amounts reflect the amounts that would result had
    the customer individually licensed each specific software
    solution at the onset of the arrangement. However, during the
    term of the arrangement, we reevaluate the allocation of revenue
    based on actual deployment of our products.

The decrease in percentage of Services and other in 2005, as
    compared to 2004, is primarily due to $11.0 million of
    revenue recognized from the sale of IP in 2004. This sale of IP
    in 2004 is included in Services and other in the preceding table
    and in Product revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Income
    Statements.

The rate of revenue change varies geographically primarily due
    to differences in the timing and size of term licenses in those
    regions. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of total
    revenue in 2006, 2005 or 2004.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to
    fluctuations of the Japanese yen in relation to the United
    States dollar, caused our revenue to decrease by
    $12.0 million in 2006, as compared to 2005, and to decrease
    by $5.7 million in 2005, as compared to 2004. Additional
    information about revenue and other financial information by
    geography can be found in Note 21 to our Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Stock-based
    Compensation Expense Summary

We adopted SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006,
    which resulted in an increase in stock-based compensation
    expense of $64.1 million in 2006 as compared to 2005.

Cost of product includes costs associated with the sale or lease
    of our hardware and licensing of our software products. Cost of
    product primarily includes the cost of employee salary, benefits
    and other employee-related costs, including stock-based
    compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangibles
    directly related to Cadence products, the cost of technical
    documentation and royalties payable to third-party vendors. Cost
    of product associated with our hardware products also includes
    materials, assembly labor and overhead. These additional
    manufacturing costs make our cost of hardware product higher, as
    a percentage of revenue, than our cost of software product.

    compared to 2005

Cost of product decreased $12.9 million in 2006 as compared
    to 2005, primarily due to:

•

A decrease of $17.4 million in amortization of acquired
    intangibles due to the full amortization of certain acquired
    intangibles; partially offset by

•

An increase of $5.3 million in hardware costs attributable
    to increased hardware sales.

Cost of product depends primarily upon the extent to which we
    acquire intangible assets, acquire licenses and incorporate
    third-party technology in our products that are licensed or sold
    in any given period, and the actual mix of hardware and software
    product sales in any given period. Assuming no changes to our
    current portfolio of intangibles, we expect the Amortization of
    acquired intangibles component of Cost of product to continue
    decreasing as the amortization periods assigned upon the
    purchase of certain intangibles are completed.

Cost of services primarily includes employee salary, benefits
    and other employee-related costs, costs to maintain the
    infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization, and
    provisions for contract losses, if any. Cost of services
    increased $4.6 million in 2006 as compared to 2005
    primarily due to:

•

An increase of $3.4 million in stock-based compensation
    expense due to our adoption of SFAS No. 123R; and

•

An increase of $1.2 million in salary, benefits and other
    employee-related costs.

Cost of maintenance includes the cost of customer services, such
    as hot-line and

on-site

support, employee salary, benefits and other employee-related
    costs for certain employees, and documentation of maintenance
    updates. Cost of maintenance increased $4.0 million in 2006
    as compared to 2005 primarily due to:

•

An increase of $2.1 million in stock-based compensation due
    to our adoption of SFAS No. 123R; and

•

An increase of $1.0 million in salary, benefits and other
    employee-related costs.

    compared to 2004

Cost of product decreased $2.3 million in 2005, as compared
    to 2004, primarily due to:

•

A decrease of $13.5 million in the cost of hardware
    products sold as a result of sales of products with lower costs;
    partially offset by

•

An increase of $6.6 million in amortization of intangibles
    due to an increase in acquired intangibles associated with our
    acquisition of Verisity; and

•

An increase of $1.6 million in royalty expenses.

Cost of services increased $0.9 million in 2005, as
    compared to 2004, primarily due to:

•

An increase of $3.2 million in salary and benefits costs;
    partially offset by

•

A decrease of $1.5 million in other operating
    expenses; and

•

A decrease of $0.8 million in stock-based compensation.

Cost of maintenance increased $6.7 million in 2005, as
    compared to 2004, primarily due to:

•

An increase of $3.7 million in salary and benefit
    costs; and

•

An increase of $3.1 million in amortization of intangible
    assets.

Amortization
    of Acquired Intangibles




(In millions)

Amortization of acquired
    intangibles

$

$

$

55.7

Assuming no changes to our current portfolio of intangibles, we
    expect the Amortization of acquired intangibles to continue
    decreasing as the amortization periods assigned upon the
    purchase of certain intangibles are completed.

    compared to 2005

Amortization of acquired intangibles decreased
    $24.7 million in 2006, as compared to 2005. Amortization of
    acquired intangible assets from prior year acquisitions
    decreased $27.5 million during 2006 due to the full
    amortization of certain acquired intangibles. This decrease was
    partially offset by $2.8 million of amortization of
    intangibles acquired during 2006.

    compared to 2004

Amortization of acquired intangibles decreased $7.9 million
    in 2005, as compared to 2004. Amortization of acquired
    intangible assets from prior year acquisitions decreased
    $21.0 million during 2005 due to the full amortization of
    certain acquired intangibles. This decrease was partially offset
    by $13.1 million of amortization of intangibles acquired
    during 2005.

Restructuring
    and Other Charges

We initiated a separate plan of restructuring in each year from
    2001 through 2005 in an effort to operate more efficiently while
    improving operating margins and cash flows. The restructuring
    plans initiated each year from 2001 through 2005, or the 2001
    Restructuring, 2002 Restructuring, 2003 Restructuring, 2004
    Restructuring and 2005 Restructuring, respectively, were
    intended to decrease costs through workforce reductions and
    facility and resource consolidation, in order to improve our
    cost structure. The 2001 and 2002 Restructurings primarily
    related to our design services business and certain other
    business or infrastructure groups throughout the world. The 2003
    Restructuring, 2004 Restructuring and 2005 Restructuring were
    targeted at reducing costs throughout the company. The 2004
    Restructuring has been completed and there was no remaining
    balance accrued for this restructuring as of December 30,
    2006.

In addition, we have recorded estimated provisions for
    termination benefits and outplacement costs, long-term asset
    impairments, and other restructuring costs. Each reporting
    period, we evaluate the adequacy of the lease loss accrual for
    each plan of restructuring. We adjust the lease loss accrual for
    changes in real estate markets or other factors that may affect
    estimated costs or sublease income. We also consider executed
    sublease agreements and adjust the lease loss accrual if
    sublease income under the agreement differs from initial
    estimates.

During 2005, in conjunction with the workforce reduction in our
    European design services business, we completed a sale-leaseback
    transaction involving land and a building in Livingston,
    Scotland. Proceeds from the sale were $33.6 million and the
    total gain on the sale was $3.6 million. We leased back a
    portion of the facility for the next two years and another
    portion for ten years, with an option to terminate the ten year
    lease after five years. We deferred the gain on the sale and are
    recognizing the gain ratably over the maximum lease term of ten
    years.

Due to the immateriality of the 2003 Restructuring, 2002
    Restructuring and 2001 Restructuring, they have been combined in
    the above table.

Frequently, asset impairments are based on significant estimates
    and assumptions, particularly regarding remaining useful life
    and utilization rates. We may incur other charges in the future
    if management determines that the useful life or utilization of
    certain long-lived assets has been reduced.

The initial facility closure and space reduction costs included
    in these restructurings were comprised of payments required
    under leases, less any applicable estimated sublease income
    after the properties were abandoned, lease buyout costs and
    other contractual charges. To estimate the initial lease loss,
    which is the loss after our cost recovery efforts from
    subleasing all or part of a building, management made certain
    assumptions related to the time period over which the relevant
    building would remain vacant and sublease terms, including
    sublease rates and contractual common area charges.

As of December 30, 2006, our accrued estimate of the lease
    loss related to all restructuring activities initiated since
    2001 was $31.3 million. This amount may be adjusted in the
    future based upon changes in the assumptions used to estimate
    the lease loss. Since 2001, we have recorded facilities
    consolidation charges, net of credits, of $97.0 million
    under the 2001 through 2005 Restructurings  related to space
    reductions or facility closures of 49 sites. As of
    December 30, 2006, 28 of these sites had been vacated and
    space reductions had occurred at the remaining 21 sites. We
    expect to pay all of the facilities-related restructuring
    liabilities for all our restructuring plans prior to 2016.

Because the restructuring charges and related benefits are
    derived from management’s estimates made during the
    formulation of the restructurings, based on then-currently
    available information, our restructuring activities may not
    achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the
    level contemplated. Demand for our products and services and,
    ultimately, our future financial performance, is difficult to
    predict with any degree of certainty. Accordingly, additional
    actions, including further restructuring of our operations, may
    be required in the future.

Our workforce reduction activities related to the 2004
    Restructuring and the 2005 Restructuring were completed prior to
    December 31, 2005. We recorded a credit during the twelve
    months ended December 30,



2006 to remove the remaining severance and benefits accrual
    related to the 2005 Restructuring. The other activity recorded
    in each of the restructuring plans for the year ended
    December 30, 2006 relates to payment of remaining lease
    obligations net of sublease payments received and changes in
    estimate related to lease loss accruals.

We expect to incur an additional $1.0 million to
    $2.0 million of future costs in connection with the 2005
    Restructuring and an additional $3.0 million to
    $5.0 million of future costs in connection with the 2003
    Restructuring, primarily for facilities-related charges, which
    will be expensed as incurred. The actual amount of additional
    costs incurred could vary depending on changes in market
    conditions and the timing of these restructuring activities.

Write-off
    of Acquired In-Process Research and Development

Upon consummation of an acquisition, we immediately charge to
    expense any acquired in-process research and development that
    has not yet reached technological feasibility and has no
    alternative future use. The value assigned to acquired
    in-process research and development is determined by identifying
    research projects in areas for which technological feasibility
    has not been established. The values are determined by
    estimating costs to develop the acquired in-process research and
    development into commercially viable products, estimating the
    resulting net cash flows from such projects and discounting the
    net cash flows back to their present value. The discount rates
    utilized include a factor that reflects the uncertainty
    surrounding successful development of the acquired in-process
    research and development.

The following table summarizes our write-offs of acquired
    in-process research and development charges in fiscal 2006, 2005

    which includes a premium paid to repurchase a portion of the
    2023 Notes of $38.9 million and a write-off of the related
    portion of unamortized deferred costs of issuing the 2023 Notes

The increases in interest income in 2006, as compared to 2005,
    and in 2005, as compared to 2004, were due to increases in our
    Cash and cash equivalents balances as well as higher interest
    rates applicable to those balances.

In January 2006, KhiMetrics, Inc., a cost method investment held
    by Telos Venture Partners L.P., a limited partnership in which
    we and our 1996 Deferred Compensation Venture Investment Plan
    Trust were the sole limited partners, was sold for consideration
    of $6.53 per share of common stock. Under the purchase
    agreement, 10% of the consideration was held in escrow to pay
    the cost of resolving any claims that could have been asserted
    against KhiMetrics on or before the first anniversary of the
    acquisition. The escrow amount remaining after resolution of
    such claims was distributed to the former stockholders of
    KhiMetrics in January and February 2007. No gain was recorded on
    amounts held in escrow during 2006. In connection with this
    sale, we received approximately $20.2 million in cash and
    recorded a gain of approximately $17.1 million during the
    year ended December 30, 2006.



In addition, our 1996 Deferred Compensation Venture Investment
    Plan Trust received $2.9 million in cash and recorded a
    gain of $2.5 million during the year ended
    December 30, 2006.

Provision

    fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows:

    compared to 2005

Our effective tax rate decreased in 2006, as compared to 2005,
    primarily due to the $30.1 million of non-recurring
    federal, state and foreign income taxes incurred upon our 2005
    repatriation of $500.0 million of certain foreign earnings
    under the American Jobs Creation Act, which increased the 2005
    annual effective tax rate by approximately 23 percentage
    points.

    compared to 2004

Our effective tax rate increased in 2005, as compared to 2004,
    primarily due to the non-recurring income taxes related to our
    2005 repatriation of certain foreign earnings, and an increase
    in foreign income tax expense from operations in 2005.

Outlook
    for 2007

In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109,” which
    prescribes a new recognition threshold and measurement attribute
    for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
    position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
    FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition,
    classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
    periods, disclosure and transition. FIN No. 48 is
    effective for fiscal year 2007. The cumulative effect of
    applying FIN No. 48 will be reported as an adjustment
    to the opening balance of retained earnings (or other
    appropriate components of equity or net assets on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheet) for fiscal year 2007. We are
    currently studying the transition effects of adopting
    FIN No. 48 and we are not yet able to assess the
    impact of FIN No. 48 on our 2007 financial statements
    and, therefore, we are not currently able to disclose the
    expected effect of its adoption nor our outlook for the fiscal
    2007 effective tax rate.

As of December 30, 2006, we had total net deferred tax
    assets of approximately $150.1 million. Realization of the
    deferred tax assets will depend on generating sufficient taxable
    income of the appropriate character prior to the expiration of
    certain net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit
    carryforwards. Although realization is not assured, we believe
    it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will
    be realized. The amount of the net deferred tax assets, however,
    could be reduced or increased in the near term if actual facts,
    including the estimate of future taxable income, differ from
    those estimated.

The IRS and other tax authorities regularly examine our income
    tax returns. In November 2003, the IRS completed its field
    examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years
    1997 through 1999 and issued a Revenue Agent’s Report, or
    RAR, in which the IRS proposes to assess an aggregate tax
    deficiency for the three-year period of approximately
    $143.0 million. The most significant of the disputed
    adjustments for the tax years 1997 through 1999 relates to
    transfer pricing arrangements that we have with a foreign
    subsidiary. We have filed a protest to certain of the proposed
    adjustments with the Appeals Office of the IRS where the matter
    is currently being considered.

In July 2006, the IRS completed its field examination of our
    federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2002
    and issued an RAR, in which the IRS proposes to assess an
    aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year period of
    approximately $324.0 million. In November 2006, the IRS
    revised the proposed aggregate tax deficiency



for the three-year period to be approximately
    $318.0 million. The IRS is contesting our qualification for
    deferred recognition of certain proceeds received from
    restitution and settlement in connection with litigation during
    the period. The proposed tax deficiency for this item is
    approximately $152.0 million. The remaining proposed tax
    deficiency of approximately $166.0 million is primarily
    related to proposed adjustments to our transfer pricing
    arrangements that we have with foreign subsidiaries and to our
    deductions for foreign trade income. The IRS took similar
    positions with respect to our transfer pricing arrangements in
    the prior examination period and may make similar claims against
    our transfer pricing arrangements in future examinations. We
    have filed a timely protest with the IRS and will seek
    resolution of the issues through the Appeals Office of the IRS.

We believe that the proposed IRS adjustments are inconsistent
    with applicable tax laws and we are challenging these proposed
    adjustments vigorously. The RARs are not final Statutory Notices
    of Deficiency but the IRS imposes interest on the proposed
    deficiencies until the matters are resolved. Interest is
    compounded daily at rates published by the IRS, which rates are
    adjusted quarterly and have been between four and ten percent
    since 1997.

Significant judgment is required in determining our provision
    for income taxes. The calculation of our tax liabilities
    involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of
    complex tax regulations. In determining the adequacy of our
    provision for income taxes, we regularly assess the likelihood
    of adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations including
    the RARs for the tax years 1997 through 2002. We provide for tax
    liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets unless we
    consider it probable that additional taxes will not be due.
    However, the ultimate outcome of tax examinations, including the
    total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon
    resolution of these issues, cannot be predicted with certainty.
    In addition, we cannot assure you that such amount will not be
    materially different than that which is reflected in our
    historical income tax provisions and accruals. Should the IRS or
    other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of a
    current or a future examination, we may be required to record
    charges to operations in future periods that could have a
    material impact on our results of operations, financial position
    or cash flows in the applicable period or periods.

Disclosures
    About Market Risk

Interest
    Rate Risk

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates
    relates primarily to our portfolio of Cash and cash equivalents.
    While we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of
    the world’s leading industrialized countries, our interest
    income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the
    general level of United States interest rates. In this regard,
    changes in United States interest rates affect the interest
    earned on our Cash and cash equivalents and costs associated
    with foreign currency hedges.

We invest in high quality credit issuers and, by policy, limit
    the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer. As part of
    our policy, our first priority is to reduce the risk of
    principal loss. Consequently, we seek to preserve our invested
    funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment
    risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality
    credit securities that we believe to have low credit risk and by
    positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a
    significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment
    issuer or guarantor. The short-term interest-bearing portfolio
    of Cash and cash equivalents includes only marketable securities
    with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio
    liquidity.



All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or
    less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash
    equivalents. Investments with maturities greater than
    three months are classified as available-for-sale and are
    considered to be short-term investments. The carrying value of
    our interest-bearing instruments approximated fair value as of
    December 30, 2006. The following table presents the
    carrying value and related weighted average interest rates for
    our interest-bearing instruments, which are all classified as
    Cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as
    of December 30, 2006.

Foreign
    Currency Risk

Our operations include transactions in foreign currencies and,
    therefore, we benefit from a weaker dollar, and we are adversely
    affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies
    worldwide. The primary effect of foreign currency transactions
    on our results of operations from a weakening United States
    dollar is an increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase in
    expenses. Conversely, the primary effect of foreign currency
    transactions on our results of operations from a strengthening
    United States dollar is a reduction in revenue offset by a
    smaller reduction in expenses.

We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with
    financial institutions to protect against currency exchange
    risks associated with existing assets and liabilities. A foreign
    currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing
    in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying
    liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange
    rates. Conversely, a foreign currency forward exchange contract
    decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or
    underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in
    foreign exchange rates. These forward contracts are not
    designated as accounting hedges under SFAS No. 133,
    “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities,” and, therefore, the unrealized gains and
    losses are recognized in Other income, net, in advance of the
    actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these
    forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other
    assets.

Our policy governing hedges of foreign currency risk does not
    allow us to use forward contracts for trading purposes. Our
    forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or
    less. The effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our
    ability to estimate future asset and liability exposures. We
    enter into currency forward exchange contracts based on
    estimated future asset and liability exposures. Recognized gains
    and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will
    ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the
    amount of currency forward exchange contracts with actual
    underlying asset and liability exposures

.



The following table provides information, as of
    December 30, 2006, about our forward foreign currency
    contracts. The information is provided in United States dollar
    equivalent amounts. The table presents the notional amounts, at
    contract exchange rates, and the weighted average contractual
    foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the
    foreign currency per United States dollar, which in some cases
    may not be the market convention for quoting a particular
    currency. All of these forward contracts matured prior to
    January 12, 2007.

While we actively monitor our foreign currency risks, there can
    be no assurance that our foreign currency hedging activities
    will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency
    exchange rates on our results of operations, cash flows and
    financial position.

1.375% Convertible
    Senior Notes Due 2011 and 1.500% Convertible Senior Notes Due

In December 2006, we issued $250.0 million principal amount
    of 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2011, or the 2011 Notes,
    and $250.0 million of 1.500% Convertible Senior Notes
    Due 2013, or the 2013 Notes and collectively, the Convertible
    Senior Notes, to three initial purchasers in a private placement
    pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act for resale
    to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC
    Rule 144A. Concurrently with the issuance of the
    Convertible Senior Notes, we entered into hedge transactions
    with various parties and in separate transactions, sold warrants
    to various parties to reduce the potential dilution from the
    conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes and to mitigate any
    negative effect such conversion may have on the price of our
    common stock. For an additional description of the Convertible
    Senior Notes, including the hedge and warrants transactions, see
    the discussion under the heading “Liquidity and Capital
    Resources — Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital
    Resources” below.

Zero
    Coupon Zero Yield Senior Convertible Notes due 2023

In August 2003, we issued $420.0 million principal amount
    of our 2023 Notes to two initial purchasers in a private
    placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act
    for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC
    Rule 144A. Concurrently with the issuance of the 2023
    Notes, we entered into hedge transactions with one of the
    initial purchasers and in a separate transaction, sold warrants
    to one of the initial purchasers to reduce the potential
    dilution from the conversion of the 2023 Notes and to mitigate
    any negative effect such conversion may have on the price of our
    common stock. For an additional description of the 2023 Notes,
    including the hedge and warrants transactions, see the
    discussion under the heading “Liquidity and Capital
    Resources — Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital
    Resources” below.

Investments

We have a portfolio of equity investments that includes
    marketable equity securities and non-marketable equity
    securities. Our equity investments are made primarily in
    connection with our strategic investment program.



Under our strategic investment program, from time to time we
    make cash investments in companies with technologies that are
    potentially strategically important to us.

The fair value of our portfolio of

available-for-sale

marketable equity securities, which are included in Short-term
    investments on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, was
    $23.7 million as of December 30, 2006 and
    $33.0 million as of December 31, 2005. While we
    actively monitor these investments, we do not currently engage
    in any hedging activities to reduce or eliminate equity price
    risk with respect to these equity investments. Accordingly, we
    could lose all or part of our investment portfolio of marketable
    equity securities if there is an adverse change in the market
    prices of the companies we invest in.

Our investments in non-marketable equity securities would be
    negatively affected by an adverse change in equity market
    prices, although the impact cannot be directly quantified. Such
    a change, or any negative change in the financial performance or
    prospects of the companies whose non-marketable securities we
    own, would harm the ability of these companies to raise
    additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to
    realize any gains or return of our investments through liquidity
    events such as initial public offerings, acquisitions and
    private sales. These types of investments involve a high degree
    of risk, and there can be no assurance that any company we
    invest in will grow or will be successful or that we will be
    able to liquidate a particular investment when desired.
    Accordingly, we could lose all or part of our investment.

Our investments in non-marketable equity securities had a
    carrying amount of $31.4 million as of December 30,
    2006 and $37.9 million as of December 31, 2005. If we
    determine that an

other-than-temporary

decline in fair value exists for a non-marketable equity
    security, we write down the investment to its fair value and
    record the related write-down as an investment loss in our
    Consolidated Income Statements.

Cash,
    cash equivalents and short-term investments

As of December 30, 2006, our principal sources of liquidity
    consisted of $958.4 million of Cash and cash equivalents
    and short-term investments, as compared to $894.6 million
    as of December 31, 2005 and $593.0 million as of
    January 1, 2005. The primary sources of our cash in 2006
    and 2005 were:

•

Customer payments under software licenses and from the sale or
    lease of our hardware products;

•

Customer payments for design and methodology services;

•

Borrowings under the Term Loan;

•

Proceeds from the sale of receivables and proceeds from the
    exercise of stock options;

Proceeds from the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes in
    2006;

•

Proceeds from the separate warrant sale transactions entered
    into in connection with the issuance of the Convertible Senior
    Notes in 2006;

•

Proceeds from the termination of a portion of the hedge
    transactions originally entered into in connection with the
    issuance of our 2023 Notes; and

•

Common stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plans.



Our primary uses of cash in 2006 and 2005 consisted of:

•

Payments relating to payroll, product, services and other
    operating expenses;

•

Payments of taxes;

•

Purchases of property, plant and equipment;

•

Payments of long-term debt and repurchases of a portion of the
    2023 Notes;

    issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes;

•

Payments made to terminate a portion of the warrant transactions
    originally entered in connection with the issuance of our 2023
    notes;

•

Purchases of treasury stock; and

•

Payments related to business acquisitions.

Net
    working capital

Net working capital increased $93.4 million as of
    December 30, 2006, as compared to December 31, 2005,
    primarily due to:

•

An increase of $73.0 million in Cash and cash equivalents;

•

A decrease of $40.8 million in Accounts payable and accrued
    liabilities;

•

A decrease of $13.0 million in Current portion of deferred
    revenue; partially offset by

•

A decrease of $43.6 million in Accounts receivable,
    net; and

•

A decrease of $9.2 million in Short-term investments.

Net working capital increased $149.5 million as of
    December 31, 2005, as compared to January 1, 2005,
    primarily due to:

•

An increase of $301.6 million in Cash and cash equivalents
    and short-term investments; partially offset by

•

A decrease of $102.0 million in Accounts receivable, net;

•

An increase of $22.6 million in Accounts payable and
    accrued liabilities; and

•

An increase of $32.0 million in Current portion of
    long-term debt.

Cash
    flows from operating activities

Cash flows from operating activities are provided by net income,
    adjusted for certain non-cash charges, as well as changes in the
    balance of certain assets and liabilities. Our cash flows from
    operating activities are significantly influenced by the payment
    terms set forth in our license agreements and by sales of our
    receivables.

We have entered into agreements whereby we may transfer accounts
    receivable to certain financing institutions on a non-recourse
    or limited-recourse basis. These transfers are recorded as sales
    and accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 140,
    “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
    and Extinguishments of Liabilities.” During 2006, we
    transferred accounts receivable, net of the losses on the sale
    of the receivables, totaling $180.6 million, which
    approximated fair value, to financing institutions on a
    non-recourse basis, as compared to $192.1 million in 2005
    and $30.1 million in 2004.

    compared to 2005

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by
    $5.1 million in 2006, as compared to 2005. The decrease was
    primarily due to:

•

An increase of $71.8 million in payments of Accounts
    payable and accrued liabilities;



•

A decrease of $68.3 million in cash received from the
    collection of Receivables and Installment contract
    receivables; and

•

A decrease of $37.6 million in Depreciation and
    amortization; partially offset by

•

An increase of $93.2 million in net income;

•

An increase of $40.8 million in Loss on extinguishment of
    debt; and

•

An increase of $64.1 million in Stock-based compensation.

    compared to 2004

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by
    $53.8 million in 2005, as compared to 2004. The increase
    was primarily due to:

•

An increase of $162.0 million in Proceeds from the sale of
    receivables; and

•

A decrease of $18.3 million in payments of Accounts payable
    and accrued liabilities; partially offset by

•

A decrease of $25.1 million in net income;

•

A decrease of $71.9 million in cash received from
    collection of Receivables and Installment contract
    receivables; and

•

An increase of $14.8 million in Other assets.

Cash
    flows from investing activities

Our primary investing activities consisted of:

•

Purchases and proceeds from the sale of property, plant and
    equipment;

•

Purchases and proceeds from short-term investments;

•

Acquiring businesses, assets and intangibles; and

•

Investing in venture capital partnerships and equity investments.

In January 2006, KhiMetrics, Inc., a cost method investment held
    by Telos Venture Partners L.P., a limited partnership in which
    we and our 1996 Deferred Compensation Venture Investment Plan
    Trust were the sole limited partners, was sold for consideration
    of $6.53 per share of common stock. Under the purchase
    agreement, 10% of the consideration was held in escrow to pay
    the cost of resolving any claims that could have been asserted
    against KhiMetrics on or before the first anniversary of the
    acquisition. The escrow amount remaining after resolution of
    such claims was distributed to the former stockholders of
    KhiMetrics in January and February 2007. No gain was recorded on
    amounts held in escrow during 2006. In connection with this
    sale, we received approximately $20.2 million in cash and
    recorded a gain of approximately $17.1 million during the
    year ended December 30, 2006. In addition, our 1996
    Deferred Compensation Venture Investment Plan Trust received
    $2.9 million in cash and recorded a gain of
    $2.5 million during the year ended December 30, 2006.

    compared to 2005

Net cash used for investing activities decreased by
    $110.9 million in 2006, as compared to 2005. The decrease
    was primarily due to:

•

A decrease of $180.8 million in Purchases of short-term
    investments; and

•

A decrease of $231.4 million in Cash paid in business
    combinations, net of cash acquired and acquisition of
    intangibles; partially offset by

•

A decrease of $289.2 million in Proceeds from the sale of
    short-term investments; and

•

A decrease of $33.3 million in Proceeds from the sale of
    property, plant and equipment.

    compared to 2004

Net cash used for investing activities increased by
    $7.7 million in 2005, as compared to 2004. The increase was
    primarily due to:

•

An increase of $182.0 million in Cash paid in business
    combinations and asset acquisitions, net of cash acquired;
    partially offset by



•

An increase of $141.2 million in Proceeds from the sale of
    short-term investments, net of Purchases of short-term
    investments; and

•

An increase of $30.0 million in Proceeds from the sale of
    property, plant and equipment.

Cash
    flows from financing activities

Financing cash flows consisted primarily of net proceeds from
    the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes in 2006, including
    payments for the hedge transactions and the proceeds from the
    separate warrant transactions, payments on the Term Loan in
    2006, proceeds received from the Term Loan in 2005, the
    repurchase of treasury stock and the issuance of stock under
    certain employee plans in both 2006 and 2005.

    compared to 2005

Net cash used for financing activities was $233.9 million
    in 2006, as compared to net cash provided by financing
    activities of $205.3 million in 2005, a decrease of
    $439.2 million. The decrease was primarily due to:

•

An increase of $393.0 million in Purchases of treasury
    stock;

•

The repurchase of $228.5 million of the 2023 Notes;

•

A decrease of $160.0 million in Proceeds from Term Loan;

•

An increase of $131.9 million in Principal payments on
    long-term debt, primarily the Term Loan; and

•

An increase of $119.8 million in Purchase of call options,
    or hedges, in connection with the Convertible Senior Notes;
    partially offset by

•

An increase of $500.0 million in Proceeds from issuance of
    the Convertible Senior Notes;

•

An increase of $55.9 million in Proceeds from sale of call
    options, or hedges, in connection with the 2023 Notes; and

•

An increase of $39.4 million in Proceeds from sale of
    common stock warrants in connection with the Convertible Senior
    Notes.

    compared to 2004

Net cash provided by financing activities was
    $205.3 million in 2005, as compared to net cash used for
    financing activities of $21.1 million in 2004, an increase
    of $226.4 million. The increase of cash provided by
    financing activities was primarily due to:

•

An increase of $160.0 million in Proceeds from the Term
    Loan; and

•

An increase of $71.2 million in Proceeds from issuances of
    common stock; partially offset by

•

An increase of $7.0 million in Purchases of treasury stock.

Other
    Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources

Income
    Taxes

We provide for United States income taxes on the earnings of
    foreign subsidiaries unless the earnings are considered
    permanently invested outside of the United States. As of
    December 30, 2006, the cumulative amount of earnings upon
    which United States income taxes have not been provided was
    approximately $274.0 million. As of December 30, 2006,
    the unrecognized deferred tax liability for these earnings was
    approximately $84.0 million.

The IRS and other tax authorities regularly examine our income
    tax returns. In November 2003, the IRS completed its field
    examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years
    1997 through 1999 and issued a Revenue Agent’s Report, or
    RAR, in which the IRS proposes to assess an aggregate tax
    deficiency for the three-year period of approximately
    $143.0 million. In July 2006, the IRS completed its field
    examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years
    2000 through 2002 and issued an RAR, in which the IRS proposes
    to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year period
    of approximately $324.0 million. In November 2006, the IRS
    revised the proposed aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year
    period to be approximately $318.0 million.

We believe that the proposed IRS adjustments are inconsistent
    with applicable tax laws and we are challenging these proposed
    adjustments vigorously. The RARs are not final Statutory Notices
    of Deficiency but the IRS imposes



interest on the proposed deficiencies until the matters are
    resolved. Interest is compounded daily at rates published by the
    IRS, which rates are adjusted quarterly and have been between
    four and ten percent since 1997.

For an additional description of the IRS examinations for the
    years 1997 through 1999 and 2000 through 2002, see the
    discussion under the heading “Provision for Income
    Taxes” above.

Term
    Loan

In December 2005, our Irish subsidiary, Castlewilder, entered
    into a syndicated term facility agreement, or Credit Agreement,
    with Banc of America Securities LLC as lead arranger, and Bank
    of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent. The Credit Agreement
    provides for a three-year $160.0 million unsecured term
    loan, or Term Loan. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement,
    Castlewilder, at its election, may prepay the loan, in whole or
    in part, with no prepayment fee. During the year ended
    December 30, 2006, Castlewilder made quarterly principal
    payments of $32.0 million, plus additional prepayments of
    $100.0 million of the principal amount due under the loan,
    thereby reducing principal payments due under the Term Loan in
    2007 and 2008. As of December 30, 2006, scheduled principal
    payments on the Term Loan due during 2007 are $28.0 million.

1.375% Convertible
    Senior Notes Due 2011 and 1.500% Convertible Senior Notes
    Due 2013

In December 2006, we issued $250.0 million principal amount
    of 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2011, or the 2011 Notes,
    and $250.0 million of 1.500% Convertible Senior Notes
    Due 2013, or the 2013 Notes, and collectively, the Convertible
    Senior Notes, to three initial purchasers in a private placement
    pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act for resale
    to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC
    Rule 144A. We received net proceeds of approximately
    $487.0 million after transaction fees of approximately
    $13.0 million, including $12.0 million of underwriting
    discounts, that were recorded in Other long-term assets on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 30, 2006 and are
    being amortized to interest expense over the term of the
    Convertible Senior Notes. A portion of the net proceeds totaling
    $228.5 million was used to purchase $189.6 million
    principal amount of our Zero Coupon Zero Yield Senior
    Convertible Notes due 2023, or the 2023 Notes.

Holders may convert their Convertible Senior Notes prior to
    maturity upon the occurrence of one of the following events:

•

The price of our common stock reaches $27.50 during certain
    periods of time specified in the Convertible Senior Notes;

•

Specified corporate transactions occur; or

•

The trading price of the Convertible Senior Notes falls below a
    certain threshold.

On and after November 2, 2011, in the case of the 2011
    Notes, and November 1, 2013, in the case of 2013 Notes,
    until the close of business on the scheduled trading day
    immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert
    their Convertible Senior Notes at any time, regardless of the
    foregoing circumstances. We may not redeem the Convertible
    Senior Notes prior to maturity.

The initial conversion rate for the Convertible Senior Notes is
    47.2813 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal
    amount of Convertible Senior Notes, equivalent to a conversion
    price of approximately $21.15 per share of our common
    stock. Upon conversion, a holder will receive the sum of the
    daily settlement amounts, calculated on a proportionate basis
    for each day, during a specified observation period following
    the conversion date. The daily settlement amount during each
    date of the observation period consists of:

•

Cash up to the principal amount of the note; and

•

Our common stock to the extent that the conversion value exceeds
    the amount of cash paid upon conversion of the Convertible
    Senior Notes.

In addition, if a fundamental change occurs prior to maturity,
    we will, in certain cases, increase the conversion rate by an
    amount up to $8.27 per share, for a holder that elects to
    convert its Convertible Senior Notes in connection with such
    fundamental change, which amount will be paid entirely in cash.
    A fundamental change is any transaction or event (whether by
    means of an exchange offer, liquidation, tender offer,
    consolidation, merger, combination, reclassification,
    recapitalization or otherwise) in connection with which more
    than 50% of our common stock is



exchanged for, converted into, acquired for or constitutes
    solely the right to receive, consideration which is not at least
    90% shares of common stock, or depositary receipts representing
    such shares, that are:

•

Listed on, or immediately after the transaction or event will be
    listed on, a United States national securities exchange; or

•

Approved, or immediately after the transaction or event will be
    approved, for quotation on a United States system of automated
    dissemination of quotations of securities prices similar to the
    NASDAQ National Market prior to its designation as a national
    securities exchange.

As of December 30, 2006, none of the conditions allowing
    the holders of the Convertible Senior Notes to convert had been
    met.

Interest on the Convertible Senior Notes began accruing in
    December 2006 and is payable semi-annually each
    December 15th and June 15th.

Concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes,
    we entered into hedge transactions with various parties whereby
    we have the option to purchase up to 23.6 million shares of
    our common stock at a price of $21.15 per share, subject to
    adjustment. These options expire on December 15, 2011, in
    the case of the 2011 Notes, and December 15, 2013, in the
    case of the 2013 Notes, and must be settled in net shares. The
    aggregate cost of these hedge transactions was
    $119.8 million and has been recorded as a reduction to
    stockholders’ equity in accordance with EITF

No. 00-19,

“Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed
    to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own
    Stock.” The estimated fair value of the hedges acquired in
    connection with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes was
    $118.3 million as of December 30, 2006. Subsequent
    changes in the fair value of these hedges will not be recognized
    as long as the instruments remain classified as equity.

In separate transactions, we also sold warrants to various
    parties for the purchase of up to 23.6 million shares of
    our common stock at a price of $31.50 per share in a private
    placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.
    The warrants expire on various dates from February 2012 through
    April 2012 in the case of the 2011 Notes, and February 2014
    through April 2014 in the case of the 2013 Notes, and must be
    settled in net shares. We received $39.4 million in cash
    proceeds from the sale of these warrants, which has been
    recorded as a reduction to stockholders’ equity in
    accordance with EITF

No. 00-19.

The estimated fair value of the warrants sold in connection with
    the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes was
    $42.6 million as of December 30, 2006. Subsequent
    changes in the fair value of these warrants will not be
    recognized as long as the instruments remain classified as
    equity. The warrants will be included in diluted earnings per
    share, or EPS, to the extent the impact is not considered
    anti-dilutive.

Zero
    Coupon Zero Yield Senior Convertible Notes due 2023

In August 2003, we issued $420.0 million principal amount
    of our 2023 Notes to two initial purchasers in a private
    placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act
    for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC
    Rule 144A. We received net proceeds of $406.4 million
    after transaction fees of $13.6 million that were recorded
    in Other long-term assets and are being amortized to interest
    expense using the straight-line method over five years, which is
    the duration of the first redemption period. The 2023 Notes were
    issued by us at par and bear no interest. The 2023 Notes are
    convertible into our common stock initially at a conversion
    price of $15.65 per share, which would result in an
    aggregate of 26.8 million shares issued upon conversion,
    subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events.
    In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes
    in December 2006, we repurchased $189.6 million principal
    amount of the 2023 Notes, reducing the aggregate number of
    shares to be issued upon conversion to 14.7 million.

We may redeem for cash all or any part of the 2023 Notes on or
    after August 15, 2008 for 100.00% of the principal amount.
    The holders of the 2023 Notes may require us to repurchase for
    cash all or any portion of their 2023 Notes on August 15,
    2008 for 100.25% of the principal amount, on August 15,
    2013 for 100.00% of the principal amount or on August 15,
    2018 for 100.00% of the principal amount, by providing to the
    paying agent a written repurchase notice. The repurchase notice
    must be delivered during the period commencing 30 business days
    prior to the relevant repurchase date and ending on the close of
    business on the business day prior to the relevant repurchase
    date. In addition, we may redeem for cash all or any part of the
    2023 Notes on or after August 15, 2008



for 100.00% of the principal amount, except for those 2023 Notes
    that holders have required us to repurchase on August 15,
    2008 or on other repurchase dates, as described above.

Each $1,000 of principal of the 2023 Notes will initially be
    convertible into 63.8790 shares of our common stock,
    subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events.
    Holders of the 2023 Notes may convert their 2023 Notes prior to
    maturity only if:

•

The price of our common stock reaches $22.69 during certain
    periods of time specified in the 2023 Notes;

•

Specified corporate transactions occur;

•

The 2023 Notes have been called for redemption; or

•

The trading price of the 2023 Notes falls below a certain
    threshold.

In the event of a fundamental change in our corporate ownership
    or structure, the holders may require us to repurchase all or
    any portion of their 2023 Notes for 100.00% of the principal
    amount. Upon a fundamental change in our corporate ownership or
    structure, in certain circumstances we may choose to pay the
    repurchase price in cash, shares of our common stock or a
    combination of cash and shares of our common stock. As of
    December 30, 2006, none of the conditions allowing the
    holders of the 2023 Notes to convert had been met.

In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes
    in December 2006, a portion of the proceeds were used to
    purchase in the open market 2023 Notes with a principal balance
    of $189.6 million for a total purchase price of
    $228.5 million. In connection with this purchase, we
    incurred expenses of $40.8 million for the early
    extinguishment of debt. The loss on early extinguishment of debt
    included the call premium on the purchased 2023 Notes and the
    write-off of a portion of the unamortized deferred debt issuance
    costs.

Concurrently with the issuance of the 2023 Notes, we entered
    into hedge transactions with a financial institution whereby we
    originally acquired options to purchase up to 26.8 million
    shares of our common stock at a price of $15.65 per share.
    These options expire on August 15, 2008 and must be settled
    in net shares. The cost of the hedge transactions to us was
    $134.6 million. In connection with the purchase of a portion of
    the 2023 Notes in December 2006, we also sold 12.1 million
    of the hedges that were originally purchased in connection with
    the 2023 Notes and received proceeds of $55.9 million.

In addition, we sold warrants for our common stock to a
    financial institution for the purchase of up to
    26.8 million shares of our common stock at a price of
    $23.08 per share. The warrants expire on various dates from
    February 2008 through May 2008 and must be settled in net
    shares. We received $56.4 million in cash proceeds from the
    sale of these warrants. In connection with the purchase of a
    portion of the 2023 Notes in December 2006, we also purchased
    12.1 million of the warrants for our common stock that were
    originally issued in connection with the 2023 Notes at a cost of
    $10.2 million. The remaining outstanding warrants will be
    included in diluted EPS to the extent the impact is not
    considered anti-dilutive.

As of December 30, 2006, the estimated fair value of the
    remaining hedges acquired in connection with the issuance of the
    2023 Notes was $68.3 million and the estimated fair value
    of the remaining warrants sold in connection with the issuance
    of the 2023 Notes was $12.0 million. Subsequent changes in
    the fair value of these hedge and warrant transactions will not
    be recognized as long as the instruments remain classified as
    equity.

Sale-leaseback
    Agreement

In January 2007, we completed the sale of certain land and
    buildings in San Jose, California for a sale price of
    $46.5 million. Concurrently with the sale, we leased back
    from the purchaser approximately 262,500 square feet of
    office space, which represents all available space in the
    buildings. The lease agreement includes an initial term of two
    years, with two options to extend the lease for six months each.
    We have committed to lease payments related to this lease of
    $2.2 million in 2007, $2.4 million in 2008 and
    $0.2 million in 2009.

We received cash payment for the full sale price in January
    2007. During the lease term, we intend to construct an
    additional building located on our San Jose, California
    campus to replace the buildings we sold in this transaction. We
    expect to use approximately $22.0 million in cash during
    2007 to begin construction on this new building.

We expect that current cash and short-term investment balances
    and cash flows that are generated from operations will be
    sufficient to meet our working capital and other capital
    requirements for at least the next 12 months.

As of December 30, 2006, we did not have any significant
    off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in
    Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC

Regulation S-K.

New
    Accounting Standards

In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109,” which
    prescribes a new recognition threshold and measurement attribute
    for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
    position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
    FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition,
    classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
    periods, disclosure and transition. FIN No. 48 amends
    SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies,”
    to eliminate its applicability to income taxes.
    FIN No. 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after December 15, 2006. The cumulative effect of applying
    FIN No. 48 will be reported as an adjustment to the
    opening balance of retained earnings (or other appropriate
    components of equity or net assets on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheet) for fiscal 2007. We are currently studying the transition
    effects of adopting FIN No. 48 and we are not yet able
    to assess the impact of FIN No. 48 on our financial
    statements and, therefore, we are currently not able to disclose
    the expected effect of adoption.

In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin, or
    SAB, No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior Year
    Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year
    Financial Statements,” which provides interpretive guidance
    on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year
    misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year
    misstatement. SAB No. 108 is effective for us for the
    year ended December 30, 2006. The implementation of
    SAB No. 108 did not have a material effect on our
    consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements,” which defines fair value,
    establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands
    disclosures regarding fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value
    measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance
    found in various prior accounting pronouncements.
    SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after November 15, 2007. Earlier adoption is permitted,
    provided the company has not yet issued financial statements,
    including for interim periods, for that fiscal year. We are
    currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 157, but
    do



not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157 to have a
    material impact on our consolidated financial position, results
    of operations or cash flows.

Item 9.
    Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and
    Financial Disclosure

Item 9A.
    Controls and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We carried out an evaluation required by

Rule 13a-15

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the
    Exchange Act, under the supervision and with the participation
    of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer, or
    CEO, and the Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Exchange Act) as of December 30, 2006.

The evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures
    included a review of our processes and implementation and the
    effect on the information generated for use in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

In the course of this evaluation, we sought to identify any
    significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our
    disclosure controls and procedures, to determine whether we had
    identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a
    significant role in our disclosure controls and procedures, and
    to confirm that any necessary corrective action, including
    process improvements, was taken. This type of evaluation is done
    every fiscal quarter so that our conclusions concerning the
    effectiveness of these controls can be reported in our periodic
    reports filed with the SEC. The overall goals of these
    evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and
    procedures and to make modifications as necessary. We intend to
    maintain these disclosure controls and procedures, modifying
    them as circumstances warrant.



Based on their evaluation as of December 30, 2006, our CEO
    and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and
    procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that
    the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports
    filed or submitted under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded,
    processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
    specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (ii) is
    accumulated and communicated to our management, including the
    CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosure.

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial
    reporting during the quarter ended December 30, 2006 that
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent
    Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that
    our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control
    over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and
    all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and
    operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
    that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the
    design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
    resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be
    considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent
    limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls
    can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and
    instances of fraud, if any, within Cadence have been detected.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined
    in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Exchange Act). Our management assessed the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 30, 2006. In making this assessment, our
    management used the criteria established in

Internal

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Cadence Design Systems, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as
    of December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, and the
    related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’
    equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the
    years in the three-year period ended December 30, 2006. In
    connection with our audit of the consolidated financial
    statements, we also have audited the accompanying financial
    statement schedule. These consolidated financial statements and
    financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial
    statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
    December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, and the
    results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
    years in the three-year period ended December 30, 2006, in
    conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial
    statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
    consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents
    fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
    therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 30, 2006, based on the
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report
    dated February 23, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on
    management’s assessment of, and the effective operation of,
    internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Cadence Design Systems, Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying “Management’s Report on Internal Control
    over Financial Reporting” appearing under Item 9A,
    that Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company)
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 30, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible
    for maintaining effective internal control over financial
    reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is
    to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
    opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    consolidated financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Cadence Design
    Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2006,
    is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control – Integrated
    Framework

issued by the COSO. Also, in our opinion, Cadence
    Design Systems, Inc. maintained, in all material respects,
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 30, 2006, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued
    by the COSO.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Cadence Design System, Inc. and
    subsidiaries as of December 30, 2006 and December 31,
    2005, and the related consolidated statements of income,
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash
    flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
    December 30, 2006, and our report dated February 23,
    2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
    financial statements.

CADENCE
    DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 30, 2006

NOTE 1.  CADENCE

Cadence Design Systems, Inc., or Cadence, licenses electronic
    design automation, or EDA, software, sells or leases hardware
    technology and intellectual property and provides design and
    methodology services throughout the world to help manage and
    accelerate electronic product development processes.
    Cadence’s broad range of products and services are used by
    electronics companies to design and develop complex integrated
    circuits, or ICs, and personal and commercial electronic systems.

NOTE 2.  SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles
    of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

Cadence’s fiscal year end is the Saturday closest to
    December 31. Fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 were

52-week

years. The consolidated financial statements include the
    accounts of Cadence and its subsidiaries after elimination of
    intercompany accounts and transactions. All consolidated
    subsidiaries are wholly-owned by Cadence.

Use
    of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
    conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts
    of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates.

Cash,
    Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

Cadence considers all highly liquid debt instruments, which
    could include commercial paper, European Union euro time
    deposits, repurchase agreements and certificates of deposit,
    with remaining maturities of three months or less at the time of
    purchase to be cash equivalents. Investments with maturities
    greater than three months and less than one year are classified
    as short-term investments.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

Cadence transacts business in various foreign currencies. In
    general, the functional currency of a foreign operation is the
    local country’s currency except for Cadence’s
    principal Irish, Israeli, Hungarian and Dutch subsidiaries,
    whose functional currency is the United States dollar.
    Non-functional currency monetary balances are re-measured into
    the functional currency of the subsidiary with any related gain
    or loss recorded in Other income (expense), net, in the
    accompanying Consolidated Income Statements. Assets and
    liabilities of operations outside the United States, for which
    the functional currency is the local currency, are translated
    into United States dollars using fiscal year-end exchange rates.
    Revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange
    rates in effect during each fiscal month during the year. The
    effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are included
    in Stockholders’ Equity as a component of Accumulated other
    comprehensive income in the accompanying Consolidated Balance
    Sheets.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Cadence accounts for its foreign currency exchange contracts in
    accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or
    SFAS, No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments
    and Hedging Activities.” Cadence enters into foreign
    currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions
    to protect against currency exchange risks associated with
    existing assets and liabilities. A foreign currency forward
    exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when
    underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities
    increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
    Conversely, a foreign currency forward exchange



contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in
    value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes
    in foreign exchange rates. The forward contracts are not
    designated as accounting hedges under SFAS No. 133
    and, therefore, the unrealized gains and losses are recognized
    in Other income (expense), net, in advance of the actual foreign
    currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward
    contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other assets.

Cadence does not use forward contracts for trading purposes.
    Cadence’s forward contracts generally have maturities of
    90 days or less. Recognized gains or losses with respect to
    our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how
    accurately Cadence is able to match the amount of currency
    forward exchange contracts with underlying asset and liability
    exposures.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

Cadence makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding
    receivables and provide allowances for the portion of
    receivables when collection becomes doubtful. Provisions are
    made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding
    invoices and are recorded in operating expenses. For those
    invoices not specifically reviewed, provisions are made based on
    Cadence’s historical bad debt experience. In determining
    these percentages, Cadence analyzes its historical collection
    experience and current economic trends. If the historical data
    Cadence uses to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful
    accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect
    outstanding receivables, additional provisions may be needed
    which could cause future results of operations to be materially
    affected.

Allowance
    for Sales Returns

Provisions for sales returns primarily relate to service
    arrangements and are recorded as a reduction to revenue. These
    provisions are made based on historical experience.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (using the

first-in,

first-out method) or market value. Cadence’s inventories
    include high technology parts and components for complex
    computer systems that emulate the performance and operation of
    computer IC and electronic systems. These parts and components
    may be specialized in nature or subject to rapid technological
    obsolescence. While Cadence has programs to minimize the
    required inventories on hand and considers technological
    obsolescence when estimating required reserves to reduce
    recorded amounts to market values, it is reasonably possible
    that such estimates could change in the near term.
    Cadence’s practice is to reserve for inventory in excess of

12-month

demand.

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost.
    Depreciation and amortization are generally provided over the
    estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, as
    follows:

Computer equipment and related
    software

3-8 years

Buildings

10-32 years

Leasehold and building improvements

Shorter of the lease term or the
    estimated useful life

Furniture and fixtures

3-5 years

Equipment

3-5 years

Cadence capitalizes the costs of software developed for internal
    use in compliance with Statement of Position, or SOP,

98-1

“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
    Obtained for Internal Use” and with Emerging Issues Task
    Force, or EITF, Issue

00-2

“Accounting for Web Site Development Costs.”
    Capitalization of software developed for internal use and web
    site development costs begins at the application development
    phase of the project. Capitalization of software developed for
    internal use and web site development costs ends, and
    amortization begins, when the computer software is substantially
    complete and ready for its intended use. Amortization is
    recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life
    of the software. Cadence capitalized $24.3 million in 2006,
    $32.6 million in 2005 and $21.4 million in 2004.



Cadence recorded depreciation and amortization expense in the
    amount of $72.0 million in 2006, $68.8 million in 2005
    and $68.7 million in 2004 for property, plant and equipment.

Software
    Development Costs

Cadence accounts for software development costs in accordance
    with SFAS No. 86, “Accounting for the Costs of
    Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise
    Marketed.” Software development costs are capitalized
    beginning when a product’s technological feasibility has
    been established by completion of a working model of the product
    and amortization begins when a product is available for general
    release to customers. The period between the achievement of
    technological feasibility and the general release of
    Cadence’s products has typically been of short duration.
    Internally-generated software development costs have not been
    material.

Cadence capitalized $7.3 million of purchased software
    during 2006, $0.5 million of purchased software during 2005
    and $10.3 million of purchased software during 2004.
    Cadence has deemed the purchased software to have an alternative
    future use in accordance with SFAS No. 86. Therefore,
    Cadence begins amortization of purchased software when the
    technology is available for general release to customers.
    Amortization expense for purchased software was
    $4.2 million in 2006, $4.4 million in 2005 and
    $2.2 million in 2004.

Acquired
    Intangibles, including Goodwill

Acquired intangibles, which include purchased technology and
    other intangible assets, are stated at cost less accumulated
    amortization and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
    circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. In
    accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets,” goodwill and purchased intangibles with
    indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are reviewed for
    impairment at least annually or when events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that Cadence will not be able to recover
    the asset’s carrying amount. Acquired intangibles with
    definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
    remaining estimated economic life of the underlying products and
    technologies (original lives assigned are one to ten years).

During the third quarters of 2006, 2005 and 2004, Cadence
    completed its annual impairment analysis of goodwill. Based on
    the results of these impairment reviews, Cadence has determined
    that no indicators of impairment existed for its one reporting
    unit in 2006 and 2005, and two reporting units in 2004 and,
    accordingly, no impairment charge was recognized during 2006,
    2005 or 2004.

Long-lived
    Assets

Cadence’s long-lived assets consist of property, plant and
    equipment and other acquired intangibles, excluding goodwill.
    Cadence reviews its long-lived assets for impairment in
    accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the
    Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” For assets to
    be held and used, Cadence initiates its review whenever events
    or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
    a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of an
    asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the
    expected future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is
    expected to generate. If it is determined that an asset is not
    recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded in the amount by
    which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.
    During 2006, there were no significant impairments of long-lived
    assets. During 2005, Cadence abandoned certain assets and
    recorded a charge of $2.4 million, which is included in
    Restructuring and other charges in the accompanying Consolidated
    Income Statements. During 2004, Cadence abandoned certain assets
    and recorded a charge of $9.4 million on long-lived assets,
    which charge is included in Restructuring and other charges in
    the accompanying Consolidated Income Statements.

Marketable
    and Non-Marketable Securities

Marketable
    Securities

Management considers all of its investments in marketable
    securities as

available-for-sale.

Available-for-sale

securities are stated at fair value, with the unrealized gains
    and losses presented net of tax and reported as a separate
    component of Stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and
    losses are determined using the specific identification method.
    Gains are recognized when realized and are recorded in the
    Consolidated Income Statements as Other income (expense), net.
    Losses are recognized as realized or when Cadence has determined
    that an

other-than-temporary

decline in fair value has occurred.



It is Cadence’s policy to review the fair value of these
    marketable securities on a regular basis to determine whether
    its investments in these companies are

other-than-temporarily

impaired. This evaluation includes, but is not limited to,
    reviewing each company’s cash position, financing needs,
    earnings or revenue outlook, operational performance, management
    or ownership changes and competition. If Cadence believes the
    carrying value of an investment is in excess of its fair value,
    and this difference is

other-than-temporary,

it is Cadence’s policy to write down the investment to
    reduce its carrying value to fair value.

Non-Marketable
    Securities

Cadence’s non-marketable securities include investments in
    privately-held companies and companies that are publicly-traded
    but as to which there are trading restrictions on the shares
    Cadence owns. To determine the fair value of publicly-traded
    securities with trading restrictions, Cadence considers the
    current market price of the security and the specific
    characteristics of the restrictions. To determine the fair value
    of privately-held investments, Cadence uses the most recent
    round of financing or estimates of current fair value using
    traditional valuation techniques. It is Cadence’s policy to
    review the fair value of these investments on a regular basis to
    determine whether the investments in these companies are

other-than-temporarily

impaired. This evaluation includes, but is not limited to,
    reviewing each company’s cash position, financing needs,
    earnings or revenue outlook, operational performance, management
    or ownership changes and competition. In the case of
    privately-held companies, this evaluation is based on
    information that Cadence requests from these companies. This
    information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as
    United States publicly-traded companies, and as such, the basis
    for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy
    of the data received from these companies. If Cadence believes
    the carrying value of an investment is in excess of fair value,
    and this difference is

other-than-temporary,

it is Cadence’s policy to write down the investment to fair
    value.

Equity
    Method Investments

Cadence applies the guidance in Accounting Principles Board
    Opinion, or APB, No. 18, “The Equity Method of
    Accounting for Investments in Common Stock,” as amended,
    and EITF

No. 02-14,

“Whether an Investor Should Apply the Equity Method of
    Accounting to Investments Other Than Common Stock,” to
    classify investments as equity method investments. These
    investments are held in the form of voting preferred stock or
    convertible debt of privately-held companies. If Cadence
    determines that it has the ability to exercise significant
    influence over the investee and the investment is in the form of
    in-substance common stock, the investment is accounted for under
    the equity method.

In applying the equity method of accounting, Cadence applies
    approach (a) of EITF

No. 99-10,

“Percentage Used to Determine the Amount of Equity Method
    Losses.” Accordingly, the portion of equity method loss or
    income recorded by Cadence is based on its percentage ownership
    of each investee’s preferred stock or convertible debt
    available to absorb losses or with contractual rights to income.
    Its level of participation in future financings of its equity
    method investees may impact Cadence’s proportional share in
    future income or losses. Cadence records its interest in equity
    method gains and losses in the quarter following incurrence
    because it is not practicable to obtain investee financial
    statements prior to the issuance of Cadence’s Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Cost
    Method Investments

Investments accounted for by Cadence under the cost method of
    accounting are carried at historical cost and Cadence
    periodically evaluates the fair value of each investment to
    determine if an

other-than-temporary

decline in value has occurred.

Nonqualified
    Deferred Compensation Trust

Executive Officers and Directors may elect to defer compensation
    payable to them under Cadence’s 1994 Nonqualified Deferred
    Compensation Plan, or the NQDC. Deferred compensation payments
    are held in accounts with values indexed to the performance of
    selected mutual funds or money market accounts. In accordance
    with EITF

No. 97-14,

“Accounting for Deferred Compensation Arrangements Where
    Amounts Earned Are Held in a Rabbi Trust and Invested,”
    Cadence consolidates the NQDC trust accounts in its Consolidated
    Financial Statements.



The selected mutual funds or money market accounts held in the
    NQDC trust are classified as trading securities in accordance
    with SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain
    Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.” Trading
    securities are stated at fair value, with the unrealized gains
    and losses recognized in the Consolidated Income Statements as
    Other income (expense), net. These trading securities are
    classified as Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
    because the securities are not available for Cadence’s use
    in its operations.

Cadence’s obligation with respect to the NQDC trust is
    recorded in Other long-term liabilities on its Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. Increases and decreases in the NQDC liability
    are recorded as compensation expense in the Consolidated Income
    Statements.

Deferred
    Revenue

Deferred revenue arises when customers pay for products

and/or

services in advance of revenue recognition. Cadence’s
    deferred revenue consists primarily of unearned revenue on
    maintenance and product licenses for which revenue is recognized
    in installments over the duration of the license. Maintenance on
    perpetual licenses is generally renewed annually, billed in full
    in advance, and the corresponding revenue is recognized over the
    ensuing

12-month

maintenance term. The fees under product licenses for which
    revenue is not recognized immediately and for maintenance in
    connection with term and subscription licenses are generally
    billed quarterly in advance and the related revenue is
    recognized over multiple periods over the ensuing license period.

Comprehensive
    Income

Other comprehensive income includes foreign currency translation
    gains and losses and unrealized gains and losses on marketable
    securities that are

available-for-sale

that have been excluded from net income and reflected instead in
    stockholders’ equity. Cadence has reported the components
    of comprehensive income in its Consolidated Statements of
    Stockholders’ Equity. Cadence reclassified
    $6.7 million in 2006, net of $2.7 million of tax,
    $9.2 million in 2005, net of $3.7 million of tax, and
    $6.8 million in 2004, net of $2.7 million of tax, from
    unrealized holding gains and losses on marketable securities to
    realized gains included in Other income (expense), net, in the
    accompanying Consolidated Income Statements. The tax expense
    (benefit) for gross unrealized holding gains (losses) in
    marketable equity securities was $(4.4) million in 2006,
    $(1.2) million in 2005 and $(16.4) million in 2004.

Revenue
    Recognition

Cadence applies the provisions of SOP, 97-2, “Software
    Revenue Recognition,” as amended by

SOP 98-9,

“Modification of

SOP 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain
    Transactions,” to all product revenue transactions where
    the software is not incidental. Cadence also applies the
    provisions of SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for
    Leases,” to all hardware lease transactions. Cadence
    recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists, the product has been delivered, the fee is fixed or
    determinable, collection of the resulting receivable is
    probable, and vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value,
    or VSOE, exists.

Cadence licenses software using three different license types:

•

Subscription licenses;

•

Term licenses; and

•

Perpetual licenses.

Subscription licenses

– Cadence’s
    subscription license arrangements offer customers the right to:

•

Access and use all software products delivered at the outset of
    an arrangement throughout the entire term of the arrangement,
    generally two to three years, with no rights to return;

•

Use unspecified additional software products that become
    commercially available during the term of the
    arrangement; and

•

Remix among the software products delivered at the outset of the
    arrangement, as well as the right to remix into other
    unspecified additional software products that may become
    available during the term of the arrangement, so long as the
    cumulative value of all products in use does not exceed the
    total license fee determined at the outset of the arrangement.
    These remix rights may be exercisable multiple times



during the term of the arrangement. The right to remix all
    software products delivered pursuant to the license agreement is
    not considered an exchange or return of software because all
    software products have been delivered and the customer has the
    continuing right to use them.

In general, revenue associated with subscription licenses is
    recognized ratably over the term of the license commencing upon
    the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery
    of the software product. Subscription license revenue is
    allocated to product and maintenance revenue. The allocation to
    maintenance revenue is based on vendor specific objective
    evidence, or VSOE, of fair value of the undelivered maintenance
    that was established in connection with the sale of our term
    licenses.

Term licenses

– Cadence’s term license
    arrangements offer customers the right to:

•

Access and use all software products delivered at the outset of
    an arrangement throughout the entire term of the arrangement,
    generally two to three years, with no rights to return; and

•

Remix among the software products delivered at the outset of the
    arrangement, so long as the cumulative value of all products in
    use does not exceed the total license fee determined at the
    outset of the arrangement. These remix rights may be exercisable
    multiple times during the term of the arrangement.

The right to remix all software products delivered pursuant to
    the license agreement is not considered an exchange or return of
    software because all software products have been delivered and
    the customer has the continuing right to use them. In general,
    revenue associated with term licenses is recognized upon the
    later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of
    the software product.

Perpetual licenses

– Cadence’s perpetual
    licenses consist of software licensed on a perpetual basis with
    no right to return or exchange the licensed software. In
    general, revenue associated with perpetual licenses is
    recognized upon the later of the effective date of the license
    or delivery of the licensed product.

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement

–
    Generally, Cadence uses a contract signed by the customer as
    evidence of an arrangement for subscription and term licenses
    and hardware leases. If a contract signed by the customer does
    not exist, Cadence has historically used a purchase order as
    evidence of an arrangement for perpetual licenses, hardware
    sales, maintenance renewals and small fixed-price service
    projects, such as training classes and small methodology service
    engagements of approximately $10,000 or less. For all other
    service engagements, Cadence uses a signed professional services
    agreement and a statement of work to evidence an arrangement. In
    cases where both a signed contract and a purchase order exist,
    Cadence considers the signed contract to be the most persuasive
    evidence of the arrangement. Sales through Cadence’s
    distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the
    relationship, together with binding purchase orders from the
    distributor on a

transaction-by-transaction

basis.

Product delivery

– Software and the
    corresponding access keys are generally delivered to customers
    electronically. Electronic delivery occurs when Cadence provides
    the customer access to the software. Occasionally, Cadence will
    deliver the software on a compact disc with standard transfer
    terms of

free-on-board,

or F.O.B., shipping point. Cadence’s software license
    agreements generally do not contain conditions for acceptance.
    With respect to hardware, delivery of an entire system is deemed
    to occur upon its successful installation. For certain hardware
    products, installation is the responsibility of the customer, as
    the system is fully functional at the time of shipment. For
    these products, delivery is deemed to be complete when the
    products are shipped with freight terms of F.O.B. shipping point.

Fee is fixed or determinable

– Cadence assesses
    whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the
    arrangement, primarily based on the payment terms associated
    with the transaction. Cadence has established a history of
    collecting under the original contract without providing
    concessions on payments, products or services. For installment
    contracts that do not include a substantial up front payment,
    Cadence may only determine that a fee is fixed or determinable
    if the arrangement has payment periods that are equal to or less
    than the term of the licenses and the payments are collected in
    equal or nearly equal installments, when evaluated over the
    entire term of the arrangement.

Significant judgment is involved in assessing whether a fee is
    fixed or determinable. Cadence must also make these judgments
    when assessing whether a contract amendment to a term
    arrangement (primarily in the context of a



license extension or renewal)  constitutes a concession.
    Cadence’s experience has been that it is able to determine
    whether a fee is fixed or determinable for term licenses. While
    Cadence does not expect that experience to change, if Cadence no
    longer were to have a history of collecting under the original
    contract without providing concessions on term licenses, revenue
    from term licenses would be required to be recognized when
    payments under the installment contract become due and payable.
    Such a change could have a material impact on Cadence’s
    results of operations.

Collection is probable

– Cadence assesses the
    probability of collecting from each customer at the outset of
    the arrangement based on a number of factors, including the
    customer’s payment history and its current
    creditworthiness. Cadence has concluded that collection is not
    probable for license arrangements executed with customers in
    certain countries. If in Cadence’s judgment collection of a
    fee is not probable, Cadence defers the revenue until the
    uncertainty is removed, which generally means revenue is
    recognized upon receipt of cash payment. Cadence’s
    experience has been that it is able to estimate whether
    collection is probable. While Cadence does not expect that
    experience to change, if Cadence were to determine that
    collection is not probable for any license arrangement,
    particularly those with installment payment terms, revenue from
    such license would be recognized generally upon the receipt of
    cash payment. Such a change could have a material impact on
    Cadence’s results of operations.

Vendor-specific objective evidence of fair
    value

– Cadence’s VSOE for certain product
    elements of an arrangement is based upon the pricing in
    comparable transactions when the element is sold separately.
    VSOE for maintenance is generally based upon the customer’s
    stated annual renewal rates. VSOE for services is generally
    based on the price charged when the services are sold
    separately. For multiple element arrangements, VSOE must exist
    to allocate the total fee among all delivered and undelivered
    elements of a term or perpetual license arrangement. If VSOE
    does not exist for all elements to support the allocation of the
    total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of the
    arrangement, revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist
    for the undelivered elements, or until all elements are
    delivered, whichever is earlier. If VSOE of all undelivered
    elements exists but VSOE does not exist for one or more
    delivered elements, revenue is recognized using the residual
    method. Under the residual method, the VSOE of the undelivered
    elements is deferred, and the remaining portion of the
    arrangement fee is recognized as revenue as the elements are
    delivered. Cadence’s experience has been that it is able to
    estimate VSOE.

Finance fee revenue

– Finance fees result from
    discounting to present value the product revenue derived from
    installment contracts in which the payment terms extend beyond
    one year from the effective date of the contract. Finance fees
    are recognized using a method that approximates the effective
    interest method over the relevant license term and are
    classified as product revenue. Finance fee revenue represented
    approximately 2% of total revenue for each of the years ended
    December 30, 2006, December 31, 2005 and
    January 1, 2005. Upon the sale of an installment contract,
    Cadence recognizes the remaining finance fee revenue associated
    with the installment contract.

Services revenue

– Services revenue consists
    primarily of revenue received for performing design and
    methodology services. These services are not related to the
    functionality of the products licensed. Revenue from service
    contracts is recognized either on the time and materials method,
    as work is performed, or on the

percentage-of-completion

method. For contracts with fixed or

not-to-exceed

fees, Cadence estimates on a monthly basis the

percentage-of-completion,

which is based on the completion of milestones relating to the
    arrangement. Cadence has a history of accurately estimating
    project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A
    number of internal and external factors can affect these
    estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency
    variances and specification and testing requirement changes. If
    different conditions were to prevail such that accurate
    estimates could not be made, then the use of the completed
    contract method would be required and the recognition of all
    revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was
    completed. Such a change could have a material impact on
    Cadence’s results of operations.



Accounting
    for Income Taxes

Cadence uses the asset and liability method to account for
    income taxes. Under this method, Cadence is required to estimate
    its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it
    operates. This process involves estimating actual current tax
    liabilities together with assessing temporary differences
    resulting from differing treatment of items, such as deferred
    revenue, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences
    result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are
    measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
    income in the years in which those temporary differences are
    expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
    assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
    income in the period that includes the enactment date. Cadence
    then assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be
    recovered from future taxable income, and to the extent it
    believes that recovery is not likely, Cadence must establish a
    valuation allowance. To the extent Cadence establishes a
    valuation allowance for deferred tax assets or increases this
    allowance, Cadence may need to include an expense within the tax
    provision of its Consolidated Income Statement.

Significant management judgment is required in determining the
    provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities
    and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax
    assets. The valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable
    income for each jurisdiction in which Cadence operates for the
    period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable. In
    the event that actual results differ from these estimates or
    Cadence adjusts these estimates in future periods, Cadence may
    need to establish an additional valuation allowance, which could
    materially affect its consolidated financial position or results
    of operations.

Restructuring
    Charges

Cadence accounts for restructuring charges in accordance with
    SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100,
    “Restructuring and Impairment Charges,” as amended.
    From fiscal 2001 through fiscal 2005, Cadence undertook
    significant restructuring initiatives. The individual components
    of the restructuring activities initiated prior to fiscal 2003
    were accounted for in accordance with EITF

No. 94-3,

“Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination
    Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain
    Costs Incurred in a Restructuring),” and EITF

No. 88-10,

“Costs Associated with Lease Modifications or
    Terminations.”

For restructuring activities initiated after fiscal 2002,
    Cadence accounted for the leased facilities in accordance with
    SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated
    with Exit or Disposal Activities.” For all periods
    presented, Cadence accounted for the asset-related portions of
    these restructurings in accordance with SFAS No. 144,
    “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets.” In addition, for all periods presented, the
    severance and benefits charges were accounted for in accordance
    with SFAS No. 112, “Employers’ Accounting
    for Postemployment Benefits – An Amendment of FASB
    Statements No. 5 and 43.”

In connection with these restructuring initiatives, cadence has
    made a number of estimates and assumptions related to losses on
    excess facilities vacated or consolidated, particularly the
    timing of subleases and sublease terms. Closure and space
    reduction costs included in the restructuring charges include
    payments required under leases less any applicable estimated
    sublease income after the facilities are abandoned, lease buyout
    costs and certain contractual costs to maintain facilities
    during the period after abandonment.

In addition, Cadence has recorded estimated provisions for
    termination benefits and outplacement costs, long-term asset
    impairments, and other restructuring costs. Cadence regularly
    evaluates the adequacy of its restructuring accrual, and adjusts
    the balance based on changes in estimates and assumptions.
    Cadence may incur future charges for new restructuring
    activities as well as for changes in estimates to amounts
    previously recorded.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Cadence adopted SFAS No. 123R “Share-Based
    Payment,” on January 1, 2006 using the modified
    prospective transition method. SFAS No. 123R requires
    companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in
    exchange for awards of equity instruments based upon the fair
    value of those awards on the grant date. Using the modified
    prospective transition method of adopting
    SFAS No. 123R, Cadence began recognizing compensation
    expense for equity-based awards granted on or after
    January 1, 2006 and unvested awards granted prior to
    January 1,



2006. Prior period stock-based compensation expense recognized
    under APB No. 25 “Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees” has been reclassified to conform to the current
    year presentation.

Under SFAS No. 123R, stock-based compensation expense
    is measured at the grant date based on the value of the option
    or restricted stock and is recognized as expense, less expected
    forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is
    generally the vesting period. The fair value of each option
    grant and each purchase right granted under Cadence’s
    Employee Stock Purchase Program, or ESPP, is estimated on the
    date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The
    fair value of each restricted stock issuance is determined using
    the fair value of Cadence’s common stock on the grant date.
    Cadence recognizes stock-based compensation expense on the
    straight-line method for options and restricted stock that only
    contain a service condition and on the graded-vesting method for
    options and restricted stock that contain both a service and
    performance condition. See Note 4 for additional
    information on performance-based restricted stock awards.
    Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant
    date requires judgment, including estimating:

•

The expected volatility of our stock;

•

The expected term of stock options;

•

The risk-free interest rate for the period;

•

Expected dividends; and

•

Expected forfeitures.

The computation of the expected volatility assumption used in
    the Black-Scholes pricing model for option grants is based on
    implied volatility calculated using an average of the volatility
    of publicly traded options for Cadence common stock and the 2023
    Notes. Cadence uses this approach to determine volatility
    because:

•

Options for Cadence’s common stock are actively traded;

•

The market prices of both the traded options and underlying
    shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and
    on a date reasonably close to the grant date of the employee
    stock options;

•

The traded options have exercise prices that are both

near-the-money

and close to the exercise price of the employee stock
    options; and

•

The remaining maturities of the traded options on which the
    estimate is based are at least one year.

When establishing the expected life assumption, Cadence reviews
    annual historical employee exercise behavior with respect to
    option grants having similar vesting periods. The risk-free
    interest rate for the period within the expected term of the
    option is based on the yield of United States Treasury notes in
    effect at the time of grant. Cadence has not historically paid
    dividends, thus the expected dividends used in the calculation
    are zero.

Judgment is also required in estimating the amount of
    stock-based awards that Cadence expects to be forfeited. Cadence
    calculates a separate expected forfeiture rate for both stock
    options and restricted stock issuances based on historical
    trends.

The valuation of all options, including the expected life of
    stock options, and the expected forfeiture rates for options and
    restricted stock, are calculated based on one employee pool as
    there is no significant difference in exercise behavior between
    classes of employees.

In November 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or
    FASB, issued Financial Statement Position, or FSP, on

SFAS No. 123R-3,

“Transition Election Related to Accounting for Tax Effects
    of Share-Based Payment Awards.” Effective upon issuance,
    FSP

No. 123R-3

provides for an alternative transition method for calculating
    the tax effects of stock-based compensation expense pursuant to
    SFAS No. 123R. The alternative transition method
    provides simplified approaches to establish the beginning
    balance of a tax benefit pool comprised of the additional
    paid-in capital, or APIC, related to the tax effects of employee
    stock-based compensation expense, and to determine the
    subsequent impact on the APIC tax benefit pool and the statement
    of cash flows of stock-based awards that were outstanding upon
    the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. Upon adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R, Cadence made the election to calculate
    the tax effects of stock-based compensation expense using the
    alternative transition method pursuant to FSP

No. 123R-3

and computed the beginning balance of the APIC tax benefit pool
    by applying the simplified method, which resulted in an APIC tax
    benefit pool windfall position. Accordingly, upon adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R, Cadence had cumulative excess tax
    benefits from stock-based compensation available in APIC



that could be used to offset an equal amount of future tax
    shortfalls (i.e., when the amount of the tax deductible
    stock-based compensation is less than the related stock-based
    compensation cost).

Concentrations
    of Credit Risk

Financial instruments, including derivative financial
    instruments, that may potentially subject Cadence to
    concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of cash and
    cash equivalents, short-term investments, long-term investments,
    accounts receivable and forward contracts. Concentration of
    credit risk related to accounts receivable is limited, due to
    the varied customers comprising Cadence’s customer base and
    their dispersion across geographical locations. Credit exposure
    related to the forward contracts is limited to the realized and
    unrealized gains on these contracts. Cadence issued options and
    warrants to hedge potential dilution of its convertible notes,
    as described more fully in Note 6. Changes in the fair
    value of these hedge and warrant transactions are not marked to
    market and are not recognized in Cadence’s Consolidated
    Income Statement as long as the instruments remain classified as
    equity. All financial instruments are executed with financial
    institutions having strong credit ratings, which minimizes risk
    of loss due to nonpayment.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The fair value of Cadence’s cash and cash equivalents,
    short-term investments, receivables, accounts payable and
    foreign currency forward exchange contracts approximate their
    carrying value due to the short-term nature of these
    instruments. The fair market values of Cadence’s long-term
    investments, term loan and installment contract receivables
    approximate their carrying values based upon current market
    rates of interest. The fair value of Cadence’s convertible
    notes is influenced by interest rates and Cadence’s stock
    price and stock price volatility and is determined by market
    trading. Based on closing market prices on December 30,
    2006, the total fair market value of Cadence’s Convertible
    Senior Notes was $505.1 million and the total fair market
    value of Cadence’s 2023 Notes was $273.4 million. See
    Note 6 for the fair value of Cadence’s convertible
    note hedges and warrants.

Leases

Cadence uses operating leases in its operations. For leases that
    contain rent escalations or rent concessions, Cadence records
    the total rent payable during the lease term on a straight-line
    basis over the term of the lease. Cadence records the difference
    between the rents paid and the straight-line rent as a deferred
    rent liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Advertising

Cadence expenses the costs of advertising as incurred.
    Advertising expense was approximately $10.5 million in
    2006, $9.0 million in 2005, and $11.6 million in 2004,
    and is included in Marketing and sales in the accompanying
    Consolidated Income Statements.

New
    Accounting Standard

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued
    Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, No. 108,
    “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When
    Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
    Statements,” which provides interpretive guidance on how
    the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year
    misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year
    misstatement. SAB No. 108 is effective for Cadence for
    the year ended December 30, 2006. The implementation of
    SAB No. 108 did not have a material effect on
    Cadence’s consolidated financial position or results of
    operations.

NOTE 3.  STOCK
    COMPENSATION PLANS

Equity
    Incentive Plans

Cadence’s 2000 Nonstatutory Equity Incentive Plan, or the
    2000 Plan, 1997 Nonstatutory Stock Incentive Plan, or 1997 Plan,
    and 1993 Nonstatutory Stock Incentive Plan, or 1993 Plan (the
    2000 Plan, the 1997 Plan and the 1993 Plan are referred to
    collectively as the Nonstatutory Stock Incentive Plans), provide
    for the issuance of non-



qualified options, incentive stock, stock bonuses and rights to
    acquire restricted stock to Cadence employees and consultants
    who are not executive officers, directors or beneficial owners
    of 10% or more of Cadence common stock. The number of shares
    available for issuance under the 2000 Plan is 50,000,000, under
    the 1997 Plan is 30,000,000 and under the 1993 Plan is
    24,750,000. Options granted under the Nonstatutory Stock
    Incentive Plans have an exercise price not less than the fair
    market value of the stock on the date of grant. Options granted
    to new employees become exercisable over a period of up to four
    years, generally with one-fourth of the shares vesting one year
    from the vesting commencement date, and the remaining shares
    vesting in 36 equal monthly installments thereafter. Options
    granted to current employees become exercisable over a period of
    up to four years, generally vesting in 48 equal monthly
    installments. Options granted under the Nonstatutory Stock
    Incentive Plans prior to October 1, 2006 generally expire
    ten years from the date of grant. Options granted under the
    Nonstatutory Stock Incentive Plans after October 1, 2006
    generally expire seven years from the date of grant. Awards of
    incentive stock granted under the Nonstatutory Stock Incentive
    Plans vest at times and in installments approved by the Board of
    Directors or its Compensation Committee, on the basis of
    continued employment, passage of time

and/or

performance criteria.

Cadence’s 1987 Stock Incentive Plan, or the 1987 Plan,
    provides for the issuance of either incentive or non-qualified
    options and incentive stock. The number of shares available for
    issuance under the 1987 Plan is 71,370,100 shares, of which
    only 3,000,000 shares may be issued pursuant to incentive
    stock awards. Options granted under the 1987 Plan have an
    exercise price not less than fair market value of the stock on
    the date of grant and become exercisable over periods of up to
    five years. Options granted under the 1987 Plan prior to
    October 1, 2006 generally expire ten years from the date of
    grant. Options granted under the 1987 Plan after October 1,
    2006 generally expire seven years from the date of grant. Awards
    of incentive stock granted under the 1987 Plan vest at times and
    in installments set forth in the 1987 Plan and approved by the
    Board of Directors or its Compensation Committee, on the basis
    of continued employment, passage of time

and/or

performance criteria.

Under the 1995 Directors’ Stock Option Plan, or the
    Directors’ Plan, Cadence may grant non-qualified options to
    its non-employee directors for up to 3,050,000 shares of
    common stock at an exercise price not less than the fair market
    value of the stock on the date of grant. Options granted under
    the Directors’ Plan have terms of ten years and vest one
    year from the date of grant.

Cadence has assumed certain options granted to employees of
    acquired companies, or Acquired Options. The Acquired Options
    were assumed by Cadence outside of its stock option plans, and
    each option is administered under the terms of the respective
    original plans of the acquired companies. All of the Acquired
    Options have been adjusted to effectuate the price conversion
    under the terms of the acquisition agreement between Cadence and
    the relevant acquired company. The Acquired Options generally
    become exercisable over a four or five year period and generally
    expire between five and ten years from the date of grant. No
    additional options will be granted under any of the acquired
    companies’ plans.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)

In November 1998, the Board of Directors adopted, and the
    Cadence stockholders subsequently approved, Cadence’s
    Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which amended
    and restated the 1990 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the ESPP.
    Subsequent amendments approved by the Board of Directors and
    Cadence stockholders increased the number of shares of common
    stock authorized for issuance under the ESPP to
    46,500,000 shares.

Under the ESPP, substantially all employees may purchase
    Cadence’s common stock at a price equal to 85 percent
    of the lower of the fair market value at the beginning of the
    applicable offering period or at the end of each applicable
    purchase period, in an amount up to 12% of their annual base
    earnings plus bonuses. The offering periods under the ESPP that
    began prior to August 1, 2006 were concurrent

24-month

offering periods. Each offering period was divided into four
    consecutive six-month purchase periods. All offering periods
    that started before August 1, 2006 will continue until they
    are completed or until they are terminated as provided in the
    documents governing the ESPP. Participants in the ESPP will
    remain in the

24-month

offering periods until these offering periods are completed or
    until such participant withdraws from the ESPP, whichever is
    earlier. Effective August 1, 2006, offering periods under
    the ESPP are six months with a corresponding six month purchase
    period. New offering periods begin on each
    August 1st and February 1st, and those offering
    periods run consecutively rather



than concurrently. Participants will be converted to the
    six-month offering periods starting with the next offering
    period in which the participants enroll on or after
    August 1, 2006.

The purchase dates under the ESPP are January 31st and
    July 31st of each year.

Stockholder
    Rights Plan

Cadence had a stockholder rights plan to protect its
    stockholders’ rights in the event of a proposed or actual
    acquisition of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of Cadence
    common stock. The rights plan expired on February 9, 2006.

NOTE 4.

STOCK-BASED
    COMPENSATION

Stock-based compensation expense and the related income tax
    benefit recognized under SFAS No. 123R in the

As required by SFAS No. 123R, on January 1, 2006,
    Cadence eliminated the unamortized Deferred stock compensation
    of $90.1 million, which in turn reduced Common stock and
    capital in excess of par value by the same amount, which had
    been included in Stockholders’ Equity on Cadence’s
    Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2005.

Stock
    Options

The exercise price of each stock option granted under one of
    Cadence’s equity incentive plans equals the market price of
    Cadence’s common stock on the date of grant. The weighted
    average grant date fair value of options



granted during the year ended December 30, 2006 was $5.58.
    The weighted average assumptions used in the model for the year

Restricted
    Stock

Generally, restricted stock awards vest over four years and are
    subject to the employee’s continuing service to Cadence.
    Cadence issues some of its restricted stock with
    performance-based vesting. The terms of these restricted stock
    grants are consistent with grants of restricted stock described
    above, with the exception that the shares vest not upon the mere
    passage of time, but upon the attainment of certain
    predetermined performance goals. Each period, Cadence estimates
    the most likely outcome of such performance goals and recognizes
    the related stock-based compensation expense. The amount of
    stock-based compensation expense recognized in any one period
    can vary based on the attainment or estimated attainment of the
    various performance goals. If such performance goals are not
    met, no compensation expense is recognized and any previously
    recognized compensation expense is reversed. Cadence recorded
    stock-based compensation expense of $13.1 million during
    2006 related to these performance-based restricted stock grants.
    No expense was recorded in 2005 and 2004 for performance-based
    restricted stock grants.

    forfeitures, related to restricted stock grants, which amount
    will be recognized over the remaining weighted average vesting
    period of 2.9 years. The total fair value of restricted
    stock that vested during the year ended December 30, 2006
    was $36.7 million.

Cumulative
    effect of change in accounting principle, net of tax

During the year ended December 30, 2006, a non-cash benefit
    of approximately $0.4 million for estimated forfeitures of
    restricted stock previously expensed was recorded as of the
    SFAS No. 123R implementation date as a one-time
    cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of tax.
    Pursuant to APB No. 25, stock-based compensation expense
    was not previously reduced for estimated future forfeitures, but
    instead was reversed upon actual forfeiture.

    For variable awards, as defined by APB No. 25, stock-based

Cadence recorded stock-based compensation expense resulting from
    its completed acquisitions. Deferred stock compensation
    resulting from these acquisitions represented the intrinsic
    value of the stock option grants to employees of the acquired
    companies multiplied by the percentage of the remaining vesting
    period divided by the total vesting period. Cadence considered
    certain stock awards to employees of certain acquired companies
    to be variable awards. Accordingly, compensation cost was
    adjusted each period for increases or decreases in the intrinsic
    value of the shares until the final measurement date.



During 2005 and 2004, Cadence issued 3,798,161 and
    3,470,938 shares, respectively, of restricted stock to
    certain employees. The restrictions lapse over a period of three
    to four years. The fair value of the restricted stock awards
    granted was $62.0 million in 2005 and $45.6 million in
    2004. The fair value of the restricted stock awards was recorded
    as a component of deferred stock compensation and was amortized
    to stock-based compensation expense as the restrictions lapse.

Cadence’s SPC Plan provided for the issuance of restricted
    shares of Cadence common stock to former employees of Silicon
    Perspective Corporation, or SPC, who became Cadence employees,
    upon the satisfaction of certain performance-based criteria in
    connection with Cadence’s acquisition of SPC. Restricted
    shares were first issued under the SPC Plan in February 2003 and
    54% of such issued shares vested immediately. The remaining 46%
    vested in 11 equal monthly installments beginning in February
    2003 and became fully vested on December 31, 2003. The
    second issue date was in April 2004, and these shares were fully
    vested when issued. An aggregate of approximately
    1.6 million shares were issued and recognized as
    stock-based compensation expense under the SPC Plan.

CONVERTIBLE
    NOTES

1.375% Convertible
    Senior Notes Due 2011 and 1.500% Convertible Senior
    Notes Due 2013

In December 2006, Cadence issued $250.0 million principal
    amount of 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2011, or the 2011
    Notes, and $250.0 million of 1.500% Convertible Senior
    Notes Due 2013, or the 2013 Notes, and collectively, the
    Convertible Senior Notes, to three initial purchasers in a
    private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the
    Securities Act for resale to qualified institutional buyers
    pursuant to SEC Rule 144A. Cadence received net proceeds of
    approximately $487.0 million after transaction fees of
    approximately $13.0 million, including $12.0 million
    of underwriting discounts, that were recorded in Other long-term
    assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 30,
    2006 and are being amortized to interest expense over the term
    of the Convertible Senior Notes. A portion of the net proceeds
    totaling $228.5 million was used to purchase
    $189.6 million principal amount of Cadence’s Zero
    Coupon Zero Yield Senior Convertible Notes due 2023, or the 2023
    Notes.

Holders may convert their Convertible Senior Notes prior to
    maturity upon the occurrence of one of the following events:

•

The price of Cadence’s common stock reaches $27.50 during
    certain periods of time specified in the Convertible Senior
    Notes;

•

Specified corporate transactions occur; or

•

The trading price of the Convertible Senior Notes falls below a
    certain threshold.

On and after November 2, 2011, in the case of the 2011
    Notes, and November 1, 2013, in the case of 2013 Notes,
    until the close of business on the scheduled trading day
    immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert
    their Convertible Senior Notes at any time, regardless of the
    foregoing circumstances. Cadence may not redeem the Convertible
    Senior Notes prior to maturity.

The initial conversion rate for the Convertible Senior Notes is
    47.2813 shares of Cadence common stock per $1,000 principal
    amount of Convertible Senior Notes, equivalent to a conversion
    price of approximately $21.15 per share of Cadence common
    stock. Upon conversion, a holder will receive the sum of the
    daily settlement amounts calculated on a proportionate basis for
    each day during a specified observation period following the
    conversion date. The daily settlement amount during each date of
    the observation period consists of:

•

Cash up to the principal amount of the note; and

•

Cadence’s common stock to the extent that the conversion
    value exceeds the amount of cash paid upon conversion of the
    Convertible Senior Notes.



In addition, if a fundamental change occurs prior to maturity,
    Cadence will, in certain cases, increase the conversion rate by
    an additional amount up to $8.27 per share, for a holder
    that elects to convert its Convertible Senior Notes in
    connection with such fundamental change, which amount will be
    paid entirely in cash. A fundamental change is any transaction
    or event (whether by means of an exchange offer, liquidation,
    tender offer, consolidation, merger, combination,
    reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) in connection
    with which more than 50% of Cadence’s common stock is
    exchanged for, converted into, acquired for or constitutes
    solely the right to receive, consideration which is not at least
    90% shares of common stock, or depositary receipts representing
    such shares, that are:

•

Listed on, or immediately after the transaction or event will be
    listed on, a United States national securities exchange; or

•

Approved, or immediately after the transaction or event will be
    approved, for quotation on a United States system of automated
    dissemination of quotations of securities prices similar to the
    NASDAQ National Market prior to its designation as a national
    securities exchange.

As of December 30, 2006, none of the conditions allowing
    the holders of the Convertible Senior Notes to convert had been
    met.

Cadence evaluated the embedded conversion option in accordance
    with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities” and concluded that the
    embedded conversion option contained within the Convertible
    Senior Notes should not be accounted for separately because the
    conversion option is indexed to Cadence’s common stock and
    is classified as stockholders’ equity. Furthermore, Cadence
    evaluated the terms of the Notes for a beneficial conversion
    feature in accordance with EITF

No. 98-5,

“Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial
    Conversion Features or Contingently Adjustable Conversion
    Ratios” and EITF

No. 00-27,

“Application of Issue

98-5

to
    Certain Convertible Instruments” and concluded there was no
    beneficial conversion feature at the commitment date based on
    the conversion rate of the Convertible Senior Notes relative to
    the commitment date stock price.

Interest on the Convertible Senior Notes began accruing in
    December 2006 and is payable semi-annually each
    December 15th and June 15th.

Concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes,
    Cadence entered into hedge transactions with various parties
    whereby Cadence has the option to purchase up to
    23.6 million shares of Cadence’s common stock at a
    price of $21.15 per share, subject to adjustment. These
    options expire on December 15, 2011, in the case of the
    2011 Notes, and December 15, 2013, in the case of the 2013
    Notes, and must be settled in net shares. The aggregate cost of
    these hedge transactions was $119.8 million and has been
    recorded as a reduction to stockholders’ equity in
    accordance with EITF

No. 00-19,

“Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed
    to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own
    Stock.” The estimated fair value of the hedges acquired in
    connection with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes was
    $118.3 million as of December 30, 2006. Subsequent
    changes in the fair value of these hedges will not be recognized
    as long as the instruments remain classified as equity.

In separate transactions, Cadence also sold warrants to various
    parties for the purchase of up to 23.6 million shares of
    Cadence’s common stock at a price of $31.50 per share
    in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the
    Securities Act. The warrants expire on various dates from
    February 2012 through April 2012 in the case of the 2011 Notes,
    and February 2014 through April 2014 in the case of the 2013
    Notes, and must be settled in net shares. Cadence received
    $39.4 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these
    warrants, which has been recorded as a reduction to
    stockholders’ equity in accordance with EITF

No. 00-19.

The estimated fair value of the warrants sold in connection with
    the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes was
    $42.6 million as of December 30, 2006. Subsequent
    changes in the fair value of these warrants will not be
    recognized as long as the instruments remain classified as
    equity. The warrants will be included in diluted earnings per
    share, or EPS, to the extent the impact is not considered
    anti-dilutive.

SFAS No. 128, “Earnings per Share” and EITF

No. 04-08,

“Accounting Issues Related to Certain Features of
    Contingently Convertible Debt and the Effect on Diluted Earnings
    per Share,” requires Cadence to include in diluted earnings
    per share the shares of Cadence’s common stock into which
    the Convertible Senior Notes will be converted. However, since
    the Convertible Senior Notes meet the qualification of an
    Instrument C under



EITF No. 90-19,

“Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed
    to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own
    Stock,” and because cash will be paid for the principal
    amount of the obligation upon conversion, the only shares that
    will be considered for inclusion in diluted EPS are those
    relating to the excess of the conversion premium over the
    principal amount in accordance with SFAS No. 128 and EITF
    Topic

D-72,

“Effect of Contracts That May Be Settled in Stock or Cash
    on the Computation of Diluted Earnings per Share.” As of
    December 30, 2006, no shares are included in diluted EPS
    for the Convertible Senior Notes.

In the event Cadence’s common stock exceeds $21.15 per
    share, for the first $1.00 the price exceeds $21.15, there would
    be dilution of approximately 1.1 million shares, but the
    impact on the calculation of EPS will vary depending on when
    during the quarter the $21.15 per share price is reached.
    As the share price continues to increase, dilution would
    continue to occur but at a declining rate.

Zero
    Coupon Zero Yield Senior Convertible Notes due 2023

In August 2003, Cadence issued $420.0 million principal
    amount of its 2023 Notes to two initial purchasers in a private
    placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act
    for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC
    Rule 144A. Cadence received net proceeds of
    $406.4 million after transaction fees of $13.6 million
    that were recorded in Other long-term assets and are being
    amortized to interest expense using the straight-line method
    over five years, which is the duration of the first redemption
    period. The 2023 Notes were issued by Cadence at par and bear no
    interest. The 2023 Notes are convertible into Cadence common
    stock initially at a conversion price of $15.65 per share, which
    would result in an aggregate of 26.8 million shares issued
    upon conversion, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of
    specified events. In connection with the issuance of the
    Convertible Senior Notes in December 2006, Cadence repurchased
    $189.6 million principal amount of the 2023 Notes, reducing
    the aggregate number of shares to be issued upon conversion to
    14.7 million.

Cadence may redeem for cash all or any part of the 2023 Notes on
    or after August 15, 2008 for 100.00% of the principal
    amount. The holders of the 2023 Notes may require Cadence to
    repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2023 Notes on
    August 15, 2008 for 100.25% of the principal amount, on
    August 15, 2013 for 100.00% of the principal amount or on
    August 15, 2018 for 100.00% of the principal amount, by
    providing to the paying agent a written repurchase notice. The
    repurchase notice must be delivered during the period commencing
    30 business days prior to the relevant repurchase date and
    ending on the close of business on the business day prior to the
    relevant repurchase date. In addition, Cadence may redeem for
    cash all or any part of the 2023 Notes on or after
    August 15, 2008 for 100.00% of the principal amount, except
    for those 2023 Notes that holders have required Cadence to
    repurchase on August 15, 2008 or on other repurchase dates,
    as described above.

Each $1,000 of principal of the 2023 Notes will initially be
    convertible into 63.8790 shares of Cadence common stock,
    subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events.
    Holders of the 2023 Notes may convert their 2023 Notes prior to
    maturity only if:

•

The price of Cadence common stock reaches $22.69 during certain
    periods of time specified in the 2023 Notes;

•

Specified corporate transactions occur;

•

The 2023 Notes have been called for redemption; or

•

The trading price of the 2023 Notes falls below a certain
    threshold.

As the fourth conversion feature is linked to the trading price
    of the 2023 Notes, which are traded in an observable market that
    differs from the one in which Cadence’s common stock is
    traded, the conversion feature meets the definition of a
    derivative that must be accounted for separately at fair value.
    The fair value of this conversion feature was not material at
    inception of the 2023 Notes or as of December 30, 2006. As
    of December 30, 2006, none of the conditions allowing
    holders of the 2023 Notes to convert had been met.

In the event of a fundamental change in Cadence’s corporate
    ownership or structure, the holders may require Cadence to
    repurchase all or any portion of their 2023 Notes for 100.00% of
    the principal amount. Upon a fundamental change in
    Cadence’s corporate ownership or structure, in certain
    circumstances Cadence may choose to pay the repurchase price in
    cash, shares of Cadence common stock or a combination of cash
    and shares of



Cadence common stock. As of December 30, 2006, none of the
    conditions allowing the holders of the 2023 Notes to convert had
    been met.

In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes
    in December 2006, a portion of the proceeds were used to
    purchase in the open market 2023 Notes with a principal balance
    of $189.6 million for a total purchase price of
    $228.5 million. In connection with this purchase, Cadence
    incurred expenses of $40.8 million for the early
    extinguishment of debt. The loss on early extinguishment of debt
    included the call premium on the purchased 2023 Notes and the
    write-off of a portion of the unamortized deferred debt issuance
    costs.

Concurrently with the issuance of the 2023 Notes, Cadence
    entered into hedge transactions with a financial institution
    whereby Cadence originally acquired options to purchase up to
    26.8 million shares of Cadence common stock at a price of
    $15.65 per share. These options expire on August 15,
    2008 and must be settled in net shares. The cost of the hedge
    transactions to Cadence was $134.6 million. In connection
    with the purchase of a portion of the 2023 Notes in December
    2006, Cadence also sold 12.1 million of the hedges that
    were originally purchased in connection with the 2023 Notes and
    received proceeds of $55.9 million.

In addition, Cadence sold warrants for its common stock to a
    financial institution for the purchase of up to
    26.8 million shares of Cadence common stock at a price of
    $23.08 per share. The warrants expire on various dates from
    February 2008 through May 2008 and must be settled in net
    shares. Cadence received $56.4 million in cash proceeds
    from the sale of these warrants. In connection with the purchase
    of a portion of the 2023 Notes in December 2006, Cadence also
    purchased 12.1 million of the warrants for its common stock
    that were originally issued in connection with the 2023 Notes at
    a cost of $10.2 million. The remaining outstanding warrants
    will be included in diluted EPS to the extent the impact is not
    considered anti-dilutive.

The costs incurred in connection with the hedge transaction and
    the proceeds from the sale of the warrants are included as a net
    reduction in Common stock and capital in excess of par in the
    accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 30,
    2006 and December 31, 2005, in accordance with the guidance
    in EITF

No. 00-19.

Additionally, the cost to purchase a portion of the warrants and
    the proceeds received from selling a portion of the notes hedges
    in December 2006 have also been recorded to stockholders equity.
    As of December 30, 2006, the estimated fair value of the
    remaining hedges acquired in connection with the issuance of the
    2023 Notes was $68.3 million and the estimated fair value
    of the remaining warrants sold in connection with the issuance
    of the 2023 Notes was $12.0 million. Subsequent changes in
    the fair value of these hedge and warrant transactions will not
    be recognized as long as the instruments remain classified as
    equity.

For the year ended December 30, 2006, a weighted average of
    26.4 million common shares were included in diluted EPS for
    the 2023 Notes. There will be no other impact on basic or
    dilutive EPS for the 2023 Notes unless the price of
    Cadence’s common stock exceeds the warrant strike price of
    $23.08 per share. Up to $23.08 per share, in
    connection with any conversion, the operation of the hedge
    transactions and sale of the warrants would effectively result
    in no impact on basic or dilutive EPS. In the event
    Cadence’s common stock exceeds $23.08 per share, for
    the first $1.00 the price exceeds $23.08, there would be
    dilution of approximately 0.6 million shares, but the
    impact on the calculation of EPS will vary depending on when
    during the quarter the $23.08 per share price is reached.
    As the share price continues to increase, dilution would
    continue to occur but at a declining rate. If these transactions
    settle in Cadence’s favor, Cadence could be exposed to
    credit risk related to the other party to the transactions.

NOTE 7.

TERM
    LOAN

On December 19, 2005, Castlewilder, a company incorporated
    in Ireland and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cadence, entered
    into a syndicated term facility agreement, or Credit Agreement,
    with Banc of America Securities LLC as lead arranger, and Bank
    of America, N.A. as Administrative Agent. The Credit Agreement
    provides for a three-year $160.0 million unsecured term
    loan. With the consent of all of the lenders, Castlewilder may,
    at the end of the second year of the loan, extend the maturity
    date to December 31, 2009.

During the year ended December 30, 2006, Castlewilder made
    scheduled principal payments of $32.0 million, plus
    additional prepayments of $100.0 million, reducing the
    amount of principal due in 2007 and 2008. As of
    December 30, 2006, scheduled principal payments on the Term
    Loan due during 2007 were $28.0 million.



During the term of the Credit Agreement, Castlewilder has the
    option to choose between two interest rates:

•

A base rate equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate plus a
    spread of 0.50% or the “prime rate” publicly announced
    by Bank of America, N.A.; or

•

A LIBOR-based rate equal to LIBOR plus a spread of 0.625%.

The loan initially was a base rate loan that converted on
    December 22, 2005 into a LIBOR-based rate loan, which
    accrued interest monthly at a rate of 5.85% as of
    December 30, 2006. Cadence can change its interest rate
    election each Interest Period, as defined in the loan agreement.
    The margin with respect to the loan (if the loan is a LIBOR
    loan) may be increased or decreased depending upon
    Cadence’s consolidated leverage ratio.

Castlewilder is obligated to repay the outstanding principal
    amount of the loan in quarterly installments in amounts equal to
    $8.0 million per quarter during 2006, $12.0 million
    per quarter during 2007 and $20.0 million per quarter
    during 2008 (with the quarterly repayment amount to be adjusted
    to $10.0 million per quarter during 2008 and 2009 if the
    maturity date of the loan is extended). Castlewilder is also
    obligated to pay accrued interest on the last day of each month
    or other interest period that Castlewilder may select under the
    terms of the Credit Agreement. If the loan is converted into a
    base rate loan, Castlewilder is obligated to pay accrued
    interest on the last day of each quarter.

Castlewilder’s obligations under the Credit Agreement are
    unconditionally guaranteed by Cadence and Cadence Technology
    Limited, or CTL, a company incorporated in Ireland and a
    wholly-owned subsidiary of Castlewilder, pursuant to guaranties
    entered into by Cadence and CTL in favor of the lenders on
    December 19, 2005.

In the event of the following, the Administrative Agent may
    declare that all or part of the loan, together with accrued
    interest and all other amounts accrued and outstanding under the
    financing documents, to be immediately due and payable:

•

Non-payment of any amounts due under the financing documents;

•

Non-compliance with any other provisions of the financing
    documents;

•

Any representation or statement made in the financing documents
    proving to have been incorrect or misleading at the time it was
    made;

•

Certain insolvency events, insolvency proceedings or
    creditor’s process with respect to Castlewilder and CTL;

•

Castlewilder or CTL ceasing to be either direct or indirect
    wholly-owned subsidiaries of Cadence;

•

It becoming unlawful for Castlewilder, CTL or Cadence to perform
    any material obligation under the financing documents; or

•

Any default under the Cadence Guaranty.

The Credit Agreement and the CTL Guaranty contain certain
    customary representations and warranties, affirmative and
    negative covenants and indemnification obligations of
    Castlewilder and CTL. The Credit Agreement also provides for
    certain tax

gross-up

payment obligations of Castlewilder. The Cadence Guaranty also
    contains representations and warranties, affirmative covenants,
    negative covenants relating to, among other matters, incurrence
    of liens and indebtedness, the making of investments and asset
    dispositions, as well as a requirement to maintain a minimum
    consolidated interest coverage ratio and consolidated leverage
    ratio. A breach by Castlewilder, Cadence or CTL of any of these
    representations, warranties or covenants could cause an event of
    default under the applicable financing document and allow the
    Administrative Agent to declare that all or part of the loan,
    together with accrued interest and all other amounts accrued and
    outstanding under the financing documents, to be immediately due
    and payable. The Cadence Guaranty also contains indemnification
    obligations on the part of Cadence. As of December 30,
    2006, Cadence was in compliance with all of its covenants.

As of December 30, 2006, Cadence had total net deferred tax
    assets of approximately $150.1 million. Realization of the
    deferred tax assets will depend on generating sufficient taxable
    income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate
    jurisdictions prior to the expiration of certain net operating
    loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards. Although
    realization is not assured, management believes that it is more
    likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be
    realized.

The valuation allowance increased by $0.8 million during
    2006 based on estimation of realization of deferred tax assets
    in future years. As of December 30, 2006, the valuation
    allowance was $5.9 million and is related to certain state
    net operating losses and tax credits, the utilization of which
    is not likely based on available evidence, including
    Cadence’s estimation of future taxable income in these
    states.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, Cadence completed its
    evaluation of the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs
    Creation Act, or AJCA, which created a temporary one year
    incentive for United States corporations to repatriate
    accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries by providing an 85%
    dividends received deduction for certain qualifying dividends.
    Cadence made the determination to repatriate $500.0 million
    of certain foreign earnings which were previously considered to
    be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. Cadence
    has been and will continue to invest these earnings in the
    United States pursuant to the AJCA guidelines. Cadence completed
    the repatriation and recorded an income tax expense of
    $30.1 million associated with the repatriation during the
    fourth quarter of 2005.

Cadence provides for United States income taxes on the earnings
    of foreign subsidiaries unless the earnings are considered
    permanently invested outside of the United States. As of
    December 30, 2006, the cumulative amount of



earnings upon which United States income taxes have not been
    provided was approximately $274.0 million. As of
    December 30, 2006, the unrecognized deferred tax liability
    for these earnings was approximately $84.0 million. Cadence
    intends to indefinitely reinvest its foreign earnings outside of
    the United States.

As of December 30, 2006, Cadence had federal and California
    net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
    $13.6 million and $2.0 million, respectively,
    available to reduce future taxable income. The federal net
    operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates from
    2008 through 2025. The California net operating loss
    carryforwards will expire at various dates from 2012 through
    2015. Cadence also has tax effected net operating losses from
    states other than California of $2.6 million, net of
    federal tax benefit, which will expire at various dates from
    2007 through 2025.

As of December 30, 2006, Cadence had federal tax credits of
    $12.9 million, California credits of $8.1 million, net
    of federal tax benefit, credits from states other than
    California of $4.8 million, net of federal tax benefit and
    $0.2 million of tax credits in foreign jurisdictions. Of
    these tax credits, $9.6 million do not expire and carry
    forward indefinitely until utilized and the remaining
    $16.4 million of tax credits will expire at various dates
    from 2007 through 2024.

The IRS and other tax authorities regularly examine
    Cadence’s income tax returns. In November 2003, the IRS
    completed its field examination of Cadence’s federal income
    tax returns for the tax years 1997 through 1999 and issued a
    Revenue Agent’s Report, or RAR, in which the IRS proposes
    to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year period
    of approximately $143.0 million. The most significant of
    the disputed adjustments for the tax years 1997 through 1999
    relates to transfer pricing arrangements that Cadence has with a
    foreign subsidiary. Cadence has filed a protest to certain of
    the proposed adjustments with the Appeals Office of the IRS
    where the matter is currently being considered.

In July 2006, the IRS completed its field examination of
    Cadence’s federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000
    through 2002 and issued an RAR, in which the IRS proposes to
    assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year period of
    approximately $324.0 million. In November 2006, the IRS
    revised the proposed aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year
    period to be approximately $318.0 million. The IRS is
    contesting Cadence’s qualification for deferred recognition
    of certain proceeds received from restitution and settlement in
    connection with litigation during the period. The proposed tax
    deficiency for this item is approximately $152.0 million.
    The remaining proposed tax deficiency of approximately
    $166.0 million is primarily related to proposed adjustments
    to Cadence’s transfer pricing arrangements that it has with
    foreign subsidiaries and to Cadence’s deductions for
    foreign trade income. The IRS took similar positions with
    respect to Cadence’s transfer pricing arrangements in the
    prior examination period and may make similar claims against
    Cadence’s transfer pricing arrangements in future
    examinations. Cadence has filed a timely protest with the IRS
    and will seek resolution of the issues through the Appeals
    Office of the IRS.

Cadence believes that the proposed IRS adjustments are
    inconsistent with applicable tax laws and Cadence is challenging
    these proposed adjustments vigorously. The RARs are not final
    Statutory Notices of Deficiency but the IRS imposes interest on
    the proposed deficiencies until the matters are resolved.
    Interest is compounded daily at rates published by the IRS,
    which rates are adjusted quarterly and have been between four
    and ten percent since 1997.

Significant judgment is required in determining Cadence’s
    provision for income taxes. The calculation of Cadence’s
    tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the
    application of complex tax regulations. In determining the
    adequacy of Cadence’s provision for income taxes, Cadence
    regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting
    from tax examinations including the RARs for the tax years 1997
    through 2002. Cadence provides for tax liabilities on its
    Consolidated Balance Sheets unless Cadence considers it probable
    that additional taxes will not be due. However, the ultimate
    outcome of tax examinations, including the total amount payable
    or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these
    issues, cannot be predicted with certainty. In addition, Cadence
    cannot assure that such amount will not be materially different
    than that which is reflected in its historical income tax
    provisions and accruals. Should the IRS or other tax authorities
    assess additional taxes as a result of a current or a future
    examination, Cadence may be required to record charges to
    operations in future periods that could have a material impact
    on the results of operations, financial position or cash flows
    in the applicable period or periods.



NOTE 9.

ACQUISITIONS

For each of the acquisitions described below, the results of
    operations and the estimated fair value of the assets acquired
    and liabilities assumed have been included in Cadence’s
    Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of the
    acquisition.

Comparative pro forma financial information for all 2006, 2005
    and 2004 acquisitions have not been presented because the
    results of operations were not material to Cadence’s
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

    Acquisition

In March 2006, Cadence acquired a company for an aggregate
    initial purchase price of $25.8 million, which included the
    payment of cash, the fair value of assumed options and
    acquisition costs. The preliminary allocation of the purchase
    price was recorded as $17.4 million of goodwill,
    $9.4 million of identifiable intangible assets and
    $(1.0) million of net liabilities. The $17.4 million
    of goodwill recorded in connection with this acquisition is not
    expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Any
    subsequent adjustments to the purchase price of this acquired
    company are included in the “Other” line of the
    changes of goodwill table in Note 10 below.

    Acquisition

Verisity
    Ltd.

In April 2005, Cadence acquired Verisity Ltd., or Verisity, an
    Israeli corporation. Verisity was a publicly-held provider of
    verification process automation solutions. Cadence purchased
    Verisity to acquire key personnel and technology. The aggregate
    initial purchase price was $325.4 million, which included
    the payment of $304.6 million of cash, $10.6 million
    of assumed options at fair value, $6.9 million of
    acquisition costs and $3.3 million of contract termination
    costs.

Any subsequent adjustments to the purchase price of this

    the changes of goodwill table in Note 10 below. The
    $9.4 million of purchase price allocated to acquired
    in-process technology was determined through established
    valuation techniques. The acquired in-process technology was
    immediately expensed because technological feasibility had not
    been established, and no future alternative use exists. The
    write-off of acquired in-process technology is a component of
    operating expenses in the 2005 Consolidated Income Statement.

For tax purposes, approximately $160.0 million of the
    goodwill is expected to be deductible.



    Acquisitions

Neolinear,
    Inc.

In April 2004, Cadence acquired Neolinear, Inc., or Neolinear, a
    privately-held developer of rapid analog design technology.
    Cadence purchased Neolinear to acquire key personnel and
    technology. As discussed in Note 12, prior to the
    acquisition Cadence held an investment in Neolinear of
    $3.0 million, representing 12% ownership, which was
    accounted for under the equity method of accounting. In
    accordance with SFAS No. 141, “Business
    Combinations,” Cadence accounted for the acquisition of
    Neolinear as a step acquisition. The aggregate initial purchase
    price was $78.1 million, which included the payment of
    cash, the fair value of assumed options and acquisition costs.
    The purchase price and goodwill will increase if certain revenue
    and product development performance goals are achieved over a
    period of approximately four years following the acquisition.

    purchase price for Neolinear and the estimated amortization

    $38.3 million of goodwill is not expected to be deductible
    for income tax purposes.

Other
    2004 Acquisition

During the year ended January 1, 2005, Cadence acquired one
    other company for an aggregate initial purchase price of
    $9.2 million, which included the payment of cash, the fair
    value of assumed options and acquisition costs. The
    $5.9 million of goodwill recorded in connection with this
    acquisition is not expected to be deductible for income tax
    purposes.

Acquisition-Related
    Earnouts

For many of Cadence’s previously completed acquisitions,
    payment of a portion of the purchase price is contingent upon
    the acquired business’ achievement of certain revenue and
    product development performance goals. The portion of the
    contingent purchase price, or earnout, associated with employee
    retention is recorded as compensation expense. The specific
    performance goal levels, and amounts and timing of earnout
    payments, vary with each acquisition.



During the year ended December 30, 2006, Cadence recorded
    $18.6 million of goodwill for achieved earnouts payable to
    former stockholders of acquired companies. The
    $18.6 million of goodwill consisted of $18.5 million
    in cash payments and $0.1 million in accrued liabilities on
    the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 30, 2006. In
    addition, Cadence recorded $1.4 million in compensation
    expense related to these earnouts during the year ended
    December 30, 2006.

During the year ended December 31, 2005, Cadence recorded
    $27.5 million of goodwill for earnouts payable to former
    stockholders of acquired companies as a result of the
    achievement of certain performance goals. The $27.5 million
    of earnouts consisted of $23.5 million of cash payments
    made prior to December 31, 2005, the issuance of
    0.1 million shares of Cadence’s common stock valued at
    $1.3 million and $2.7 million accrued in Accounts payable
    and accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
    December 31, 2005.

In the year ended January 1, 2005, Cadence recorded
    $40.6 million of goodwill as contingent purchase price
    payable to former stockholders of acquired companies as a result
    of the achievement of certain performance goals. The
    $40.6 million of goodwill consisted of $17.0 million
    of actual cash payments, $7.2 million of accrued cash
    payments and the issuance of 1.1 million shares of
    Cadence’s common stock valued at $16.4 million. In
    addition, Cadence recognized stock compensation expense of
    $1.2 million in connection with these acquisitions in
    accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
    Interpretation No. 44, “Accounting for Certain
    Transactions Involving Stock Compensation (an Interpretation of
    APB No. 25).”

In connection with Cadence’s acquisitions completed prior
    to December 30, 2006, Cadence may be obligated to pay up to
    an aggregate of $4.8 million in cash during the next
    12 months and an additional $2.0 million in cash in
    periods after the next 12 months through August 2008 if
    certain revenue and product development performance goals are
    achieved.

Write-off
    of Acquired In-Process Research and Development

Acquired in-process research and development charges represent
    in-process research and development that had not reached
    technological feasibility at the time of acquisition and had no
    probable alternative future use.

For acquisitions completed during 2006, 2005 and 2004, the
    purchase price allocated to acquired in-process research and
    development was determined through established valuation
    techniques. The acquired in-process research and development was
    immediately expensed because technological feasibility had not
    been established, and no future alternative use existed. The
    write-off of acquired in-process research and development is a
    component of operating expenses in the Consolidated Income
    Statements.

Described below are the write-offs of acquired in-process
    research and development charges in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004.

GOODWILL
    AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES

Goodwill

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
    Other Intangible Assets,” Cadence conducts an annual
    impairment analysis of goodwill, which it completed during the
    third quarter of 2006. Based on the results of the impairment
    review, Cadence determined that no indicators of impairment
    existed for its reporting unit during 2006.



For purposes of SFAS No. 142, Cadence operates under
    one reporting unit. Cadence’s annual impairment review
    process compares the fair value of its reporting unit to its
    carrying value, including the goodwill related to the reporting
    unit. To determine the reporting unit’s fair value, Cadence
    utilized the market valuation approach in the current year
    evaluation.

The market approach provides an estimate of the fair value of
    Cadence based on the total number of Cadence common shares
    outstanding, multiplied by the price per common share. The
    estimated fair value is then compared to the carrying value of
    Cadence’s net assets. If the carrying value of
    Cadence’s net assets is greater than the aggregate market
    value of its common shares outstanding, additional fair value
    analyses are performed on the individual intangible assets,
    including goodwill, to determine if any intangible assets are
    impaired, and, if so, an impairment charge is recorded.

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years
    ended December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005 are as
    follows:

    During the year ended December 31, 2005, Cadence recorded
    other adjustments of $4.4 million in the carrying amount of
    goodwill primarily as a result of a $3.0 million reduction
    for foreign currency translation and a $1.4 million
    reduction due to adjustments to the initial purchase price of
    certain acquisitions, which primarily consists of changes to
    estimated sublease income from facilities acquired as part of
    previous acquisitions.

SALES OF
    INSTALLMENT CONTRACT RECEIVABLES

From

time-to-time,

Cadence transfers installment contract receivables on a
    non-recourse or limited-recourse basis to third party financing
    institutions. These transfers are recorded as sales and
    accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 140,
    “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
    and Extinguishments of Liabilities.” The following table
    shows the amounts of accounts receivable transferred to
    financing institutions on a non-recourse basis in fiscal 2006,
    2005 and 2004:




(In thousands)

Losses on the sale of receivables are included in General and
    administrative expense in the accompanying Consolidated Income
    Statements. The recorded losses are determined based on the
    purchasing financing institution’s review of the credit
    strength of the customers whose installment contract receivables
    are being transferred by Cadence. The following table presents

Non-Marketable
    Securities

Cadence uses either the cost or equity method of accounting to
    account for its long-term, non-marketable investment securities,
    which are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. Net realized gains on the sale of non-marketable
    investments were $19.9 million in 2006, $2.5 million
    in 2005 and $5.7 million in 2004. In addition,
    Cadence’s 1996 Deferred Compensation Venture Investment
    Plan Trust recorded a gain of $2.7 million in 2006. If
    Cadence determines that an

other-than-temporary

decline exists in a non-marketable equity security, Cadence
    writes down the investment to its fair value and records the
    related write-down as an investment loss in the Consolidated
    Income Statements.

Cadence recorded write-downs due to

    cost basis of $2.5 million in 2006, $9.7 million in
    2005 and $1.5 million in 2004. These write-downs are
    included in Other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated
    Income Statements.

In January 2006, KhiMetrics, Inc., a cost method investment held
    by Telos Venture Partners L.P., a limited partnership in which
    Cadence and its 1996 Deferred Compensation Venture Investment
    Plan Trust were the sole limited partners, was sold for
    consideration of $6.53 per share of common stock. Under the
    purchase agreement, 10% of the consideration was held in escrow
    to pay the cost of resolving any claims that could have been
    asserted against KhiMetrics on or before the first anniversary
    of the acquisition. The escrow amount remaining after resolution
    of such claims was distributed to the former stockholders of
    KhiMetrics in January and February 2007. No gain was recorded on
    amounts held in escrow during 2006. In connection with this
    sale, Cadence received approximately $20.2 million in cash
    and recorded a gain of approximately $17.1 million during
    the year ended December 30, 2006. In addition,
    Cadence’s 1996 Deferred Compensation Venture Investment
    Plan Trust received $2.9 million in cash and recorded a
    gain of $2.5 million during the year ended
    December 30, 2006.

Equity
    Method Investments

Cadence’s voting interest in its equity method investments
    ranged from approximately 10% to 46% of the following
    privately-held companies: Accent S.p.a., CoWare, Inc.,
    FyreStorm, Inc., Shanghai SVA Integrated Circuits Co., Ltd.,
    Theta Microelectronics, Inc. and ZCIST Co., Ltd.

    following the quarter in which these gains or losses actually
    occur because it is not practicable to obtain investee financial
    statements prior to the issuance of Cadence’s Consolidated

LEASE
    COMMITMENTS

Equipment and facilities are leased under various operating
    leases expiring at various dates through 2025. Certain of these

NOTE 14.  CONTINGENCIES

Legal
    Proceedings

From time to time, Cadence is involved in various disputes and
    litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of
    business. These include disputes and lawsuits related to
    intellectual property, mergers and acquisitions, licensing,
    contracts, distribution arrangements and employee relations
    matters. Periodically, Cadence reviews the status of each
    significant matter and assesses its potential financial
    exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal
    proceeding is considered probable and the amount or the range of
    loss can be estimated, Cadence accrues a liability for the
    estimated loss in accordance with SFAS No. 5,
    “Accounting for Contingencies.” Legal proceedings are
    subject to uncertainties, and the outcomes are difficult to
    predict. Because of such uncertainties, accruals are based only
    on the best information available at the time. As additional
    information becomes available, Cadence reassesses the potential
    liability related to pending claims and litigation matters and
    may revise estimates.

On November 8, 2006, an individual filed suit against
    Cadence, Magma Design Automation, Inc., Dynalith Systems, Inc.,
    Altera Corp., Mentor Graphics Corp. and Aldec, Inc. in the
    United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.
    The suit alleges that certain products of Cadence and the other
    defendants infringe a patent for an electronic simulation and
    emulation system owned by the plaintiff. The plaintiff seeks
    unspecified damages and attorneys’ fees and costs. Cadence
    disputes the plaintiff’s claims and intends to defend the
    lawsuit vigorously.

While the outcome of these litigation matters cannot be
    predicted with any certainty, management does not believe that
    the outcome of any current matters will have a material adverse
    effect on Cadence’s consolidated financial position or
    results of operations.

Other
    Contingencies

Cadence provides its customers with a warranty on sales of
    hardware products for a

90-day

period. These warranties are accounted for in accordance with
    SFAS No. 5. To date, Cadence has not incurred any
    significant costs related to warranty obligations.

Cadence’s product license and services agreements include a
    limited indemnification provision for claims from third parties
    relating to Cadence’s intellectual property. Such
    indemnification provisions are accounted for in accordance with
    SFAS No. 5. The indemnification is generally limited
    to the amount paid by the customer. To date, claims under such
    indemnification provisions have not been significant.



The IRS and other tax authorities regularly examine
    Cadence’s income tax returns. In November 2003, the IRS
    completed its field examination of Cadence’s federal income
    tax returns for the tax years 1997 through 1999 and issued a
    Revenue Agent’s Report, or RAR, in which the IRS proposes
    to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year period
    of approximately $143.0 million. The most significant of
    the disputed adjustments for the tax years 1997 through 1999
    relates to transfer pricing arrangements that Cadence has with a
    foreign subsidiary. Cadence has filed a protest to certain of
    the proposed adjustments with the Appeals Office of the IRS
    where the matter is currently being considered.

In July 2006, the IRS completed its field examination of
    Cadence’s federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000
    through 2002 and issued an RAR, in which the IRS proposes to
    assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year period of
    approximately $324.0 million. In November 2006, the IRS
    revised the proposed aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year
    period to be approximately $318.0 million. The IRS is
    contesting Cadence’s qualification for deferred recognition
    of certain proceeds received from restitution and settlement in
    connection with litigation during the period. The proposed tax
    deficiency for this item is approximately $152.0 million.
    The remaining proposed tax deficiency of approximately
    $166.0 million is primarily related to proposed adjustments
    to Cadence’s transfer pricing arrangements that it has with
    foreign subsidiaries and to Cadence’s deductions for
    foreign trade income. The IRS took similar positions with
    respect to Cadence’s transfer pricing arrangements in the
    prior examination period and may make similar claims against
    Cadence’s transfer pricing arrangements in future
    examinations. Cadence has filed a timely protest with the IRS
    and will seek resolution of the issues through the Appeals
    Office of the IRS.

Cadence believes that the proposed IRS adjustments are
    inconsistent with applicable tax laws and Cadence is challenging
    these proposed adjustments vigorously. The RARs are not final
    Statutory Notices of Deficiency but the IRS imposes interest on
    the proposed deficiencies until the matters are resolved.
    Interest is compounded daily at rates published by the IRS,
    which rates are adjusted quarterly and have been between four
    and ten percent since 1997.

Significant judgment is required in determining Cadence’s
    provision for income taxes. The calculation of Cadence’s
    tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the
    application of complex tax regulations. In determining the
    adequacy of our provision for income taxes, Cadence regularly
    assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax
    examinations including the RARs for the tax years 1997 through
    2002. Cadence provides for tax liabilities on its Consolidated
    Balance Sheets unless Cadence considers it probable that
    additional taxes will not be due. However, the ultimate outcome
    of tax examinations, including the total amount payable or the
    timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues,
    cannot be predicted with certainty. In addition, Cadence cannot
    assure you that such amount will not be materially different
    than that which is reflected in its historical income tax
    provisions and accruals. Should the IRS or other tax authorities
    assess additional taxes as a result of a current or a future
    examination, Cadence may be required to record charges to
    operations in future periods that could have a material impact
    on the results of operations, financial position or cash flows
    in the applicable period or periods.

NOTE 15.  NET
    INCOME PER SHARE

Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income,
    the numerator, by the weighted average number of shares of
    common stock outstanding, less unvested restricted stock, the
    denominator, during the period. Diluted net income per share
    gives effect to equity instruments considered to be potential
    common shares, if dilutive, computed using the treasury stock
    method of accounting.

Cadence accounts for the effect of its Zero Coupon Zero Yield
    Senior Convertible Notes due 2023, or the 2023 Notes, in the
    diluted earnings per common share calculation using the
    if-converted method of accounting. Under that method, the 2023
    Notes are assumed to be converted to shares (weighted for the
    number of days outstanding in the period) at a conversion price
    of $15.65, and amortization of transaction fees, net of taxes,
    related to the 2023 Notes is added back to net income.

EITF

No. 04-08,

“Accounting Issues Related to Certain Features of
    Contingently Convertible Debt and the Effect on Diluted Earnings
    per Share,” requires Cadence to include in diluted earnings
    per share the shares of Cadence’s common stock into which
    the Convertible Senior Notes will be converted. However, since
    the



Convertible Senior Notes meet the qualification of an Instrument
    C under EITF

No. 90-19,

“Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed
    to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own
    Stock,” and because cash will be paid for the principal
    amount of the obligation upon conversion, the only shares that
    will be considered for inclusion in diluted EPS are those
    relating to the excess of the conversion premium over the
    principal amount, using the “if-converted” method. As
    of December 30, 2006, no shares are included in diluted EPS
    for the Convertible Senior Notes.

    and denominator used in the basic and diluted net income per

NOTE 16.  STOCK
    REPURCHASE PROGRAMS

In August 2001, the Cadence Board of Directors authorized a
    program to repurchase shares of Cadence’s common stock in
    the open market with a value of up to $500.0 million in the
    aggregate, which amount was exhausted during February 2006. In
    February 2006, the Cadence Board of Directors authorized a new
    program to repurchase shares of Cadence common stock in the open
    market with a value of up to $500.0 million in the
    aggregate. In November 2006, Cadence’s Board of Directors
    authorized a new program to repurchase shares of Cadence’s
    common stock in the open market with a value of up to an
    additional $500.0 million in the aggregate.

NOTE 17.  EMPLOYEE
    AND DIRECTOR BENEFIT PLANS

Cadence maintains a 401(k) savings plan to provide retirement
    benefits through tax-deferred salary deductions for all of its
    United States employees. Cadence may make discretionary
    contributions, as determined by the Board of Directors, which
    cannot exceed a specified percentage of the annual aggregate
    salaries of those employees eligible to participate. Cadence
    made total contributions to the plan of $11.4 million in
    2006, $10.8 million in 2005, and $9.6 million in 2004.

Executive Officers and Directors may also elect to defer
    compensation payable to them under Cadence’s 1994
    Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan. Deferred compensation
    payments are held in accounts with values indexed to the
    performance of selected mutual funds or money market accounts.
    These investments are classified as trading securities on
    Cadence’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and gains and losses
    are recognized as income (expense) in the Consolidated Income
    Statements. Net recognized appreciation (depreciation) of

NOTE 19.  RESTRUCTURING
    AND OTHER CHARGES

Cadence initiated a separate plan of restructuring in each year
    from 2001 through 2005 in an effort to operate more productively
    while improving operating margins and cash flows. The
    restructuring plans initiated each year from 2001 through 2005,
    or the 2001 Restructuring, 2002 Restructuring, 2003
    Restructuring, 2004 Restructuring and 2005 Restructuring,
    respectively, were intended to decrease costs through workforce
    reductions and facility and resource consolidation, in order to
    improve Cadence’s cost structure. The 2001 and 2002
    Restructurings primarily related to Cadence’s design
    services business and certain other business or infrastructure
    groups throughout the world. The 2003 Restructuring, 2004
    Restructuring and 2005 Restructuring were targeted at reducing
    costs throughout the company. The 2004 Restructuring has been
    completed and there was no remaining balance accrued for this
    restructuring as of December 30, 2006.

The initial facility closure and space reduction costs included
    in these restructurings were comprised of payments required
    under leases, less any applicable estimated sublease income
    after the properties were abandoned, lease buyout costs and
    other contractual charges. To estimate the initial lease loss,
    which is the loss after Cadence’s cost recovery efforts
    from subleasing all or part of a building, Cadence management
    made certain assumptions related to the time period over which
    the relevant building would remain vacant and sublease terms,
    including sublease rates and contractual common area charges.

Each reporting period, Cadence evaluates the adequacy of the
    lease loss accrual for each plan of restructuring. Cadence
    adjusts the lease loss accrual for changes in real estate
    markets or other factors that may affect estimated costs or
    sublease income. Cadence also considers executed sublease
    agreements and adjusts the lease loss accrual if sublease income
    under the agreement differs from initial estimates.

During 2005, in conjunction with the workforce reduction in
    Cadence’s European design services business, Cadence
    completed a sale-leaseback transaction involving land and a
    building in Livingston, Scotland. Proceeds from the sale were
    $33.6 million and the total gain on the sale was
    $3.6 million. Cadence leased back a portion of the facility
    for two years following the date of sale and another portion for
    ten years from the date of sale, with an option to terminate the
    ten year lease after five years. Cadence deferred the gain on
    the sale and is recognizing the gain ratably over the maximum
    lease term of ten years.

Since 2001, Cadence has recorded facilities consolidation
    charges, net of credits, of $97.0 million related to space
    reductions or facility closures of 49 sites. As of
    December 30, 2006, 28 of these sites had been vacated and
    space reductions had occurred at the remaining 21 sites. Cadence
    expects to pay remaining facilities-related restructuring
    liabilities for all of its restructuring plans prior to 2016.

As of December 30, 2006, Cadence’s accrued estimate of
    the lease loss related to all restructuring activities initiated
    since 2001 was $31.3 million. This amount may be adjusted
    in the future based upon changes in the



assumptions used to estimate the lease loss.

Total restructuring costs accrued as of December 30, 2006
    were $31.3 million, consisting solely of lease losses, of
    which $5.1 million was Accounts payable and accrued
    liabilities and $26.2 million was Other long-term
    liabilities.

Restructuring and other charges (credits) recorded by plan of
    restructuring for fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004 are as

Due to the immateriality of the 2003 Restructuring, 2002
    Restructuring and 2001 Restructuring, they have been combined in
    the above table.

Cadence’s workforce reduction activities related to the
    2004 Restructuring and the 2005 Restructuring were completed
    prior to December 31, 2005. Cadence recorded a credit
    during the twelve months ended December 30, 2006 to remove
    the remaining severance and benefits accrual related to the 2005
    Restructuring. The other activity recorded in each of the
    restructuring plans for the year ended December 30, 2006
    relates to payment of remaining lease obligations, net of
    sublease payments received, and changes in the estimate related
    to lease loss accruals.



The following tables present activity for the years ended

NOTE 21.  SEGMENT
    REPORTING

SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an
    Enterprise and Related Information,” requires disclosures
    of certain information regarding operating segments, products
    and services, geographic areas of operation and major customers.
    SFAS No. 131 reporting is based upon the
    “management approach”: how management organizes the
    company’s operating segments for which separate financial
    information is (i) available and (ii) evaluated
    regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how
    to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
    Cadence’s chief operating decision maker is its President
    and Chief Executive Officer, or CEO.

Cadence’s CEO reviews Cadence’s consolidated results
    within one operating segment. In making operating decisions, the
    CEO primarily considers consolidated financial information,
    accompanied by disaggregated information about revenues by
    geographic region.

Outside the United States, Cadence markets and supports its
    products and services primarily through its subsidiaries.
    Revenue is attributed to geography based on the country in which
    the customer is domiciled. Long-lived assets are attributed to
    geography based on the country where the assets are located.

The following tables present a summary of revenue by geography
    in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004:

SUBSEQUENT
    EVENT

In January 2007, Cadence completed the sale of certain land and
    buildings in San Jose, California for a sale price of
    $46.5 million. Concurrently with the sale, Cadence leased
    back from the purchaser approximately 262,500 square feet
    of office space, which represents all available space in the
    buildings. The lease agreement includes an initial term of two
    years, with two options to extend the lease for six months each.
    Cadence is obligated to make lease payments related to this
    lease of $2.2 million in 2007, $2.4 million in 2008
    and $0.2 million in 2009.

Cadence received cash payment for the full sale price in January
    2007. During the lease term, Cadence intends to construct an
    additional building located on its San Jose, California
    campus to replace the buildings it sold in this transaction.
