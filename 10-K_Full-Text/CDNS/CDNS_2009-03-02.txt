Factors
    Driving the Electronic Design Automation Industry

During fiscal 2008, the semiconductor industry’s growth
    declined as the overall macroeconomic environment deteriorated.
    Most industry analysts estimate minimal growth for the
    semiconductor industry for 2008, and these industry analysts are
    forecasting a significant decline in semiconductor industry
    revenue for 2009. Since consumer spending on electronics in 2008
    was also negatively impacted by higher energy costs and
    increased unemployment, and corporate spending was impacted by
    the tight credit market, electronics companies faced financial
    challenges in fiscal 2008 and may continue to face such
    challenges in fiscal 2009. Consistent with recent prior years,



semiconductor unit volumes grew during 2008, but average selling
    prices declined. These factors, combined with the current
    macroeconomic environment, impact how electronics companies
    address the traditional challenges of cost, quality, innovation
    and time-to-market associated with highly complex electronics
    systems and IC product development. Electronics companies are
    currently requiring higher levels of productivity from their
    design teams, better predictability in their development
    schedules and higher quality products in order to be competitive
    in the challenging and price-conscious markets they serve.

Electronics companies respond to demand for increased
    functionality and miniaturization in markets that are affected
    by the current macroeconomic environment by combining
    subsystems — such as radio frequency, or RF, wireless
    communication, video signal processing and
    microprocessors — onto a single silicon chip, creating
    a

system-on-chip,

or SoC, or multiple chips into a single chip package in a format
    referred to as

system-in-package,

or SiP. These trends toward subsystem integration have required
    chip makers to find solutions to challenges previously addressed
    by system companies, such as verifying system-level
    functionality and hardware-software interoperability.

SoC designs put many more transistors on each chip, increasing
    the need for tight control over power consumption. This is done
    not only to increase battery life in portable devices, but also
    to minimize energy cost for computing and networking equipment.
    Higher power devices generate more heat, which further increases
    both system cost as well as operating expenses for cooling.
    Evolving semiconductor manufacturing processes with smaller
    features (transistors and wires) and lower supply voltages
    address both of these issues to some degree, but introduce new
    challenges of their own. Contemporary portable electronic
    devices contain chips in which individual features can be as
    small as 45 nanometers, or 45/1,000,000ths of a millimeter.
    Because of the electrical characteristics of the materials used
    to construct the transistors, which are essentially microscopic
    switches, chips continue to consume power even when transistors
    in the device are switched off. To overcome these and other
    power-related issues, specific “low power” design
    techniques must be developed and are most effective if they are
    integrated throughout the design flow, from logic design and
    verification through physical implementation.

Variability in the processes and materials used to manufacture
    silicon chips have become so pervasive at 65 nanometers and
    below that traditional connections between design and
    manufacturing teams are insufficient to ensure chip performance
    and yield. Integrating detailed models of the manufacturing
    process into the chip design environment is desirable so
    engineers can craft a design to avoid or overcome these
    manufacturing process variations. Similarly, manufacturing teams
    can optimize their processes if, along with the design, they are
    provided with information about the most critical parts of the
    chip. However, sharing information between design and
    manufacturing processes is complicated because current data
    formats used to describe the chip design differ from data
    formats used to describe the manufacturing process and control
    the manufacturing equipment. Moreover, design and manufacturing
    most often involve two or more separate companies, since
    multiple companies may participate in the design of the chip and
    in the manufacturing and assembly of the final device.

These trends represent significant new challenges for
    electronics design processes. Specifically, product performance
    and size requirements of the mobile consumer electronics market
    require microelectronic systems to be smaller, consume less
    power and provide multiple functions all in one SoC or SiP. This
    requires designers to pay close attention to many electrical,
    physical and manufacturing effects that were inconsequential in
    previous generations of chip designs. The design challenge
    becomes more complex with each new generation of electronics and
    providers of EDA solutions must deliver products that address
    these technical challenges while improving the productivity,
    predictability and reliability of the design process.

Operating
    Segment

Our chief operating decision maker is our President and Chief
    Executive Officer, or CEO. Our CEO reviews our consolidated

Design
    for Manufacturing

With the advent of silicon manufacturing technologies at
    geometries of 65 nanometer and below, our customers are
    increasingly concerned about manufacturability of their designs.
    The physical layout of each IC requires detailed analysis and
    optimization to ensure that the design can be manufactured in
    volume while performing as expected. Our strategy is to
    integrate DFM awareness into our core design platforms of
    Encounter Digital IC and Virtuoso Custom IC.

Some of our DFM capabilities include:

•

Parasitic extraction products, which take a physical
    representation of a design and determine the electrical
    properties to enable additional simulation and timing analysis;

•

On-chip power distribution for digital, analog and SoC designs;

•

Manufacturing design rule checks to ensure the proposed design
    meets foundry process requirements; and

Analytical and design tools for physical and electrical effects,
    process proximity correction, and yield / failure
    analysis diagnostics.

Our primary focus in DFM is to address manufacturing effects as
    early in the product development process as possible. As a
    result, we are enhancing the DFM awareness of our core Encounter
    Digital IC and Virtuoso Custom IC product offerings. Where
    upstream integration is not possible, Cadence offers certain
    stand alone DFM products. In connection with our cost savings
    initiatives that were implemented during the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2008, we adjusted our roadmaps and investment consistent
    with our current DFM strategy. The changes in our DFM strategy
    resulted in an impairment charge of $42.5 million arising
    from the abandonment and reduction to net realizable value of
    certain identifiable intangible assets.

Third
    Party Programs and Initiatives

In addition to our products, many customers use
    internally-developed design tools or design tools provided by
    other EDA companies, as well as IP available from multiple
    suppliers. We support the use of third-party design products and
    IP through vehicles such as our
    Connections

®

program and through our participation in the OpenAccess
    Coalition, the Power Forward Initiative and other programs and
    initiatives. We also contribute to the development and
    deployment of EDA industry standards.

Maintenance

Customer service and support is critical to the adoption and
    successful use of our products. We provide our customers with
    technical support to facilitate their use of our software and
    hardware solutions.

We offer maintenance to our customers as an integral,
    non-cancelable component of our subscription license agreements,
    as a component of our term license agreements subject to annual
    renewal, or as a separate agreement subject to annual renewal
    for our perpetual license customers.

Our Maintenance revenue was $388.5 million, or 37% of our
    total revenue, during fiscal 2008; $385.2 million, or 24%
    of our total revenue, during fiscal 2007; and
    $366.3 million, or 25% of our total revenue, during fiscal
    2006. For additional description of our Maintenance revenue, see
    the discussion under the heading “Results of
    Operations” under Item 7, “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations,” below.



Services

We offer a number of fee-based services, including engineering
    and education services. These services may be sold separately or
    sold and performed in conjunction with the sale, lease or
    license of our products.

Our Services revenue was $133.5 million, or 13% of our
    total revenue, during fiscal 2008; $125.8 million, or 8% of
    our total revenue, during fiscal 2007; and $134.9 million,
    or 9% of our total revenue, during fiscal 2006. For additional
    description of our Services revenue, see the discussion under
    the heading “Results of Operations” under Item 7,
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations,” below.

Engineering
    Services

We offer engineering services to aid our customers with the
    design of complex ICs and the implementation of key design
    capabilities, including low power, IC packaging and board
    design, mixed-signal design, functional verification, digital
    implementation, analog/mixed-signal and system-level. The
    customers for these services primarily consist of semiconductor
    and systems companies developing products for the consumer,
    communications, military and aerospace and computing markets.
    These ICs range from digital SoCs, analog and RF designs to
    complex mixed-signal ICs.

We offer engineering capabilities to assist customers from
    product concept to volume manufacturing. We leverage our
    experience and knowledge of design techniques, leading practices
    and different design environments to improve the productivity of
    our own and our customers’ engineering teams. Depending on
    the customers’ projects and needs, we work with customers
    using outsourcing, consultative and collaborative offerings. Our
    Virtual Computer-Aided Design, or VCAD, offering enables our
    engineering teams at one or more of our locations to collaborate
    with our customers’ teams located elsewhere in the world
    during the course of their design and engineering projects
    through a secure network infrastructure. We also make our design
    IP portfolio available to customers as part of our technology
    and services solutions. These reusable design and methodology
    components enable us to efficiently deliver our services and
    allow our customers to reduce the design complexity and time to
    market when developing complex SoCs.

Through collaboration with our customers, we are able to design
    advanced ICs and gain direct and early visibility to industry
    design issues that may not be addressed adequately by
    today’s EDA technologies. This enables us to target and
    accelerate the development of new software technology and
    products to satisfy current and future design requirements.

Education
    Services

Our education services offerings can be customized and include
    training programs that are conducted via the internet or in a
    classroom setting. The content of these offerings ranges from
    the latest IC design techniques to methodologies for using the
    most recent features of our EDA products. The primary focus of
    education services is to accelerate our customers’ path to
    productivity in the use of our products and increase awareness
    of the total solution required for engineering success.

Marketing
    and Sales

We generally market our products and provide maintenance and
    services to existing and prospective customers through a direct
    sales force consisting of sales people and applications
    engineers. Applications engineers provide technical pre-sales
    and post-sales support for software products. Due to the
    complexity of many of our EDA products and the electronic design
    process, the sales cycle is generally long, requiring three to
    six months or more. During the sales cycle, our direct sales
    force generally provides technical presentations, product
    demonstrations and support for

on-site

customer evaluation of our solutions. We also use traditional
    marketing approaches to promote our products and services,
    including advertising, direct mail, telemarketing, trade shows,
    public relations and the internet. As EDA products mature and
    become more widely understood by the marketplace, we selectively
    utilize value added resellers to broaden our reach and reduce
    cost of sales. All OrCAD and selected Incisive products are
    primarily marketed through these channels. With respect to
    international sales, we generally market and support our



products and services through our subsidiaries. We also use a
    third-party distributor to sell our products and services to
    certain customers in Japan.

Software
    Licensing Arrangements

We sell software using three license types: subscription, term
    and perpetual. Customers who prefer to license technology for a
    specified, limited period of time will choose either a
    subscription or term license, and customers who prefer to have
    the right to use the technology continuously without time
    restriction will choose a perpetual license. Customers who
    desire to use new technology during the life of the contract
    will select a subscription license, which allows them limited
    access to unspecified new technology on a

when-and-if-available

basis, as opposed to a term or perpetual license, which does not
    include rights to use new technology. Payment terms for
    subscription and term licenses generally provide for payments to
    be made in installments over the license period and payment
    terms for perpetual licenses generally are net 30 days.

We offer a delivery mechanism for term and subscription licenses
    called eDA Cards. eDA cards have an overall “face”
    value amount that customers draw down against as they select
    specific products that are priced based on the particular
    duration of use the customer desires. The selection and
    licensing of the specific products is accomplished through an
    automated on-line system. The card expires when all of the face
    value is consumed, or on the pre-determined expiration date,
    whichever comes first. There are two types of eDA Cards. An eDA
    Gold Card is a term license that enables a customer to access a
    predetermined list of existing products. An eDA Platinum Card is
    a subscription license that enables a customer to access
    existing and new technology.

Our revenue recognition depends on a number of contract-specific
    terms and conditions, including the license type, payment terms,
    creditworthiness of the customer and other factors. For
    additional description of our revenue recognition, see the
    discussion under the heading “Critical Accounting
    Estimates” under Item 7, “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations,” below. Revenue associated with subscription
    licenses is recognized over multiple periods during the license
    term, whereas product revenue associated with term and perpetual
    licenses is generally recognized upon the later of the effective
    date of the license or delivery of the product, assuming all
    other criteria for revenue recognition have been met. The amount
    of product revenue recognized from backlog varies from quarter
    to quarter. The amount of product revenue recognized from
    backlog, as compared to total product revenue, was more than
    half during fiscal 2008 and approximately two-thirds during both
    fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. We are moving to a license mix that
    will result in increased ratable revenue and we expect the
    percentage of product revenue from backlog to increase in future
    years.

Our revenue and results of operations may miss expectations due
    to a shortfall in product revenue generated from current
    transactions or variance in the actual mix of license types
    executed in any given period, and due to other contract-specific
    terms and conditions as discussed above. We are subject to
    greater credit risk on subscription and term licenses, as
    compared to perpetual licenses because of the installment
    payment terms generally associated with those license types.

From time to time, we sell receivables generated by our licenses
    with installment payment terms to third-party financial
    institutions on a non-recourse or limited-recourse basis.

For a further description of our license agreements, revenue
    recognition policies and results of operations, please refer to
    the discussion under the heading “Critical Accounting
    Estimates” under Item 7, “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations,” below.

Research
    and Development

Our investment in research and development was
    $457.9 million during fiscal 2008, $494.0 million
    during fiscal 2007 and $460.1 million during fiscal 2006.

The primary areas of our research and development include SoC
    design, the design of silicon devices in the nanometer range,
    high-performance IC packaging, SiP and PCB design, system-level
    modeling and verification, high-performance logic verification
    technology and hardware/software co-verification. The
    electronics industry combines rapid innovation with rapidly
    increasing design and manufacturing complexity, so we make
    significant



investments in enhancing our current products, as well as
    creating new products and technologies and integrating those
    products and technologies together into segmented solutions.

Our future performance depends largely on our ability to
    maintain and enhance our current product development and
    commercialization, to develop, acquire or operate with new
    products from third parties, and to develop solutions that meet
    increasingly demanding productivity, quality, predictability and
    cost requirements.

Manufacturing
    and Distribution

Our software production consists of configuring the
    customer’s order, recording the product electronically or
    on CD-ROM, and producing unique access keys that allow customers
    to use licensed products. Software and documentation are
    primarily distributed to customers by secure electronic
    delivery. User manuals and other documentation are generally
    available by secure electronic delivery or on CD-ROM, but are
    occasionally supplied in hard copy format.

We perform final assembly and test our hardware verification,
    acceleration and emulation products at our headquarters in
    San Jose, California. Subcontractors manufacture all major
    subassemblies, including all individual PCBs and custom ICs, and
    supply them for qualification and testing before their
    incorporation into the assembled product.

Proprietary
    Technology

Our success depends, in part, upon our proprietary technology.
    We generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade
    secret laws, licenses and restrictive agreements to establish
    and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products.
    Many of our products include software or other intellectual
    property licensed from third parties. We may have to seek new
    licenses or renew existing licenses for third party software and
    other intellectual property in the future. As part of performing
    engineering services for customers, our engineering services
    business uses certain software and other intellectual property
    licensed from third parties, including that of our competitors.

Competition

We compete in the EDA market for products and maintenance
    primarily with three companies: Synopsys, Inc., Mentor Graphics
    Corporation and Magma Design Automation, Inc. We also compete
    with numerous smaller EDA companies, with manufacturers of
    electronic devices that have developed or have the capability to
    develop their own EDA products, and with numerous electronics
    design and consulting companies. We generally compete on the
    basis of product quality, product features, level of integration
    or compatibility with other tools, price, payment terms and
    maintenance offerings.

Our maintenance business flows directly from our product
    business. The competitive issues associated with our maintenance
    business are substantially similar to those for our product
    business in that every maintenance contract is the direct result
    of a product contract, and once we have entered into a product
    contract, maintenance is generally purchased by the customer to
    ensure access to bug fixes and service releases, as and when
    they are made available, and other continued support.

Certain competitive factors in the engineering services business
    as described herein differ from those of the products and
    maintenance businesses. While we do compete with other EDA
    companies in the engineering services business, our principal
    competitors are independent engineering service businesses.
    These companies vary greatly in focus, geographic location,
    capability, cost structure and pricing. In addition,
    manufacturers of electronic devices may be reluctant to purchase
    services from independent vendors, including us, because they
    wish to promote their own internal design departments. We
    compete with these companies by focusing on the design of
    complex analog and digital ICs. It is our strategy to use
    engineering services as a differentiator to further promote our
    products and maintenance businesses.



Backlog

Our backlog as of January 3, 2009 was approximately
    $1.8 billion, as compared to approximately
    $2.0 billion as of December 29, 2007. Backlog consists
    of revenue to be recognized in future fiscal periods after
    January 3, 2009 from a variety of license types which
    generally include, but are not limited to:

•

Subscription licenses for software products;

•

Sale or lease of hardware;

•

Maintenance contracts on hardware and software products;

•

Orders for hardware and software products sold on perpetual and
    term licenses on which customers have delivery dates after
    January 3, 2009;

•

Licenses with payments that are outside our customary
    terms; and

•

The undelivered portion of engineering services contracts.

The substantial majority of our backlog is generated by our
    product and maintenance businesses because customer licenses
    generally include both product and maintenance components.
    Historically, we have not experienced significant cancellations
    of our contracts with customers. However, we occasionally
    reschedule the required completion dates of engineering services
    contracts, which may defer revenue recognition under those
    contracts beyond the original expected completion date. Changes
    in customer license types or payment terms also can impact the
    timing of revenue recognition.

The challenges currently affecting the economy of the United
    States and other regions of the world have impacted our
    customers, who are concentrated in the semiconductor sector, and
    may cause them to delay or default on their payment obligations,
    file for bankruptcy or modify or cancel plans to license our
    products. We have not yet experienced a material level of
    defaults by customers of payment obligations, but any material
    payment default by our customers or significant reductions in
    existing contractual commitments could adversely impact our
    financial condition and operating results.

Revenue
    Seasonality

Historically, orders and revenue have been lowest in our first
    quarter and highest in our fourth quarter, with a material
    decline between the fourth quarter of one year and the first
    quarter of the following year. Due to the current economic
    environment and our previously announced transition to a
    primarily ratable license mix, we did not see the trend of
    higher orders and revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008
    and there can be no assurance we will experience it in the
    future. We still expect the first quarter to remain our lowest
    quarter for orders and revenue.

International
    Operations

We have approximately 55 sales offices, design centers and
    research and development facilities, approximately half of which
    are located outside of the United States. We consider customer
    sales and support requirements, the availability of a skilled
    workforce, and costs and efficiencies, among other relative
    benefits, when determining what operations to locate
    internationally. For additional information regarding our
    international operations, see the discussion under the heading
    “The effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and other
    risks to our international operations may seriously harm our
    financial condition” under Item 1A, “Risk
    Factors” and Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Employees

As of January 3, 2009, we employed approximately 4,900
    individuals, with approximately 1,800 in sales, services,
    marketing, support and manufacturing activities, approximately
    2,400 in product research and development and approximately 700
    in management, administration and finance. During fiscal 2008,
    we initiated a restructuring plan to decrease costs by reducing
    our workforce across the company. This restructuring plan is
    expected to reduce our workforce by at least 625 positions.
    Approximately 300 of the affected employees were still employed
    by us as of January 3, 2009 due to regulatory requirements
    in certain jurisdictions in which we operate. For additional
    description of our restructuring plan, see the discussion under
    the heading “Results of Operations
    — Restructuring and Other Charges” under
    Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and



Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,”
    below. None of our employees is represented by a labor union and
    we have experienced no work stoppages. We believe that our
    employee relations are good.

Item 1A.
    Risk Factors

Our business faces many risks. Described below are what we
    believe to be the material risks that we face. If any of the
    events or circumstances described in the following risks
    actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of
    operations could suffer.

Risks
    Related to Our Business

We are
    subject to the cyclical nature of the integrated circuit and
    electronics systems industries, and any downturn in these
    industries may reduce our revenue.

Purchases of our products and services are dependent upon the
    commencement of new design projects by IC manufacturers and
    electronics systems companies. The IC and electronics systems
    industries are cyclical and are characterized by constant and
    rapid technological change, rapid product obsolescence and price
    erosion, evolving standards, short product life cycles and wide
    fluctuations in product supply and demand.

The IC and electronics systems industries experienced
    significant challenges in 2008 and may continue to face
    challenges in 2009 as a result of a decline in the macroeconomic
    environment. The IC and electronic systems industries also from
    time to time experience downturns in connection with, or in
    anticipation of, maturing product cycles of both these
    industries’ and their customers’ products. As in the
    past, the current economic downturn is characterized by
    diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high
    inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling
    prices. The current economic downturn in the industries we serve
    has contributed to the substantial reduction in our revenue and
    could continue to harm our business, operating results and
    financial condition.

Our
    failure to respond quickly to technological developments could
    make our products uncompetitive and obsolete.

The industries in which we compete experience rapid technology
    developments, changes in industry standards, changes in customer
    requirements and frequent new product introductions and
    improvements. Currently, the industries we serve are
    experiencing the following trends:

•

Migration to nanometer design: the size of features such as
    wires, transistors and contacts on ICs continuously shrink due
    to the ongoing advances in the semiconductor manufacturing
    processes. Process feature sizes refer to the width of the
    transistors and the width and spacing of interconnect on the IC.
    Feature size is normally identified by the transistor length,
    which is shrinking rapidly to 32 nanometers and smaller. This is
    commonly referred to in the semiconductor industry as the
    migration to nanometer design. It represents a major challenge
    for participants in the semiconductor industry, from IC design
    and design automation to design of manufacturing equipment and
    the manufacturing process itself. Shrinkage of transistor length
    to such proportions is challenging the industry in the
    application of more complex physics and chemistry that is needed
    to realize advanced silicon devices. For EDA tools, models of
    each component’s electrical properties and behavior become
    more complex as do requisite analysis, design and verification
    capabilities. Novel design tools and methodologies must be
    invented quickly to remain competitive in the design of
    electronics in the smallest nanometer ranges.

•

The challenges of nanometer design are leading some customers to
    work with older, less risky manufacturing processes. This may
    reduce their need to upgrade or enhance their EDA products and
    design flows.

•

The ability to design SoCs increases the complexity of managing
    a design that, at the lowest level, is represented by billions
    of shapes on the fabrication mask. In addition, SoCs typically
    incorporate microprocessors and digital signal processors that
    are programmed with software, requiring simultaneous design of
    the IC and the related software embedded on the IC.

•

With the availability of seemingly endless gate capacity, there
    is an increase in design reuse, or the combining of
    off-the-shelf design IP with custom logic to create ICs. The
    unavailability of high-quality design IP that can be reliably
    incorporated into a customer’s design with our IC
    implementation products and services could reduce demand for our
    products and services.



•

Increased technological capability of the Field-Programmable
    Gate Array, which is a programmable logic chip, creates an
    alternative to IC implementation for some electronics companies.
    This could reduce demand for our IC implementation products and
    services.

•

A growing number of low-cost engineering services businesses
    could reduce the need for some IC companies to invest in EDA
    products.

If we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these
    trends, we may lose our competitive position, and our products
    or technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete. To compete
    successfully, we must develop or acquire new products and
    improve our existing products and processes on a schedule that
    keeps pace with technological developments and the requirements
    for products addressing a broad spectrum of designers and
    designer expertise in our industries. We must also be able to
    support a range of changing computer software, hardware
    platforms and customer preferences. We cannot guarantee that we
    will be successful in this effort.

We have
    experienced varied operating results, and our operating results
    for any particular fiscal period are affected by the timing of
    significant orders for our software products, fluctuations in
    customer preferences for license types and the timing of revenue
    recognition under those license types.

We have experienced, and may continue to experience, varied
    operating results. In particular, we experienced a net loss
    during fiscal 2008 and we expect to experience a net loss during
    fiscal 2009. Various factors affect our operating results and
    some of them are not within our control. Our operating results
    for any period are affected by the timing of significant orders
    for our software products because a significant number of
    licenses for our software products are in excess of
    $5.0 million.

Our operating results are also affected by the mix of license
    types executed in any given period. We license software using
    three different license types: subscription, term and perpetual.
    Product revenue associated with term and perpetual licenses is
    generally recognized at the beginning of the license period,
    whereas product revenue associated with subscription licenses is
    recognized over multiple periods during the term of the license.
    Revenue may also be deferred under term and perpetual licenses
    until payments become due and payable from customers with
    nonlinear payment terms or as cash is collected from customers
    with lower credit ratings. In addition, revenue is impacted by
    the timing of license renewals, the extent to which contracts
    contain flexible payment terms, changes in existing contractual
    arrangements with customers and the mix of license types (i.e.,
    perpetual, term or subscription) for existing customers, which
    changes could have the effect of accelerating or delaying the
    recognition of revenue from the timing of recognition under the
    original contract. Our license mix has changed such that a
    higher proportion of licenses require ratable revenue
    recognition and we expect the change in our license mix,
    combined with the difficult economic environment, will result in
    a decrease in our revenue for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal
    2008.

We plan operating expense levels primarily based on forecasted
    revenue levels. These expenses and the impact of long-term
    commitments are relatively fixed in the short term. In addition,
    revenue levels are harder to forecast in a difficult economic
    environment. A shortfall in revenue could lead to operating
    results below expectations because we may not be able to quickly
    reduce these fixed expenses in response to these short-term
    business changes.

The majority of our contracts are executed in the final few
    weeks of a fiscal quarter. This makes it difficult to determine
    with accuracy how much business will be executed in each fiscal
    quarter. Due to the volume or complexity of transactions that we
    review at the very end of the quarter, or due to operational
    matters regarding particular agreements, we may not finish
    processing or ship products under some contracts that have been
    signed during that fiscal quarter, which means that the
    associated revenue cannot be recognized in that particular
    period.

You should not view our historical results of operations as
    reliable indicators of our future performance. If our revenue,
    operating results or business outlook for future periods fall
    short of the levels expected by securities analysts or
    investors, the trading price of our common stock could decline.



Our stock
    price has been subject to fluctuations and has experienced a
    significant decline, and may continue to be subject to
    fluctuations and decline.

The market price of our common stock has recently experienced
    significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate in the
    future, and as a result you could lose the value of your
    investment. The market price of our common stock may be affected
    by a number of factors, such as:

•

Announcements of our quarterly operating results and revenue and
    earnings forecasts that fail to meet or are inconsistent with
    earlier projections or the expectations of our securities
    analysts or investors;

•

Changes in our revenue and earnings estimates;

•

Announcements of a restructuring plan;

•

Changes in management;

•

Accounting charges relating to the impairment of goodwill;

•

A gain or loss of a significant customer or market segment share;

•

Announcements of new products by us, our competitors or our
    customers; and

•

Market conditions in the electronics systems and semiconductor
    industries.

In addition, equity markets in general have experienced extreme
    price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of many
    technology companies have decreased substantially, particularly
    electronic systems and semiconductor companies. Such price and
    volume fluctuations may continue to adversely affect the market
    price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our business
    or operating results.

Litigation
    could adversely affect our financial condition or
    operations.

We are currently, and in the future may be, involved in various
    disputes and litigation that arise in the ordinary course of
    business. These include disputes and lawsuits related to
    intellectual property, mergers and acquisitions, licensing,
    contracts, distribution arrangements and employee relations
    matters. We are also currently engaged in several securities
    class actions and derivative lawsuits. For information regarding
    the litigation matters in which we are currently engaged, please
    refer to the discussion under Item 3, “Legal
    Proceedings.” We cannot provide any assurances that the
    final outcome of these lawsuits or any other proceedings that
    may arise in the future will not have a material adverse effect
    on our business, operating results or financial condition.
    Litigation can be time-consuming and expensive and could divert
    management’s time and attention from our business, which
    could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and
    operating results. The adverse resolution of any specific
    lawsuit or proceeding could also have a material adverse effect
    on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash
    flows.

Matters
    relating to or arising from our recent restatement and
    weaknesses in our internal controls could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial
    condition.

In connection with the restatement of our previously issued
    financial statements for the periods ended March 29, 2008
    and June 28, 2008 and our reassessment of our disclosure
    controls and procedures under Item 307 of

Regulation S-K,

management concluded that as of March 29, 2008,
    June 28, 2008 and September 27, 2008, our disclosure
    controls and procedures were not effective and that we had a
    material weakness in our internal control over financial
    reporting. Please refer to the discussion under Item 9A,
    “Controls and Procedures” for further discussion of
    the remediation of this material weakness as of January 3,
    2009. Should we identify any other material weakness and be
    unable to remediate any such other material weakness promptly
    and effectively, such weakness could harm our operating results,
    result in a material misstatement of our financial statements,
    cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations or
    prevent us from providing reliable and accurate financial
    reports or avoiding or detecting fraud. This, in turn, could
    result in a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and
    completeness of our financial reports, which could have an
    adverse effect on our stock price. Any litigation or other
    proceeding or adverse publicity relating to our remediated
    material weakness or any future material weakness could have a
    material adverse effect on our business and operating results.



Our
    operating results and revenue could be adversely affected by
    customer payment delays, customer bankruptcies and defaults or
    modifications of licenses or supplier modifications in response
    to the economic environment.

As a result of challenges currently affecting the economy of the
    United States and other regions of the world, our customers, who
    are concentrated in the semiconductor sector, have experienced
    and may continue to experience adverse changes in their business
    and, as a result, may delay or default on their payment
    obligations, file for bankruptcy or modify or cancel plans to
    license our products, and our suppliers may significantly and
    quickly increase their prices or reduce their output. If our
    customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or
    are precluded from securing financing, they may not be able to
    pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that are owed
    to us, although these obligations are generally not cancelable.
    Our customers’ inability to fulfill payment obligations may
    adversely affect our revenue and cash flow. Additionally, our
    customers may seek to renegotiate pre-existing contractual
    commitments. Though we have not yet experienced a material level
    of defaults, any material payment default by our customers or
    significant reductions in existing contractual commitments would
    have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
    operating results. Because of the escalating challenges in the
    global capital markets and financial institutions, including a
    tightening in the capital and credit markets, if we were to seek
    funding from the capital or credit markets in response to any
    material level of customer defaults, we may not be able to
    secure funding on terms acceptable to us or at all.

Our
    future revenue is dependent in part upon our installed customer
    base continuing to license or buy additional products, renew
    maintenance agreements and purchase additional
    services.

Our installed customer base has traditionally generated
    additional new license, service and maintenance revenues. In
    future periods, customers may not necessarily license or buy
    additional products or contract for additional services or
    maintenance. Maintenance is generally renewable annually at a
    customer’s option, and there are no mandatory payment
    obligations or obligations to license additional software. If
    our customers decide not to renew their maintenance agreements
    or license additional products or contract for additional
    services, or if they reduce the scope of the maintenance
    agreements, our revenue could decrease, which could have an
    adverse effect on our operating results. Our customers, which
    include large semiconductor companies, often have significant
    bargaining power in negotiations with us. Mergers or
    acquisitions of our customers can reduce the total level of
    purchases of our software and services, and in some cases,
    increase customers’ bargaining power in negotiations with
    their suppliers, including us.

We depend
    upon our management team and key employees, and our management
    changes or our failure to attract, train, motivate and retain
    management and key employees may make us less competitive in our
    industries and therefore harm our results of
    operations.

Our business depends upon the efforts and abilities of our
    executive officers and other key employees, including key
    development personnel. From time to time, there may be changes
    in our management team resulting from the hiring and departure
    of executive officers. On October 15, 2008, we announced
    the resignations of our President and Chief Executive Officer,
    Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer,
    Executive Vice President — Worldwide Field Operations,
    Executive Vice President — Products and Technologies
    Organization and Executive Vice President — Corporate
    Affairs. On January 8, 2009, we announced that Lip-Bu Tan
    was appointed our new President and Chief Executive Officer. As
    we undergo this transition, we may experience disruption to our
    business that may harm our operating results and our
    relationships with our employees, customers and suppliers may be
    adversely affected. In addition, our competitors may seek to use
    this transition and the related potential disruptions to gain a
    competitive advantage over us.

Competition for highly skilled executive officers and employees
    can be intense, particularly in geographic areas recognized as
    high technology centers such as the Silicon Valley area, where
    our principal offices are located, and the other locations where
    we maintain facilities. To attract, retain and motivate
    individuals with the requisite expertise, we may be required to
    grant large numbers of stock options or other stock-based
    incentive awards, which may be dilutive to existing stockholders
    and increase compensation expense, and pay significant base
    salaries and cash bonuses, which could harm our operating
    results. The high cost of training new employees, not fully
    utilizing



these employees, or losing trained employees to competing
    employers could also reduce our gross margins and harm our
    business or operating results.

In addition, the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules require stockholder
    approval for new equity compensation plans and significant
    amendments to existing plans, including increases in shares
    available for issuance under such plans, and prohibit NASDAQ
    member organizations from giving a proxy to vote on equity
    compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has
    given voting instructions. These regulations could make it more
    difficult for us to grant equity compensation to employees in
    the future. To the extent that these regulations make it more
    difficult or expensive to grant equity compensation to
    employees, we may incur increased compensation costs or find it
    difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, which could
    materially and adversely affect our business.

We may
    not be able to effectively implement our restructuring plans,
    and our restructuring plans may not result in the expected
    benefits, which would negatively impact our future results of
    operations.

During fiscal 2008, we initiated a restructuring plan in an
    effort to align our cost structure with expected revenue. This
    restructuring plan is intended to decrease costs throughout our
    company. We cannot assure you that we will be able to
    successfully complete and realize the expected benefits of our
    restructuring plan, such as improvements in operating margins
    and cash flows, in the restructuring periods contemplated. The
    restructuring plan may involve higher costs or a longer
    timetable than we currently anticipate or it may fail to improve
    our results of operations as we anticipate. Our inability to
    realize these benefits may result in an inefficient business
    structure that could negatively impact our results of
    operations. We also expect our restructuring plan to cause us to
    incur substantial costs related to severance and other
    employee-related costs. Our restructuring plan may also subject
    us to litigation risks and expenses. In addition, our
    restructuring plan may have other consequences, such as
    attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce or a
    negative impact on employee morale and our competitors may seek
    to gain a competitive advantage over us. Together with our
    changes in management, the restructuring plan could also cause
    our remaining employees to leave or result in reduced
    productivity by our remaining employees, which in turn may
    affect our revenue and other operating results in the future.

We may
    not receive significant revenue from our current research and
    development efforts for several years, if at all.

Developing EDA technology and integrating acquired technology
    into existing platforms is expensive, and these investments
    often require a long time to generate returns. Our strategy
    involves significant investments in research and development and
    related product opportunities. We believe that we must continue
    to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research
    and development efforts in order to maintain our competitive
    position. However, we cannot predict that we will receive
    significant, if any, revenue from these investments.

The
    competition in our industries is substantial and we may not be
    able to continue to successfully compete in our
    industries.

The EDA market and the commercial electronics engineering
    services industries are highly competitive. If we fail to
    compete successfully in these industries, it could seriously
    harm our business, operating results or financial condition. To
    compete in these industries, we must identify and develop or
    acquire innovative and cost-competitive EDA products, integrate
    them into platforms and market them in a timely manner. We must
    also gain industry acceptance for our engineering services and
    offer better strategic concepts, technical solutions, prices and
    response time, or a combination of these factors, than those of
    other design companies and the internal design departments of
    electronics manufacturers. We cannot assure you that we will be
    able to compete successfully in these industries. Factors that
    could affect our ability to succeed include:

•

The development by others of competitive EDA products or
    platforms and engineering services, which could result in a
    shift of customer preferences away from our products and
    services and significantly decrease revenue;

•

Decisions by electronics manufacturers to perform engineering
    services internally, rather than purchase these services from
    outside vendors due to budget constraints or excess engineering
    capacity;



•

The challenges of developing (or acquiring externally-developed)
    technology solutions that are adequate and competitive in
    meeting the requirements of next-generation design challenges;

•

The significant number of current and potential competitors in
    the EDA industry and the low cost of entry;

•

Intense competition to attract acquisition targets, which may
    make it more difficult for us to acquire companies or
    technologies at an acceptable price or at all; and

•

The combination of or collaboration among many EDA companies to
    deliver more comprehensive offerings than they could
    individually.

We compete in the EDA products market with Synopsys, Inc., Magma
    Design Automation, Inc. and Mentor Graphics Corporation. We also
    compete with numerous smaller EDA companies, with manufacturers
    of electronic devices that have developed or have the capability
    to develop their own EDA products, and with numerous electronics
    design and consulting companies. Manufacturers of electronic
    devices may be reluctant to purchase engineering services from
    independent vendors such as us because they wish to promote
    their own internal design departments.

We may
    need to change our pricing models to compete
    successfully.

The highly competitive markets in which we compete can put
    pressure on us to reduce the prices of our products. If our
    competitors offer deep discounts on certain products in an
    effort to recapture or gain market segment share or to sell
    other software or hardware products, we may then need to lower
    our prices or offer other favorable terms to compete
    successfully. Any such changes would be likely to reduce our
    profit margins and could adversely affect our operating results.
    Any substantial changes to our prices and pricing policies could
    cause sales and software license revenues to decline or be
    delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust
    to the new pricing policies. Some of our competitors may bundle
    products for promotional purposes or as a long-term pricing
    strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product
    implementations. These practices could, over time, significantly
    constrain the prices that we can charge for our products. If we
    cannot offset price reductions with a corresponding increase in
    the number of sales or with lower spending, then the reduced
    license revenues resulting from lower prices could have an
    adverse effect on our results of operations.

We have
    acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses
    and may not realize the expected benefits of these
    acquisitions.

We have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and
    businesses in the future. While we expect to carefully analyze
    each potential acquisition before committing to the transaction,
    we may not consummate any particular transaction, which can
    nevertheless result in significant costs, or if a transaction is
    consummated, we may not be able to integrate and manage acquired
    products and businesses effectively. In addition, acquisitions
    involve a number of risks. If any of the following events occurs
    after we acquire another business, it could seriously harm our
    business, operating results or financial condition:

•

Difficulties in combining previously separate businesses into a
    single unit;

•

The substantial diversion of management’s attention from
    day-to-day business when evaluating and negotiating these
    transactions and integrating an acquired business;

•

The discovery, after completion of the acquisition, of
    liabilities assumed from the acquired business or of assets
    acquired for which we cannot realize the anticipated value and
    the exposure to such assumed liabilities;

•

The failure to realize anticipated benefits such as cost savings
    and revenue enhancements;

•

The failure to retain key employees of the acquired business;

•

Difficulties related to integrating the products of an acquired
    business in, for example, distribution, engineering and customer
    support areas;

•

Unanticipated costs;

•

Customer dissatisfaction with existing license agreements with
    us, which may dissuade them from licensing or buying products
    acquired by us after the effective date of the license; and

•

The failure to understand and compete effectively in markets in
    which we have limited experience.



In a number of our previously completed acquisitions, we have
    agreed to make future payments, either in the form of employee
    bonuses or contingent purchase price payments, or earnouts,
    based on the performance of the acquired businesses or the
    employees who joined us with the acquired businesses. The
    performance goals pursuant to which these future payments may be
    made generally relate to achievement by the acquired business or
    the employees who joined us with the acquired business of
    certain specified bookings, revenue, run rate, product
    proliferation, product development or employee retention goals
    during a specified period following completion of the applicable
    acquisition. Future acquisitions may involve issuances of stock
    as full or partial payment of the purchase price for the
    acquired business, grants of incentive stock or options to
    employees of the acquired businesses (which may be dilutive to
    existing stockholders), expenditure of substantial cash
    resources or the incurrence of material amounts of debt.

The specific performance goal levels and amounts and timing of
    employee bonuses or contingent purchase price payments vary with
    each acquisition. While we expect to derive value from an
    acquisition in excess of such contingent payment obligations,
    our strategy may change and we may be required to make certain
    contingent payments without deriving the anticipated value. In
    connection with our acquisitions completed before
    January 3, 2009, we may be obligated to pay up to an
    aggregate of $51.0 million in cash during the next
    44 months if certain defined performance goals are achieved
    in full, which would be expensed as compensation expense in our
    Consolidated Statements of Operations.

In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or
    FASB, issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard, or
    SFAS, No. 141R, “Business Combinations,” which
    will change how business acquisitions are accounted for and will
    impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in
    subsequent periods. SFAS No. 141R is effective for
    fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Early
    adoption is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the
    impact that SFAS No. 141R will have on our
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

We rely
    on our proprietary technology as well as software and other
    intellectual property rights licensed to us by third parties,
    and we cannot assure you that the precautions taken to protect
    our rights will be adequate or that we will continue to be able
    to adequately secure such intellectual property rights from
    third parties.

Our success depends, in part, upon our proprietary technology.
    We generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade
    secret laws, licenses and restrictive agreements to establish
    and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products.
    Despite precautions we may take to protect our intellectual
    property, third parties have tried in the past, and may try in
    the future, to challenge, invalidate or circumvent these
    safeguards. The rights granted under our patents or attendant to
    our other intellectual property may not provide us with any
    competitive advantages and there is no guarantee that patents
    will be issued on any of our pending applications and future
    patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology.
    Furthermore, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our
    proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as
    applicable law protects these rights in the United States. The
    protection of our intellectual property may require the
    expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.
    Litigation can be time-consuming and expensive and could divert
    management’s time and attention from our business, which
    could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and
    operating results. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our
    intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or
    prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our
    proprietary rights. Many of our products include software or
    other intellectual property licensed from third parties. We may
    have to seek new or renew existing licenses for such software
    and other intellectual property in the future. Our engineering
    services business holds licenses to certain software and other
    intellectual property owned by third parties, including that of
    our competitors. Our failure to obtain software or other
    intellectual property licenses or other intellectual property
    rights that is necessary or helpful for our business on
    favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation over these
    licenses or rights, could seriously harm our business, operating
    results or financial condition.



We could
    lose key technology or suffer serious harm to our business
    because of the infringement of our intellectual property rights
    by third parties or because of our infringement of the
    intellectual property rights of third parties.

There are numerous patents in the EDA industry and new patents
    are being issued at a rapid rate. It is not always practicable
    to determine in advance whether a product or any of its
    components infringes the patent rights of others. As a result,
    from time to time, we may be compelled to respond to or
    prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to protect
    our rights or defend a customer’s rights.

Intellectual property infringement claims, regardless of merit,
    could consume valuable management time, result in costly
    litigation, or cause product shipment delays, all of which could
    seriously harm our business, operating results or financial
    condition. In settling these claims, we may be required to enter
    into royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties
    claiming infringement. These royalty or licensing agreements, if
    available, may not have terms favorable to us. Being compelled
    to enter into a license agreement with unfavorable terms could
    seriously harm our business, operating results or financial
    condition. Any potential intellectual property litigation could
    compel us to do one or more of the following:

•

Pay damages (including the potential for treble damages),
    license fees or royalties (including royalties for past periods)
    to the party claiming infringement;

•

Stop licensing products or providing services that use the
    challenged intellectual property;

•

Obtain a license from the owner of the infringed intellectual
    property to sell or use the relevant technology, which license
    may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all; or

•

Redesign the challenged technology, which could be
    time-consuming and costly, or not be accomplished.

If we were compelled to take any of these actions, our business
    or operating results may suffer.

If our
    security measures are breached and an unauthorized party obtains
    access to customer data, our information systems may be
    perceived as being unsecure and customers may curtail or stop
    their use of our products and services.

Our products and services involve the storage and transmission
    of customers’ proprietary information, and breaches of our
    security measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of
    this information, litigation and potential liability. Because
    techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage
    information systems change frequently and generally are not
    recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to
    anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive
    measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security
    occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our
    security measures could be harmed and we could lose existing
    customers and our ability to obtain new customers.

The long
    sales cycle of our products and services makes the timing of our
    revenue difficult to predict and may cause our operating results
    to fluctuate unexpectedly.

Generally, we have a long sales cycle that can extend up to six
    months or longer. The length of the sales cycle may cause our
    revenue or operating results to vary from quarter to quarter.
    The complexity and expense associated with our business
    generally require a lengthy customer education, evaluation and
    approval process. Consequently, we may incur substantial
    expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to
    develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements
    or revenue and may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities.

In addition, sales of our products and services have been and
    may in the future be delayed if customers delay approval or
    commencement of projects because of:

•

The timing of customers’ competitive evaluation
    processes; or

•

Customers’ budgetary constraints and budget cycles.

Long sales cycles for acceleration and emulation hardware
    products subject us to a number of significant risks over which
    we have limited control, including insufficient, excess or
    obsolete inventory, variations in inventory valuation and
    fluctuations in quarterly operating results.



The majority of our contracts are executed in the final few
    weeks of a fiscal quarter. This makes it difficult to determine
    with accuracy how much business will be executed in each fiscal
    quarter. Also, because of the timing of large orders and our
    customers’ buying patterns, we may not learn of bookings
    shortfalls, revenue shortfalls, earnings shortfalls or other
    failures to meet market expectations until late in a fiscal
    quarter. These factors may cause our operating results to
    fluctuate unexpectedly, which can cause significant fluctuations
    in the trading price of our common stock.

We may
    not be able to sell certain installment contracts to generate
    cash, which may impact our operating cash flows for any
    particular fiscal period.

We sell certain installment contracts to certain financial
    institutions on a non-recourse or limited-recourse basis to
    generate cash. Our ability to complete these sales of
    installment contracts is affected by a number of factors,
    including the:

•

Economic conditions in the securities markets;

•

Credit policies of the financial institutions; and

•

Credit quality of customers whose installment contracts we wish
    to sell.

Disruptions in the financial markets have and may continue to
    adversely impact the availability and cost of financing
    transactions for the installment contract sales that we have
    already arranged or may arrange. As a result of the credit
    losses recorded by banks during 2008 and the current financial
    challenges experienced by banks, a number of banks have become
    less willing to purchase assets because of capital constraints
    and concerns about over-exposure to the technology sector. In
    addition, the change in our license mix will result in an
    increased number of subscription licenses and a decrease in the
    sale of receivables to financial institutions, so we expect a
    reduced level of Proceeds from the sale of receivables
    throughout fiscal 2009. If we are unable to sell certain
    installment contracts, our operating cash flows would be
    adversely affected. There can be no assurance that funding will
    be available to us or, if available, that it will be on terms
    acceptable to us. If sources of funding are not available to us
    on a regular basis for any reason, including the occurrence of
    events of default, deterioration in credit quality in the
    underlying pool of receivables or otherwise, it would have a
    material adverse effect on our operating cash flows.

The
    effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and other risks to
    our international operations may seriously harm our financial
    condition.

We have significant operations outside the United States. Our
    revenue from international operations as a percentage of total
    revenue was approximately 58% during fiscal 2008, 54% during
    fiscal 2007 and 48% during fiscal 2006. We expect that revenue
    from our international operations will continue to account for a
    significant portion of our total revenue. We also transact
    business in various foreign currencies, primarily the Japanese
    yen. The volatility of foreign currencies in certain regions,
    most notably the Japanese yen, European Union euro, British
    pound and Indian rupee have had, and may in the future have, a
    harmful effect on our revenue or operating results.

Fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the United States
    dollar and the currencies of other countries in which we conduct
    business could seriously harm our business, operating results or
    financial condition. For example, when a foreign currency
    declines in value relative to the United States dollar, it takes
    more of the foreign currency to purchase the same amount of
    United States dollars than before the change. If we price our
    products and services in the foreign currency, we receive fewer
    United States dollars than we did before the change. If we price
    our products and services in United States dollars, the decrease
    in value of the local currency results in an increase in the
    price for our products and services compared to those products
    of our competitors that are priced in local currency. This could
    result in our prices being uncompetitive in markets where
    business is transacted in the local currency. On the other hand,
    when a foreign currency increases in value relative to the
    United States dollar, it takes more United States dollars to
    purchase the same amount of the foreign currency. As we use the
    foreign currency to pay for payroll costs and other operating
    expenses in our international operations, this results in an
    increase in operating expenses.

Exposure to foreign currency transaction risk can arise when
    transactions are conducted in a currency different from the
    functional currency of one of our subsidiaries. A
    subsidiary’s functional currency is generally the currency
    in which it primarily conducts its operations, including product
    pricing, expenses and borrowings. Although we



attempt to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations,
    significant exchange rate movements may hurt our results of
    operations as expressed in United States dollars.

Our international operations may also be subject to other risks,
    including:

•

The adoption or expansion of government trade restrictions;

•

Limitations on repatriation of earnings;

•

Limitations on the conversion of foreign currencies;

•

Reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some
    countries;

•

Recessions in foreign economies;

•

Longer collection periods for receivables and greater difficulty
    in collecting accounts receivable;

•

Difficulties in managing foreign operations;

•

Political and economic instability;

•

Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;

•

Tariffs and other trade barriers; and

•

United States and other governments’ licensing requirements
    for exports, which may lengthen the sales cycle or restrict or
    prohibit the sale or licensing of certain products.

We have offices throughout the world, including key research and
    development facilities outside of the United States. Our
    operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations
    throughout the world. Activities that interfere with our
    international connectivity, such as computer hacking or the
    introduction of a virus into our computer systems, could
    significantly interfere with our business operations.

Our
    operating results could be adversely affected as a result of
    changes in our effective tax rates.

Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by
    the following:

•

Earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we are
    taxed at lower rates as compared to the United States federal
    and state statutory tax rates;

•

An increase in expenses not deductible for tax purposes,
    including certain stock-based compensation, write-offs of
    acquired in-process technology and impairment of goodwill;

•

Changes in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax
    assets;

•

Changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws;

•

Changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information that
    results in a recognition, derecognition, or change in
    measurement of a tax position taken in a prior period;

•

Increases to interest expenses classified in the financial
    statements as income taxes;

•

New accounting standards or interpretations of such standards;

•

A change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest foreign
    earnings outside the United States; or

•

Results of tax examinations by the Internal Revenue Service, or
    IRS, and state and foreign tax authorities.

Any significant change in our future effective tax rates could
    adversely impact our results of operations for future periods.

We have
    received an examination report from the IRS proposing
    deficiencies in certain of our tax returns, and the outcome of
    current and future tax examinations may have a material adverse
    effect on our results of operations and cash flows.

The IRS and other tax authorities regularly examine our income
    tax returns. In July 2006, the IRS completed its field
    examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years
    2000 through 2002 and issued a Revenue Agents Report, or RAR, in
    which the IRS proposed to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for
    the three-year period of approximately $324.0 million. In
    November 2006, the IRS revised the proposed aggregate tax
    deficiency for the three-year period to be approximately
    $318.0 million. The IRS is contesting our qualification for
    deferred recognition of certain proceeds received from
    restitution and settlement in connection with litigation during
    the period. The proposed tax deficiency for this item is
    approximately $152.0 million. The remaining proposed tax
    deficiency of approximately $166.0 million is primarily
    related to proposed adjustments to our transfer pricing



arrangements with foreign subsidiaries and to our deductions for
    foreign trade income. The IRS may make similar claims against
    our transfer pricing arrangements and deductions for foreign
    trade income in future examinations. We have filed a timely
    protest with the IRS and are seeking resolution of the issues
    through the Appeals Office of the IRS, or the Appeals Office.

We believe that the proposed IRS adjustments are inconsistent
    with applicable tax laws and we are vigorously challenging these
    proposed adjustments. The RAR is not a final Statutory Notice of
    Deficiency but the IRS imposes interest on the proposed
    deficiencies until the matters are resolved. Interest is
    compounded daily at rates published and adjusted quarterly by
    the IRS and have been between 4% and 10% since 2001. The IRS is
    currently examining our federal income tax returns for the tax
    years 2003 through 2005.

Significant judgment is required in applying the principles of
    FASB Interpretation, or FIN, No. 48, “Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109” and SFAS No. 109,
    “Accounting for Income Taxes.” The calculation of our
    provision for income taxes involves dealing with uncertainties
    in the application of complex tax laws and regulations. In
    determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, we
    regularly assess the potential settlement outcomes resulting
    from income tax examinations. However, the final outcome of tax
    examinations, including the total amount payable or the timing
    of any such payments upon resolution of these issues, cannot be
    estimated with certainty. In addition, we cannot be certain that
    such amount will not be materially different than that which is
    reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals.
    Should the IRS or other tax authorities assess additional taxes
    as a result of a current or a future examination, we may be
    required to record charges to operations in future periods that
    could have a material impact on the results of operations,
    financial position or cash flows in the applicable period or
    periods.

Forecasting
    our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject
    to uncertainty, and material differences between forecasted and
    actual tax rates could have a material impact on our results of
    operations.

Forecasts of our income tax position and resultant effective tax
    rate are complex and subject to uncertainty because our income
    tax position for each year combines the effects of estimating
    our annual income or loss, the mix of profits and losses earned
    by us and our subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad
    range of income tax rates, as well as benefits from available
    deferred tax assets, the impact of various accounting rules and
    changes to these rules and results of tax audits. To forecast
    our global tax rate, pre-tax profits and losses by jurisdiction
    are estimated and tax expense by jurisdiction is calculated. If
    our estimate of the pre-tax profit and losses, the mix of our
    profits and losses, our ability to use deferred tax assets, the
    results of tax audits, or effective tax rates by jurisdiction is
    different than those estimates, our actual tax rate could be
    materially different than forecasted, which could have a
    material impact on our results of operations.

Failure
    to obtain export licenses could harm our business by rendering
    us unable to ship products and transfer our technology outside
    of the United States.

We must comply with regulations of the United States and of
    certain other countries in shipping our software products and
    transferring our technology outside the United States and to
    foreign nationals. Although we have not had any significant
    difficulty complying with such regulations so far, any
    significant future difficulty in complying could harm our
    business, operating results or financial condition.

Errors or
    defects in our products and services could expose us to
    liability and harm our reputation.

Our customers use our products and services in designing and
    developing products that involve a high degree of technological
    complexity, each of which has its own specifications. Because of
    the complexity of the systems and products with which we work,
    some of our products and designs can be adequately tested only
    when put to full use in the marketplace. As a result, our
    customers or their end users may discover errors or defects in
    our software or the systems we design, or the products or
    systems incorporating our design and intellectual property may
    not operate as expected. Errors or defects could result in:

•

Loss of customers;

•

Loss of market segment share;



•

Failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance;

•

Diversion of development resources to resolve the problem;

•

Loss of or delay in revenue;

•

Increased service costs; and

•

Liability for damages.

If we
    become subject to unfair hiring claims, we could be prevented
    from hiring needed employees, incur liability for damages and
    incur substantial costs in defending ourselves.

Companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with
    competitors frequently claim that these competitors have engaged
    in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these
    persons would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets.
    These claims could prevent us from hiring employees or cause us
    to incur liability for damages. We could also incur substantial
    costs in defending ourselves or our employees against these
    claims, regardless of their merits. Defending ourselves from
    these claims could also divert the attention of our management
    away from our operations.

Our
    business is subject to the risk of earthquakes.

Our corporate headquarters, including certain of our research
    and development operations and certain of our distribution
    facilities, is located in the Silicon Valley area of Northern
    California, which is a region known to experience seismic
    activity. If significant seismic activity were to occur, our
    operations may be interrupted, which would adversely impact our
    business and results of operations.

We
    maintain research and development and other facilities in parts
    of the world that are not as politically stable as the United
    States, and as a result we may face a higher risk of business
    interruption from acts of war or terrorism than businesses
    located only or primarily in the United States.

We maintain international research and development and other
    facilities, some of which are in parts of the world that are not
    as politically stable as the United States. Consequently, we may
    face a greater risk of business interruption as a result of
    terrorist acts or military conflicts than businesses located
    domestically. Furthermore, this potential harm is exacerbated
    given that damage to or disruptions at our international
    research and development facilities could have an adverse effect
    on our ability to develop new or improve existing products as
    compared to other businesses which may only have sales offices
    or other less critical operations abroad. We are not insured for
    losses or interruptions caused by acts of war or terrorism.

Risks
    Related to Our Securities and Indebtedness

Our debt
    obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our
    business, operating results or financial condition, and could
    prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such
    indebtedness.

We have a substantial level of debt. As of January 3, 2009,
    we had $500.2 million of outstanding indebtedness as
    follows:

•

$250.0 million related to our 1.375% Convertible
    Senior Notes Due 2011, or the 2011 Notes;

•

$250.0 million related to our 1.500% Convertible
    Senior Notes Due 2013, or the 2013 Notes and, together with the
    2011 Notes, the Convertible Senior Notes; and

•

$0.2 million related to our Zero Coupon Zero Yield Senior
    Convertible Notes Due 2023, or the 2023 Notes.

The level of our current or future indebtedness, among other
    things, could:

•

Make it difficult for us to satisfy our payment obligations on
    our debt as described below;

•

Make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our
    business;

•

Reduce funds available for use in our operations;

•

Make it difficult for us to incur additional debt or obtain any
    necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital
    expenditures, debt service, acquisitions or general corporate
    purposes;



•

Impose operating or financial covenants on us;

•

Limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in
    our business; or

•

Place us at a possible competitive disadvantage relative to less
    leveraged competitors and competitors that have greater access
    to capital resources.

While we are not currently a party to any loans that would
    prohibit us from making payment on our outstanding convertible
    notes, we are not prevented by the terms of the convertible
    notes from entering into other loans that could prohibit such
    payments. If we are prohibited from paying our outstanding
    indebtedness, we could try to obtain the consent of the lenders
    under those arrangements to make such payment, or we could
    attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain the
    restrictions. If we do not obtain the necessary consents or
    refinance the borrowings, we may be unable to satisfy our
    outstanding indebtedness. Any such failure would constitute an
    event of default under our indebtedness, which could, in turn,
    constitute a default under the terms of any other indebtedness
    then outstanding.

If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise
    obtain funds necessary to make required payments, or if we fail
    to comply with the various requirements of our indebtedness, we
    would be in default, which would permit the holders of our
    indebtedness to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness and
    could cause defaults under any other indebtedness as well.

We have in the past and may in the future attempt to access the
    capital or credit markets in order to obtain funding to meet
    particular liquidity needs. Because of the escalating challenges
    in the global capital markets and financial institutions,
    including a tightening in the capital and credit markets,
    compounded by the increasingly challenging and price-conscious
    economic environment and our lower levels of business, we may
    not be able to secure additional funding on terms acceptable to
    us or at all, which could adversely impact our business and
    operating results.

Any default under our indebtedness could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, operating results and financial
    condition. In addition, a material default on our indebtedness
    could suspend our eligibility to register securities using
    certain registration statement forms under SEC guidelines that
    permit incorporation by reference of substantial information
    regarding us, which could potentially hinder our ability to
    raise capital through the issuance of our securities and will
    increase the costs of such registration to us.

In May 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position, or FSP,
    Accounting Principles Board Opinion, or

APB 14-1,

“Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be
    Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash
    Settlement),” which will require us to recognize additional
    non-cash interest expense related to our Convertible Senior
    Notes in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. FSP APB

14-1

is
    effective for fiscal 2009 and is required to be applied
    retrospectively for all periods for which our Convertible Senior
    Notes were outstanding before the date of adoption. FSP APB

14-1

will
    have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial
    condition, particularly with respect to interest expense ratios
    commonly referred to by lenders, and could potentially hinder
    our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt or
    equity securities.

Conversion
    of the Convertible Senior Notes will dilute the ownership
    interests of existing stockholders.

The terms of the Convertible Senior Notes permit the holders to
    convert the Convertible Senior Notes into shares of our common
    stock. The terms of the Convertible Senior Notes stipulate a net
    share settlement, which upon conversion of the Convertible
    Senior Notes requires us to pay the principal amount in cash and
    the conversion premium, if any, in shares of our common stock
    based on a daily settlement amount, calculated on a
    proportionate basis for each day of the relevant 20

trading-day

observation period. The initial conversion rate for the
    Convertible Senior Notes is 47.2813 shares of our common
    stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes,
    equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $21.15 per
    share of our common stock. The conversion price is subject to
    adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued
    interest, except in limited circumstances. The conversion of
    some or all of the Convertible Senior Notes will dilute the
    ownership interest of our existing stockholders. Any sales in
    the public market of the common stock issuable upon conversion
    could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common
    stock.



Each $1,000 of principal of the Convertible Senior Notes is
    initially convertible into 47.2813 shares of our common
    stock, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified
    events. Holders of the Convertible Senior Notes may convert
    their notes at their option on any day before the close of
    business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding
    December 15, 2011 in the case of the 2011 Notes and
    December 15, 2013 in the case of the 2013 Notes, in each
    case only if:

•

The price of our common stock reaches $27.50 during certain
    periods of time specified in the Convertible Senior Notes;

•

Specified corporate transactions occur; or

•

The trading price of the Convertible Senior Notes falls below
    98% of the product of (i) the last reported sale price of
    our common stock and (ii) the conversion rate on that date.

On and after November 2, 2011, in the case of the 2011
    Notes, and November 1, 2013, in the case of the 2013 Notes,
    until the close of business on the scheduled trading day
    immediately preceding the maturity date of such Convertible
    Senior Notes, holders may convert their Convertible Senior Notes
    at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. As of
    January 3, 2009, none of the conditions allowing holders of
    the Convertible Senior Notes to convert had been met.

Although the conversion price of the Convertible Senior Notes is
    currently $21.15 per share, concurrent with the issuance of the
    Convertible Senior Notes, we entered into hedge and separate
    warrant transactions to reduce the potential dilution from the
    conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes. However, we cannot
    guarantee that such hedges and warrant instruments will fully
    mitigate the dilution. In addition, the existence of the
    Convertible Senior Notes may encourage short selling by market
    participants because the conversion of the Convertible Senior
    Notes could depress the price of our common stock.

At the
    option of the holders of the Convertible Senior Notes, under
    certain circumstances we may be required to repurchase the
    Convertible Senior Notes in cash or shares of our common
    stock.

Under the terms of the Convertible Senior Notes, we may be
    required to repurchase the Convertible Senior Notes following a
    “fundamental change” in our corporate ownership or
    structure, such as a change of control in which substantially
    all of the consideration does not consist of publicly traded
    securities, prior to maturity of the Convertible Senior Notes.
    The repurchase price for the Convertible Senior Notes in the
    event of a fundamental change must be paid solely in cash. This
    repayment obligation may have the effect of discouraging,
    delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that may
    otherwise be beneficial to investors.

Hedge and
    warrant transactions entered into in connection with the
    issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes may affect the value of
    our common stock.

We entered into hedge transactions with various financial
    institutions, at the time of issuance of the Convertible Senior
    Notes, with the objective of reducing the potential dilutive
    effect of issuing our common stock upon conversion of the
    Convertible Senior Notes. We also entered into separate warrant
    transactions with the same financial institutions. In connection
    with our hedge and warrant transactions, these financial
    institutions purchased our common stock in secondary market
    transactions and entered into various over-the-counter
    derivative transactions with respect to our common stock. These
    entities or their affiliates are likely to modify their hedge
    positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of
    the Convertible Senior Notes by purchasing and selling shares of
    our common stock, other of our securities or other instruments
    they may wish to use in connection with such hedging. Any of
    these transactions and activities could adversely affect the
    value of our common stock and, as a result, the number of shares
    and the value of the common stock holders will receive upon
    conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes. In addition, subject
    to movement in the price of our common stock, if the hedge
    transactions settle in our favor, we could be exposed to credit
    risk related to the other party with respect to the payment we
    are owed from such other party. If the financial institutions
    with which we entered into these hedge transactions were to fail
    or default, our ability to settle on these transactions could be
    harmed or delayed.



Rating
    agencies may provide unsolicited ratings on the Convertible
    Senior Notes that could reduce the market value or liquidity of
    our common stock.

We have not requested a rating of the Convertible Senior Notes
    from any rating agency and we do not anticipate that the
    Convertible Senior Notes will be rated. However, if one or more
    rating agencies independently elects to rate the Convertible
    Senior Notes and assigns the Convertible Senior Notes a rating
    lower than the rating expected by investors, or reduces such
    rating in the future, the market price or liquidity of the
    Convertible Senior Notes and our common stock could be harmed.
    Should a decline in the market price of the Convertible Senior
    Notes result, as compared to the price of our common stock, this
    may trigger the right of the holders of the Convertible Senior
    Notes to convert the Convertible Senior Notes into cash and
    shares of our common stock.

Anti-takeover
    defenses in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and
    certain provisions under Delaware law could prevent an
    acquisition of our company or limit the price that investors
    might be willing to pay for our common stock.

Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain
    provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law that apply to
    us could make it difficult for another company to acquire
    control of our company. For example:

•

Our certificate of incorporation allows our Board of Directors
    to issue, at any time and without stockholder approval,
    preferred stock with such terms as it may determine. No shares
    of preferred stock are currently outstanding. However, the
    rights of holders of any of our preferred stock that may be
    issued in the future may be superior to the rights of holders of
    our common stock.

•

Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law
    generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any
    business combination with a person owning 15% or more of its
    voting stock, or who is affiliated with the corporation and
    owned 15% or more of its voting stock at any time within three
    years prior to the proposed business combination, for a period
    of three years from the date the person became a 15% owner,
    unless specified conditions are met.

All or any one of these factors could limit the price that
    certain investors would be willing to pay for shares of our
    common stock and could delay, prevent or allow our Board of
    Directors to resist an acquisition of our company, even if a
    proposed transaction were favored by a majority of our
    independent stockholders.

Item 1B.
    Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

Item 2.
    Properties

We own land and buildings at our headquarters, which is located
    in San Jose, California. We also own buildings in India. As
    of January 3, 2009, the total square footage of our owned
    buildings was approximately 950,000, which includes our newly
    constructed building located at our headquarters. During the
    first quarter of fiscal 2009, we occupied all of the
    approximately 208,000 square feet available in our new
    building.

In January 2007, we completed the sale of certain of our land
    and buildings in San Jose, California. Concurrently with
    the sale, we leased back from the purchaser all available space
    in the buildings for two years. The lease term ended in January
    2009, and we have vacated the leased buildings.

We lease additional facilities in the United States and various
    other countries. We sublease certain of these facilities where
    space is not fully utilized or has been involved in
    restructuring plans.

We believe that these facilities, including our newly
    constructed building located at our headquarters, are adequate
    for our current needs and that suitable additional or substitute
    space will be available as needed to accommodate any expansion
    of our operations.

Item 3.
    Legal Proceedings

From time to time, we are involved in various disputes and
    litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business. These
    include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property,
    mergers and acquisitions, licensing,



contracts, distribution arrangements and employee relations
    matters. At least quarterly, we review the status of each
    significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure.
    If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is
    considered probable and the amount or the range of loss can be
    estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss in
    accordance with SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for
    Contingencies.” Legal proceedings are subject to
    uncertainties, and the outcomes are difficult to predict.
    Because of such uncertainties, accruals are based only on the
    best information available at the time. As additional
    information becomes available, we reassess the potential
    liability related to pending claims and litigation matters and
    may revise estimates.

During fiscal 2008, three complaints were filed in the United
    States District Court for the Northern District of California,
    or District Court, all alleging violations of
    Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of
    1934, as amended, or Exchange Act, and

Rule 10b-5

promulgated thereunder, on behalf of a purported class of
    purchasers of our common stock. The plaintiffs in these actions
    allege that the company and the individual defendants made
    statements during the class period regarding our financial
    results that were false and misleading because we had recognized
    revenue that should have been recognized in subsequent quarters.
    The plaintiffs requested certification of the actions as a class
    action, unspecified damages and interest, the plaintiffs’
    reasonable costs, including attorneys’ and experts’
    fees, and unspecified equitable or injunctive relief. The first
    such complaint was filed on October 29, 2008, captioned
    Hu v. Cadence Design Systems, Inc., Michael J. Fister,
    William Porter and Kevin S. Palatnik; the second such complaint
    was filed on November 4, 2008, captioned Vyas v.
    Cadence Design Systems, Inc., Michael J. Fister, and Kevin S.
    Palatnik; and the third such complaint was filed on
    November 21, 2008, captioned Collins v. Cadence Design
    Systems, Inc., Michael J. Fister, John B. Shoven, Kevin S.
    Palatnik and William Porter. Various plaintiffs have filed
    motions seeking to be named lead plaintiff, and to have these
    complaints consolidated. Those motions are set to be heard by
    the Court on March 6, 2009. We intend to vigorously defend
    these and any other securities lawsuits that may be filed.

During fiscal 2008, two derivative complaints were filed in
    Santa Clara County Superior Court. The first was filed on
    November 20, 2008, and captioned Ury Priel, derivatively on
    behalf of nominal defendant Cadence Design Systems, Inc. v.
    John B. Shoven, Lip-Bu Tan, Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli,
    Donald L. Lucas, Sr., Roger Siboni, George Scalise, Michael
    J. Fister, and Doe Defendants 1-15. The second was filed on
    December 1, 2008, and captioned Mark Levine, derivatively
    on behalf of nominal defendant Cadence Design Systems,
    Inc. v. John B. Shoven, Lip-Bu Tan, Alberto
    Sangiovanni-Vincentelli, Donald L. Lucas, Sr., Roger
    Siboni, George Scalise, Michael J. Fister, John Swainson and Doe
    Defendants 1-10. These complaints purport to bring suit
    derivatively, on behalf of Cadence, against certain of our
    current and former directors for alleged breach of fiduciary
    duty, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate
    assets and unjust enrichment. Many of the allegations underlying
    these claims are similar or identical to the allegations in the
    securities class action lawsuits described above, and further
    allege that the individual defendants approved compensation
    based on inflated financial results. The plaintiffs request
    unspecified damages, restitution, equitable relief and their
    reasonable attorneys’ fees, experts’ fees, costs and
    expenses on behalf of us against the individual defendants. A
    motion to consolidate these complaints was granted on
    January 20, 2009. We are analyzing these derivative
    complaints and will respond to them appropriately.

In light of the preliminary status of these lawsuits, we cannot
    predict the claims, allegations, class period (in the case of
    the class actions), or outcome of these matters. We cannot
    provide any assurances that the final outcome of these lawsuits
    or any other lawsuits or proceedings that may arise in the
    future will not have a material adverse effect on our business,
    operating results or financial condition. Litigation can be
    time-consuming and expensive and could divert management’s
    time and attention from our business, which could have a
    material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results.

While the outcome of these disputes and litigation matters
    cannot be predicted with any certainty, management does not
    believe that the outcome of any current matters will have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position,
    liquidity or operating results.

Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market
    under the symbol CDNS. We have never declared or paid any cash
    dividends on our common stock in the past, and we do not plan to
    pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As of
    February 7, 2009, we had approximately 1,001 registered
    stockholders and approximately 24,218 beneficial owners of our
    common stock.

The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices for
    Cadence common stock for each fiscal quarter in the two-year

    stockholder return on our common stock relative to the
    cumulative total return of the S&P 500 index, the S&P
    Information Technology index, the NASDAQ Composite index and the
    S&P 400 Information Technology index. We plan to replace
    the S&P 500 index with the S&P 400 Information
    Technology index as a comparative index going forward because we
    believe that a comparison of our performance against the
    S&P 400 Information Technology index is a more appropriate
    performance measure for Cadence, as this index is focused on
    mid-cap technology companies. We will retain the NASDAQ
    Composite index going forward rather than the S&P 500 index
    as a broadly market focused index because Cadence is listed on
    the NASDAQ Global Select Market.

We adopted the provisions of FIN No. 48 on
    December 31, 2006, which was the first day of fiscal 2007.
    FIN No. 48 prescribes the recognition threshold and
    measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and
    measurement of an income tax position taken or expected to be
    taken in a tax return. The cumulative effect of applying the
    provisions of FIN No. 48 have been reported as an
    adjustment to our opening balance of retained earnings or other
    appropriate components of equity or net assets in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the beginning of fiscal 2007.

Overview

Business
    Overview

We develop electronic design automation, or EDA, software and
    hardware. We license software, sell or lease hardware
    technology, provide maintenance for our software and hardware
    and provide engineering and education services throughout the
    world to help manage and accelerate product development
    processes for electronics. Our broad range of products and
    services are used by the world’s leading electronics
    companies to design and develop complex integrated circuits, or
    ICs, and electronics systems.

We primarily generate revenue from licensing our EDA software,
    selling or leasing our hardware technology, providing
    maintenance for our software and hardware and providing
    engineering services. In the past, our revenue recognition has
    been significantly affected by the mix of license types executed
    in any given period. Our revenue may also be deferred until
    payments become due and payable or cash is received from certain
    customers and for certain contracts. For additional description
    of our revenue recognition, see the discussion under the heading
    “Critical Accounting Estimates — Revenue
    Recognition,” below. Substantially all of our revenue is
    generated from IC manufacturers and designers and electronics
    systems companies and is dependent upon their commencement of
    new design projects. As a result, our revenue is significantly
    influenced by our customers’ business outlook and
    investment in the introduction of new products and the
    improvement of existing products.

The IC, electronics systems and semiconductor industries are
    currently experiencing significant challenges, primarily due to
    a deteriorating macroeconomic environment, which is
    characterized by diminished product demand, production
    overcapacity, high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of
    average selling prices. As a result of this downturn, some of
    our customers faced financial challenges in fiscal 2008 and may
    continue to face such challenges in fiscal 2009. It is unclear
    when the macroeconomic environment may improve. We are seeing
    increasing pressures on our customers’ research and
    development budgets, and therefore our customers are looking for
    more flexibility in the type of software and hardware products
    they purchase and how and when they purchase them. The current
    economic downturn in our customers’ industries has
    contributed to the substantial reduction in our revenue and
    could continue to harm our business, operating results and
    financial condition.

Facing uncertainty and cost pressures in their own businesses,
    some of our customers are waiting to purchase our products and
    are increasingly seeking purchasing terms and conditions that
    are less favorable to us. As a result of this trend, we
    experienced lower business levels for fiscal 2008 and we have
    forecasted lower business levels for fiscal 2009. We recognized
    a net loss for fiscal 2008 and we expect to recognize a net loss
    for fiscal 2009. To enable us to keep our focus on the value of
    our technology and to assist with customer demands, we are
    transitioning to a license mix that will provide our customers
    with greater flexibility and will result in a higher portion of
    our revenue being recognized ratably.

Our customers may also experience adverse changes in their
    business and, as a result, may delay or default on their payment
    obligations, file for bankruptcy or modify or cancel plans to
    license our products. If our customers are not successful in
    generating sufficient revenue or are precluded from securing
    financing, they may not be able to



pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that are owed
    to us, although these obligations are generally not cancelable.
    Additionally, our customers may seek to renegotiate existing
    contractual commitments. Though we have not yet experienced a
    material level of defaults, any material payment default by our
    customers or significant reductions in existing contractual
    commitments could have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition and operating results.

Due to the decline in our stock price and market capitalization,
    our fiscal 2008 net loss, expected future net losses,
    reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in
    our industry, we recorded impairment charges totaling
    $1,317.2 million in fiscal 2008, representing all of our
    acquired goodwill, and we recorded an additional valuation
    allowance on our deferred tax assets of $332.9 million.

We plan operating expense levels primarily based on forecasted
    revenue levels. To offset some of the impact of our expected
    decrease in revenue, we have implemented cost savings
    initiatives, including reducing headcount, decreasing employee
    bonuses and reducing other discretionary spending. During fiscal
    2008, we initiated a restructuring plan to improve our operating
    results and to align our cost structure with expected revenue.
    This restructuring plan is intended to decrease costs by
    reducing our workforce throughout the company by at least
    625 positions. We expect ongoing annual savings of
    approximately $150.0 million related to this restructuring
    plan.

Product performance and size specifications of the mobile and
    other consumer electronics market are requiring electronic
    systems to be smaller, consume less power and provide multiple
    functions in one

system-on-chip,

or SoC, or

system-in-package,

or SiP. The design challenge is also becoming more complex with
    each new generation of electronics because providers of EDA
    solutions are required to deliver products that address these
    technical challenges and improve the efficiency and productivity
    of the design process in a price-conscious environment.

With the addition of emerging nanometer design considerations to
    the already burgeoning set of traditional design tasks, complex
    SoC or IC design can no longer be accomplished using a
    collection of discrete design tools. What previously consisted
    of sequential design activities must be merged and accomplished
    nearly simultaneously without time-consuming data translation
    steps. We combine our design technologies into
    “platforms” addressing four major design activities:
    functional verification, digital IC design, custom IC design and
    system interconnect design. The four Cadence design platforms
    are Incisive functional verification, Encounter digital IC
    design, Virtuoso custom design and Allegro system interconnect
    design platforms. In addition, we augment these platform product
    offerings with a set of DFM products that service both the
    digital and custom IC design flows. These four platforms,
    together with our DFM products, comprised our primary product
    lines during fiscal 2008. In connection with our cost savings
    initiatives that were implemented during the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2008, we made certain changes to our DFM product
    strategy, including focusing on integrating DFM awareness into
    our core design platforms of Encounter and Virtuoso. The changes
    in our DFM strategy resulted in an impairment charge of
    $42.5 million arising from the abandonment and reduction to
    net realizable value of certain identifiable intangible assets.

We have identified certain items that management uses as
    performance indicators to manage our business, including
    revenue, certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow
    from operations, and we describe these items more fully below
    under the heading “Results of Operations” and
    “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Management

On October 15, 2008, we announced the resignation of
    Michael J. Fister, our President and Chief Executive Officer and
    member of our Board of Directors, and four other executive
    officers, and in connection with Mr. Fister’s
    resignation, our Board of Directors formed an Interim Office of
    the Chief Executive, or the IOCE, to oversee the day-to-day
    running of our operations. On January 8, 2009, we announced
    the appointment of Lip-Bu Tan as our new President and Chief
    Executive Officer and the dissolution of the IOCE.

Critical
    Accounting Estimates

In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we make
    assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant
    impact on our revenue, operating income and net income, as well
    as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. We base our assumptions, judgments
    and estimates on historical



experience and various other factors that we believe to be
    reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ
    materially from these estimates under different assumptions or
    conditions. At least quarterly, we evaluate our assumptions,
    judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly. We believe
    that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the
    accounting for revenue recognition, accounting for income taxes
    and valuation of goodwill and other long-lived assets have the
    greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial
    Statements; therefore, we consider these to be our critical
    accounting estimates.

Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative
    to our critical accounting estimates have not differed
    materially from actual results. For further information on our
    significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to our
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue
    Recognition

We apply the provisions of Statement of Position, or SOP,

97-2,

“Software Revenue Recognition,” as amended by

SOP 98-9,

“Modification of

SOP 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain
    Transactions,” to all software licensing transactions and
    to all product revenue transactions where the software is not
    incidental. We also apply the provisions of
    SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for Leases,” to all
    hardware lease transactions. We recognize revenue when
    persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has
    been delivered, the fee is fixed or determinable, collection of
    the resulting receivable is probable, and vendor-specific
    objective evidence of fair value, or VSOE, exists.

We license software using three different license types:

•

Subscription licenses;

•

Term licenses; and

•

Perpetual licenses.

For many of our term and subscription license arrangements, we
    use our proprietary internet-based delivery mechanism,

“eDA-on-tap,”

to facilitate the delivery of our software products. To maximize
    the efficiency of this delivery mechanism, we created what we
    refer to as “eDA Cards,” of which there are two types.
    Subscription license customers may purchase what we refer to as
    an “eDA Platinum Card,” which provides the customer
    access to and use of all software products delivered at the
    outset of the arrangement and the ability to use additional
    unspecified software products that may become commercially
    available during the term of the arrangement. Term license
    customers may purchase what we refer to as an “eDA Gold
    Card,” which provides the customer access to and use of all
    software products delivered at the outset of the arrangement.
    Overall, the eDA Cards provide greater flexibility for our
    customers in how and when they deploy and use our software
    products.

Subscription licenses

– Our subscription
    license arrangements offer our customers the right to:

•

Access and use all software products delivered at the outset of
    an arrangement throughout the entire term of the arrangement,
    generally two to four years, with no rights to return;

•

Use unspecified additional software products that become
    commercially available during the term of the
    arrangement; and

•

Remix among the software products delivered at the outset of the
    arrangement, as well as the right to remix into other
    unspecified additional software products that may become
    available during the term of the arrangement, so long as the
    cumulative value of all products in use does not exceed the
    total license fee determined at the outset of the arrangement.
    These remix rights may be exercisable multiple times during the
    term of the arrangement. The right to remix all software
    products delivered pursuant to the license agreement is not
    considered an exchange or return of software because all
    software products have been delivered and the customer has the
    continuing right to use them.

Customers that purchase an eDA Platinum Card have the ability
    during the term of the arrangement to use software products
    delivered at the outset of the arrangement, and to use other
    unspecified additional software products that may become
    commercially available during the term of the arrangement, until
    the fees have been depleted.



In general, revenue associated with subscription licenses is
    recognized ratably over the term of the license commencing upon
    the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery
    of the software product. Subscription license revenue is
    allocated to product and maintenance revenue. The allocation to
    maintenance revenue is based on vendor specific objective
    evidence, or VSOE, of fair value of the undelivered maintenance
    that was established in connection with the sale of our term
    licenses.

In the event that a subscription license arrangement is
    terminated by mutual agreement and a new term license
    arrangement is entered into either concurrently with or after
    the termination of the subscription license arrangement, the
    revenue associated with the new term license arrangement is
    recognized upon the later of the effective date of the
    arrangement or delivery of the software product, assuming all
    other criteria in

SOP 97-2

have been met.

Term licenses

– Our term license arrangements
    offer our customers the right to:

•

Access and use all software products delivered at the outset of
    an arrangement throughout the entire term of the arrangement,
    generally two to four years, with no rights to return; and

•

Remix among the software products delivered at the outset of the
    arrangement, so long as the cumulative value of all products in
    use does not exceed the total license fee determined at the
    outset of the arrangement. These remix rights may be exercisable
    multiple times during the term of the arrangement. The right to
    remix all software products delivered pursuant to the license
    agreement is not considered an exchange or return of software
    because all software products have been delivered and the
    customer has the continuing right to use them.

Customers that purchase an eDA Gold Card have the ability during
    the term of the arrangement to use software products delivered
    at the outset of the arrangement until the fees relating to the
    arrangement have been depleted.

In general, revenue associated with term licenses is recognized
    upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or
    delivery of the software product.

Perpetual licenses

– Our perpetual licenses
    consist of software licensed on a perpetual basis with no right
    to return or exchange the licensed software. In general, revenue
    associated with perpetual licenses is recognized upon the later
    of the effective date of the license or delivery of the licensed
    product.

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement

–
    Generally, we use a contract signed by the customer as evidence
    of an arrangement for subscription and term licenses and
    hardware leases. If a contract signed by the customer does not
    exist, we have historically used a purchase order as evidence of
    an arrangement for perpetual licenses, hardware sales,
    maintenance renewals and small fixed-price service projects,
    such as training classes and small methodology service
    engagements of approximately $10,000 or less. For all other
    service engagements, we use a signed professional services
    agreement and a statement of work to evidence an arrangement. In
    cases where both a signed contract and a purchase order exist,
    we consider the signed contract to be the most persuasive
    evidence of the arrangement. Sales through our distributors are
    evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship,
    together with binding purchase orders from the distributor on a

transaction-by-transaction

basis.

Product delivery

– Software and the
    corresponding access keys are generally delivered to customers
    electronically. Electronic delivery occurs when we provide the
    customer access to the software. Occasionally, we will deliver
    the software on a compact disc with standard transfer terms of

free-on-board,

or F.O.B., shipping point. Our software license agreements
    generally do not contain conditions for acceptance. With respect
    to hardware, delivery of an entire system is deemed to occur
    upon its successful installation. For certain hardware products,
    installation is the responsibility of the customer, as the
    system is fully functional at the time of shipment. For these
    products, delivery is deemed to be complete when the products
    are shipped with freight terms of F.O.B. shipping point.

For customers who purchase eDA Gold or eDA Platinum Cards,
    delivery occurs when the customer has been provided with access
    codes that allow the customer to download the software pursuant
    to the terms of the software license agreement.

Fee is fixed or determinable

– We assess
    whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the
    arrangement, primarily based on the payment terms associated
    with the transaction. We have established a history of
    collecting



under the original contract without providing concessions on
    payments, products or services. For our installment contracts
    that do not include a substantial up front payment, we only
    consider that a fee is fixed or determinable if the arrangement
    has payment periods that are equal to or less than the term of
    the licenses and the payments are collected in equal or nearly
    equal installments, when evaluated over the entire term of the
    arrangement. We have a history of collecting receivables under
    installment contracts of up to five years.

Significant judgment is involved in assessing whether a fee is
    fixed or determinable. We must also make these judgments when
    assessing whether a contract amendment to a term arrangement
    (primarily in the context of a license extension or renewal)
    constitutes a concession. Our experience has been that we are
    able to determine whether a fee is fixed or determinable for
    term licenses. While we do not expect that experience to change,
    if we no longer were to have a history of collecting under the
    original contract without providing concessions on term
    licenses, revenue from term licenses would be required to be
    recognized when payments under the installment contract become
    due and payable. Such a change could have a material impact on
    our results of operations.

Collection is probable

– We assess the
    probability of collecting from each customer at the outset of
    the arrangement based on a number of factors, including the
    customer’s payment history and its current
    creditworthiness. We have concluded that collection is not
    probable for license arrangements executed with customers in
    certain countries. If in our judgment collection of a fee is not
    probable, we defer the revenue until the uncertainty is removed,
    which generally means revenue is recognized upon receipt of cash
    payment. Our experience has been that we are able to estimate
    whether collection is probable. While we do not expect that
    experience to change, if we were to determine that collection is
    not probable for any license arrangement, particularly those
    with installment payment terms, revenue from such license would
    be recognized generally upon the receipt of cash payment. Such a
    change could have a material impact on our results of operations.

Multiple element arrangement

– A multiple
    element arrangement, or MEA, is any arrangement that includes or
    contemplates rights to a combination of software or hardware
    products, software license types, services, training or
    maintenance in a single arrangement. From time to time, we may
    include individual deliverables in separately priced and
    separately signed contracts with the same customer. We obtain
    and evaluate all known relevant facts and circumstances in
    determining whether the separate contracts should be accounted
    for individually as distinct arrangements or whether the
    separate contracts are, in substance, a MEA. Significant
    judgment can be involved in determining whether a group of
    contracts might be so closely related that they are, in effect,
    part of a single arrangement.

Vendor-specific objective evidence of fair
    value

– Our VSOE for certain product elements of
    an arrangement is based upon the pricing in comparable
    transactions when the element is sold separately. VSOE for
    maintenance is generally based upon the customer’s stated
    annual renewal rates. VSOE for services is generally based on
    the price charged when the services are sold separately. For
    multiple element arrangements, VSOE must exist to allocate the
    total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of a term
    or perpetual license arrangement. If VSOE does not exist for all
    elements to support the allocation of the total fee among all
    delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement, revenue
    is deferred until such evidence does exist for the undelivered
    elements, or until all elements are delivered, whichever is
    earlier. If VSOE of all undelivered elements exists but VSOE
    does not exist for one or more delivered elements, revenue is
    recognized using the residual method. Under the residual method,
    the VSOE of the undelivered elements is deferred, and the
    remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as
    revenue as the elements are delivered. Our experience has been
    that we are able to determine VSOE for maintenance and
    time-based services, but not for product.

Finance fee revenue

– Finance fees result from
    discounting to present value the product revenue derived from
    our installment contracts in which the payment terms extend
    beyond one year from the effective date of the contract. Finance
    fees are recognized using a method that approximates the
    effective interest method over the relevant license term and are
    classified as product revenue. Finance fee revenue represented
    approximately 3% of total revenue for fiscal 2008 and 2% for
    each of fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. Upon the sale of an
    installment contract, we recognize the remaining finance fee
    revenue associated with the installment contract.

Services revenue

– Services revenue consists
    primarily of revenue received for performing engineering
    services. These services are not related to the functionality of
    the products licensed. Revenue from service contracts is
    recognized either on the time and materials method, as work is
    performed, or on the percentage-of-



completion method. For contracts with fixed or not-to-exceed
    fees, we estimate on a monthly basis the
    percentage-of-completion, which is based on the completion of
    milestones relating to the arrangement. We have a history of
    accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to
    complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can
    affect our estimates, including labor rates, utilization and
    efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement
    changes. If different conditions were to prevail such that
    accurate estimates could not be made, then the use of the
    completed contract method would be required and the recognition
    of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was
    completed. Such a change could have a material impact on our
    results of operations.

Accounting
    for Income Taxes

We provide for the effect of income taxes in our Consolidated
    Financial Statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109
    and FIN No. 48.

Under SFAS No. 109, income tax expense or benefit is
    recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the
    current year, and for deferred tax assets and liabilities for
    the tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an
    entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We must make
    significant assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine
    our current provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets
    and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded
    against our deferred tax assets. Our judgments, assumptions and
    estimates relating to the current provision for income taxes
    include the geographic mix and amount of income (loss), our
    interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of
    current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax
    authorities. Our judgments also include anticipating the tax
    positions we will take on tax returns before actually preparing
    and filing the tax returns. Changes in our business, tax laws or
    our interpretation of tax laws, and developments in current and
    future tax audits, could significantly impact the amounts
    provided for income taxes in our results of operations,
    financial position or cash flows.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
    estimated future tax consequences attributable to tax benefit
    carryforwards and to differences between the financial statement
    amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax
    basis. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for
    recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more
    likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax
    assets will not be realized. To make this assessment, we take
    into account predictions of the amount and category of taxable
    income from various sources and all available positive and
    negative evidence about these possible sources of taxable
    income. As required under SFAS No. 109, the weight
    given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence
    is commensurate with the extent to which the strength of the
    evidence can be objectively verified. For example, a
    company’s current or previous losses are given more weight
    than its future outlook. For the year ended January 3,
    2009, we concluded that a significant increase in valuation
    allowance was required based on our evaluation and weighting of
    the positive and negative evidence. If, in the future, we
    determine that these deferred tax assets are more likely than
    not to be realized, a release of all or part, of the related
    valuation allowance could result in a material income tax
    benefit in the period such determination is made. For additional
    description of the fiscal 2008 valuation allowance, see the
    discussion under the heading “Results of
    Operations — Provision for Income Taxes,” below.

Under FIN No. 48, we may only recognize an income tax
    position in our financial statements that we judge is more
    likely than not to be sustained solely on its technical merits
    in a tax audit, including resolution of any related appeals or
    litigation processes. To make this judgment, we must interpret
    the application of complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws,
    regulations and practices. If an income tax position meets the
    more likely than not recognition threshold, then we must measure
    the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by determining
    the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than a 50%
    likelihood of being realized upon effective settlement with a
    taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant
    facts. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate
    such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability
    of various possible settlement outcomes. To determine if a tax
    position is effectively settled, we must also estimate the
    likelihood that a taxing authority would review a tax position
    after a tax examination had otherwise been completed. We must
    also determine when it is reasonably possible that the amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or
    decrease in the 12 months after each fiscal year-end. These
    judgments are difficult because a taxing authority may change
    its behavior as a result of our disclosures in our financial
    statements that are based on the requirements of
    FIN No. 48. We must re-evaluate our income tax
    positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as
    changes in facts or circumstances, changes



in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new
    audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement
    would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional
    charge to the tax provision.

We are also required to assess whether the earnings of our
    foreign subsidiaries will be indefinitely reinvested outside the
    United States. Given the escalating challenges in the global
    capital markets during fiscal 2008, we decided to repatriate
    $250.0 million of earnings from a foreign subsidiary to the
    United States that had previously been considered to be
    indefinitely reinvested outside the United States and for which
    deferred taxes had not been previously provided. We currently
    expect that an additional $67.2 million of previously
    untaxed earnings from foreign subsidiaries will not be
    indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. As a
    result, we have accrued a tax expense of $101.1 million
    during fiscal 2008 to provide for the potential federal, state
    and foreign income taxes on these repatriations. To calculate
    this tax expense, we were required to estimate the geographic
    mix of profits and losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in
    tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income and dividend
    withholding tax rates, the impact of foreign exchange rate
    fluctuations, and the potential outcomes of current and future
    tax audits. Changes in our actual or projected operating
    results, tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws, foreign
    exchange rates and developments in current and future tax audits
    could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes
    in our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Valuation
    of Goodwill and Other Long-lived Assets

Goodwill

Costs in excess of the fair value of tangible and other
    intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a purchase
    business combination are recorded as goodwill.
    SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets,” requires that companies not amortize goodwill, but
    instead test for impairment at least annually. We have evaluated
    goodwill on an annual basis since our adoption of
    SFAS No. 142 and whenever events and changes in
    circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be
    recoverable.

Impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by
    comparing the reporting unit’s carrying amount, including
    goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair
    values of the reporting units are estimated using a combination
    of the income, or discounted cash flows, approach and the market
    approach, which utilizes comparable companies’ data. If the
    carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value,
    goodwill is considered to be impaired and a second step is
    performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss.

The preparation of the goodwill impairment analysis requires
    management to make significant estimates and assumptions with
    respect to the determination of fair values of reporting units
    and tangible and intangible assets. These estimates and
    assumptions, which include future values, are complex and often
    subjective and may differ significantly from period to period
    based on changes in the overall economic environment, changes in
    our industry and changes in our strategy or our internal
    forecasts. Estimates and assumptions with respect to the
    determination of the fair value of our reporting unit include:

•

Control premium assigned to our market capitalization;

•

Our operating forecasts;

•

Revenue growth rates;

•

Risk-commensurate discount rates and costs of capital; and

•

Market multiples of revenue and earnings.

These estimates and assumptions, along with others, are used to
    estimate the fair value of our reporting unit as well as
    tangible and intangible assets. While we believe the estimates
    and assumptions we used are reasonable, different assumptions
    may materially impact the resulting fair value of the reporting
    unit, tangible assets and intangible assets, the amount of
    impairment we record in any given period and our results of
    operations.

We engage independent valuation experts to assess the
    reasonableness of our assumptions and to perform certain
    portions of our goodwill impairment analysis.



Other
    Long-lived Assets

We review long-lived assets, including certain identifiable
    intangibles, for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover an
    asset’s carrying amount in accordance with
    SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
    Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” In addition, we assess our
    long-lived assets for impairment if they are abandoned.

For long-lived assets to be held and used, including acquired
    intangibles, we initiate our review whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a
    long-lived asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of an
    asset is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the
    expected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from
    the use and eventual disposition of that asset, excluding future
    interest costs that would be recognized as an expense when
    incurred. Any impairment to be recognized is measured by the
    amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its
    fair market value. Significant management judgment is required
    in:

•

Identifying a triggering event that arises from a change in
    circumstances;

•

Forecasting future operating results; and

•

Estimating the proceeds from the disposition of long-lived or
    intangible assets.

In future periods, material impairment charges could be
    necessary should different conditions prevail or different
    judgments be made.

Results
    of Operations

As noted above, we saw increasing pressures on the research and
    development budgets in our customer base due to the deceleration
    of growth in the electronics systems and semiconductor
    industries and the deteriorating macroeconomic environment. In
    addition, the escalating challenges in the global capital
    markets made it important to keep cash available and held in
    short-term, low-risk investments.

Fiscal 2008 financial results reflected the following:

•

Lower business levels due to the challenges in the current
    macroeconomic environment and the timing of our contract
    renewals with existing customers;

•

Lower business levels and up-front revenue recognized due to our
    transition to a ratable license mix, which began in the third
    quarter of fiscal 2008;

•

Initiation of a restructuring plan, resulting in
    $46.4 million of expense during fiscal 2008;

•

Impairment of all of our $1,317.2 million of goodwill and
    $47.1 million of intangible and tangible assets;

•

Repatriation of earnings that had previously been considered to
    be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States and for
    which deferred taxes had not been previously provided, resulting
    in additional provisions for income taxes of $101.1 million;

•

Additional valuation allowance of $332.9 million against
    our deferred tax assets; and

•

Resignations of five executive officers resulting in severance
    expense of $16.4 million, $7.1 million of which was
    stock-based compensation.

Revenue

We primarily generate revenue from licensing our EDA software,
    selling or leasing our hardware technology, providing
    maintenance for our software and hardware and providing
    engineering services. We principally utilize three license
    types: subscription, term and perpetual. The different license
    types provide a customer with different conditions of use for
    our products, such as:

•

The right to access new technology;

•

The duration of the license; and

•

Payment timing.

Customer decisions regarding these aspects of license
    transactions determine the license type, timing of revenue
    recognition and potential future business activity. For example,
    if a customer chooses a fixed duration of use, this will result
    in either a subscription or term license. A business implication
    of this decision is that, at the expiration of the license
    period, the customer must decide whether to continue using the
    technology and therefore



renew the license agreement. Because larger customers generally
    use products from two or more of our five product groups, rarely
    will a large customer completely terminate its relationship with
    us at expiration of the license. See the discussion under the
    heading “Critical Accounting Estimates — Revenue
    Recognition” above for additional description of license
    types and timing of revenue recognition.

Although we believe that pricing volatility has not generally
    been a material component of the change in our revenue from
    period to period, we believe that the amount of revenue
    recognized in future periods will depend on, among other things,
    the:

•

Competitiveness of our new technology;

•

Timing of contract renewals with existing customers;

•

Length of our sales cycle; and

•

Size, duration, terms and type of:

•

Contract renewals with existing customers;

•

Additional sales to existing customers; and

•

Sales to new customers.

A substantial portion of our total revenue is recognized over
    multiple periods. In the past, a significant portion of our
    product revenue has been recognized upon delivery of licensed
    software, which generally occurs upon the later of the effective
    date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product. We
    are moving to a license mix that will result in increased
    ratable revenue and we expect the percentage of product revenue
    from backlog to increase in future years.

The value and duration of contracts, and consequently product
    revenue recognized, is affected by the competitiveness of our
    products. Product revenue recognized in any period is also
    affected by the extent to which customers purchase subscription,
    term or perpetual licenses, and the extent to which contracts
    contain flexible payment terms. The timing of revenue
    recognition is also affected by changes in the extent to which
    existing contracts contain flexible payment terms and by changes
    in contractual arrangements with existing customers (e.g.,
    customers transitioning from subscription license arrangements
    to term license arrangements).

Revenue
    Mix

We analyze our software and hardware businesses by product
    group, combining revenues for both product and maintenance
    because of their interrelationship. During fiscal 2008, fiscal
    2007 and fiscal 2006, our product groups were as follows:

Functional Verification

:  Products in this
    group, which include the Incisive functional verification
    platform, are used to verify that the high level, logical
    representation of an IC design is functionally correct.

Digital IC Design

:  Products in this group,
    which include the Encounter digital IC design platform, are used
    to accurately convert the high-level, logical representation of
    a digital IC into a detailed physical blueprint and then
    detailed design information showing how the IC will be
    physically implemented. This data is used for creation of the
    photomasks used in chip manufacture.

Custom IC Design

:  Our custom design products,
    which include the Virtuoso custom design platform, are used for
    ICs that must be designed at the transistor level, including
    analog, radio frequency, memories, high performance digital
    blocks and standard cell libraries. Detailed design information
    showing how an IC will be physically implemented is used for
    creation of the photomasks used in chip manufacture.

System Interconnect Design

:  This product group
    consists of our PCB and IC package design products, including
    the Allegro and OrCAD products. The Allegro system interconnect
    design platform enables consistent co-design of interconnects
    across ICs, IC packages and PCBs, while the OrCAD line focuses
    on cost-effective, entry-level PCB solutions.

Design for Manufacturing

:  Included in this
    product group are our physical verification and analysis
    products. These products are used to analyze and verify that the
    physical blueprint of the IC has been constructed correctly and
    can be manufactured successfully. In connection with our cost
    savings initiatives that were implemented during the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2008, we made certain changes to our DFM
    product



strategy, including focusing on integrating DFM awareness into
    our core design platforms of Encounter and Virtuoso. The changes
    in our DFM strategy resulted in an impairment charge of
    $42.5 million arising from the abandonment and reduction to
    net realizable value of certain identifiable intangible assets.

For additional description of our current product strategy, see
    the discussion under the heading “Products and Product
    Strategy” under Item 1, “Business,” above.

Product revenue decreased during fiscal 2008, as compared to
    fiscal 2007, primarily because of lower business levels due to
    the challenges in the current macroeconomic environment, the
    timing of our contract renewals with existing customers, our
    transition to a ratable license mix and a longer sales cycle. As
    a result, product revenue decreased for all product groups, and
    particularly for Digital IC Design, Custom IC Design and
    Functional Verification products during fiscal 2008. Due to the
    lower business levels and the change in the license mix in the
    second half of fiscal 2008, we expect to recognize decreased
    revenue during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008.

Product revenue was higher during fiscal 2007, as compared to
    fiscal 2006, primarily because of increased revenue from
    licenses for Digital IC Design, Functional Verification and
    Custom IC Design products, partially offset by a small decrease
    in revenue from licenses for DFM products.

As described under the heading “Critical Accounting
    Estimates” above, certain of our licenses allow customers
    the ability to remix among software products. Additionally, we
    have licensed a combination of our products to customers with
    the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be
    determined at a later date. For these arrangements, we estimate
    the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the
    expected usage of our products by these customers. The actual
    usage of our products by these customers may differ and, if that
    proves to be the case, the revenue allocation in the above table
    would differ.



Although we believe the methodology of allocating revenue to
    product groups is reasonable, there can be no assurance that
    such allocated amounts reflect the amounts that would result had
    the customer individually licensed each specific software
    solution at the onset of the arrangement.

The rate of revenue change varies geographically primarily due
    to differences in the timing and size of term licenses in those
    regions. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of total
    revenue during fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 or fiscal 2006.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates caused our revenue to
    increase by $24.5 million during fiscal 2008 compared to
    fiscal 2007, primarily due to a decrease in the valuation of the
    United States dollar when compared to the Japanese yen and the
    European Union euro, partially offset by an increase in the
    valuation of the United States dollar when compared to the
    British pound. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates caused
    our revenue to increase by $2.9 million in 2007 compared to
    2006, primarily due to a decrease in the valuation of the United
    States dollar when compared to the European Union euro and the
    British pound, partially offset by an increase in the valuation
    of the United States dollar when compared to the Japanese yen.
    Additional information about revenue and other financial
    information by geography can be found in Note 21 to our
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock
    awards and restricted stock units, collectively referred to as
    restricted stock, and stock bonuses decreased during fiscal
    2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to the reversal
    of $6.5 million of stock-based compensation expense related
    to the modification of certain performance-based restricted
    stock awards, new grants of restricted stock being valued at a
    lower stock price and a decrease in stock bonuses. Stock-based
    compensation expense related to restricted stock and stock
    bonuses increased during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal
    2006, as we issued more restricted stock in place of stock
    options and due to our increased stock price during fiscal 2007.

Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options
    decreased in each of fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007,
    and fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to
    our increased use of restricted stock instead of stock options,
    partially offset by an increase in stock option expense during
    fiscal 2008 due to the acceleration of vesting for the five
    executive officers that resigned during fiscal 2008.

We expect stock-based compensation expense to continue to
    decrease during fiscal 2009, primarily due to lower fair values
    at grant dates for both restricted stock and stock options, and
    due to the cancellation of restricted stock and stock options
    due to our restructuring plan and other attrition.

Expected
    Effects of Restructuring Plans

We plan operating expense levels primarily based on forecasted
    revenue levels. To offset some of the impact of our expected
    decrease in revenue, we have implemented cost savings
    initiatives, including reducing headcount, decreasing employee
    bonuses and reducing other discretionary spending. During fiscal
    2008, we initiated a restructuring plan to improve our operating
    results and to align our cost structure with expected revenue.
    This restructuring plan is intended to decrease costs by
    reducing our workforce throughout the company by at least
    625 positions. We expect ongoing annual savings of
    approximately $150.0 million related to this restructuring
    plan.

Cost of
    Product

Cost of product includes costs associated with the sale or lease
    of our hardware and licensing of our software products. Cost of
    product primarily includes the cost of employee salary, benefits
    and other employee-related costs, including stock-based
    compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangibles
    directly related to our products, the cost of technical
    documentation and royalties payable to third-party vendors. Cost
    of product associated with our hardware products also includes
    materials, assembly and overhead. These additional manufacturing
    costs make our cost of hardware product higher, as a percentage
    of revenue, than our cost of software product. Cost of product
    as a percentage of product revenue increased during fiscal 2008,
    as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to decreased software
    product revenue during fiscal 2008.

Hardware costs decreased during fiscal 2008, as compared to
    fiscal 2007, primarily due to a decrease in hardware sales,
    partially offset by a write-off of obsolete inventory during
    fiscal 2008. Hardware costs increased during fiscal 2007, as
    compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to an increase in
    hardware sales.



Amortization of acquired intangibles decreased in each of fiscal
    2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, and during fiscal 2007, as
    compared to fiscal 2006, because certain acquired intangible
    assets became fully amortized during the related periods. We
    expect the amortization of acquired intangibles component of
    Cost of product to decrease during fiscal 2009 due to the
    impairment of certain acquired intangibles during fiscal 2008.

Cost of product depends primarily upon the extent to which we
    acquire intangible assets, acquire licenses and incorporate
    third-party technology in our products that are licensed or sold
    in any given period, and the actual mix of hardware and software
    product sales in any given period.

Cost of
    Services

Cost of services primarily includes employee salary, benefits
    and other employee-related costs, costs to maintain the
    infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization and
    provisions for contract losses, if any. Cost of services
    increased $9.9 million during fiscal 2008, as compared to
    fiscal 2007, and decreased $3.1 million during fiscal 2007,
    as compared to fiscal 2006, due to the following:

    employee bonuses. These costs increased during fiscal 2007, as
    compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to increased headcount
    and higher bonuses earned during fiscal 2007. Travel and
    customer conference costs decreased during fiscal 2008, as
    compared to fiscal 2007, as we reduced certain discretionary
    spending.

    costs increased during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006,
    primarily due to increased headcount and higher bonuses earned
    during fiscal 2007.



Losses on the sale of installment contract receivables decreased
    during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, due to a
    reduction in sales of receivables. As a result of the credit
    losses recorded by banks during 2008 and the current financial
    challenges experienced by banks, a number of banks have become
    less willing to purchase assets because of capital constraints
    and concerns about over-exposure to the technology sector. In
    addition, the change in our license mix will result in an
    increased number of subscription licenses and a decrease in the
    sale of receivables to financial institutions. Losses on the
    sale of installment contract receivables decreased during fiscal
    2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, due to the lower discount
    rates available to us during fiscal 2007.

Litigation, legal and other professional services costs
    decreased during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, due to
    litigation costs incurred in fiscal 2007 that did not recur in
    fiscal 2008, offset by increased professional services fees
    related to our proposed acquisition of Mentor Graphics
    Corporation and the restatement of our previously issued
    financial statements for the periods ended March 29, 2008
    and June 28, 2008. See additional discussion of our current
    litigation under the heading Item 3, “Legal
    Proceedings,” above. Litigation, legal and other
    professional services costs increased during fiscal 2007, as
    compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to an increase in
    litigation costs incurred in fiscal 2007.

Bad debt expense increased during fiscal 2008, as compared to
    fiscal 2007, due to the challenges currently affecting the
    economy of the United States and other regions of the world. As
    a result, our customers may experience adverse changes in their
    business, which may result in a delay or default on their
    payment obligations. Bad debt expense increased during fiscal
    2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, reflecting a lower amount of
    bad debt recoveries during fiscal 2007.

Executive severance costs in fiscal 2008 relate to the cash
    payable to three of the five executives who resigned in October
    2008. The expense related to the other two resignations of our
    executive officers is included in our Sales and marketing and
    Research and development expenses.

    under the heading “Impairment of Intangible and Tangible
    Assets,” below.

Restructuring
    and Other Charges

During fiscal 2008, we initiated a restructuring plan, or the
    2008 Restructuring Plan, to decrease costs by reducing our
    workforce across the company and by consolidating facilities. We
    recorded total costs associated with the 2008 Restructuring Plan
    of $46.7 million during fiscal 2008 for severance and
    benefits, excess facilities and other charges. We regularly
    evaluate the adequacy of our severance and related benefits
    accrual, and adjust the balance based on actual costs incurred
    or changes in estimates and assumptions. We may incur future
    charges to



reflect actual costs incurred or for changes in estimates
    related to amounts previously recorded and for additional
    activities under the 2008 Restructuring Plan.

We also initiated restructuring plans in each year from 2001
    through 2005, or the Other Restructuring Plans, in an effort to
    operate more efficiently. As of January 3, 2009, the
    balance of $6.3 million related to the Other Restructuring
    Plans consisted solely of estimated lease losses.

Facility closure and office space reduction costs included in
    our restructuring plans are comprised of payments required under
    leases, less any applicable estimated sublease income after the
    properties are abandoned, lease buyout costs and other
    contractual charges. To estimate the lease loss, which is the
    loss after our cost recovery efforts from subleasing all or part
    of a building, we made certain assumptions related to the time
    period over which the relevant building would remain vacant and
    sublease terms, including sublease rates and contractual common
    area charges.

Each reporting period, we evaluate the adequacy of the lease
    loss accruals related to all of our restructuring plans. When
    necessary, we adjust the lease loss accruals for changes in real
    estate markets or other factors that may affect estimated costs
    or sublease income. We also consider executed sublease
    agreements and adjust the lease loss accruals if sublease income
    under the agreements differ from initial estimates. The credits
    recorded in connection with the Other Restructuring Plans during
    fiscal 2006, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008 relate primarily to
    changes in lease loss estimates.

As of January 3, 2009, our estimate of the accrued lease
    loss related to all worldwide restructuring plans initiated
    since 2001 was $8.4 million. This amount will be adjusted
    in the future if there are changes in the assumptions used to
    estimate the lease loss. The lease loss could range as high as
    $11.3 million if sublease rental rates decrease in
    applicable markets or if it takes longer than currently expected
    to find a suitable tenant to sublease the facilities.

Because the restructuring charges and related benefits are
    derived from management’s estimates made during the
    formulation of the restructuring plans, based on then-currently
    available information, our restructuring plans may not achieve
    the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level
    contemplated. Demand for our products and services and,
    ultimately, our future financial performance, is difficult to
    predict with any degree of certainty and is especially difficult
    to predict in light of the current economic challenges and
    uncertainty. Accordingly, additional actions, including further
    restructuring of our operations, may be required in the future.

During fiscal 2008, we recorded $44.3 million of headcount
    reduction costs associated with the 2008 Restructuring Plan,
    which included severance payments, severance-related benefits
    and costs for outplacement services. The costs recorded during
    fiscal 2008 are net of a reversal of $4.9 million recorded
    during the fourth quarter of 2008 due to termination and related
    benefits costs that were less than the initial estimate of
    $48.1 million recorded during the third quarter of fiscal
    2008. The net costs recorded during fiscal 2008 include
    severance and severance-related benefits that were communicated
    to the affected employees before January 3, 2009 and
    estimated costs that were both probable and estimable for
    employees who were notified after January 3, 2009.

We provide severance and termination benefits according to the
    varying regulations in the jurisdictions and countries in which
    we operate. In accordance with these regulations, termination
    benefits of approximately $15.4 million were paid to
    employees before January 3, 2009 and termination benefits
    of approximately $29.7 million will be paid after
    January 3, 2009. We expect to pay substantially all
    benefits by January 2, 2010. We expect ongoing annual
    savings of approximately $150.0 million related to the 2008
    Restructuring Plan.

During fiscal 2007, we completed a lease termination agreement
    for a facility included in the 2001 restructuring plan, whereby
    we paid $8.2 million and were released from all future
    obligations related to the facility. We recorded a credit to
    Restructuring and other charges of $7.1 million during the
    year ended December 29, 2007, representing the lease loss
    accrual related to this facility in excess of the amount paid.

Write-off
    of Acquired In-Process Research and Development

Upon consummation of an acquisition, we immediately charge to
    expense any acquired in-process research and development that
    has not yet reached technological feasibility and has no
    alternative future use. The value assigned to acquired
    in-process research and development is determined by identifying
    research projects in areas for which technological feasibility
    has not been established. The values are determined by
    estimating costs to develop the acquired in-process research and
    development into commercially viable products, estimating the
    resulting net cash flows from such projects and discounting the
    net cash flows back to their present value. The discount rates
    utilized include a factor that reflects the uncertainty
    surrounding successful development of the acquired in-process
    research and development.

The following table summarizes our write-offs of acquired
    in-process research and development charges during fiscal 2008,
    fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006:

Impairment
    of Goodwill

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we conduct a goodwill
    impairment analysis annually and as necessary if changes in
    facts and circumstances indicate that the fair value of our
    reporting unit may be less than the carrying amount. For
    additional description of our goodwill impairment analysis, see
    the discussion under the heading “Critical Accounting
    Estimates — Valuation of Goodwill and Other Long-lived
    Assets,” above.

We completed our annual impairment analysis of goodwill during
    the third quarter of fiscal 2008, and we determined at that time
    that we satisfied the first step of the two-step goodwill
    impairment test, and no impairment of goodwill was recorded.
    However, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we observed
    impairment indicators including a further deterioration in the
    market in which we operate and a decrease in our market
    capitalization. As such, we determined that certain indicators
    indicated that the fair value of our reporting unit was less
    than its carrying amount. Accordingly, in connection with the
    preparation of our year-end financial statements, we completed
    an interim goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2008 and recorded an Impairment of goodwill of
    $1,317.2 million, representing all of our goodwill.

During the third quarters of fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, we
    completed our annual impairment analysis of goodwill. Based on
    the results of these impairment reviews, we determined that no
    indicators of impairment existed for our one reporting unit and,
    accordingly, no impairment charge was recognized during fiscal
    2007 or fiscal 2006.

Impairment
    of Intangible and Tangible Assets

In connection with our cost savings initiatives that were
    implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we made
    certain changes to our DFM product strategy. As a result, we
    recognized an impairment charge of $42.5 million arising
    from the abandonment of certain identifiable intangible assets
    and reducing to net realizable value certain other identifiable
    intangible assets. We also abandoned and impaired
    $4.6 million of other long-lived assets during fiscal 2008.
    There were no such impairments during fiscal 2007 or fiscal 2006.

Loss on
    Extinguishment of Debt

We recorded a Loss on extinguishment of debt of
    $40.8 million during fiscal 2006, which includes a premium
    paid to repurchase a portion of the 2023 Notes of
    $38.9 million and a write-off of the related portion of
    unamortized deferred costs of issuing the 2023 Notes of
    $1.9 million.

Interest expense decreased $0.8 million in 2008, as
    compared to 2007, primarily due to the increase of
    $0.4 million in capitalized interest relating to a building
    under construction at our headquarters and a decrease in
    interest of $0.2 million related to our Term Loan, which
    was entered into on December 19, 2005 and the repayment of
    which was completed in March 2007.

During 2007, the primary component of Interest expense was the
    Convertible Senior Notes, which were issued in December 2006.
    During 2006, the primary component of interest expense was our
    Term Loan, the repayment of which was completed in March 2007.

We expect interest expense to increase during fiscal 2009, as
    compared to fiscal 2008, due to the inclusion of approximately
    $20.0 million of non-cash interest expense resulting from
    our adoption of FSP APB

14-1.

In
    addition, FSP APB

14-1

requires retrospective adoption, which will require us to adjust
    our Consolidated Financial Statements for prior years to reflect
    increased interest expense in each of those years.

The decrease in interest income in 2008, as compared to 2007,
    was due to lower average cash balances and lower interest rates.
    The increase in interest income in 2007, as compared to 2006,
    was due to higher average cash balances and higher interest
    rates. We expect interest income to decrease during fiscal 2009,
    as compared to fiscal 2008, due to the expected combination of
    lower average cash balances and lower interest rates.

During fiscal 2008, we determined that two of our
    available-for-sale securities were other-than-temporarily
    impaired based on the severity and the duration of the
    impairments, and we wrote down the investments by
    $8.1 million. We determined that four of our non-marketable
    securities were other-than-temporarily impaired during fiscal
    2008 and we wrote down the investments by $8.6 million.

During fiscal 2008, we purchased approximately 4.3 million
    shares of Mentor Graphics common stock in connection with our
    proposed acquisition of Mentor Graphics. After the announcement
    of our withdrawal of the proposed acquisition of Mentor
    Graphics, we sold our entire equity interest in Mentor Graphics
    at a loss of $9.4 million.

The $9.3 million loss on liquidation of subsidiary is
    primarily attributable to currency translation adjustment
    losses, net of gains, previously recorded in Accumulated other
    comprehensive income on our Consolidated Balance Sheet for a
    subsidiary that was completely liquidated during fiscal 2008.
    There were no significant gains or losses during fiscal 2007 or
    fiscal 2006.

In January 2006, KhiMetrics, Inc., a cost method investment held
    by Telos Venture Partners, a limited partnership in which we and
    our 1996 Deferred Compensation Venture Investment Plan Trust
    were the sole limited partners, was sold for consideration of
    $6.53 per share of common stock. In connection with this sale,
    we received approximately $20.2 million in cash and
    recorded a gain of approximately $17.1 million during
    fiscal 2006. In addition, our 1996 Deferred Compensation Venture
    Investment Plan Trust received $2.9 million in cash and
    recorded a gain of $2.5 million during fiscal 2006. Under
    the purchase agreement, an additional 10% of the consideration
    was held in escrow, which was released to us and to the trust in
    January 2007. Upon receipt of these additional proceeds, we
    recorded a gain of $2.6 million and our 1996 Deferred
    Compensation Venture Investment Plan Trust recorded a gain of
    $0.4 million during fiscal 2007.



Provision
    for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes and the effective tax rates
    during fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 were as follows:

During fiscal 2008, we had a Loss before provision for income
    taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle,
    including the impairment of $1,059.7 million of United
    States goodwill that was non-deductible. We also increased the
    valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by
    $332.9 million because of the uncertainty regarding their
    ultimate realization. In making this judgment, we considered the
    current year loss that resulted in a cumulative three-year loss
    and other factors. See discussion below for further details.

Further, given the escalating challenges in the global capital
    markets during fiscal 2008, we decided to repatriate
    $250.0 million of earnings from a foreign subsidiary to the
    United States that had previously been considered to be
    indefinitely reinvested outside the United States and for which
    deferred taxes had not been previously provided. We currently
    expect that an additional $67.2 million of previously
    untaxed earnings from foreign subsidiaries will not be
    indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. As a
    result, we have accrued a tax expense of $101.1 million
    during fiscal 2008 to provide for the federal, state and foreign
    income taxes on these repatriations. We intend to indefinitely
    reinvest the remainder of undistributed earnings of our foreign
    subsidiaries of approximately $37.8 million as of
    January 3, 2009 to meet both the working capital and
    long-term capital needs of our subsidiaries and of Cadence. The
    unrecognized deferred tax liability for these indefinitely
    reinvested foreign earnings was approximately $15.5 million
    as of January 3, 2009.

Our effective tax rate was negative for fiscal 2008, as compared
    to the positive effective tax rates for fiscal 2007, primarily
    due to the Loss before provision for income taxes and cumulative
    effect of change in accounting principle and the tax expenses
    related to the increase in our valuation allowance against our
    deferred tax assets, repatriations of foreign earnings,
    impairment of non-deductible goodwill, income of certain foreign
    subsidiaries and interest expense on our unrecognized tax
    benefits.

Our effective tax rate decreased during fiscal 2007, as compared
    to fiscal 2006, primarily due to the decrease in net
    unrecognized tax benefit of $27.8 million, as a result of
    the effective settlement of certain tax matters with the IRS in
    December 2007 and an increase in benefit from foreign income,
    which is taxed at a lower rate than the United States federal
    statutory income tax rate, of $30.6 million, resulting from
    the conclusion of certain transfer pricing arrangements with a
    foreign subsidiary in 2006.

We currently expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 to be
    approximately (16.0)%. The effective tax rate is negative
    because we anticipate having a loss before provision for income
    taxes and because we expect to have tax expense on the income of
    certain foreign subsidiaries and interest expense on our
    unrecognized tax benefits. In addition, we currently anticipate
    recording a valuation allowance that will offset the potential
    tax benefit of certain tax loss and credit carryforwards
    generated during fiscal 2009. However, we expect that the
    effective tax rate for interim reporting periods during fiscal
    2009 will vary from the estimated annual effective tax rate
    because of the recognition of period-specific items of tax
    expense or benefit such as interest expense related to
    unrecognized tax benefits.

Net
    Deferred Tax Assets and IRS Examinations

We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability
    and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than
    not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not
    be realized. We consider various sources of taxable income and
    all available positive and negative evidence about these
    possible sources of taxable income. As required by
    SFAS No. 109, a company’s current or previous
    losses are given more weight than its future outlook. Under this
    standard, our current year loss in fiscal 2008, which included
    the impairment of goodwill and other intangible and tangible
    assets, resulted in a cumulative three-year loss and was
    considered a significant negative



factor. The current year loss, the uncertain and negative market
    and economic conditions which severely limited our visibility to
    the timing and extent of an economic recovery, and our
    expectation of a net loss in the near term were considered
    significant negative evidence with a high level of objectivity
    that outweighed our ability to rely on our longer term
    projections of future taxable income in determining whether a
    valuation allowance was needed. Accordingly, we concluded that
    an increase in valuation allowance of $332.9 million was
    required as of January 3, 2009. If, in the future, we
    determine that these deferred tax assets are more likely than
    not to be realized, a release of all or part of the related
    valuation allowance could result in a material income tax
    benefit in the period such determination is made. As of
    January 3, 2009, we had total net deferred tax assets of
    approximately $66.4 million. The net deferred tax assets
    are primarily composed of United States net operating loss and
    tax credit carryforwards. The net deferred tax assets are
    presented gross of unrecognized tax benefits, which are not
    directly associated with the net operating loss and tax credit
    carryforwards. Although we cannot guarantee that we will be able
    to realize these deferred tax assets, we believe that it is more
    likely than not that we will be able to realize the net deferred
    tax assets over time.

In July 2006, the IRS completed its field examination of our
    federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2002
    and issued an RAR in which the IRS proposed to assess an
    aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year period of
    approximately $324.0 million. In November 2006, the IRS
    revised the proposed aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year
    period to be approximately $318.0 million. The IRS is
    contesting our qualification for deferred recognition of certain
    proceeds received from restitution and settlement in connection
    with litigation during the period. The proposed tax deficiency
    for this item is approximately $152.0 million. The
    remaining proposed tax deficiency of approximately
    $166.0 million is primarily related to proposed adjustments
    to our transfer pricing arrangements that we had with foreign
    subsidiaries and to our deductions for foreign trade income. The
    IRS may make similar claims against our transfer pricing
    arrangements and deductions for foreign trade income in future
    examinations. We have filed a timely protest with the IRS and
    are seeking resolution of the issues with the Appeals Office.

We believe that the proposed IRS adjustments are inconsistent
    with applicable tax laws and we are vigorously challenging these
    proposed adjustments. The RAR is not a final Statutory Notice of
    Deficiency but the IRS imposes interest on the proposed
    deficiencies until the matters are resolved. Interest is
    compounded daily at rates published by the IRS, which rates are
    adjusted quarterly and have been between 4% and 10% since 2001.
    The IRS is currently examining our federal income tax returns
    for the tax years 2003 through 2005.

Significant judgment is required in applying the principles of
    FIN No. 48 and SFAS No. 109. The calculation
    of our provision for income taxes involves dealing with
    uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and
    regulations. In determining the adequacy of our provision for
    income taxes, we regularly assess the potential settlement
    outcomes resulting from income tax examinations. However, the
    final outcome of tax examinations, including the total amount
    payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of
    these issues, cannot be estimated with certainty. In addition,
    we cannot be certain that such amount will not be materially
    different than that which is reflected in our historical income
    tax provisions and accruals. Should the IRS or other tax
    authorities assess additional taxes as a result of a current or
    a future examination, we may be required to record charges to
    operations in future periods that could have a material impact
    on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows
    in the applicable period or periods.

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments

As of January 3, 2009, our principal sources of liquidity
    consisted of $572.1 million of Cash and cash equivalents
    and Short-term investments, as compared to $1,078.1 million
    as of December 29, 2007 and $958.4 million as of
    December 30, 2006.

Our primary sources of cash during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007
    were:

•

Customer payments under software licenses and from the sale or
    lease of our hardware products;

•

Customer payments for engineering services;

•

Proceeds from the sale of receivables;

•

Cash received for common stock purchases under our employee
    stock purchase plan; and

•

Proceeds from the exercise of stock options during fiscal 2007.

Our primary uses of cash during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 were:

•

Payments relating to salary, benefits, other employee-related
    costs and other operating expenses, including our restructuring
    plans;

•

Purchases of treasury stock as part of our stock repurchase
    program;

•

Repurchase of the 2023 Notes in the amount of
    $230.2 million pursuant to their terms;

•

Purchases of property, plant and equipment; and

•

Payments to former shareholders of acquired businesses.

Our existing Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investment
    balances may decline during the first quarter of fiscal 2009,
    and continue to decline during fiscal 2009, in the event of a
    further deterioration in the economy or the capital markets, a
    reduction in our cash receipts or changes in our cash outlays.
    However, we expect that current cash and short-term investment
    balances and cash flows that are generated from operations will
    be sufficient to meet our working capital and other capital
    requirements for at least the next 12 months.

Cash flows provided by operating activities include net income
    (loss), adjusted for certain non-cash charges, as well as
    changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities. Our
    cash flows from operating activities are significantly
    influenced by business levels, the payment terms set forth in
    our license agreements and by sales of our receivables. As a
    result of challenges currently affecting the economy of the
    United States and other regions of the world, our customers, who
    are concentrated in the semiconductor sector, have experienced
    and may continue to experience adverse changes in their business
    and as a result, may delay purchasing our products and services
    or delay or default on their payment obligations. If our
    customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or
    are precluded from securing financing, they may not be able to
    pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that are owed
    to us, although these obligations are generally not cancelable.
    Our customers’ inability to fulfill payment obligations may
    adversely affect our cash flow. Additionally, our customers may
    seek to renegotiate pre-existing contractual commitments. Though
    we have not yet experienced a material level of defaults, any
    material payment default by our customers or significant
    reductions in existing contractual commitments would have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating
    results.

We have entered into agreements whereby we may transfer accounts
    receivable to certain financial institutions on a non-recourse
    or limited-recourse basis. These transfers are recorded as sales
    and accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 140,
    “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
    and Extinguishments of Liabilities.” During fiscal 2008, we
    transferred accounts receivable, net of the losses on the sale
    of the



receivables, totaling $52.2 million, which approximated
    fair value, to financial institutions on a non-recourse basis,
    as compared to $215.4 million during fiscal 2007 and
    $180.6 million during fiscal 2006. As a result of the
    credit losses recorded by banks during 2008 and the current
    financial challenges experienced by banks, a number of banks
    have become less willing to purchase assets because of capital
    constraints and concerns about over-exposure to the technology
    sector. In addition, the change in our license mix will result
    in an increased number of subscription licenses and a decrease
    in the sale of receivables to financial institutions, so we
    expect a reduced level of Proceeds from the sale of receivables
    throughout fiscal 2009.

Due to the lower order levels and the reduced level of sale of
    receivables, we do not expect positive net cash flows from
    operating activities in fiscal 2009.

During fiscal 2008, we initiated the 2008 Restructuring Plan to
    decrease costs by reducing our workforce across the company and
    by consolidating facilities where the workforce reductions
    resulted in excess office space. This restructuring plan is
    intended to decrease costs by reducing our workforce throughout
    the company by at least 625 positions and we recorded
    Restructuring and other charges of $46.4 million during
    fiscal 2008. As of January 3, 2009, we had made payments in
    connection with the 2008 Restructuring Plan in the amount of
    $15.6 million. We expect substantially all termination
    benefits to be paid by January 2, 2010. We expect ongoing
    annual savings of approximately $150.0 million related to
    the 2008 Restructuring Plan.

Cash
    Flows from Investing Activities

Our primary investing activities consisted of:

•

Purchases and proceeds from the sale of property, plant and
    equipment;

•

In January 2007, we completed the sale of certain land and
    buildings in San Jose, California for a sales price of
    $46.5 million in cash. Concurrently with the sale, we
    leased back from the purchaser all available space in the
    buildings. During the lease term, we constructed an additional
    building located on our San Jose, California campus to
    replace the buildings we sold in this transaction. We expect to
    use approximately $5.6 million in cash in fiscal 2009 in
    connection with the completion of construction of this new
    building. We expect decreased cash payments for Property, plant
    and equipment during fiscal 2009 as the new building is complete.

During fiscal 2008, we purchased approximately 4.3 million
    shares of Mentor Graphics common stock for $62.4 million in
    connection with our proposed acquisition of Mentor Graphics.
    After the announcement of our withdrawal of the proposed
    acquisition of Mentor Graphics we sold our entire equity
    interest in Mentor Graphics at a loss of $9.4 million.



In connection with our acquisitions completed before
    January 3, 2009, we may be obligated to pay up to an
    aggregate of $51.0 million in cash during the next
    44 months if certain defined performance goals are achieved
    in full, which would be expensed as compensation expense in our
    Consolidated Statements of Operations.

We expect to continue our investing activities, including
    purchasing property, plant and equipment, purchasing intangible
    assets, purchasing software licenses and making long-term equity
    investments.

Cash
    Flows from Financing Activities

Financing cash flows during fiscal 2008 consisted primarily of
    purchases of treasury stock, the repurchase of our 2023 Notes
    and the issuance of common stock under certain employee plans.

Net cash used for financing activities increased by
    $273.3 million during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal
    2007, and decreased $63.8 million during fiscal 2007, as
    compared to fiscal 2006, due to the following:

The decrease in Proceeds from the issuance of common stock
    during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, is due to fewer
    stock option exercises resulting from lower stock prices. The
    decrease in Purchases of treasury stock during fiscal 2008, as
    compared to fiscal 2007, is due to a lower cost to repurchase
    shares.

We record a gain or loss on re-issuance of treasury stock based
    on the total proceeds received in the transaction. During fiscal
    2008, we recorded losses on the re-issuance of treasury stock of
    $110.6 million as a component of Retained earnings.

As of January 3, 2009, we have $854.4 million
    remaining under the stock repurchase programs authorized by our
    Board of Directors.

Other
    Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources

Income Taxes

Given the escalating challenges in the global capital markets
    during fiscal 2008, we decided to repatriate $250.0 million
    of earnings from a foreign subsidiary to the United States that
    had previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested
    outside the United States and for which deferred taxes had not
    been previously provided. We currently expect to repatriate an
    additional $67.2 million of previously untaxed earnings
    from foreign subsidiaries in future periods. We expect that our
    available net operating losses and foreign tax credits will
    offset any current year income taxes related to the dividends
    paid during fiscal 2008. We intend to indefinitely reinvest the
    remainder of our undistributed earnings of our foreign
    subsidiaries of approximately $37.8 million as of
    January 3, 2009, to meet both the working capital and
    long-term capital needs of its subsidiaries and of Cadence. The
    unrecognized deferred tax liability for these indefinitely
    reinvested foreign earnings was approximately $15.5 million
    as of January 3, 2009.



During fiscal 2008, we also increased our valuation allowance on
    our deferred tax assets by $332.9 million because of the
    uncertainty regarding their ultimate realization. We record a
    valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the
    amount that we are more likely than not to realize. The
    valuation allowance will not result in current or future tax
    payments. For additional description of the valuation allowance
    on our deferred tax assets, see the discussion under the heading
    “Results of Operations — Provision for Income
    Taxes,” above.

The IRS and other tax authorities regularly examine our income
    tax returns and we have received a RAR in which the IRS proposed
    to assess a tax deficiency. For additional description of our
    IRS Examinations, see the discussion under the heading
    “Results of Operations — Provision for Income
    Taxes,” above.

As of January 3, 2009, we had current income tax
    liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of
    $5.7 million. As of January 3, 2009, we had long-term
    income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of
    $288.0 million. For additional information on the income
    tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, see the
    discussion under the heading “Contractual Obligations and
    Off Balance Sheet Arrangements,” below.

1.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2011 and
    1.500% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2013

In December 2006, we issued $250.0 million principal amount
    of 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2011, or the 2011
    Notes, and $250.0 million principal amount of
    1.500% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2013, or the 2013
    Notes, and collectively, the Convertible Senior Notes, to three
    initial purchasers in a private placement pursuant to
    Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or
    Securities Act, for resale to qualified institutional buyers
    pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act. The indentures
    for the Convertible Senior Notes do not contain any financial
    covenants.

We received net proceeds of approximately $487.0 million
    after transaction fees of approximately $13.0 million,
    including $12.0 million of underwriting discounts. A
    portion of the net proceeds totaling $228.5 million was
    used to purchase $189.6 million principal amount of our
    2023 Notes.

Holders may convert their Convertible Senior Notes prior to
    maturity upon the occurrence of one of the following events:

•

The price of our common stock reaches $27.50 during certain
    periods of time specified in the Convertible Senior Notes;

•

Specified corporate transactions occur; or

•

The trading price of the Convertible Senior Notes falls below
    98% of the product of (i) the last reported sale price of
    our common stock and (ii) the conversion rate on that date.

On and after November 2, 2011, in the case of the 2011
    Notes, and November 1, 2013, in the case of the 2013 Notes,
    until the close of business on the scheduled trading day
    immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert
    their Convertible Senior Notes at any time, regardless of the
    foregoing circumstances. We may not redeem the Convertible
    Senior Notes prior to maturity.

The initial conversion rate for the Convertible Senior Notes is
    47.2813 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal
    amount of Convertible Senior Notes, equivalent to a conversion
    price of approximately $21.15 per share of our common stock.
    Upon conversion, a holder will receive the sum of the daily
    settlement amounts, calculated on a proportionate basis for each
    day, during a specified observation period following the
    conversion date. The daily settlement amount during each date of
    the observation period consists of:

•

Cash up to the principal amount of the note; and

•

Our common stock to the extent that the conversion value exceeds
    the amount of cash paid upon conversion of the Convertible
    Senior Notes.

In addition, if a fundamental change occurs prior to maturity
    and provided that our stock price is greater than $18.00 per
    share, the conversion rate will increase by an additional amount
    of up to $8.27 per share, for a holder that elects to convert
    its Convertible Senior Notes in connection with such fundamental
    change, which amount will be paid entirely in cash. A
    fundamental change is any transaction or event (whether by means
    of an exchange offer, liquidation, tender offer, consolidation,
    merger, combination, reclassification, recapitalization or
    otherwise) in



which more than 50% of our common stock is exchanged for,
    converted into, acquired for or constitutes solely the right to
    receive, consideration. No fundamental change will have occurred
    if at least 90% of the consideration received consists of shares
    of common stock, or depositary receipts representing such
    shares, that are:

•

Listed on, or immediately after the transaction or event will be
    listed on, a United States national securities exchange; or

•

Approved, or immediately after the transaction or event will be
    approved, for quotation on a United States system of automated
    dissemination of quotations of securities prices similar to the
    NASDAQ National Market prior to its designation as a national
    securities exchange.

As of January 3, 2009, none of the conditions allowing the
    holders of the Convertible Senior Notes to convert had been met.

Interest on the Convertible Senior Notes began accruing in
    December 2006 and is payable semi-annually each
    December 15th and June 15th.

Concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes,
    we entered into hedge transactions with various parties whereby
    we have the option to purchase up to 23.6 million shares of
    our common stock at a price of $21.15 per share, subject to
    adjustment. These options expire on December 15, 2011, in
    the case of the 2011 Notes, and December 15, 2013, in the
    case of the 2013 Notes, and must be settled in net shares. The
    aggregate cost of these hedge transactions was
    $119.8 million and has been recorded as a reduction to
    Stockholders’ equity in accordance with Emerging Issues
    Task Force, or EITF,

No. 00-19,

“Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed
    to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own
    Stock.” The estimated fair value of the hedges acquired in
    connection with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes was
    $11.6 million as of January 3, 2009. Subsequent
    changes in the fair value of these hedges will not be recognized
    as long as the instruments remain classified as equity.

In separate transactions, we also sold warrants to various
    parties for the purchase of up to 23.6 million shares of
    our common stock at a price of $31.50 per share in a private
    placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.
    The warrants expire on various dates from February 2012 through
    April 2012 in the case of the 2011 Notes, and February 2014
    through April 2014 in the case of the 2013 Notes, and must be
    settled in net shares. We received $39.4 million in cash
    proceeds from the sale of these warrants, which has been
    recorded as a reduction to Stockholders’ equity in
    accordance with EITF

No. 00-19.

The estimated fair value of the warrants sold in connection with
    the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes was
    $7.5 million as of January 3, 2009. Subsequent changes
    in the fair value of these warrants will not be recognized as
    long as the instruments remain classified as equity. The
    warrants will be included in diluted earnings per share, or EPS,
    to the extent the impact is dilutive.

Zero Coupon Zero Yield Senior Convertible Notes Due 2023

In August 2003, we issued $420.0 million principal amount
    of our 2023 Notes to two initial purchasers in a private
    placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act
    for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to
    Rule 144A of the Securities Act. We received net proceeds
    of $406.4 million after transaction fees of
    $13.6 million that were recorded in Other long-term assets
    and were being amortized to interest expense using the
    straight-line method over five years. In connection with the
    issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes in December 2006, we
    repurchased $189.6 million principal amount of the 2023
    Notes and in August 2008, we repurchased $230.2 million
    principal amount of the 2023 Notes upon election of the holders
    of the 2023 Notes pursuant to the terms of the 2023 Notes, for
    total consideration of $230.8 million, reducing the
    outstanding 2023 Notes balance to $0.2 million as of
    January 3, 2009. Concurrently with the issuance of the 2023
    Notes, we entered into hedge and warrant transactions, all of
    which expired during fiscal 2008 and no settlement was required.

The 2023 Notes are due in August 2023. However, the holders of
    the 2023 Notes can require us to repurchase for cash the
    remaining portion of the 2023 Notes on August 15, 2013 for
    100.00% of the principal amount. Therefore, we have included
    $0.2 million of principal of the 2023 Notes on the
    potential repurchase of the 2023 Notes in the 3 to 5 Years
    column in the above table.

u

Included in other long-term contractual obligations are
    long-term income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax
    benefits of $288.0 million, and of that amount we estimate
    that $212.9 million will be paid within 1 to 3 years.
    We did not include the remaining long-term income tax
    liabilities of $75.1 million in the table above, because we
    estimated that this liability can be offset by available net
    operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and that future
    cash payments will not be required to settle this liability.
    However, the total amounts of income tax payable and the timing
    of such tax payments may depend upon the resolution of current
    and future tax examinations which cannot be estimated with
    certainty. The remaining portion of other long-term contractual
    obligations is primarily acquisition-related liabilities.

With respect to purchase obligations that are cancelable by us,
    the table includes the amount that would have been payable if we
    had canceled the obligation as of January 3, 2009 or the
    earliest cancellation date.

In connection with our acquisitions completed before
    January 3, 2009, we may be obligated to pay up to an
    aggregate of $51.0 million in cash during the next
    44 months if certain predefined performance goals are
    achieved in full.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

As of January 3, 2009, we did not have any significant
    off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in
    Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC

Regulation S-K.

New
    Accounting Standards

In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP APB

14-1,

“Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be
    Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash
    Settlement),” which will require us to recognize additional
    non-cash interest expense related to our Convertible Senior
    Notes in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. FSP APB

14-1

is
    effective for fiscal 2009 and is required to be applied
    retrospectively for all periods for which our Convertible Senior
    Notes were outstanding before the date of adoption. FSP APB

14-1

will
    have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial
    condition, particularly with respect to interest expense ratios
    commonly referred to by lenders, and could potentially hinder
    our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt or
    equity



securities. We expect interest expense to increase during fiscal
    2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, due to the inclusion of
    approximately $20.0 million of non-cash interest expense
    resulting from our adoption of FSP APB

14-1.

In
    addition, FSP APB

14-1

requires retrospective adoption, which will require us to adjust
    our Consolidated Financial Statements for prior years to reflect
    increased interest expense in each of those years.

In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP

FAS No. 142-3,

“Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
    Assets.” FSP

FAS 142-3

amends the factors an entity should consider in developing
    renewal or extension assumptions used in determining the useful
    life of recognized intangible assets under
    SFAS No. 142. This new guidance applies prospectively
    to intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a
    group of other assets in business combinations and asset
    acquisitions. FSP

FAS 142-3

is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2008.
    Early adoption is prohibited. Since this guidance will be
    applied prospectively, on adoption, there will be no impact to
    our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,
    “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities — an Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 133,” which requires companies with derivative
    instruments to disclose information that should enable financial
    statement users to understand how and why a company uses
    derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related
    hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133,
    “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities,” and how derivative instruments and related
    hedged items affect a company’s financial position,
    financial performance and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is
    effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Because
    SFAS No. 161 only requires additional disclosure, the
    adoption will not impact our consolidated financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R,
    “Business Combinations” and SFAS No. 160,
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements, an amendment of Accounting Research
    Bulletin No. 51.” SFAS No. 141R will
    change how business acquisitions are accounted for and will
    impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in
    subsequent periods. SFAS No. 160 will change the
    accounting and reporting for minority interests, which will be
    recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a
    component of equity. SFAS No. 141R and
    SFAS No. 160 are effective for fiscal years beginning
    after December 15, 2008. Early adoption is not permitted.
    We are currently evaluating the impact that
    SFAS No. 141R and SFAS No. 160 will have on
    our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements,” which defines fair value,
    establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands
    disclosures regarding fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value
    measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance
    found in various prior accounting pronouncements.
    SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after November 15, 2007. However, on February 12,
    2008, the FASB issued FSP

FAS No. 157-2,

which delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for
    all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except
    those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the
    financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually),
    to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 and
    interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the
    scope of FSP

FAS No. 157-2.

We adopted SFAS No. 157 at the beginning of fiscal
    2008, except as it applies to those non-financial assets and
    non-financial liabilities as described in FSP

FAS No. 157-2.

We adopted SFAS No. 157 for all non-financial assets
    and non-financial liabilities on the first day of fiscal 2009.
    Since the adoption of SFAS No. 157 for non-financial
    assets and non-financial liabilities will be applied
    prospectively, on adoption, there will be no impact to our
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 7A.
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk

Interest
    Rate Risk

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates
    relates primarily to our portfolio of Cash and cash equivalents.
    While we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of
    the world’s leading industrialized countries, our interest
    income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the
    general level of United States interest rates. In this regard,
    changes in United States interest rates affect the interest
    earned on our Cash and cash equivalents and costs associated
    with foreign currency hedges.



We invest in high quality credit issuers and, by policy, limit
    the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer. As part of
    our policy, our first priority is to reduce the risk of
    principal loss. Consequently, we seek to preserve our invested
    funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment
    risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality
    credit securities that we believe to have low credit risk and by
    positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a
    significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment
    issuer or guarantor. The short-term interest-bearing portfolio
    of Cash and cash equivalents includes only marketable securities
    with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio
    liquidity.

All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or
    less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash
    equivalents. Investments with maturities greater than three
    months are classified as available-for-sale and are considered
    to be short-term investments. The carrying value of our
    interest-bearing instruments approximated fair value as of
    January 3, 2009. The following table presents the carrying
    value and related weighted average interest rates for our
    interest-bearing instruments, which are all classified as Cash
    and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
    January 3, 2009.

Foreign
    Currency Risk

Most of our revenue, expenses and material business activity are
    transacted in the United States dollar. However, certain of our
    operations include transactions in foreign currencies and,
    therefore, we benefit from a weaker dollar, and in certain
    countries where we invoice customers in the local currency, we
    are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major
    currencies worldwide. The primary effect of foreign currency
    transactions on our results of operations from a weakening
    United States dollar is an increase in revenue offset by a
    smaller increase in expenses. Conversely, the primary effect of
    foreign currency transactions on our results of operations from
    a strengthening United States dollar is a reduction in revenue
    offset by a smaller reduction in expenses.

We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with
    financial institutions to protect against currency exchange
    risks associated with existing assets and liabilities. A foreign
    currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing
    in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying
    liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange
    rates. Conversely, a foreign currency forward exchange contract
    decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or
    underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in
    foreign exchange rates. These forward contracts are not
    designated as accounting hedges under SFAS No. 133
    and, therefore, the unrealized gains and losses are recognized
    in Other income, net, in advance of the actual foreign currency
    cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being
    recorded as accrued liabilities or other current assets.

Our policy governing hedges of foreign currency risk does not
    allow us to use forward contracts for trading purposes. Our
    forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or
    less. The effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our
    ability to estimate future asset and liability exposures. We
    enter into currency forward exchange contracts based on
    estimated future asset and liability exposures. Recognized gains
    and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will
    ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the
    amount of currency forward exchange contracts with actual
    underlying asset and liability exposures.

The following table provides information, as of January 3,
    2009, about our forward foreign currency contracts. The
    information is provided in United States dollar equivalent
    amounts. The table presents the notional amounts, at contract
    exchange rates, and the weighted average contractual foreign
    currency exchange rates expressed as units of



the foreign currency per United States dollar, which in some
    cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular
    currency. All of these forward contracts matured during January
    2009.

Equity
    Price Risk

1.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2011 and
    1.500% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2013

In December 2006, we issued $250.0 million principal amount
    of 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2011, or the 2011
    Notes, and $250.0 million of 1.500% Convertible Senior
    Notes Due 2013, or the 2013 Notes and collectively, the
    Convertible Senior Notes, to three initial purchasers in a
    private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the
    Securities Act for resale to qualified institutional buyers
    pursuant to SEC Rule 144A. Concurrently with the issuance
    of the Convertible Senior Notes, we entered into hedge
    transactions with various parties and in separate transactions,
    sold warrants to various parties to reduce the potential
    dilution from the conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes and
    to mitigate any negative effect such conversion may have on the
    price of our common stock. For additional description of the
    Convertible Senior Notes, including the hedge and warrants
    transactions, see the discussion under the heading
    “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Factors
    Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources” under
    Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” above.

Investments

We have a portfolio of equity investments that includes
    marketable equity securities and non-marketable equity
    securities. Our equity investments are made primarily in
    connection with our strategic investment program. Under our
    strategic investment program, from time to time we make cash
    investments in companies with technologies that are potentially
    strategically important to us.

The fair value of our portfolio of available-for-sale marketable
    equity securities, which are included in Short-term investments
    on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, was
    $3.6 million as of January 3, 2009 and
    $14.9 million as of December 29, 2007. While we
    actively monitor these investments, we do not currently engage
    in any hedging activities to reduce or eliminate equity price
    risk with respect to these equity investments. Accordingly, we
    could lose all or part of our investment portfolio of marketable
    equity securities if there is an adverse change in the market
    prices of the companies we invest in.



Our investments in non-marketable equity securities would be
    negatively affected by an adverse change in equity market
    prices, although the impact cannot be directly quantified. Such
    a change, or any negative change in the financial performance or
    prospects of the companies whose non-marketable securities we
    own, would harm the ability of these companies to raise
    additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to
    realize any gains or return of our investments through liquidity
    events such as initial public offerings, acquisitions and
    private sales. These types of investments involve a high degree
    of risk, and there can be no assurance that any company we
    invest in will grow or will be successful or that we will be
    able to liquidate a particular investment when desired.
    Accordingly, we could lose all or part of our investment.

Our investments in non-marketable equity securities had a
    carrying amount of $18.7 million as of January 3, 2009
    and $26.2 million as of December 29, 2007. If we
    determine that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value
    exists for a non-marketable equity security, we write down the
    investment to its fair value and record the related write-down
    as an investment loss in our Consolidated Statements of
    Operations.

Item 9A. Controls
    and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We carried out an evaluation required by

Rule 13a-15

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the
    Exchange Act, under the supervision and with the participation
    of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, or
    CEO, and our Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Exchange Act) as of January 3, 2009.

The evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures
    included a review of our processes and the effect on the
    information generated for use in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

In the course of this evaluation, we sought to identify any
    material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures,
    to determine whether we had identified any acts of fraud
    involving personnel who have a significant role in our
    disclosure controls and procedures, and to confirm that any
    necessary corrective action, including process improvements, was
    taken. This type of evaluation is performed  every fiscal
    quarter so that our conclusions concerning the effectiveness of
    these controls can be reported in our periodic reports filed
    with the SEC. We intend to maintain these disclosure controls
    and procedures, modifying them as circumstances warrant.

Based on their evaluation as of January 3, 2009, our CEO
    and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and
    procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that
    the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports
    filed or submitted under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded,
    processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
    specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (ii) is
    accumulated and communicated to our management, including the
    CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosure. As previously disclosed in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K,

we appointed a new CEO, effective January 8, 2009.
    Therefore, it should be noted that the certification of the CEO
    as to our disclosure controls and procedures as of
    January 3, 2009 is necessarily based in part on an
    evaluation of facts that existed before he served in the
    capacity of CEO.

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, in connection with the
    restatement of our previously issued financial statements for
    the periods ended March 29, 2008 and June 28, 2008 and
    our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures,
    management concluded that as of March 29, 2008,
    June 28, 2008 and September 27, 2008, our disclosure
    controls and procedures were not effective and that we had a
    material weakness in internal control over financial reporting.
    We engaged in a review of our internal control over financial
    reporting as described below and, based on that review, our
    management believes that the changes in our internal control
    over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal
    2008 described below materially affected, or are reasonably
    likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
    reporting. We believe the remediation measures described below
    have been successful in the remediation of the material weakness
    previously identified and have further strengthened and enhanced
    our internal control over financial reporting. See also
    “Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting” below.

Remediation
    of Previously Reported Material Weakness

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, consistent with good
    corporate governance practices, the Audit Committee of our Board
    of Directors, or Audit Committee, with the assistance of special
    counsel and other advisors, conducted an investigation of the
    events that led to the restatement of our previously issued
    financial statements for the quarterly periods ended
    March 29, 2008 and June 28, 2008. The restatements are
    more fully described in the Explanatory Note to Amendment
    No. 1 to the Quarterly Reports on

Form 10-Q/A

for the periods ended March 29, 2008 and June 28, 2008
    and in Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial
    Statements therein. Upon the completion of this investigation,
    the Audit Committee concluded that the circumstances that led to
    the restatement were not the result of illegal conduct on the
    part of any of our directors, officers or other employees. We
    also carried



out, as of September 27, 2008, an evaluation required by

Rule 13a-15

of the Exchange Act of the effectiveness of the design and
    operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, under the
    supervision and with the participation of our management,
    including the Chief of Staff of our Interim Office of the Chief
    Executive, or IOCE Chief of Staff, who performed functions
    similar to a principal executive officer during a portion of the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, and our CFO. In the course of
    that evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our
    management concluded that as of March 29, 2008,
    June 28, 2008 and September 27, 2008, our disclosure
    controls and procedures were not effective and that we had a
    material weakness in internal control over financial reporting.

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of
    deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that
    creates a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of
    our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
    or detected on a timely basis. Our management concluded that
    there was a material weakness in our internal controls over the
    application of revenue recognition criteria required by

SOP 97-2

“Software Revenue Recognition” in the context of
    multiple-element software arrangements. The material weakness
    related to both the insufficient design and ineffective
    operation of certain internal controls over the recognition of
    revenue from term license agreements. Specifically, the material
    weakness was comprised of the following components:

•

Controls were not adequately designed to facilitate
    communication of all information pertinent to the negotiations
    with customers between the sales and sales finance organizations
    and the personnel responsible for determining the appropriate
    recognition of the revenue related to such license agreements.
    As a result, controls relative to the sales and sales finance
    organizations reviewing, analyzing and evaluating available
    information pertinent to revenue recognition for term license
    agreements were not operating effectively.

•

Controls were not adequately designed to detect or prevent the
    inappropriate issuance of evaluation licenses to customers for
    incubation technology. Incubation technology is not commercially
    available for release.

As a result of the material weakness in internal control over
    financial reporting, our management did not previously detect
    that revenue from three term license arrangements was improperly
    recognized in the quarterly periods ended March 29, 2008
    and June 28, 2008 and preliminarily recognized in the
    quarterly period ended September 27, 2008, which resulted
    in the restatement of our previously issued condensed
    consolidated financial statements for the three month period
    ended March 29, 2008 and for the three and six month
    periods ended June 28, 2008, and adjustments to the
    preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements for the
    three and nine month periods ended September 27, 2008. To
    address the material weakness described above, we implemented
    enhancements to our internal controls. Specifically, we took the
    following actions during the last fiscal quarter ended
    January 3, 2009, which our management believes have
    improved, and will continue to improve, our internal control
    over financial reporting, and our disclosure controls and
    procedures:

•

We enhanced our comprehensive, ongoing compliance training
    specific to our policies and procedures that individuals who are
    part of the sales process are required to take;

•

We now require additional analysis, communication, and
    accompanying documentation from our sales and sales finance
    organizations relating to recognition of revenue for term
    license agreements, with particular emphasis on transactions
    when factors are present that increase the risk that the
    transaction could be deemed to be a subset of a multiple element
    arrangement;

•

We enhanced our existing processes and controls with respect to
    evaluation licenses that are applied to all technology being
    evaluated by customers; and

•

We made certain personnel changes and increased supervision and
    training to effectuate the changes discussed above.

Our management believes that the actions described above
    remediated the material weakness we identified and strengthened
    our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent
    Limitations on Effectiveness of Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting and Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that
    our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control
    over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and
    all fraud. An internal control framework, no matter how well
    conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
    absolute, assurance that the objectives of internal control are
    met. Further, the design of internal control must reflect the
    fact that there are



resource constraints, and the benefits of the controls must be
    considered relative to their costs. While our disclosure
    controls and procedures and internal control over financial
    reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of their
    effectiveness, because of the inherent limitations in internal
    control, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
    assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if
    any, within Cadence have been detected.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined
    in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Exchange Act). Our management assessed the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of January 3, 2009. In making this assessment, our
    management used the criteria established in

Internal
    Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Our
    management has concluded that, as of January 3, 2009, our
    internal control over financial reporting is effective based on
    these criteria. Our independent registered public accounting
    firm, KPMG LLP, has issued an attestation report on our internal
    control over financial reporting, which is included in
    Item 15, “Exhibits and Financial Statement
    Schedules.”

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Cadence Design Systems, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as
    of January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007, and the
    related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss), and
    cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
    January 3, 2009. In connection with our audits of the
    consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the
    financial statement schedule, as set forth under
    Item 15(a)(2). These consolidated financial statements and
    financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial
    statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
    January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007, and the results
    of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years
    in the three-year period ended January 3, 2009, in
    conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement
    schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
    financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
    material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for
    uncertainty in income taxes, effective December 31, 2006,
    due to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board
    Interpretation (FIN) No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty
    in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    January 3, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO), and our report dated March 2, 2009
    expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Cadence Design Systems, Inc.:

We have audited Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and
    subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial
    reporting as of January 3, 2009, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control – Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)

.

The
    Company’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in the accompanying

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

included in Item 9A. Our responsibility is to
    express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries
    maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of January 3, 2009, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated
    Framework

issued by the COSO.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and
    subsidiaries as of January 3, 2009 and December 29,
    2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss), and
    cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
    January 3, 2009. In connection with our audits of the
    consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the
    financial statement schedule as of and for each of the years in
    the three-year period ended January 3, 2009. Our report
    dated March 2, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on
    those consolidated financial statements and accompanying
    financial statement schedule.

    accounts of Cadence and its subsidiaries after elimination of
    intercompany accounts and transactions. All consolidated
    subsidiaries are wholly-owned by Cadence.

Use
    of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
    conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts
    of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates.

Cash,
    Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

Cadence considers all highly liquid debt instruments, which
    could include commercial paper, European Union euro time
    deposits, repurchase agreements and certificates of deposit,
    with remaining maturities of three months or less at the time of
    purchase to be cash equivalents. Investments with maturities
    greater than three months and less than one year are classified
    as Short-term investments.

Foreign
    Operations

Cadence transacts business in various foreign currencies. The
    United States dollar is the functional currency of
    Cadence’s consolidated entities operating in the United
    States and Cadence’s principal Irish, Israeli, Hungarian
    and Dutch subsidiaries. The functional currency for
    Cadence’s other consolidated entities operating outside of
    the United States is generally the local country’s
    currency, which is the primary currency in which the entity
    generates and expends cash. Cadence translates the financial
    statements of consolidated entities whose functional currency is
    not the United States dollar into United States dollars. Cadence
    translates assets and liabilities at the exchange rate in effect
    as of the financial statement date and translates statement of
    operations accounts using the average exchange rate for the
    period. Cadence includes translation adjustments from foreign
    exchange and the effect of exchange rate changes on intercompany
    transactions of a long-term investment nature in
    Stockholders’ Equity as a component of Accumulated other
    comprehensive income. Cadence reports gains and losses from
    foreign exchange rate changes related to intercompany
    receivables and payables that are not of a long-term investment
    nature, as well as gains and losses from foreign currency
    transactions, in its Consolidated Statements of Operations.
    Cadence recognized a $9.9 million loss attributable to
    currency translation adjustment losses, net of gains, from the
    complete liquidation of a subsidiary during fiscal 2008. There
    were no significant gains or losses during fiscal 2007 or fiscal
    2006.



Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Cadence accounts for its foreign currency exchange contracts in
    accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or
    SFAS, No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments
    and Hedging Activities.” Cadence enters into foreign
    currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions
    to protect against currency exchange risks associated with
    existing assets and liabilities. A foreign currency forward
    exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when
    underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities
    increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
    Conversely, a foreign currency forward exchange contract
    decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or
    underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in
    foreign exchange rates. The forward contracts are not designated
    as accounting hedges under SFAS No. 133 and,
    therefore, the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in
    Other income, net, in advance of the actual foreign currency
    cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being
    recorded as accrued liabilities or other current assets.

Cadence does not use forward contracts for trading purposes.
    Cadence’s forward contracts generally have maturities of
    90 days or less. Recognized gains or losses with respect to
    our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how
    accurately Cadence is able to match the amount of currency
    forward exchange contracts with underlying asset and liability
    exposures.

Allowances
    for Doubtful Accounts and Sales Returns

Cadence makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding
    receivables and provides allowances for the portion of
    receivables when collection becomes doubtful. Provisions are
    made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding
    invoices and are recorded in operating expenses or as a
    reduction of revenue. For those invoices specifically reviewed,
    Cadence analyzes the creditworthiness of its customers,
    historical experience, changes in customer demand, and the
    overall economic climate in industries that it serves.
    Provisions for sales returns primarily relate to service
    arrangements. These provisions are made based upon a specific
    review of all significant outstanding balances and are recorded
    as a reduction of revenue.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value.
    Cadence’s inventories include high technology parts and
    components for complex computer systems that emulate the
    performance and operation of computer IC and electronic systems.
    These parts and components may be specialized in nature or
    subject to rapid technological obsolescence. While Cadence has
    programs to minimize the required inventories on hand and
    considers technological obsolescence when estimating required
    reserves to reduce recorded amounts to market values, it is
    reasonably possible that such estimates could change in the near
    term. Cadence’s practice is to reserve for inventory in
    excess of

12-month

demand.

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost.
    Depreciation and amortization are generally provided over the
    estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, as
    follows:

Computer equipment and related software

2-7 years

Buildings

10-32 years

Leasehold and building improvements

Shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life

Furniture and fixtures

3-5 years

Equipment

3-5 years

Cadence capitalizes the costs of software developed for internal
    use in compliance with Statement of Position, or SOP,

98-1,

“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
    Obtained for Internal Use” and with Emerging Issues Task
    Force, or EITF

No. 00-2,

“Accounting for Web Site Development Costs.”
    Capitalization of software developed for internal use and web
    site development costs begins at the application development
    phase of the project. Capitalization of software developed for
    internal use and web site development costs ends, and
    amortization begins, when the computer software is substantially
    complete and ready for its intended use.



Amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the
    estimated useful life of the software. Cadence capitalized
    $15.6 million in 2008, $24.1 million in 2007 and
    $24.3 million in 2006 for costs of software developed for
    internal use.

Cadence recorded depreciation and amortization expense in the
    amount of $77.9 million in fiscal 2008, $73.7 million
    in fiscal 2007 and $72.0 million in fiscal 2006 for
    property, plant and equipment. Cadence abandoned and impaired
    certain long-lived assets of $4.6 million during fiscal 2008,
    which is included in Impairment of intangible and tangible
    assets in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
    Operations.  There were no significant impairments of long-lived
    assets during fiscal 2007 or fiscal 2006.

In January 2007, Cadence completed the sale of certain land and
    buildings in San Jose, California for a sales price of
    $46.5 million in cash. Concurrently with the sale, Cadence
    leased back from the purchaser approximately 262,500 square
    feet of office space, which represents all available space in
    the buildings for two years and Cadence has since vacated the
    leased buildings.

As of January 3, 2009, Cadence had capitalized
    $63.6 million in connection with the construction of its
    new building at its headquarters in San Jose, California.
    Cadence occupied a portion of this building as of
    January 3, 2009 and completed and occupied the remaining
    portion of the building during the first quarter of fiscal 2009.

Software
    Development Costs

Cadence accounts for software development costs in accordance
    with SFAS No. 86, “Accounting for the Costs of
    Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise
    Marketed.” Software development costs are capitalized
    beginning when a product’s technological feasibility has
    been established by completion of a working model of the product
    and amortization begins when a product is available for general
    release to customers. The period between the achievement of
    technological feasibility and the general release of
    Cadence’s products has typically been of short duration and
    costs incurred during this period have not been material.

Cadence capitalized $2.2 million of third party
    SFAS No. 86 costs, or purchased software, during
    fiscal 2008. Cadence did not capitalize any purchased software
    during fiscal 2007. Cadence capitalized $7.3 million of
    purchased software during fiscal 2006. Cadence has deemed the
    purchased software to have an alternative future use in
    accordance with SFAS No. 86. Therefore, Cadence begins
    amortization of purchased software when the technology is
    available for general release to customers. Amortization expense
    for purchased software was $2.8 million during fiscal 2008,
    $5.1 million during fiscal 2007 and $4.2 million
    during fiscal 2006.

Goodwill

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
    Other Intangible Assets,” Cadence conducts a goodwill
    impairment analysis annually and as necessary if changes in
    facts and circumstances indicate that the fair value of
    Cadence’s reporting unit may be less than its carrying
    amount. Cadence’s goodwill impairment test consists of the
    two steps required by SFAS No. 142. In connection with
    the preparation of Cadence’s year-end financial statements,
    Cadence performed an interim goodwill impairment test and
    recorded an Impairment of goodwill of $1,317.2 million,
    representing all of Cadence’s goodwill. See Note 5
    below for additional information regarding Cadence’s
    goodwill impairment analysis.

Long-lived
    Assets, including Acquired Intangibles

Cadence’s long-lived assets consist of property, plant and
    equipment and other acquired intangibles, excluding goodwill.
    Acquired intangibles with definite lives are amortized on a
    straight-line basis over the remaining estimated economic life
    of the underlying products and technologies (original lives
    assigned are one to ten years). Cadence reviews its long-lived
    assets for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144,
    “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets.” For assets to be held and used, Cadence initiates
    its review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be
    recoverable. Recoverability of an asset is measured by
    comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future
    undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate.
    If it is determined that an asset is not recoverable, an



impairment loss is recorded in the amount by which the carrying
    amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. In addition, Cadence
    assesses its long-lived assets for impairment if they are
    abandoned.

Non-Marketable
    Securities

Cadence’s non-marketable securities include investments in
    privately-held companies and companies that are publicly-traded
    but as to which there are trading restrictions on the shares
    Cadence owns. To determine the fair value of publicly-traded
    securities with trading restrictions, Cadence considers the
    current market price of the security and the specific
    characteristics of the restrictions. To determine the fair value
    of privately-held investments, Cadence uses the most recent
    round of financing or estimates of current fair value using
    traditional valuation techniques. It is Cadence’s policy to
    review the fair value of these investments on a regular basis to
    determine whether the investments in these companies are
    other-than-temporarily impaired. This evaluation includes, but
    is not limited to, reviewing each company’s cash position,
    financing needs, earnings or revenue outlook, operational
    performance, management or ownership changes and competition. In
    the case of privately-held companies, this evaluation is based
    on information that Cadence requests from these companies. This
    information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as
    United States publicly-traded companies, and as such, the basis
    for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy
    of the data received from these companies. If Cadence believes
    the carrying value of an investment is in excess of fair value,
    and this difference is other-than-temporary, it is
    Cadence’s policy to write down the investment to fair
    value. The majority of Cadence’s non-marketable securities
    are accounted for under the cost method of accounting and are
    carried at historical cost. Cadence periodically evaluates the
    fair value of each investment to determine if an
    other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred.

Nonqualified
    Deferred Compensation Trust

Executive Officers, senior management and Directors may elect to
    defer compensation payable to them under Cadence’s 1994
    Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan, or the NQDC. Deferred
    compensation payments are held in accounts with values indexed
    to the performance of selected mutual funds or money market
    accounts. In accordance with EITF

No. 97-14,

“Accounting for Deferred Compensation Arrangements Where
    Amounts Earned Are Held in a Rabbi Trust and Invested,”
    Cadence consolidates the NQDC trust accounts in its Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

The selected mutual funds or money market accounts held in the
    NQDC trust are classified as trading securities in accordance
    with SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain
    Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.” Trading
    securities are stated at fair value, with the unrealized gains
    and losses recognized in the Consolidated Statements of
    Operations as Other income, net. These trading securities are
    classified as Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
    because the securities are not available for Cadence’s use
    in its operations.

Cadence’s obligation with respect to the NQDC trust is
    recorded in Other long-term liabilities on its Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. Increases and decreases in the NQDC liability
    are recorded as compensation expense in the Consolidated
    Statements of Operations.

Deferred
    Revenue

Deferred revenue arises when customers pay for products

and/or

services in advance of revenue recognition. Cadence’s
    deferred revenue consists primarily of unearned revenue on
    maintenance and product licenses for which revenue is recognized
    over the duration of the license. Maintenance on perpetual
    licenses is generally renewed annually, billed in full in
    advance, and the corresponding revenue is recognized over the
    ensuing

12-month

maintenance term. The fees under product licenses for which
    revenue is not recognized immediately and for maintenance in
    connection with term and subscription licenses are generally
    billed quarterly in advance and the related revenue is
    recognized over multiple periods over the ensuing license period.

Comprehensive
    Income (Loss)

Other comprehensive income (loss) includes foreign currency
    translation gains and losses and unrealized gains and losses on
    marketable securities that are available-for-sale that have been
    excluded from Net income (loss) and reflected instead in
    Stockholders’ equity. Cadence has reported comprehensive
    income (loss) in its Consolidated



Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. Cadence reclassified
    ($7.9) million during fiscal 2008 (no tax),
    $4.4 million during fiscal 2007, net of $1.8 million
    of tax, and $6.7 million during fiscal 2006, net of
    $2.7 million of tax, from unrealized holding gains and
    losses on marketable securities to realized gains included in
    Other income, net, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements
    of Operations. Cadence did not have a tax benefit for gross
    unrealized holding losses in marketable equity securities during
    fiscal 2008. The tax benefit for gross unrealized holding losses
    in marketable equity securities was $2.5 million during
    fiscal 2007 and $4.4 million during fiscal 2006.

Revenue
    Recognition

Cadence applies the provisions of

SOP 97-2,

“Software Revenue Recognition,” as amended by

SOP 98-9,

“Modification of

SOP 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain
    Transactions,” to all software licensing transactions and
    to all product revenue transactions where the software is not
    incidental. Cadence also applies the provisions of
    SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for Leases,” to all
    hardware lease transactions. Cadence recognizes revenue when
    persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has
    been delivered, the fee is fixed or determinable, collection of
    the resulting receivable is probable, and vendor-specific
    objective evidence of fair value, or VSOE, exists.

Cadence licenses software using three different license types:

•

Subscription licenses;

•

Term licenses; and

•

Perpetual licenses.

For many of Cadence’s term and subscription license
    arrangements, Cadence uses its proprietary internet-based
    delivery mechanism,

“eDA-on-tap,”

to facilitate the delivery of its software products. To maximize
    the efficiency of this delivery mechanism, Cadence created what
    it refers to as “eDA Cards,” of which there are two
    types. Subscription license customers may purchase what Cadence
    refers to as an “eDA Platinum Card,” which provides
    the customer access to and use of all software products
    delivered at the outset of the arrangement and the ability to
    use additional unspecified software products that may become
    commercially available during the term of the arrangement. Term
    license customers may purchase what Cadence refers to as an
    “eDA Gold Card,” which provides the customer access to
    and use of all software products delivered at the outset of the
    arrangement. Overall, the eDA Cards provide greater flexibility
    for Cadence’s customers in how and when they deploy and use
    Cadence’s software products.

Subscription licenses

– Cadence’s
    subscription license arrangements offer customers the right to:

•

Access and use all software products delivered at the outset of
    an arrangement throughout the entire term of the arrangement,
    generally two to four years, with no rights to return;

•

Use unspecified additional software products that become
    commercially available during the term of the
    arrangement; and

•

Remix among the software products delivered at the outset of the
    arrangement, as well as the right to remix into other
    unspecified additional software products that may become
    available during the term of the arrangement, so long as the
    cumulative value of all products in use does not exceed the
    total license fee determined at the outset of the arrangement.
    These remix rights may be exercisable multiple times during the
    term of the arrangement. The right to remix all software
    products delivered pursuant to the license agreement is not
    considered an exchange or return of software because all
    software products have been delivered and the customer has the
    continuing right to use them.

Customers that purchase an eDA Platinum Card have the ability
    during the term of the arrangement to use software products
    delivered at the outset of the arrangement, and to use other
    unspecified additional software products that may become
    commercially available during the term of the arrangement, until
    the fees have been depleted.

In general, revenue associated with subscription licenses is
    recognized ratably over the term of the license commencing upon
    the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery
    of the software product. Subscription license revenue is
    allocated to product and maintenance revenue. The allocation to
    maintenance revenue is based on



vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value of
    the undelivered maintenance that was established in connection
    with the sale of our term licenses.

In the event that a subscription license arrangement is
    terminated by mutual agreement and a new term license
    arrangement is entered into either concurrently with or after
    the termination of the subscription license arrangement, the
    revenue associated with the new term license arrangement is
    recognized upon the later of the effective date of the
    arrangement or delivery of the software product, assuming all
    other criteria in

SOP 97-2

have been met.

Term licenses

– Cadence’s term license
    arrangements offer customers the right to:

•

Access and use all software products delivered at the outset of
    an arrangement throughout the entire term of the arrangement,
    generally two to four years, with no rights to return; and

•

Remix among the software products delivered at the outset of the
    arrangement, so long as the cumulative value of all products in
    use does not exceed the total license fee determined at the
    outset of the arrangement. These remix rights may be exercisable
    multiple times during the term of the arrangement. The right to
    remix all software products delivered pursuant to the license
    agreement is not considered an exchange or return of software
    because all software products have been delivered and the
    customer has the continuing right to use them.

Customers that purchase an eDA Gold Card have the ability during
    the term of the arrangement to use software products delivered
    at the outset of the arrangement until the fees relating to the
    arrangement have been depleted.

In general, revenue associated with term licenses is recognized
    upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or
    delivery of the software product.

Perpetual licenses

– Cadence’s perpetual
    licenses consist of software licensed on a perpetual basis with
    no right to return or exchange the licensed software. In
    general, revenue associated with perpetual licenses is
    recognized upon the later of the effective date of the license
    or delivery of the licensed product.

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement

–
    Generally, Cadence uses a contract signed by the customer as
    evidence of an arrangement for subscription and term licenses
    and hardware leases. If a contract signed by the customer does
    not exist, Cadence has historically used a purchase order as
    evidence of an arrangement for perpetual licenses, hardware
    sales, maintenance renewals and small fixed-price service
    projects, such as training classes and small methodology service
    engagements of approximately $10,000 or less. For all other
    service engagements, Cadence uses a signed professional services
    agreement and a statement of work to evidence an arrangement. In
    cases where both a signed contract and a purchase order exist,
    Cadence considers the signed contract to be the most persuasive
    evidence of the arrangement. Sales through Cadence’s
    distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the
    relationship, together with binding purchase orders from the
    distributor on a

transaction-by-transaction

basis.

Product delivery

– Software and the
    corresponding access keys are generally delivered to customers
    electronically. Electronic delivery occurs when Cadence provides
    the customer access to the software. Occasionally, Cadence will
    deliver the software on a compact disc with standard transfer
    terms of

free-on-board,

or F.O.B., shipping point. Cadence’s software license
    agreements generally do not contain conditions for acceptance.
    With respect to hardware, delivery of an entire system is deemed
    to occur upon its successful installation. For certain hardware
    products, installation is the responsibility of the customer, as
    the system is fully functional at the time of shipment. For
    these products, delivery is deemed to be complete when the
    products are shipped with freight terms of F.O.B. shipping point.

For customers who purchase eDA Gold or eDA Platinum Cards,
    delivery occurs when the customer has been provided with access
    codes that allow the customer to download the software pursuant
    to the terms of the software license agreement.

Fee is fixed or determinable

– Cadence assesses
    whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the
    arrangement, primarily based on the payment terms associated
    with the transaction. Cadence has established a history of
    collecting under the original contract without providing
    concessions on payments, products or services. For installment
    contracts that do not include a substantial up front payment,
    Cadence only considers that a fee is



fixed or determinable if the arrangement has payment periods
    that are equal to or less than the term of the licenses and the
    payments are collected in equal or nearly equal installments,
    when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement. Cadence
    has a history of collecting receivables under installment
    contracts of up to five years.

Significant judgment is involved in assessing whether a fee is
    fixed or determinable. Cadence must also make these judgments
    when assessing whether a contract amendment to a term
    arrangement (primarily in the context of a license extension or
    renewal) constitutes a concession. Cadence’s experience has
    been that it is able to determine whether a fee is fixed or
    determinable for term licenses. While Cadence does not expect
    that experience to change, if Cadence no longer were to have a
    history of collecting under the original contract without
    providing concessions on term licenses, revenue from term
    licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under
    the installment contract become due and payable. Such a change
    could have a material impact on Cadence’s results of
    operations.

Collection is probable

– Cadence assesses the
    probability of collecting from each customer at the outset of
    the arrangement based on a number of factors, including the
    customer’s payment history and its current
    creditworthiness. Cadence has concluded that collection is not
    probable for license arrangements executed with customers in
    certain countries. If in Cadence’s judgment collection of a
    fee is not probable, Cadence defers the revenue until the
    uncertainty is removed, which generally means revenue is
    recognized upon receipt of cash payment. Cadence’s
    experience has been that it is able to estimate whether
    collection is probable. While Cadence does not expect that
    experience to change, if Cadence were to determine that
    collection is not probable for any license arrangement,
    particularly those with installment payment terms, revenue from
    such license would be recognized generally upon receipt of cash
    payment. Such a change could have a material impact on
    Cadence’s results of operations.

Multiple element arrangement

– A multiple
    element arrangement, or MEA, is any arrangement that includes or
    contemplates rights to a combination of software or hardware
    products, software license types, services, training or
    maintenance in a single arrangement. From time to time, Cadence
    may include individual deliverables in separately priced and
    separately signed contracts with the same customer. Cadence
    obtains and evaluates all known relevant facts and circumstances
    in determining whether the separate contracts should be
    accounted for individually as distinct arrangements or whether
    the separate contracts are, in substance, a MEA. Significant
    judgment can be involved in determining whether a group of
    contracts might be so closely related that they are, in effect,
    part of a single arrangement.

Vendor-specific objective evidence of fair
    value

– Cadence’s VSOE for certain product
    elements of an arrangement is based upon the pricing in
    comparable transactions when the element is sold separately.
    VSOE for maintenance is generally based upon the customer’s
    stated annual renewal rates. VSOE for services is generally
    based on the price charged when the services are sold
    separately. For multiple element arrangements, VSOE must exist
    to allocate the total fee among all delivered and undelivered
    elements of a term or perpetual license arrangement. If VSOE
    does not exist for all elements to support the allocation of the
    total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of the
    arrangement, revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist
    for the undelivered elements, or until all elements are
    delivered, whichever is earlier. If VSOE of all undelivered
    elements exists but VSOE does not exist for one or more
    delivered elements, revenue is recognized using the residual
    method. Under the residual method, the VSOE of the undelivered
    elements is deferred, and the remaining portion of the
    arrangement fee is recognized as revenue as the elements are
    delivered. Cadence’s experience has been that it is able to
    determine VSOE for maintenance and time-based services, but not
    for product.

Finance fee revenue

– Finance fees result from
    discounting to present value the product revenue derived from
    installment contracts in which the payment terms extend beyond
    one year from the effective date of the contract. Finance fees
    are recognized using a method that approximates the effective
    interest method over the relevant license term and are
    classified as product revenue. Finance fee revenue represented
    approximately 3% of total revenue for fiscal 2008 and 2% of
    total revenue for each of fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. Upon the
    sale of an installment contract, Cadence recognizes the
    remaining finance fee revenue associated with the installment
    contract.

Services revenue

– Services revenue consists
    primarily of revenue received for performing engineering
    services. These services are not related to the functionality of
    the products licensed. Revenue from service contracts is
    recognized either on the time and materials method, as work is
    performed, or on the percentage-of-completion method. For
    contracts with fixed or not-to-exceed fees, Cadence estimates on
    a monthly basis the



percentage-of-completion, which is based on the completion of
    milestones relating to the arrangement. Cadence has a history of
    accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to
    complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can
    affect these estimates, including labor rates, utilization and
    efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement
    changes. If different conditions were to prevail such that
    accurate estimates could not be made, then the use of the
    completed contract method would be required and the recognition
    of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was
    completed. Such a change could have a material impact on
    Cadence’s results of operations.

In accordance with EITF

No. 06-03,

“How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to
    Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income
    Statement (That Is, Gross versus Net Presentation),”
    Cadence applies the net basis presentation for taxes collected
    from customers and remitted to governmental authorities.

Accounting
    for Income Taxes

Cadence provides for the effect of income taxes in its
    Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with
    SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”
    and FIN No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes – An Interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109.” Cadence must make significant judgments to
    apply the principles of SFAS No. 109 and
    FIN No. 48.

In accordance with SFAS No. 109, Cadence is required
    to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in
    which it operates. This process involves estimating actual
    current tax liabilities together with assessing temporary
    differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as
    deferred revenue, for tax and accounting purposes. These
    differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which
    are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
    taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences
    are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred
    tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
    recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment
    date.

Cadence then records a valuation allowance to reduce the
    deferred tax assets to the amount that Cadence believes it is
    more likely than not to realize based on its judgment of all
    available positive and negative factors. Deferred tax assets are
    realized by an enterprise by having sufficient taxable income to
    allow the related tax benefits to reduce taxes otherwise
    payable. Accordingly, the taxable income must be both of an
    appropriate character (e.g., capital versus ordinary, foreign
    versus United States source income) and within the carryback and
    carryforward periods permitted by law. In making such
    assessments, Cadence must make significant judgments about the
    possible sources of taxable income and the evidence available
    about each possible sources of taxable income on a jurisdiction
    by jurisdiction basis. As required under SFAS No. 109,
    the weight given to the potential effect of negative and
    positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the
    strength of the evidence can be objectively verified. For
    example, a company’s current or previous losses are given
    more weight than its future outlook. For the year ended
    January 3, 2009, Cadence concluded that a significant
    increase in valuation allowance was required based on its
    evaluation and weighting of the positive and negative evidence.
    See Note 4 below for additional details. If, in the future,
    Cadence determines that these deferred tax assets are more
    likely than not to be realized, a release of all or part, of the
    related valuation allowance could result in a material income
    tax benefit in the period such determination is made.

Cadence adopted FIN No. 48 on December 31, 2006,
    which was the first day of Cadence’s fiscal 2007.
    FIN No. 48 requires Cadence to take a two-step
    approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions.
    The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition
    by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates
    that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be
    sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals
    or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax
    benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of
    being realized upon effective settlement. Cadence re-evaluates
    its income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider
    factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in or
    interpretations of tax law, effectively settled issues under
    audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or
    measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an
    additional charge to the tax provision. Upon adoption of
    FIN No. 48, Cadence adopted an accounting policy to
    classify interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits as
    income tax expense. For years before the adoption of
    FIN No. 48, Cadence also reported interest and
    penalties on unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.



Cadence is also required to assess whether the earnings of our
    foreign subsidiaries will be indefinitely reinvested outside the
    United States. Given the escalating challenges in the global
    capital markets during fiscal 2008, Cadence decided to
    repatriate $250.0 million of earnings from a foreign
    subsidiary to the United States that had previously been
    considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United
    States and for which deferred taxes had not been previously
    provided. Cadence expects that an additional $67.2 million
    of previously untaxed earnings from foreign subsidiaries will
    not be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. As
    a result, Cadence has accrued a tax expense of
    $101.1 million during fiscal 2008 to provide for the
    federal, state and foreign income taxes on these repatriations.
    To calculate this tax expense, Cadence was required to estimate
    the geographic mix of profits and losses earned by Cadence and
    its subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of
    income and dividend withholding tax rates, the impact of foreign
    exchange rate fluctuations, and the potential outcomes of
    current and future tax audits. Changes in Cadence’s actual
    or projected operating results, tax laws or Cadence’s
    interpretation of tax laws, foreign exchange rates and
    developments in current and future tax audits could
    significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in
    Cadence’s results of operations, financial position or cash
    flows.

Restructuring
    Charges

Cadence accounts for restructuring charges in accordance with
    SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100,
    “Restructuring and Impairment Charges,” as amended.
    Cadence accounted for the leased facilities portions of its
    restructurings in accordance with SFAS No. 146,
    “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
    Activities,” Cadence accounted for the asset-related
    portions of its restructurings in accordance with
    SFAS No. 144 and Cadence accounted for the severance
    and benefits charges in accordance with SFAS No. 112,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Postemployment
    Benefits – An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 5
    and 43.”

In connection with these restructuring plans, Cadence has made a
    number of estimates and assumptions related to losses on excess
    facilities vacated or consolidated, particularly the timing of
    subleases and sublease terms. Closure and space reduction costs
    included in the restructuring charges include payments required
    under leases less any applicable estimated sublease income after
    the facilities are abandoned, lease buyout costs and certain
    contractual costs to maintain facilities during the period after
    abandonment.

In addition, Cadence has recorded estimated provisions for
    termination benefits and outplacement costs, long-term asset
    impairments and other restructuring costs. Cadence regularly
    evaluates the adequacy of its restructuring accrual, and adjusts
    the balance based on changes in estimates and assumptions.
    Cadence may incur future charges for new restructuring plans as
    well as for changes in estimates to amounts previously recorded.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Cadence adopted SFAS No. 123R “Share-Based
    Payment,” on January 1, 2006 using the modified
    prospective transition method. SFAS No. 123R requires
    companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in
    exchange for awards of equity instruments based upon the fair
    value of those awards on the grant date. Using the modified
    prospective transition method of adopting
    SFAS No. 123R, Cadence began recognizing compensation
    expense for equity-based awards granted on or after
    January 1, 2006 and unvested awards granted before
    January 1, 2006. Prior period stock-based compensation
    expense was recognized under Accounting Principles Board
    Opinion, or APB, No. 25 “Accounting for Stock Issued
    to Employees.”

Under SFAS No. 123R, stock-based compensation expense
    is measured at the grant date based on the value of the option
    or restricted stock and is recognized as expense, less expected
    forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is
    generally the vesting period. The fair value of each option
    grant and each purchase right granted under Cadence’s
    Employee Stock Purchase Program, or ESPP, is estimated on the
    date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The
    fair value of each restricted stock issuance is determined using
    the fair value of Cadence’s common stock on the grant date.
    Cadence recognizes stock-based compensation expense on the
    straight-line method for options and restricted stock that only
    contain a service condition and on the graded-vesting method



for options and restricted stock that contain both a service and
    performance condition. Determining the fair value of stock-based
    awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating
    the following:

•

Expected volatility of our stock;

•

Expected term of stock options;

•

Risk-free interest rate for the period;

•

Expected dividends, if any; and

•

Expected forfeitures.

The computation of the expected volatility assumption used in
    the Black-Scholes pricing model for option grants is based on
    implied volatility calculated using the volatility of publicly
    traded options for Cadence common stock. Cadence uses this
    approach to determine volatility because:

•

Options for Cadence’s common stock are actively traded;

•

The market prices of both the traded options and underlying
    shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and
    on a date reasonably close to the grant date of the employee
    stock options;

•

The traded options have exercise prices that are both
    near-the-money and close to the exercise price of the employee
    stock options; and

•

The remaining maturities of the traded options on which the
    estimate is based are at least one year.

When establishing the expected life assumption, Cadence reviews
    annual historical employee exercise behavior with respect to
    option grants having similar vesting periods. The risk-free
    interest rate for the period within the expected term of the
    option is based on the yield of United States Treasury notes in
    effect at the time of grant. Cadence has not historically paid
    dividends, thus the expected dividends used in the calculation
    are zero.

Judgment is required in estimating the amount of stock-based
    awards that Cadence expects to be forfeited. Cadence calculates
    a separate expected forfeiture rate for both stock options and
    restricted stock issuances based on historical trends. Judgment
    is also required to estimate the attainment of certain
    predetermined performance goals for a performance-based bonus
    plan, under which payments may be made in Cadence common stock,
    and performance-based restricted stock grants. Each period,
    Cadence estimates the most likely outcome of such performance
    goals and recognizes any related stock-based compensation
    expense. The amount of stock-based compensation expense
    recognized in any one period can vary based on the attainment or
    estimated attainment of the various performance goals. If such
    performance goals are not met, no compensation expense is
    recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is
    reversed.

The valuation of all options, including the expected life of
    stock options, and the expected forfeiture rates for options and
    restricted stock, are calculated based on one employee pool
    because there is no significant difference in exercise behavior
    between classes of employees.

Upon adoption of SFAS No. 123R, Cadence made the
    election to calculate the tax effects of stock-based
    compensation expense using the alternative transition method
    pursuant to Financial Statement Position, or FSP,

FAS No. 123R-3,

“Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax
    Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards,” and computed the
    beginning balance of the Additional Paid In Capital, or APIC,
    tax benefit pool by applying the simplified method, which
    resulted in an APIC tax benefit pool windfall position.
    Accordingly, upon adoption of SFAS No. 123R, Cadence
    had cumulative excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation
    available in APIC that could be used to offset an equal amount
    of future tax shortfalls (i.e., when the amount of the tax
    deductible stock-based compensation is less than the related
    stock-based compensation cost).

Treasury
    Stock

Cadence records a gain or loss on re-issuance of treasury stock
    based on the total proceeds received in the transaction. Gains
    on the re-issuance of treasury stock are recorded as a component
    of Capital in excess of par in the Consolidated Statements of
    Stockholders’ Equity. Losses on the re-issuance of treasury
    stock are recorded as a component of Capital in excess of par to
    the extent that there are gains to offset the losses. If there
    are no treasury stock gains in Capital in excess of par, the
    losses upon re-issuance of treasury stock are recorded as a
    component of Retained earnings in the Consolidated Statements of
    Stockholders’ Equity. Cadence recorded losses on the
    re-issuance of treasury stock as a component of Retained
    earnings of $110.6 million during fiscal 2008 and



$24.4 million during fiscal 2007. Cadence did not record
    any losses on the re-issuance of treasury stock during fiscal
    2006.

Concentrations
    of Credit Risk

Financial instruments, including derivative financial
    instruments, that may potentially subject Cadence to
    concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of cash and
    cash equivalents, short-term investments, long-term investments,
    accounts receivable and forward contracts. Cadence’s
    customers are concentrated within the semiconductor sector,
    which is currently experiencing a significant downturn with very
    limited visibility to the extent and timing of recovery.
    Additionally, ten of Cadence’s customers represent
    approximately half of its total Receivables, net and Installment
    contracts receivables as of January 3, 2009. The allowance
    for doubtful accounts, which was based on management’s best
    estimates, could be adjusted in the near term from current
    estimates depending on actual experience. Such adjustments could
    be material to the consolidated financial statements.

Credit exposure related to the forward contracts is limited to
    the realized and unrealized gains on these contracts. Cadence
    issued options and warrants to hedge potential dilution of its
    convertible notes, as described more fully in Note 14.
    Changes in the fair value of these hedge and warrant
    transactions are not marked to market and are not recognized in
    Cadence’s Consolidated Statements of Operations as long as
    the instruments remain classified as equity. All financial
    instruments are executed with financial institutions having
    strong credit ratings, which minimizes risk of loss due to
    nonpayment.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or
    FASB, issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value
    Measurements,” which defines fair value, establishes
    guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures
    regarding fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does
    not require any new fair value measurements but rather
    eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior
    accounting pronouncements. SFAS No. 157 is effective
    for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. In
    February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position, or FSP,

FAS No. 157-2,

“Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157,” which
    delayed the effective date of SFAS No. 157 to fiscal
    years beginning after November 15, 2008 and interim periods
    within those fiscal years for all non-financial assets and
    non-financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or
    disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a
    recurring basis (at least annually). Cadence adopted
    SFAS No. 157 for fiscal 2008, except as it applies to
    those non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities as
    described in FSP

FAS No. 157-2,

and it did not have a material impact on its consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See
    Note 3 for information and related disclosures regarding
    Cadence’s fair value measurements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities.” Under SFAS No. 159, companies may
    elect to measure certain financial instruments and certain other
    items at fair value. The standard requires that unrealized gains
    and losses on items for which the fair value option has been
    elected be reported in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
    2007. Cadence adopted SFAS No. 159 for fiscal 2008.
    However, Cadence did not elect to apply the fair value option to
    any financial instruments or other items upon adoption of
    SFAS No. 159 or during the nine months ended
    September 27, 2008. Therefore, the adoption of
    SFAS No. 159 did not impact Cadence’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

On a quarterly basis, Cadence measures at fair value certain
    financial assets, including cash equivalents, available-for-sale
    securities, time deposits, trading securities held in
    Cadence’s Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plans, or
    NQDCs, and foreign exchange contracts. SFAS No. 157
    specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether
    the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or
    unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained
    from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect
    Cadence’s market assumptions. These two types of inputs
    have created the following fair-value hierarchy:

•

Level 1

– Quoted prices for identical
    instruments in active markets;

•

Level 2

– Quoted prices for similar
    instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or
    similar instruments in markets that are not active, and
    model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and
    significant value drivers are observable in active
    markets; and



•

Level 3

– Valuations derived from
    valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or
    significant value drivers are unobservable.

This hierarchy requires Cadence to minimize the use of
    unobservable inputs and to use observable market data, if
    available, when determining fair value.

The fair value of Cadence’s cash and cash equivalents,
    short-term investments, receivables, accounts payable and
    foreign currency forward exchange contracts approximate their
    carrying value due to the short-term nature of these
    instruments. The fair market values of Cadence’s long-term
    investments, term loan and installment contract receivables
    approximate their carrying values based upon current market
    rates of interest. The fair value of Cadence’s convertible
    notes is influenced by interest rates and Cadence’s stock
    price and stock price volatility and is determined by market
    trading. As of January 3, 2009, the total fair market value
    of Cadence’s 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2011,
    or the 2011 Notes, and $250.0 million principal amount of
    1.500% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2013, or the 2013
    Notes, and collectively, the Convertible Senior Notes, was
    $263.8 million and the total fair market value of
    Cadence’s Zero Coupon Zero Yield Senior Convertible Notes
    Due 2023, or 2023 Notes, was $0.1 million. See Note 14
    for the fair value of Cadence’s convertible note hedges and
    warrants.

Leases

Cadence uses operating leases in its operations. For leases that
    contain rent escalations or rent concessions, Cadence records
    the total rent payable during the lease term on a straight-line
    basis over the term of the lease. Cadence records the difference
    between the rents paid and the straight-line rent as a deferred
    rent liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Advertising

Cadence expenses the costs of advertising as incurred.
    Advertising expense was approximately $9.0 million in 2008,
    $8.8 million in 2007 and $10.5 million in 2006, and is
    included in Marketing and sales in the accompanying Consolidated
    Statements of Operations.

New
    Accounting Standard with Retroactive Adjustments

In May 2008, FASB issued FSP APB

14-1,

“Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be
    Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash
    Settlement),” which will require Cadence to recognize
    additional non-cash interest expense related to its Convertible
    Senior Notes in its Consolidated Statements of Operations. FSP
    APB

14-1

is
    effective for fiscal 2009 and is required to be applied
    retrospectively for all periods for which Cadence’s
    Convertible Senior Notes were outstanding before the date of
    adoption. FSP APB

14-1

will
    have an adverse effect on Cadence’s operating results and
    financial condition, particularly with respect to interest
    expense ratios commonly referred to by lenders, and could
    potentially hinder Cadence’s ability to raise capital
    through the issuance of debt or equity securities. In addition,
    FSP APB

14-1

requires retrospective adoption, which will require Cadence to
    adjust its Consolidated Financial Statements for prior years to
    reflect increased interest expense in each of those years.

Marketable
    Securities

Cadence considers all of its investments in marketable
    securities as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities
    are stated at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses
    presented net of tax and reported as a separate component of
    Stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses are
    determined using the specific identification method. Gains are
    recognized when realized and are recorded in the Consolidated
    Statements of Operations as Other income (expense), net. Losses
    are recognized as realized or when Cadence has determined that
    an other-than-temporary decline in fair value has occurred.



Net recognized gains (losses) from the sale of
    available-for-sale securities during fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007

During fiscal 2008, Cadence purchased approximately
    4.3 million shares of Mentor Graphics Corporation, or
    Mentor Graphics, common stock in connection with its proposed
    acquisition of Mentor Graphics. After the announcement of
    Cadence’s withdrawal of the proposed acquisition of Mentor
    Graphics and during fiscal 2008, Cadence sold its entire equity
    interest in Mentor Graphics at a loss of $9.4 million,
    which is included in Losses on sale of available-for-sale
    securities in the table above.

It is Cadence’s policy to review the fair value of these
    marketable securities on a regular basis to determine whether
    its investments in these companies are other-than-temporarily
    impaired. This evaluation includes, but is not limited to,
    reviewing each company’s cash position, financing needs,
    earnings or revenue outlook, operational performance, management
    or ownership changes and competition. If Cadence believes the
    carrying value of an investment is in excess of its fair value,
    and this difference is other-than-temporary, it is
    Cadence’s policy to write down the investment to reduce its
    carrying value to fair value. Cadence determined that two of its
    available-for-sale securities were other-than-temporarily
    impaired based on the severity and the duration of the
    impairment and Cadence wrote down the investments by
    $8.1 million during fiscal 2008. These impairments are
    included in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated
    Statement of Operations. Cadence did not recognize an
    other-than-temporary impairment of available-for-sale securities
    during fiscal 2007 or fiscal 2006.

Non-Marketable
    Securities

Cadence uses either the cost or equity method of accounting to
    account for its long-term, non-marketable investment securities,
    which are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. Net realized gains on the sale of non-marketable
    investments were $1.6 million during fiscal 2008,
    $6.0 million during fiscal 2007 and $19.9 million
    during fiscal 2006. In addition, Cadence’s 1996 Deferred
    Compensation Venture Investment Plan Trust recorded a gain of
    $0.6 million during fiscal 2007. If Cadence determines that
    an other-than-temporary decline exists in a non-marketable
    equity security, Cadence writes down the investment to its fair
    value and records the related write-down as an investment loss
    in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The following table illustrates the carrying value of
    Cadence’s non-marketable securities as of January 3,
    2009 and December 29, 2007:

Cost

Cadence recorded write-downs due to other-than-temporary
    declines in value of non-marketable securities carried on the
    cost basis of $8.6 million during fiscal 2008,
    $2.6 million during fiscal 2007 and $2.5 million during
    fiscal 2006. These write-downs are included in Other income
    (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

In January 2006, KhiMetrics, Inc., a cost method investment held
    by Telos Venture Partners, a limited partnership in which
    Cadence and its 1996 Deferred Compensation Venture Investment
    Plan Trust were the sole



limited partners, was sold for consideration of $6.53 per share
    of common stock. In connection with this sale, Cadence received
    approximately $20.2 million in cash and recorded a gain of
    approximately $17.1 million during fiscal 2006. In
    addition, the 1996 Deferred Compensation Venture Investment Plan
    Trust received $2.9 million in cash and recorded a gain of
    $2.5 million during fiscal 2006. Under the purchase
    agreement, an additional 10% of the consideration was held in
    escrow, which was released to Cadence and to the trust in
    January 2007. Upon receipt of these additional proceeds, Cadence
    recorded a gain of $2.6 million and the 1996 Deferred
    Compensation Venture Investment Plan Trust recorded a gain of
    $0.4 million during fiscal 2007.

Equity
    Method Investments

Cadence applies the guidance in APB No. 18, “The
    Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common
    Stock,” as amended, and EITF

No. 02-14,

“Whether an Investor Should Apply the Equity Method of
    Accounting to Investments Other Than Common Stock,” to
    classify investments as equity method investments. These
    investments are held in the form of voting preferred stock or
    convertible debt of privately-held companies. If Cadence
    determines that it has the ability to exercise significant
    influence over the investee and the investment is in the form of
    in-substance common stock, the investment is accounted for under
    the equity method.

In applying the equity method of accounting, Cadence applies
    approach (a) of EITF

No. 99-10,

“Percentage Used to Determine the Amount of Equity Method
    Losses.” Accordingly, the portion of equity method income
    or loss recorded by Cadence is based on its percentage ownership
    of each investee’s preferred stock or convertible debt
    available to absorb losses or with contractual rights to income.
    Its level of participation in future financings of its equity
    method investees may impact Cadence’s proportional share in
    future income or losses. Cadence records its interest in equity
    method gains and losses in the quarter following incurrence
    because it is not practicable to obtain investee financial
    statements before the issuance of Cadence’s Consolidated
    Financial Statements. Cadence records its proportional share of
    the investees’ gains or losses in Other income (expense),
    net. Cadence’s proportional share of its investees’
    net losses and impairment losses was as follows:

    privately-held companies: Accent International S.A., D2S, Inc.,
    GSR Associates II, L.P., Shanghai SVA Integrated Circuits Co.,
    Ltd. and ZCIST Co., Ltd. As of January 3, 2009, the
    difference between the carrying value of Cadence’s
    investments in these investee companies and Cadence’s share
    of the underlying net assets of the investee companies was
    immaterial.

Cadence’s effective tax rate was negative for fiscal 2008,

    and fiscal 2006, primarily due to the Loss before provision for
    income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting
    principle and the tax expenses related to the increase in the
    valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, repatriations
    of foreign earnings, impairment of non-deductible goodwill,
    income of certain foreign subsidiaries and interest expense on
    unrecognized tax benefits.

Cadence regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for
    recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance if it is
    more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
    tax assets will not be realized. Cadence considered various
    sources of taxable income and all available positive and
    negative evidence about these possible sources of taxable
    income. As required by SFAS No. 109, Cadence gave
    significant weight to evidence that could be objectively
    verified. Under this standard Cadence’s current year loss,
    which resulted in a cumulative three-year loss, the uncertain
    and negative market and economic conditions which severely
    limited the visibility to the timing and extent of an economic
    recovery, and the Cadence expectation of a net loss in the near
    term, were considered significant negative evidence with a high
    level of objectivity that outweighed Cadence’s ability to
    rely on longer term projections of future taxable income in
    determining whether a valuation allowance was needed. As a
    result, Cadence concluded that an increase in valuation
    allowance of $332.9 million was required as of
    January 3, 2009. After consideration of the valuation
    allowance, Cadence had total net deferred tax assets of
    approximately $66.4 million as of January 3, 2009. The
    net deferred tax assets are primarily composed of United States
    net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The net
    deferred tax assets are presented gross of unrecognized tax
    benefits, which are not directly associated with the net
    operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Although there is
    no guarantee that these deferred tax assets will be realized,
    Cadence believes that it is more likely than not that it will be
    able to realize the net deferred tax assets over time.

Cadence provides for United States income taxes on the earnings
    of foreign subsidiaries unless the earnings are considered
    indefinitely invested outside of the United States. Given the
    escalating challenges in the global capital markets during
    fiscal 2008, Cadence decided to repatriate $250.0 million
    of earnings from a foreign subsidiary to the United States that
    had previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested
    outside the United States and for which deferred taxes had not
    been previously provided. Cadence currently expects that an
    additional $67.2 million



of previously untaxed earnings from foreign subsidiaries will
    not be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. As
    a result, Cadence has accrued a tax expense of
    $101.1 million during fiscal 2008 to provide for the
    federal, state and foreign income taxes on these repatriations.
    Of the $101.1 million of tax expense associated with
    Cadence’s repatriation of earnings, $1.8 million was
    accounted for in its Consolidated Statements of
    Stockholders’ Equity and Comprehensive Income. Cadence
    intends to indefinitely reinvest the remainder of its
    undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries of
    approximately $37.8 million as of January 3, 2009, to
    meet both the working capital and long-term capital needs of its
    subsidiaries and of Cadence. The unrecognized deferred tax
    liability for these indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was
    approximately $15.5 million as of January 3, 2009.

As of January 3, 2009, Cadence had United States federal
    and California net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
    $27.5 million and $70.4 million, respectively,
    available to reduce future taxable income. The federal net
    operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates from
    2021 through 2027. The California net operating loss
    carryforwards will expire at various dates from 2014 through
    2029. For fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009, no California net
    operating loss deduction is allowed. Cadence also has tax
    effected net operating losses from states other than California
    of $4.2 million, which will expire at various dates from
    2009 through 2028.

As of January 3, 2009, Cadence had United States federal
    tax credit carryforwards of $0.6 million, California tax
    credit carryforwards of $24.5 million, tax credit
    carryforwards from states other than California of
    $6.5 million, and $0.2 million of tax credit
    carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions. $26.8 million of
    these available tax credits do not expire and carry forward
    indefinitely until utilized and the remaining $5.0 million
    of tax credits will expire at various dates from 2009 through
    2026. For fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009, California limited the
    utilization of tax credits to 50% of the tax liabilities.

Internal
    Revenue Service Examinations

The Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, and other tax authorities
    regularly examine Cadence’s income tax returns.
    Cadence’s federal income tax returns beginning with the
    2000 tax year remain subject to examination by the IRS.
    Cadence’s California income tax returns beginning with the
    2001 tax year remain subject to examination by the California
    Franchise Tax Board.

In November 2003, the IRS completed its field examination of
    Cadence’s federal income tax returns for the tax years 1997
    through 1999 and issued a Revenue Agent’s Report, or RAR,
    in which the IRS proposed to assess an aggregate tax deficiency
    for the three-year period of approximately $143.0 million.
    The most significant of the disputed adjustments for the tax
    years 1997 through 1999 related to transfer pricing arrangements
    that Cadence had with a foreign subsidiary. In December 2007,
    the Joint Committee on Taxation of the U.S. Congress, or
    the Joint Committee, approved and the Appeals Office of the IRS,
    or the Appeals Office, executed settlement agreements, which
    resulted in an effective settlement of the transfer pricing
    dispute for purposes of FIN No. 48. As a result of
    this effective settlement, Cadence recognized a tax benefit of
    $27.8 million in the Consolidated Income Statement. Cadence
    also recognized a tax benefit of $6.2 million in the
    Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity and
    Comprehensive Income as a result of this effective settlement.

Cadence did not reach a settlement with the Appeals Office of
    the IRS on separate tax refund claims that would increase its
    tax deductions for foreign trade income for the tax years 1997
    through 1999. Cadence continues to believe that its position is
    well supported and Cadence is considering its options for
    further pursuing this matter.

In July 2006, the IRS completed its field examination of
    Cadence’s federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000
    through 2002 and issued a RAR in which the IRS proposed to
    assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year period of
    approximately $324.0 million. In November 2006, the IRS
    revised the proposed aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year
    period to be approximately $318.0 million. The IRS is
    contesting Cadence’s qualification for deferred recognition
    of certain proceeds received from restitution and settlement in
    connection with litigation during the period. The proposed tax
    deficiency for this item is approximately $152.0 million.
    The remaining proposed tax deficiency of approximately
    $166.0 million is primarily related to proposed adjustments
    to Cadence’s transfer pricing arrangements that it had with
    foreign subsidiaries and to Cadence’s deductions for
    foreign trade income. The IRS may make similar claims against
    our transfer pricing arrangements and deductions for foreign
    trade income in future examinations. Cadence has filed a timely
    protest with the IRS and is seeking resolution of the issues
    through the Appeals Office.



Cadence believes that the proposed IRS adjustments are
    inconsistent with applicable tax laws and Cadence is vigorously
    challenging these proposed adjustments. The RAR is not a final
    Statutory Notice of Deficiency but the IRS imposes interest on
    the proposed deficiencies until the matters are resolved.
    Interest is compounded daily at rates published by the IRS,
    which rates are adjusted quarterly and have been at an annual
    rate between 4% and 10% since 2001. The IRS is currently
    examining Cadence’s federal income tax returns for the tax
    years 2003 through 2005.

Unrecognized
    Tax Benefits

Cadence adopted FIN No. 48 on December 31, 2006,
    which was the first day of Cadence’s fiscal 2007. The
    cumulative effect of adopting FIN No. 48 was reported
    as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings (or
    other appropriate components of equity or net assets) in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet for fiscal 2007. Cadence recognized a
    $59.4 million decrease in the net liabilities for
    unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as an
    increase to the December 31, 2006 balance of Retained
    earnings. Cadence also recognized a $42.6 million decrease
    in the net liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which was
    accounted for as a $35.3 million increase in the
    December 31, 2006 balance of Common stock and capital in
    excess of par value and a $7.3 million decrease in the
    December 31, 2006 balance of Goodwill.

Upon adoption of FIN No. 48, Cadence also recognized
    additional long-term income tax assets of $115.0 million
    and additional long-term income tax liabilities of
    $115.0 million to present the unrecognized tax benefits as
    gross amounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Cadence also
    decreased current income tax liabilities by $26.2 million
    and increased long-term income tax liabilities by the same
    amount based on its anticipation of the amount of cash payments
    to be made within one year.

    benefits for fiscal 2008 are as follows:

During fiscal 2008, Cadence recognized a $7.9 million
    decrease in the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits based
    on new information received during the period, which Cadence
    accounted for as a $7.9 million increase in the balance of
    Common stock and capital in excess of par value. As of
    January 3, 2009, Cadence had $232.5 million of
    unrecognized tax benefits, as compared to $228.4 million as
    of December 29, 2007, that if recognized upon resolution of
    the uncertain tax positions, would reduce Cadence’s
    effective tax rate.

The total amounts of interest and penalties recognized in the
    Consolidated Statement of Operations during fiscal 2008 resulted
    in net tax expense of $8.3 million. The total amounts of
    gross accrued interest and penalties recognized in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 3, 2009, were
    $62.5 million and $9.7 million, respectively as
    compared to $47.9 million and $9.7 million,
    respectively as of December 29, 2007.

Cadence believes that it is reasonably possible that the total
    amounts of unrecognized tax benefits related to the IRS
    examination of Cadence’s federal income tax returns for the
    tax years 2000 through 2002 could significantly increase or
    decrease during fiscal 2009 depending on whether Cadence is able
    to effectively settle the disputed issues with the Appeals
    Office. Cadence cannot currently provide an estimate of the
    range of the reasonably possible change.



Cadence believes that it is reasonably possible that the total
    amounts of unrecognized tax benefits for its transfer pricing
    arrangements with its foreign subsidiaries could significantly
    increase or decrease during fiscal 2009 if the Appeals Office
    develops new settlement guidelines that change Cadence’s
    measurement of the tax benefits to be recognized upon effective
    settlement with the IRS. Because of the uncertain impact of any
    potential settlement guidelines, Cadence cannot currently
    provide an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible
    change.

Cadence also believes that it is reasonably possible that the
    total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits related to the value
    of stock options included in its cost sharing arrangements with
    its foreign subsidiaries could significantly increase or
    decrease during fiscal 2009 based on the outcome of the IRS
    appeal of Xilinx, Inc. v. Commissioner, which is before the
    United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Cadence
    believes that the range of reasonably possible change is an
    increase in unrecognized tax benefits of $6.4 million to a
    decrease of unrecognized tax benefit of $1.6 million.

NOTE 5. GOODWILL
    AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES

Goodwill

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Cadence conducts a
    goodwill impairment analysis annually and as necessary if
    changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the fair value
    of Cadence’s reporting unit may be less than its carrying
    amount. Cadence’s goodwill impairment test consists of the
    two steps required by SFAS No. 142. The first step
    requires that Cadence compare the estimated fair value of its
    single reporting unit to the carrying value of the reporting
    unit’s net assets, including goodwill. If the fair value of
    the reporting unit is greater than the carrying value of its net
    assets, goodwill is not considered to be impaired and no further
    testing is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is
    less than the carrying value of its net assets, Cadence would be
    required to complete the second step of the test by analyzing
    the fair value of its goodwill. If the carrying value of the
    goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is
    recorded.

To determine the reporting unit’s fair value, Cadence uses
    a combination of the income and market valuation approaches. In
    determining its overall conclusion of reporting unit fair value,
    Cadence considers the estimated values derived from both the
    income and market valuation approaches and weighs the values
    from each approach equally.

The income approach provides an estimate of fair value based on
    discounted expected future cash flows. Estimates and assumptions
    with respect to the determination of the fair value of
    Cadence’s reporting unit using the income approach include:

•

Cadence’s operating forecasts;

•

Revenue growth rates; and

•

Risk-commensurate discount rates and costs of capital.

Cadence’s estimates of revenues and costs are based on
    historical data, various internal estimates and a variety of
    external sources, and are developed as part of Cadence’s
    routine long-range planning process.

The market approach provides an estimate of the fair value of
    Cadence’s one reporting unit using various price or market
    multiples applied to the reporting unit’s operating results
    and then applying an appropriate control premium. The control
    premium is determined by considering control premiums offered as
    part of acquisitions in both Cadence’s market segment and
    comparable market segments.

The market capitalization of Cadence’s reporting unit is an
    indicator of its fair value. Accordingly, the estimated fair
    value of Cadence’s reporting unit using the income and
    market approaches is compared to the market capitalization of
    its reporting unit as one measure that the estimated fair value
    is reasonable.

Cadence completed its annual impairment analysis of goodwill
    during the third quarter of fiscal 2008, and determined at that
    time that it satisfied the first step of the two-step goodwill
    impairment test, and no impairment of goodwill was recorded.
    However, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, Cadence
    observed impairment indicators including a further deterioration
    in the market in which Cadence operates and a decrease in its
    market capitalization. As such, Cadence determined indicators
    existed that indicated that the fair value of Cadence’s
    reporting unit was less than its carrying amount.



Accordingly, in connection with the preparation of
    Cadence’s year-end financial statements, Cadence completed
    an interim goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2008, including the second step prescribed by
    SFAS No. 142. As part of the second step of its
    goodwill impairment test, Cadence determined the fair value of
    its goodwill by allocating the estimated fair value of its
    reporting unit to its assets and liabilities, including the
    estimated fair value of its unrecorded intangible assets, on a
    fair value basis. After allocating its assets and liabilities on
    a fair value basis, Cadence recorded an impairment of all of its
    goodwill of $1,317.2 million.

Allocating assets and liabilities on a fair value basis and
    determining the fair value of unrecorded intangible assets
    required that Cadence make assumptions and estimates about the
    fair value of assets and liabilities where the fair values of
    those assets and liabilities were not readily available or
    observable. In addition, Cadence made estimates regarding its
    forecasted revenue, expenses and cash flows, its research and
    development activities, its customer turnover rates, applicable
    discount rates and costs of capital and the marketability of its
    current and future technology.

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years
    ended January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007 are as

In connection with the Cadence’s cost savings initiatives
    that were implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008,
    Cadence made certain changes to its Design for Manufacturing
    product strategy. As a result, Cadence recognized an impairment
    charge of $42.5 million arising from the abandonment of certain
    identifiable intangible assets and reducing to net realizable
    value certain other identifiable intangible assets.



During fiscal 2008, Cadence acquired intangible assets of
    $8.6 million, including $0.6 million allocated to
    acquired in-process technology related to Cadence’s
    acquisition of a company. The acquired in-process technology was
    immediately expensed because technological feasibility had not
    been established and no future alternative use existed.

NOTE 6. ACQUISITIONS

During fiscal 2008, Cadence acquired a company for an aggregate
    purchase price of $9.4 million, which included the payment
    of cash, the fair value of assumed options and acquisition
    costs. The $3.1 million of goodwill recorded in connection with
    this acquisition is not expected to be deductible for income tax
    purposes.

During fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, Cadence acquired three
    companies for an aggregate purchase price of $101.3 million,
    which included the payment of cash, the fair value of assumed
    options and acquisition costs.  The $63.1 million of goodwill
    recorded in connection with these acquisitions is not deductible
    for income tax purposes and was completely impaired during
    fiscal 2008 as discussed in Note 5 above.

Prior to the acquisition of one company in fiscal 2007, Cadence
    had an investment of $2.0 million in the company,
    representing a 12% ownership interest, which had been accounted
    for under the cost method of accounting. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations,”
    Cadence accounted for this acquisition as a step acquisition.
    Subsequent adjustments to the purchase price of these acquired
    companies are included in the “Other” line of the
    changes of goodwill table in Note 5 above.

For each of the acquisitions described above, the results of
    operations and the estimated fair value of the assets acquired
    and liabilities assumed have been included in Cadence’s
    Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of the
    acquisition. Comparative pro forma financial information for all
    fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 acquisitions have not
    been presented because the results of operations were not
    material to Cadence’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

For many of Cadence’s previously completed acquisitions,
    payment of a portion of the purchase price is contingent upon
    the acquired business’ achievement of certain revenue and
    product development performance goals. The portion of the
    contingent purchase price, or earnout, associated with employee
    retention is recorded as compensation expense. The specific
    performance goal levels, and amounts and timing of earnout
    payments, vary with each acquisition. The acquisition-related
    earnouts in fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 were not
    significant. In connection with its acquisitions completed
    before January 3, 2009, Cadence may be obligated to pay up
    to an aggregate of $51.0 million in cash during the next
    44 months if certain defined performance goals are achieved
    in full, which would be expensed as compensation expense in our
    Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Write-off
    of Acquired In-Process Research and Development

Acquired in-process research and development charges represent
    in-process research and development that had not reached
    technological feasibility at the time of acquisition and had no
    probable alternative future use. For acquisitions completed
    during fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, the purchase
    price allocated to acquired in-process research and development
    was determined through established valuation techniques. The
    acquired in-process research and development was immediately
    expensed because technological feasibility had not been
    established, and no future alternative use existed. The
    write-off of acquired in-process research and development is a
    component of operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements
    of Operations.

Write-offs of acquired in-process research and development
    charges during fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 were as

NOTE 7. RESTRUCTURING
    AND OTHER CHARGES

During fiscal 2008, Cadence initiated a restructuring plan, or
    the 2008 Restructuring Plan, to decrease costs by reducing its
    workforce across the company and by consolidating facilities.
    Cadence recorded total costs associated



with the 2008 Restructuring Plan of $46.7 million during
    fiscal 2008 for severance and benefits, excess facilities and
    other charges. Cadence regularly evaluates the adequacy of its
    severance and related benefits accrual, and adjusts the balance
    based on actual costs incurred or changes in estimates and
    assumptions. Cadence may incur future charges to reflect actual
    costs incurred or for changes in estimates related to amounts
    previously recorded and for additional activities under the 2008
    Restructuring Plan.

Cadence also initiated restructuring plans in each year from
    2001 through 2005, or the Other Restructuring Plans, in an
    effort to operate more efficiently. As of January 3, 2009,
    the balance of $6.3 million related to the Other
    Restructuring Plans consisted solely of estimated lease losses.

Facility closure and office space reduction costs included in
    Cadence’s restructuring plans are comprised of payments
    required under leases, less any applicable estimated sublease
    income after the properties are abandoned, lease buyout costs
    and other contractual charges. To estimate the lease loss, which
    is the loss after Cadence’s cost recovery efforts from
    subleasing all or part of a building, Cadence management made
    certain assumptions related to the time period over which the
    relevant building would remain vacant and sublease terms,
    including sublease rates and contractual common area charges.

Each reporting period, Cadence evaluates the adequacy of the
    lease loss accruals related to all of its restructuring plans.
    When necessary, Cadence adjusts the lease loss accruals for
    changes in real estate markets or other factors that may affect
    estimated costs or sublease income. Cadence also considers
    executed sublease agreements and adjusts the lease loss accruals
    if sublease income under the agreements differ from initial
    estimates. The credits recorded in connection with the Other
    Restructuring Plans during fiscal 2006, fiscal 2007 and fiscal
    2008 relate primarily to changes in lease loss estimates.

As of January 3, 2009, Cadence’s estimate of the
    accrued lease loss related to all worldwide restructuring plans
    initiated since 2001 was $8.4 million. This amount will be
    adjusted in the future based on changes in the assumptions used
    to estimate the lease loss. The lease loss could range as high
    as $11.3 million if sublease rental rates decrease in
    applicable markets or if it takes longer than currently expected
    to find a suitable tenant to sublease the facilities.

As of January 3, 2009, Cadence’s total amount accrued
    for its restructuring plans was $38.2 million, consisting
    primarily of $29.7 million of severance and
    severance-related benefits and $8.4 million of estimated
    lease losses related to the restructuring plans initiated since
    2001. This amount may be adjusted in the future based upon
    changes in the assumptions used to estimate the lease loss. Of
    the $38.2 million accrued as of January 3, 2009,
    $32.4 million was included in Accounts payable and accrued
    liabilities and $5.8 million was included in Other
    long-term liabilities on Cadence’s Consolidated Balance
    Sheets.

    Restructuring Plan

During fiscal 2008, Cadence recorded $44.3 million of
    headcount reduction costs associated with the 2008 Restructuring
    Plan, which included severance payments, severance-related
    benefits and costs for outplacement services. The costs recorded
    during fiscal 2008 are net of a reversal of $4.9 million
    recorded during the fourth quarter of 2008 due to termination
    and related benefits costs that were less than the initial
    estimate of $48.1 million recorded during the third quarter
    of fiscal 2008. The net costs recorded during fiscal 2008
    include severance and severance-related benefits which were
    communicated to the affected employees before January 3,
    2009 and estimated costs that were both probable and estimable
    for employees who were notified after January 3, 2009.

Cadence provides severance and termination benefits according to
    the varying regulations in the jurisdictions and countries in
    which Cadence operates. In accordance with these regulations,
    termination benefits of approximately $15.4 million were
    paid to employees before January 3, 2009 and termination
    benefits of approximately $29.7 million will be paid after
    January 3, 2009. Cadence expects to pay substantially all
    benefits by January 2, 2010.

    agreement for a facility included in the 2001 restructuring
    plan, whereby Cadence paid $8.2 million and was released
    from all future obligations related to the facility. Cadence
    recorded a credit to Restructuring and other charges of
    $7.1 million during the year ended December 29, 2007,
    representing the lease loss accrual related to this facility in
    excess of the amount paid.

Equity
    Incentive Plans

Cadence’s 2000 Nonstatutory Equity Incentive Plan, or the
    2000 Plan, 1997 Nonstatutory Stock Incentive Plan, or 1997 Plan,
    and 1993 Nonstatutory Stock Incentive Plan, or 1993 Plan (the
    2000 Plan, the 1997 Plan and the 1993 Plan are referred to
    collectively as the Nonstatutory Stock Incentive Plans), provide
    for the issuance of non-qualified options, restricted stock
    awards, restricted stock units, stock bonuses and rights to
    acquire restricted stock to Cadence employees and consultants
    who are not executive officers, directors or beneficial owners
    of 10% or more of Cadence common stock. The number of shares
    available for issuance under the 2000 Plan is 50,000,000, under
    the 1997 Plan is 30,000,000 and under the 1993 Plan is
    24,750,000. Options granted under the Nonstatutory Stock
    Incentive Plans have an exercise price not less than the fair
    market value of the stock on the date of grant. Options granted
    to new employees become exercisable over a period of up to four
    years, generally with one-fourth of the shares vesting one year
    from the vesting commencement date, and the remaining shares
    vesting in 36 equal monthly installments thereafter. Options
    granted to current employees become exercisable over a period of
    up to four years, generally vesting in 48 equal monthly
    installments. Options granted under the Nonstatutory Stock
    Incentive Plans before October 1, 2006 generally expire ten
    years from the date of grant. Options granted under the
    Nonstatutory Stock Incentive Plans after October 1, 2006
    generally expire seven years from the date of grant. Restricted
    stock awards and restricted stock units, collectively referred
    to as restricted stock, granted under the Nonstatutory Stock
    Incentive Plans vest at times and in installments approved by
    the Board of Directors or its Compensation Committee, on the
    basis of continued employment, passage of time

and/or

performance criteria.

Cadence’s 1987 Stock Incentive Plan, or the 1987 Plan,
    provides for the issuance of either incentive or non-qualified
    options and restricted stock awards. The number of shares
    available for issuance under the 1987 Plan is
    75,370,100 shares, of which only 5,000,000 shares may
    be issued pursuant to restricted stock awards. Options granted
    under the 1987 Plan have an exercise price not less than fair
    market value of the stock on the date of grant and become
    exercisable over periods of up to five years. Options granted
    under the 1987 Plan before October 1, 2006 generally expire
    ten years from the date of grant. Options granted under the 1987
    Plan after October 1, 2006 generally expire seven years
    from the date of grant. Restricted stock awards granted under
    the 1987 Plan vest at times and in installments set forth in the
    1987 Plan and approved by the Board of Directors or its
    Compensation Committee, on the basis of continued employment,
    passage of time

and/or

performance criteria.

Under the 1995 Directors’ Stock Option Plan, or the
    Directors’ Plan, Cadence may grant non-qualified options to
    its non-employee directors for up to 3,050,000 shares of
    common stock at an exercise price equal to the average of



the closing price for 20 trading days prior to the grant date.
    Options granted under the Directors’ Plan have terms of ten
    years and vest one year from the date of grant.

Cadence has assumed certain options granted to employees of
    acquired companies, or Acquired Options. The Acquired Options
    were assumed by Cadence outside of its stock option plans, and
    each option is administered under the terms of the respective
    original plans of the acquired companies. All of the Acquired
    Options have been adjusted to effectuate the price conversion
    under the terms of the acquisition agreement between Cadence and
    the relevant acquired company. The Acquired Options generally
    become exercisable over a four or five year period and generally

    additional options will be granted under any of the acquired
    companies’ plans.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)

In November 1998, the Board of Directors adopted, and the
    Cadence stockholders subsequently approved, Cadence’s
    Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which amended
    and restated the 1990 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the ESPP.
    Subsequent amendments approved by the Board of Directors and
    Cadence stockholders increased the number of shares of common
    stock authorized for issuance under the ESPP to
    54,000,000 shares.

Under the ESPP and through the January 31, 2009 purchase
    date, a majority of Cadence’s employees could purchase
    Cadence’s common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lower
    of the fair market value at the beginning of the applicable
    offering period or at the end of the applicable offering period,
    in an amount up to 12% of their annual base earnings plus
    bonuses and commissions, subject to a limit in any calendar year
    of $25,000 worth of common stock. The offering periods are six
    months with a corresponding six month purchase period. New
    offerings begin on each February 1st and
    August 1st, and those offerings run consecutively. The
    purchase dates under the ESPP are January 31st and
    July 31st of each year.

On January 30, 2009, since Cadence did not have a
    sufficient number of authorized common stock available under the
    ESPP to permit all ESPP participants to purchase Cadence’s
    common stock in the full amount that had been set aside for them
    through their contributions, Cadence allocated the purchase on a
    pro rata basis and refunded the excess contributions. The
    continuation of the ESPP is contingent upon stockholder approval
    of additional shares of Cadence’s common stock authorized
    under the ESPP.

Under the ESPP, the Cadence Board of Directors has the
    discretion to designate the percentage and maximum dollar amount
    that may be withheld from the ESPP participants’ annual
    base earnings plus bonuses and commissions for a particular
    offering period, and the Cadence Board of Directors may modify
    such percentage and maximum dollar amount from time to time. If
    additional issuances of common stock are approved by the
    stockholders, under the rules currently in effect, the ESPP
    participants would be entitled to purchase Cadence common stock
    under the ESPP: (i) for the offering period commencing
    February 1, 2009, in an amount not to exceed the lower of (A)
    $7,058.82 or (B) the difference between (x) $25,000 and (y) the
    aggregate amount of Cadence’s common stock purchased on
    January 31, 2009 under the ESPP; and (ii) for the offering
    period commencing August 1, 2009 and thereafter, in an amount
    not to exceed $7,058.82 in any calendar year. In addition,
    contributions made by ESPP participants under the ESPP may not
    exceed 5% of their annual base earnings plus bonuses and
    commissions.

The exercise price of each stock option granted under
    Cadence’s employee equity incentive plans is equal to or
    greater than the market price of Cadence’s common stock on
    the date of grant. The fair value of each option grant is
    estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
    pricing model. The weighted average grant date fair value of
    options granted and the weighted average assumptions used in the
    model for fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 were as

The decrease in Cadence’s expected life assumption from

    fiscal 2007 is primarily due to the decrease in the contractual
    life from 10 to 7 years for substantially all options
    granted after October 1, 2006. Options granted to
    non-employee members of our Board of Directors have a

10-year

term.

Cadence had total unrecognized compensation expense, net of
    estimated forfeitures, related to stock option grants of
    $14.4 million as of January 3, 2009, which will be
    recognized over the remaining weighted average vesting period of
    1.1 years. The total intrinsic value of options exercised
    was $3.8 million during fiscal 2008, $113.7 million
    during fiscal 2007 and $55.9 million during fiscal 2006.
    Cash received from stock option exercises was $3.6 million
    during fiscal 2008, $211.5 million during fiscal 2007 and
    $114.9 million during fiscal 2006.

In October 2008, certain executive officers resigned from their
    positions at Cadence. Pursuant to the resignations and the terms
    of the respective employment agreements of these executive
    officers, stock options have either been accelerated or
    forfeited. Cadence recorded additional stock-based compensation
    expense of $6.5 million relating to the accelerated vesting
    of these stock options.

Restricted
    Stock and Stock Bonuses

Generally, restricted stock, which includes restricted stock
    awards and restricted stock units, vests over three to four
    years and is subject to the employee’s continuing service
    to Cadence. Cadence issues some of its restricted stock with
    performance-based vesting. The terms of these restricted stock
    grants are consistent with grants of restricted stock described
    above, with the exception that the vesting of the shares depends
    not only upon the completion of the required period of service,
    but also on the satisfaction of certain predetermined
    performance goals. Each period, Cadence estimates the
    probability of the achievement of these performance goals and
    recognizes any related stock-based compensation expense. The
    amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized in any one
    period can vary based on the attainment or estimated attainment
    of the various performance goals. If such performance goals are
    not met, no compensation expense is recognized and any
    previously recognized compensation expense is reversed.

In July 2008, Cadence modified the performance goals related to
    its performance-based restricted stock. On the modification
    date, Cadence evaluated the probability of achievement of both
    the original performance goals and the modified performance
    goals. For the performance-based restricted stock in which the
    original performance goal was unlikely to be achieved, Cadence
    reversed the previously recorded stock-based compensation
    expense of $6.5 million, calculated the fair value of the
    restricted stock on the modification date, and recorded the
    stock-based compensation expense to the extent that the modified
    performance goals were expected to be achieved over the
    remaining weighted average requisite service period of
    1.0 years. The fair value of the modified performance-based
    restricted stock was $6.2 million, or $7.34 per share. In
    the case of performance-based restricted stock grants for



which both the original performance goal and the modified
    performance goal were determined to be likely to be achieved,
    the original grant date fair value will continue to be recorded
    as stock-based compensation expense as if no modification had
    occurred.

In October 2008, certain executive officers resigned from their
    positions with Cadence. As a result of those resignations and
    the terms of the respective employment agreements of those
    executive officers, the performance-based restricted stock
    either was forfeited or will be subject to vesting according to
    the terms of those agreements. Cadence recorded additional
    stock-based compensation expense relating to accelerated vesting
    of certain portions of some of the affected performance-based
    restricted stock, which was partially offset by the reversal of
    previously recorded stock-based compensation expense relating to
    the performance-based restricted stock that were forfeited.
    Cadence also recorded an additional expense related to the
    acceleration of restricted stock that was not performance-based
    in connection with the executive officer resignations.

Cadence recorded a net credit to stock-based compensation
    expense of $1.0 million during fiscal 2008 related to these
    performance-based restricted stock grants, primarily due to the
    modifications and accelerations noted above. Cadence recorded
    stock-based compensation expense of $7.4 million during
    fiscal 2007 and $4.4 million during fiscal 2006 related to
    these performance-based restricted stock grants.

    3.3 years.

Liability-based
    Awards

Cadence maintains a performance-based bonus plan under which
    payments may be made in Cadence common stock. Each period,
    Cadence estimates the most likely outcome of predetermined
    performance goals and recognizes any related stock-based
    compensation expense. The amount of stock-based compensation
    expense recognized in any one period can vary based on the
    attainment or estimated attainment of the various performance
    goals. If such performance goals are not met, no compensation
    expense is recognized and any previously recognized compensation
    expense is reversed. The stock-based compensation expense
    related to this performance-based bonus plan for fiscal 2008,
    fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 was as follows:

The dollar amount earned under this bonus plan is based on the

    to be issued under the plan is based on the average stock price
    for three days preceding the grant date. Stock issued under the
    performance-based bonus plan vests immediately. Cadence agreed
    to make the fiscal 2008 payments in cash under this
    performance-based bonus plan. Under the terms of this
    performance-based bonus plan, future payments may be made in
    cash or stock. Cash paid and shares issued related to these
    performance-based bonus plans and the fair value of shares
    issued for fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 were as

Cumulative
    effect of change in accounting principle, net of

During fiscal 2006, a non-cash benefit of $0.4 million for
    estimated forfeitures of restricted stock previously expensed
    was recorded as of the SFAS No. 123R implementation
    date as a one-time cumulative effect of change in accounting
    principle, net of tax. Pursuant to APB No. 25, stock-based
    compensation expense was not previously reduced for estimated
    future forfeitures, but instead was reversed upon actual
    forfeiture.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)

Compensation expense is calculated using the fair value of the
    employees’ purchase rights under the Black-Scholes option
    pricing model. The weighted average grant date fair value of

NOTE 12.
    NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE

Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net
    income (loss), the numerator, by the weighted average number of
    shares of common stock outstanding, less unvested restricted
    stock, the denominator, during the period. Diluted net income
    per share gives effect to equity instruments considered to be
    potential common shares, if dilutive, computed using the
    treasury stock method of accounting. In periods in which a net
    loss is recorded, potentially dilutive equity instruments would
    decrease the loss per share and therefore are not added to the
    weighted average shares outstanding.

Cadence accounts for the effect of the 2023 Notes in the diluted
    net income per share calculation using the if-converted method
    of accounting. Under that method, the 2023 Notes are assumed to
    be converted to shares (weighted for the number of days
    outstanding in the period) at a conversion price of $15.65, and
    amortization of transaction fees, net of taxes, related to the
    2023 Notes is added back to net income.

EITF

No. 04-08

requires Cadence to include in diluted earnings per share the
    shares of Cadence’s common stock into which the Convertible
    Senior Notes may be converted. However, since the Convertible
    Senior Notes meet the qualification of an Instrument C under
    EITF

No. 90-19

and because cash will be paid for the principal amount of the
    obligation upon conversion, the only shares that will be
    considered for inclusion in diluted net income per share are
    those relating to the excess of the conversion premium over the
    principal amount, using the “if-converted” method. As
    of January 3, 2009, no shares are included in diluted
    earnings per share, or EPS, for the Convertible Senior Notes.



The calculations for basic and diluted net income (loss) per
    share for fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 are as

CONVERTIBLE
    NOTES

1.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2011 and
    1.500% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2013

In December 2006, Cadence issued $250.0 million principal
    amount of 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2011, or the
    2011 Notes, and $250.0 million of 1.500% Convertible
    Senior Notes Due 2013, or the 2013 Notes, and collectively, the
    Convertible Senior Notes, to three initial purchasers in a
    private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the
    Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for
    resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC
    Rule 144A of the Securities Act, or SEC Rule 144A. The
    indentures for the Convertible Senior Notes do not contain any
    financial covenants.

Cadence received net proceeds of approximately
    $487.0 million after transaction fees of approximately
    $13.0 million, including $12.0 million of underwriting
    discounts. A portion of the net proceeds totaling
    $228.5 million was used to purchase $189.6 million
    principal amount of Cadence’s 2023 Notes.



Holders may convert their Convertible Senior Notes prior to
    maturity upon the occurrence of one of the following events:

•

The price of Cadence’s common stock reaches $27.50 during
    certain periods of time specified in the Convertible Senior
    Notes;

•

Specified corporate transactions occur; or

•

The trading price of the Convertible Senior Notes falls below
    98% of the product of (i) the last reported sale price of
    our common stock and (ii) the conversion rate on that date.

On and after November 2, 2011, in the case of the 2011
    Notes, and November 1, 2013, in the case of the 2013 Notes,
    until the close of business on the scheduled trading day
    immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert
    their Convertible Senior Notes at any time, regardless of the
    foregoing circumstances. Cadence may not redeem the Convertible
    Senior Notes prior to maturity.

The initial conversion rate for the Convertible Senior Notes is
    47.2813 shares of Cadence common stock per $1,000 principal
    amount of Convertible Senior Notes, equivalent to a conversion
    price of approximately $21.15 per share of Cadence common stock.
    Upon conversion, a holder will receive the sum of the daily
    settlement amounts, calculated on a proportionate basis for each
    day, during a specified observation period following the
    conversion date. The daily settlement amount during each date of
    the observation period consists of:

•

Cash up to the principal amount of the note; and

•

Cadence’s common stock to the extent that the conversion
    value exceeds the amount of cash paid upon conversion of the
    Convertible Senior Notes.

In addition, if a fundamental change occurs prior to maturity
    and provided that Cadence’s stock price is greater than
    $18.00 per share, the conversion rate will increase by an
    additional amount of up to $8.27 per share, for a holder that
    elects to convert its Convertible Senior Notes in connection
    with such fundamental change, which amount will be paid entirely
    in cash. A fundamental change is any transaction or event
    (whether by means of an exchange offer, liquidation, tender
    offer, consolidation, merger, combination, reclassification,
    recapitalization or otherwise) in which more than 50% of
    Cadence’s common stock is exchanged for, converted into,
    acquired for or constitutes solely the right to receive,
    consideration. No fundamental change will have occurred if at
    least 90% of the consideration received consists of shares of
    common stock, or depositary receipts representing such shares,
    that are:

•

Listed on, or immediately after the transaction or event will be
    listed on, a United States national securities exchange; or

•

Approved, or immediately after the transaction or event will be
    approved, for quotation on a United States system of automated
    dissemination of quotations of securities prices similar to the
    NASDAQ National Market prior to its designation as a national
    securities exchange.

As of January 3, 2009, none of the conditions allowing the
    holders of the Convertible Senior Notes to convert had been met.

Cadence evaluated the embedded conversion option in accordance
    with SFAS No. 133 and concluded that the embedded
    conversion option contained within the Convertible Senior Notes
    should not be accounted for separately because the conversion
    option is indexed to Cadence’s common stock and is
    classified as stockholders’ equity. Furthermore, Cadence
    evaluated the terms of the Convertible Senior Notes for a
    beneficial conversion feature in accordance with EITF

No. 98-5,

“Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial
    Conversion Features or Contingently Adjustable Conversion
    Ratios” and EITF

No. 00-27,

“Application of Issue

98-5

to
    Certain Convertible Instruments” and concluded there was no
    beneficial conversion feature at the commitment date based on
    the conversion rate of the Convertible Senior Notes relative to
    the commitment date stock price.

Interest on the Convertible Senior Notes began accruing in
    December 2006 and is payable semi-annually each
    December 15th and June 15th.

Concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes,
    Cadence entered into hedge transactions with various parties
    whereby Cadence has the option to purchase up to
    23.6 million shares of Cadence’s common stock at a
    price of $21.15 per share, subject to adjustment. These options
    expire on December 15, 2011, in the case of the 2011 Notes,
    and December 15, 2013, in the case of the 2013 Notes, and
    must be settled in net shares. The aggregate



cost of these hedge transactions was $119.8 million and has
    been recorded as a reduction to Stockholders’ equity in
    accordance with EITF

No. 00-19,

“Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed
    to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own
    Stock.” The estimated fair value of the hedges acquired in
    connection with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes was
    $11.6 million as of January 3, 2009. Subsequent
    changes in the fair value of these hedges will not be recognized
    as long as the instruments remain classified as equity.

In separate transactions, Cadence also sold warrants to various
    parties for the purchase of up to 23.6 million shares of
    Cadence’s common stock at a price of $31.50 per share in a
    private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the
    Securities Act. The warrants expire on various dates from
    February 2012 through April 2012 in the case of the 2011 Notes,
    and February 2014 through April 2014 in the case of the 2013
    Notes, and must be settled in net shares. Cadence received
    $39.4 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these
    warrants, which has been recorded as a reduction to
    Stockholders’ equity in accordance with EITF

No. 00-19.

The estimated fair value of the warrants sold in connection with
    the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes was
    $7.5 million as of January 3, 2009. Subsequent changes
    in the fair value of these warrants will not be recognized as
    long as the instruments remain classified as equity. The
    warrants will be included in diluted EPS to the extent the
    impact is considered dilutive.

Zero Coupon Zero Yield Senior Convertible Notes Due 2023

In August 2003, Cadence issued $420.0 million principal
    amount of its 2023 Notes to two initial purchasers in a private
    placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act
    for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC
    Rule 144A. Cadence received net proceeds of
    $406.4 million after transaction fees of $13.6 million
    that were recorded in Other long-term assets and were amortized
    to interest expense using the straight-line method over five
    years.

In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes
    in December 2006, a portion of the proceeds were used to
    purchase in the open market 2023 Notes with a principal balance
    of $189.6 million for a total purchase price of
    $228.5 million. In connection with this purchase, Cadence
    incurred expenses of $40.8 million for the early
    extinguishment of debt. The loss on early extinguishment of debt
    included the call premium on the purchased 2023 Notes and the
    write-off of a portion of the unamortized deferred debt issuance
    costs. In August 2008, Cadence repurchased $230.2 million
    principal amount of the 2023 Notes upon the election of the
    holders of the 2023 Notes pursuant to the terms of the 2023
    Notes, for a total consideration of $230.8 million,
    reducing the outstanding 2023 Note balance to $0.2 million
    as of January 3, 2009. Concurrently with the issuance of
    the 2023 Notes, Cadence entered into hedge and warrant
    transactions, all of which expired during fiscal 2008 and no
    settlement was required.

NOTE 15.

CONTINGENCIES

Legal Proceedings

From time to time, Cadence is involved in various disputes and
    litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business. These
    include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property,
    mergers and acquisitions, licensing, contracts, distribution
    arrangements and employee relations matters. At least quarterly,
    Cadence reviews the status of each significant matter and
    assesses its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss
    from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and
    the amount or the range of loss can be estimated, Cadence
    accrues a liability for the estimated loss in accordance with
    SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies.”
    Legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties, and the outcomes
    are difficult to predict. Because of such uncertainties,
    accruals are based only on the best information available at the
    time. As additional information becomes available, Cadence
    reassesses the potential liability related to pending claims and
    litigation matters and may revise estimates.

During fiscal 2008, three complaints were filed in the United
    States District Court for the Northern District of California,
    all alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the
    Exchange Act, and

Rule 10b-5

promulgated thereunder, on behalf of a purported class of
    purchasers of Cadence’s common stock. The plaintiffs in
    these actions allege that Cadence and the individual defendants
    made statements during the class period regarding the
    Company’s financial results that were false and misleading
    because Cadence had recognized revenue that should have been
    recognized in subsequent quarters. The plaintiffs requested
    certification of the actions as a class action, unspecified
    damages and interest, the plaintiffs’ reasonable costs,
    including attorneys’ and experts’ fees, and
    unspecified equitable or injunctive relief. The first such
    complaint was filed on October 29, 2008, captioned
    Hu v. Cadence



Design Systems, Inc., Michael J. Fister, William Porter and
    Kevin S. Palatnik; the second such complaint was filed on
    November 4, 2008, captioned Vyas v. Cadence Design
    Systems, Inc., Michael J. Fister, and Kevin S. Palatnik; and the
    third such complaint was filed on November 21, 2008,
    captioned Collins v. Cadence Design Systems, Inc., Michael
    J. Fister, John B. Shoven, Kevin S. Palatnik and William Porter.
    Various plaintiffs have filed motions seeking to be named lead
    plaintiff, and to have these complaints consolidated. Those
    motions are set to be heard by the Court on March 6, 2009.
    Cadence intends to vigorously defend these and any other
    securities lawsuits that may be filed.

During fiscal 2008, two derivative complaints have been filed in
    Santa Clara County Superior Court. The first was filed on
    November 20, 2008, and captioned Ury Priel, derivatively on
    behalf of nominal defendant Cadence Design Systems, Inc. v.
    John B. Shoven, Lip-Bu Tan, Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli,
    Donald L. Lucas, Sr., Roger Siboni, George Scalise, Michael
    J. Fister, and Doe Defendants 1-15. The second was filed on
    December 1, 2008, and captioned Mark Levine, derivatively
    on behalf of nominal defendant Cadence Design Systems,
    Inc. v. John B. Shoven, Lip-Bu Tan, Alberto
    Sangiovanni-Vincentelli, Donald L. Lucas, Sr., Roger
    Siboni, George Scalise, Michael J. Fister, John Swainson and Doe
    Defendants 1-10. These complaints purport to bring suit
    derivatively, on behalf of Cadence, against certain of
    Cadence’s current and former directors for alleged breach
    of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste
    of corporate assets and unjust enrichment. Many of the
    allegations underlying these claims are similar or identical to
    the allegations in the securities class action lawsuits
    described above, and further allege that the individual
    defendants approved compensation based on inflated financial
    results. The plaintiffs request unspecified damages,
    restitution, equitable relief and their reasonable
    attorneys’ fees, experts’ fees, costs and expenses on
    behalf of Cadence against the individual defendants. A motion to
    consolidate these complaints was granted on January 20,
    2009. Cadence is analyzing these derivative complaints and will
    respond to them appropriately.

In light of the preliminary status of these lawsuits, Cadence
    cannot predict the claims, allegations, class period (in the
    case of the class actions), or outcome of these matters. While
    the outcome of these litigation matters cannot be predicted with
    any certainty, management does not believe that the outcome of
    any current matters will have a material adverse effect on
    Cadence’s consolidated financial position, liquidity or
    results of operations.

Other Contingencies

Cadence provides its customers with a warranty on sales of
    hardware products for a

90-day

period. These warranties are accounted for in accordance with
    SFAS No. 5. To date, Cadence has not incurred any
    significant costs related to warranty obligations.

Cadence’s product license and services agreements include a
    limited indemnification provision for claims from third parties
    relating to Cadence’s intellectual property. Such
    indemnification provisions are accounted for in accordance with
    SFAS No. 5. The indemnification is generally limited
    to the amount paid by the customer. To date, claims under such
    indemnification provisions have not been significant.

NOTE 16.

LEASE
    COMMITMENTS

Equipment and facilities are leased under various operating
    leases expiring at various dates through 2025. Certain of these
    leases contain renewal options. Rental expense was
    $34.7 million for fiscal 2008, $34.6 million for
    fiscal 2007 and $30.5 million for fiscal 2006.



As of January 3, 2009, future minimum lease payments under

NOTE 17.
    SALES OF INSTALLMENT CONTRACT RECEIVABLES

From time to time, Cadence transfers installment contract
    receivables on a non-recourse or limited-recourse basis to third
    party financial institutions. These transfers are recorded as
    sales and accounted for in accordance with
    SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and
    Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
    Liabilities.” The following table shows the amounts of
    accounts receivable transferred to financial institutions on a
    non-recourse basis during fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal
    2006:

Losses on the sale of receivables are included in General and
    administrative expense in the accompanying Consolidated
    Statements of Operations. The recorded losses are determined
    based on the purchasing financial institution’s review of
    the credit strength of the customers whose installment contract
    receivables are being transferred by Cadence. The following
    table presents the losses recorded during fiscal 2008, fiscal

When Cadence sells receivables, it generally retains the
    servicing rights to the underlying accounts receivable. The fair
    value of the retained servicing rights have not been material to
    Cadence’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

During fiscal 2008, Cadence executed a transaction that was not
    deemed a true sale in accordance with SFAS No. 140.
    Accordingly, Cadence recorded a liability of $18.0 million
    due to the financial institution in its Consolidated Balance
    Sheet and the cash received from the financial institution is
    included as Cash flows from financing activities in the
    Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

NOTE 18.
    EMPLOYEE AND DIRECTOR BENEFIT PLANS

Cadence maintains a 401(k) savings plan to provide retirement
    benefits through tax-deferred salary deductions for all of its
    United States employees. Cadence may make discretionary
    contributions, as determined by the Board of Directors, which
    cannot exceed a specified percentage of the annual aggregate
    salaries of those employees



eligible to participate. Cadence made total contributions to the
    plan of $12.2 million in 2008, $12.2 million in 2007
    and $11.4 million in 2006.

Executive Officers and Directors may also elect to defer
    compensation payable to them under Cadence’s 1994
    Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan. Deferred compensation
    payments are held in accounts with values indexed to the
    performance of selected mutual funds or money market accounts.
    These investments are classified as trading securities on
    Cadence’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and gains and losses
    are recognized as income (expense) in the Consolidated
    Statements of Operations. Net recognized gains (losses) of
    trading securities during fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal

    FIN No. 48 was reported as an adjustment to the
    opening balance of retained earnings (or other appropriate
    components of equity or net assets) in the Consolidated Balance
    Sheet for fiscal 2007, which amounts were non-cash items in

NOTE 21.

SEGMENT
    REPORTING

SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an
    Enterprise and Related Information,” requires disclosures
    of certain information regarding operating segments, products
    and services, geographic areas of operation and major customers.
    SFAS No. 131 reporting is based upon the
    “management approach”: how management organizes the
    company’s operating segments for which separate financial
    information is (i) available and (ii) evaluated
    regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how
    to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
    Cadence’s chief operating decision maker is its President
    and Chief Executive Officer, or CEO.

Cadence’s CEO reviews Cadence’s consolidated results
    within one segment. In making operating decisions, the CEO
    primarily considers consolidated financial information,
    accompanied by disaggregated information about revenues by
    geographic region.

Outside the United States, Cadence markets and supports its
    products and services primarily through its subsidiaries.
    Revenue is attributed to geography based on the country in which
    the product is used or services are delivered. Long-lived assets
    are attributed to geography based on the country where the
    assets are located.
