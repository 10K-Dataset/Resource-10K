Factors Driving the Electronic Design Automation Industry

During the last decade, the worldwide communications, business
productivity and consumer electronics markets accounted for much
of the growth in the electronics industry. Ever-decreasing
silicon manufacturing process geometries, coupled with the move
to 300 millimeter wafer production, are causing IC unit cost
decreases, volume increases and greater complexity for providers
of electronics devices. At the same time, the development of ICs
with greater functionality complicates effective integration of
components into complete electronic systems. These market and
technology forces pose major challenges for the global
electronics design community, and consequently create
significant opportunities and challenges for EDA product and
service providers.

From a design perspective, many of today’s complex ICs are

system-on

-a-chip, or
SoC, devices. SoC design requires the implementation of an
entire electronics sub-system on a single IC, which is made
possible by smaller feature sizes characteristic of the newest
IC fabrication processes. Smaller feature sizes make it



possible to put additional circuitry on a single segment of
silicon, or die. SoCs typically include one or more processors
(microprocessors and digital signal processors), a
high-performance “bus” for on-chip data communication,
numerous memory devices and peripherals, custom digital
circuitry, custom analog circuitry and millions of lines of
software code developed to run on the resulting device. These
complex devices offer benefits in terms of price, performance,
power and size; however, they are extremely difficult to design.
Successful SoC design requires the convergence of the previously
distinct domains of embedded software, digital logic, analog
circuitry, IC packaging and PCB design. This convergence is
changing the way designs for these devices are created.

The migration to nanometer design poses major challenges for
design teams. Nanometer design refers to the design of ICs that
have feature sizes smaller than 180 nanometers or one hundred
eighty billionths of a meter (for reference, the diameter of the
period at the end of this sentence is approximately
400,000 nanometers). IC feature sizes for wires,
transistors and contacts decrease with each advance in the
semiconductor manufacturing process. Each move to a smaller
feature size (e.g., decreasing from 130 nanometers to
90 nanometers and smaller) requires introducing new
capabilities throughout the entire design and manufacturing
chain to account for physical effects that were inconsequential
at larger geometries but now limit device yield, performance,
reliability and the ability to function as intended. For
example, at 130 nanometers, signal integrity issues such as
crosstalk between signal wires and voltage drop on power wires
become critical. At 90 nanometers, device power leakage
becomes a major factor in total power consumption. The increased
complexity, electrical “noise” and power consumption
due to leakage combine to increase the challenge to design teams
in meeting chip performance specifications.

These trends pose significant new challenges for electronics
design teams. Specifically, nanometer design requires designers
to take into account many physical effects that were too small
to affect the performance of larger circuit geometries. SoC
design requires new approaches to managing complexity and its
related risks. The electronics industry addresses these
challenges in a number of ways, including the use of new EDA
products, the upgrade of existing tools and design
methodologies, and offering the advantages of highly integrated

front-to

-back design
solutions.

Operating Segments

Our chief operating decision maker is our President and Chief
Executive Officer, or CEO. Our CEO reviews our consolidated
results within only one segment.

Products

Our products are engineered to improve our customers’
design productivity and resulting design quality by providing a
comprehensive set of EDA design technology. Product revenues
include all fees earned from granting licenses to use our
software, and from sales and leases of our hardware products,
and exclude revenues derived from our maintenance and services
businesses. We offer customers three license types for our
software: perpetual, term and subscription. See “Software
Licensing Arrangements” below for additional discussion of
our license types.

Product revenue was $851.5 million, or 64% of our total
revenue, in 2005, $729.8 million, or 61% of our total
revenue, in 2004 and $663.5 million, or 59% of our total
revenue, in 2003.

Product Strategy

With the addition of emerging nanometer design considerations to
the already burgeoning set of traditional design tasks, complex
SoC or IC design can no longer be accomplished using a
collection of discrete design tools. What previously consisted
of sequential design activities must be merged and accomplished
nearly simultaneously without time-consuming data translation
steps. We combine our design technologies into
“platforms” for four major design activities:
functional verification, digital IC design, custom IC design and
system interconnect. The four
Cadence

®

design platforms are
Incisive

tm

functional verification,
Encounter

tm

digital IC design,
Virtuoso

®

custom design and
Allegro

®

system interconnect platforms. In addition, we augment these
platform product offerings with a comprehensive set of design
for manufacturing



products that service both the digital and custom IC design
flows. These four platforms, together with our design for
manufacturing products, comprise our primary product lines.

Incisive Functional Verification Platform

The Incisive functional verification platform enables our
customers to employ enterprise-level verification process
automation, including verification planning, management and
process tracking with coordination of all verification
activities across teams of specialists and different execution
platforms.

The Incisive platform is tailored for three segments: hardware
description language engineers, design teams who are also
responsible for verification, and multi-specialist enterprise
teams. The Incisive platform includes verification tools and
technologies from mixed-language and mixed-signal simulation
through the Specman
Elite

®

test bench solution, formal analysis and the
Palladium

®

and
Extreme

®

series of emulation and acceleration solutions. The Incisive

plan-to

-closure
methodology (including technical field experts) is designed to
enable the scalable deployment of best practices and to mitigate
our customers’ language, technology and methodology
adoption risks. The technology acquired in our acquisition of
Verisity Ltd., or Verisity, is included in the Incisive platform.

Encounter Digital IC Design Platform

The Encounter digital IC design platform enables our customers
to implement all aspects of their digital nanometer-scale
designs. It is based on a single user interface and unified
in-memory data model, and was specifically designed to
facilitate the analysis and optimization of physical
interconnect throughout our customers’ design processes.
The Encounter platform is comprised of the following core
technologies:

•

Silicon virtual prototyping for enabling designers to plan the
    complete implementation of a chip before committing to a
    specific design strategy;

•

Global register transfer level, or RTL, and physical synthesis
    for creating and physically locating logic on the chip, while
    simultaneously optimizing for performance, power, cost and yield;

•

Signal integrity and yield-aware routing for connecting high
    performance physical interconnect between the logic gates;

•

Signal integrity and nanometer delay analysis;

•

Comprehensive Design-for-Test capability as well as post-silicon
    test diagnostics; and

•

Logic Equivalence Checking and design constraint management
    capability for designers to verify that their RTL specification
    is equivalent to the final IC layout.

Unlike traditional “front-end/back-end” systems, the
Encounter platform does not require customers to perform
time-consuming translations between common tasks such as
placement, power distribution, routing, and timing/crosstalk
analysis. The Encounter platform supports hierarchical designs,
with full-chip support for designs containing more than
50 million gates (a gate is an electronic switch that
allows or prevents the flow of electrical current in a circuit).
Since 2005, the Encounter platform has been comprised of three
levels: Encounter L, XL and GXL. These levels are scaled to
provide customers with technologies tailored to specific degrees
of design complexity in the digital IC space.

Virtuoso Custom Design Platform

The Virtuoso custom design platform enables design
predictability by ensuring that the circuit design
representation will perform correctly in the final manufactured
chip. With the Virtuoso platform, designers are able to deliver
silicon-accurate analog, custom digital, radio frequency, or RF,
and mixed-signal designs, while addressing the growing number of
physical effects in package, power grid, interconnect, devices
and substrate employing a “top-down” language-based
design.

The Virtuoso platform reduces design time by providing:

•

Reference flows for analog, mixed-signal, RF and analog-digital
    integration focused at the wireless and analog/mixed-signal
    markets;

•

Automatic analog circuit sizing and optimization (including
    yield optimization);



•

Multi-mode simulation (digital, analog and RF) using a common
    syntax and model, and common equations;

•

Fast custom layout technologies;

•

Process migration technology;

•

Electrical vs. physical effects analysis; and

•

Physical design integration and silicon analysis for complex
    custom, cell-based and mixed custom designs using the
    OpenAccess

tm

database (described below in “Third Party Programs and
    Initiatives).”

Allegro System Interconnect Design Platform

The Allegro system interconnect design platform enables design
teams to design high-performance interconnect across the domains
of IC, package and PCB, reducing cost and time to market. The
system interconnect — between input-output, or I/ O,
buffers and across ICs, packages and PCBs — can be
optimized through the platform’s co-design methodology,
reducing both hardware costs and design cycles. Designers use
the Allegro platform’s constraint-driven methodology and
advanced capabilities for design capture, signal integrity and
physical implementation. Silicon design-in kits speed time to
market by allowing IC companies to shorten new device adoption
time and allowing systems companies to accelerate PCB system
design cycles.

The system interconnect product group includes the Allegro
system interconnect platform and the
OrCAD

®

product line of PCB design products which are engineered for
individual or small design team productivity. The OrCAD product
line is marketed worldwide through a network of alternative
channel partners.

Design for Manufacturing

The physical layout of each IC requires detailed analysis and
optimization to ensure that the design can be manufactured in
volume while performing as expected. Some of the Cadence
products that deliver design for manufacturing, or DFM,
capabilities for nanometer SoC design include:

•

Fire &
    Ice

®

QX and
    Assura

tm

RCX extraction products, which take the designer’s physical
    representation of an IC and extract the electrical properties of
    that design representation to enable further analyses, such as
    simulation and timing analysis;

•

Products in the
    VoltageStorm

®

family, which analyze on-chip power distribution for digital,
    analog and SoC designs. VoltageStorm detects unanticipated
    voltage drop, enabling the customer to correct fatal conditions,
    thereby preventing extensive troubleshooting and delay during
    initial manufacturing;

•

Our physical verification products, including Cadence Physical
    Verification System, Assura,
    Diva

®

and
    Dracula

®

,
    which perform manufacturing design rule checks to ensure the
    proposed design meets the requirements of the foundry’s
    manufacturing process rules; and

•

Mask data preparation tools, such as MaskCompose and QuickView,
    which help customer mask shops create mask and reticle layouts
    for chips being manufactured in nanometer processes.

Kits

Today’s growing silicon complexity creates an array of
design challenges for semiconductor and systems design teams.
Among these is the application of EDA technologies to overcome
design hurdles in the wired networking, wireless and personal
entertainment sectors. Cadence kits are designed to allow
companies in these sectors to achieve shorter, more predictable
design cycles and greater design productivity by greatly
simplifying the application and integration of EDA technologies
and verification IP.

Each kit addresses application-specific design issues by
combining a verified methodology packaged in platform flows, and
enabling standards-based IP — all applied to a segment
representative design and delivered with applicability training.
We introduced the first kits, the AMS Methodology Kit and the
ARM

tm

Methodology
Kit, in September 2005 and our RF Design Methodology Kit in
December 2005.



Verification and Application Specific Programming Services

We offer verification and applications specific programming, or
ASP, services through

Time-to

-Market
Engineering, or TtME, services. Our TtME team provides customers
with consulting services, project services and/or complete
turnkey services for verification acceleration and system
emulation. QuickCycles allows customers to access our Palladium
simulation acceleration and emulation products on a
pay-as-you-go basis, either on the customer internet site or
remotely over a high-speed, secure network connection.

Third Party Programs and Initiatives

We recognize that certain of our customers may also use
internally-developed design tools or design tools provided by
other EDA companies, as well as IP available from multiple
suppliers. We support the integration of third party design
products through our OpenAccess Initiative and
Connections

®

and OpenChoice programs. OpenAccess is a full-featured EDA
database that supports access and manipulation of its internal
EDA data via a fully documented and freely available programming
interface. This provides an open application program interface
through which applications developed by our customers, by their
other EDA vendors, or by university research groups can all
operate within a single database and with Cadence platforms. We
have licensed the OpenAccess database to the OpenAccess
Coalition, which is operated by the Silicon Integration
Initiative, an organization of EDA, electronic system and
semiconductor industry leaders focused on improving productivity
and reducing cost in creating and producing integrated silicon
systems.

The Connections Program provides other EDA companies with access
to our products to ensure that our products work well with those
third party tools. Over 130 EDA providers are members of the
Connections Program. The OpenChoice program was instituted to
enable interoperability and facilitate open collaboration with
leading providers of library, processor, memory core and
verification IP to build, validate and deliver accurate models
optimized for Cadence design and verification solutions. The
program aims to ensure IP quality and provide our customers with
access to optimized IP. A key component of the OpenChoice
program is to assist and support library providers in the
integration of our design and verification products and model
formats into customer-owned tooling, or COT, library solutions.

In addition, we work with vendors of Application Specific
Integrated Circuits, or ASICs, to ensure predictable and smooth
handoff of design data from mutual customers to ASIC
implementation. These programs foster relationships throughout
the silicon design chain with leading IP partners, silicon
manufacturers and library provider partners to support both ASIC
and COT solutions for our customers. They are integral to
providing complete design chain solutions to IC and electronic
systems designers who depend on coordinated offerings from
multiple suppliers.

Maintenance

We provide technical support to our customers to facilitate
their use of our software and hardware products. A high level of
customer service and support is critical to the adoption and
successful use of our products.

We have a global customer support organization and specialized
field application engineering teams located in each of our
operating regions to provide assistance to customers where and
when they need it.

Standard maintenance support includes three major components:
our
Sourcelink

®

online support portal, which provides 24 hour access to
real-time technical information on our products; contact center
support (telephone, email and web access to our support
engineers); and software updates (periodic updates with
regression-tested critical fixes and updated functionality
available via CDs or secure internet download).

Maintenance is offered to customers as an integral,
non-cancelable component of our subscription license agreements,
or as a separate agreement subject to annual renewal for our
term and perpetual license customers.

Some of our customers have relocated, or expanded the presence
of their design teams, away from their headquarters or
historical locations to less expensive locations in emerging
growth regions. Accordingly, to



provide responsive and effective support for our customers, we
expect to continue expanding the presence of our own support and
application engineering teams in these emerging growth regions.

Maintenance revenue was $351.5 million, or 26% of our total
revenue, in 2005, $330.7 million, or 28% of our total
revenue, in 2004 and $324.8 million, or 29% of our total
revenue, in 2003. Maintenance revenue in 2006 will be generated
predominantly from backlog.

Services

We offer a number of fee-based services, including education and
engineering services related to IC design and methodology.
These services may be sold separately or sold and performed in
conjunction with the sale, lease or license of our products.

Services revenue was $126.2 million, or 9% of our total
revenue, in 2005, $137.0 million, or 11% of our total
revenue, in 2004 and $131.1 million, or 12% of our total
revenue, in 2003.

Education Services

Our education services include Internet, classroom and custom
courses, the content of which ranges from how to use the most
recent features of our EDA products to instruction in the latest
IC design techniques.

Engineering Services

We offer engineering services and reusable design technologies
to aid customers with the design of complex ICs. We focus our
offerings primarily on SoC devices, including both ASICs and
Application Specific Standard Parts, and on analog and mixed
signal ICs. The customers for these services primarily consist
of semiconductor and systems companies developing products for
the communications, computing and consumer market segments. We
offer engineering capabilities to assist customers from product
concept through volume manufacturing.

We also make our design IP portfolio available to customers as
part of our technology and services solutions. These reusable
design and methodology components enable us to more efficiently
deliver our services, and allow our customers to reduce the
design complexity and time to market for the development of
complex SoCs.

In our design and methodology service practices, we leverage our
cumulative experience and knowledge of design practices across
many customers and different design environments to improve our
own service teams’ and our customers’ productivity. We
work with customers using outsourcing, consultative and
collaborative models depending on their projects and needs. Our
Virtual Computer-Aided Design, or VCAD, model enables our
engineering teams at one or more of our locations to virtually
work “side-by-side” with our customers’ teams
located elsewhere during the course of their design and
engineering projects through a secure private network
infrastructure.

Through collaboration with our customers, we are able to design
advanced ICs and gain direct and early visibility to industry
design issues that may not be addressed adequately by
today’s EDA solutions. This enables us to accelerate the
development of new software technology and products to meet the
market’s current and future design requirements.

Marketing and Sales

We generally use a direct sales force consisting of sales people
and applications engineers to market our products and provide
maintenance and services to existing and prospective customers.
Applications engineers provide technical pre-sales and
post-sales support for software products. Due to the complexity
of many of our EDA products and the electronic design process in
general, the sales cycle is generally long, requiring three to
six months or more. During the sales cycle, our direct sales
force generally provides technical presentations, product
demonstrations and support for

on-site

customer
evaluation of our software.



We also use traditional marketing approaches to promote our
products and services, including advertising, direct mail,
telemarketing, trade shows, public relations and the Internet.
As EDA products mature and become widely understood by the
marketplace, we selectively utilize value added resellers to
broaden our reach and reduce cost of sales. The OrCAD and some
Incisive products are primarily marketed through these channels.

Internationally, we market and support our products and services
primarily through our subsidiaries. Until June 28, 2003, we
licensed most of our software products in Japan through Innotech
Corporation, or Innotech. In June 2003, we purchased certain
assets from Innotech, including distribution rights for certain
customers in Japan. Since June 2003, we directly license our
software products to customers for which we acquired the
distribution rights from Innotech. As of December 31, 2005,
we were an approximately 7% stockholder of Innotech.

Software Licensing Arrangements

We sell software using three license types: subscription, term
and perpetual. Customers who prefer to license technology for a
specified, limited period of time will choose either a
subscription or term license, and customers who prefer to have
the right to use the technology continuously without time
restriction will choose a perpetual license. Customers who
desire rights to remix in new technology during the life of the
contract will select a subscription license, which allows them
limited access to unspecified new technology on a
when-and-if-available basis, as opposed to a term or perpetual
license which does not include remix rights to new technology.
Payment terms for subscription and term licenses generally
provide for payments to be made in installments over the license
period and payment terms for perpetual licenses generally are
net 30 days.

Our revenue recognition depends on a number of contract-specific
terms and conditions, including the license type, payment terms,
creditworthiness of the customer and other factors as more fully
described under the heading “Critical Accounting
Estimates” under Item 7, “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.” Revenue associated with subscription licenses
is recognized over multiple periods during the license term,
whereas product revenue associated with term and perpetual
licenses is generally recognized upon the later of the effective
date or delivery of the product, assuming all other criteria for
revenue recognition have been met. Although it can vary from
quarter to quarter, approximately two-thirds of our product
revenue was recognized from backlog during each of the past
three years.

Our revenue and results of operations may miss expectations due
to a shortfall in product revenue generated from current
transactions or variance in the actual mix of license types
executed in any given period and due to other contract-specific
terms and conditions as discussed above. We are subject to
greater credit risk on subscription and term licenses, as
compared to perpetual licenses, due to the installment payment
terms generally associated with those license types. Otherwise,
the particular risks to us of one license type versus another
type do not vary considerably.

From time to time we sell receivables from our licenses with
installment payment terms on a non-recourse or limited-recourse
basis to third party financing institutions.

For further discussion of our license agreements, revenue
recognition policies and results of operations, please refer to
“Critical Accounting Estimates” under Item 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.”

Research and Development

Our investment in research and development was
$370.1 million in 2005, $351.3 million in 2004 and
$340.1 million in 2003.

The primary areas of our research include SoC design, the design
of silicon devices in the nanometer range, high-performance IC
packaging,

System-in

-Package and
PCB design, system-level modeling and verification,
high-performance logic verification technology and hardware/
software co-verification. Because the electronics industry
combines rapid innovation with rapidly increasing design and
manufacturing



complexity, we make significant investments in enhancing our
current products, as well as creating new products and
technologies and integrating those products and technologies
together into segmented solutions.

Our future performance depends largely on our ability to
maintain and enhance our current product development and
commercialization to meet advancing semiconductor manufacturing
capability and design complexity, develop, acquire or interface
to new products from third parties, and develop solutions that
meet increasingly demanding productivity, quality,
predictability and cost requirements. In addition to research
and development, we maintain Cadence Laboratories, an advanced
research group responsible for exploring specific new
technologies, moving those technologies into product development
and maintaining strong industry relationships.

Manufacturing and Distribution

Our software production consists of configuring the
customer’s order, outsourcing the recording of the product
electronically or on CD-ROM, and producing customer-unique
access keys that allow customers to use licensed products.
Software and documentation are primarily distributed to
customers by secure electronic delivery. User manuals and other
documentation are generally available by secure electronic
delivery or on CD-ROM, but are occasionally supplied in hard
copy format.

Cadence performs final assembly and test of its hardware
verification, acceleration and emulation products in
San Jose, California. Subcontractors manufacture all major
subassemblies, including all individual printed circuit boards
and custom ICs, and supply them to us for qualification and
testing prior to their incorporation into the assembled product.

Proprietary Technology

Our success depends, in part, upon our proprietary technology.
We generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade
secret laws, licenses and restrictive agreements to establish
and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products.
Many of our products include software or other intellectual
property licensed from third parties. We may have to seek new
licenses or renew existing licenses for this third party
software and other intellectual property in the future. As part
of performing design and methodology services for customers, our
design and methodology services business licenses certain
software and other intellectual property of third parties,
including that of our competitors.

Competition

We compete in the EDA market for products and maintenance
primarily with three other significant companies: Synopsys,
Inc., Mentor Graphics Corporation and Magma Design Automation,
Inc. We also compete with numerous smaller EDA companies, with
manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed or have
the capability to develop their own EDA products, and with
numerous electronics design and consulting companies. We
generally compete on the basis of product quality and features,
integration in a platform or compatibility with other tools,
price and payment terms and maintenance offerings.

Our maintenance business flows directly from our products
business. The competitive issues associated with our maintenance
business are substantially the same as those for our products
business in that every maintenance contract is the direct result
of a product contract, and once we have entered into a product
contract, maintenance is generally purchased by the customer to
ensure that the customer will receive access to bug fixes and
service releases, as and when they are made available, and other
continued support.

Certain competitive factors in the design and methodology
services business as described herein differ from those of the
products and maintenance businesses. While we also compete with
other EDA companies in the design and methodology services
business, we compete more with independent design and
methodology service businesses. These companies vary greatly in
focus, geographic location, capability, cost structure and
pricing. In addition, manufacturers of electronic devices may be
reluctant to purchase services from independent vendors, such as
Cadence, because they wish to promote their own internal design
departments. We compete with these companies by focusing on the
design of complex analog and digital ICs. It is our



strategy to use design and methodology services as a
differentiator to further promote our products and maintenance
businesses.

Backlog

Our backlog on December 31, 2005 was approximately
$1.8 billion, as compared to $1.7 billion on
January 1, 2005. Backlog consists of revenue to be
recognized over multiple fiscal periods after December 31,
2005 from:

•

subscription licenses for software products;

•

the sale or lease of hardware;

•

maintenance contracts on hardware and software products;

•

orders for hardware and software products sold on perpetual and
    term licenses on which customers have delivery dates after
    December 31, 2005;

•

term licenses with payments that are outside our customary terms;

•

licenses for which collection of payment is not probable;

•

the undelivered portion of design and methodology services
    contracts for which revenue is recognized as services are
    performed; and

•

design and methodology services contracts recognized under the

percentage-of

-completion
    method for which services have not yet been completed.

The substantial majority of our backlog is generated by our
product and maintenance businesses because customer licenses
generally include both product and maintenance components. We
expect that maintenance revenue in 2006 will be predominately
generated from backlog. Historically, we have not experienced
significant cancellations of our contracts with customers.
However, we often reschedule the required completion dates of
design and methodology services contracts which, at times,
defers revenue recognition under those contracts beyond the
original expected completion date. Changes in customer license
types or payment terms also can impact the timing of revenue
recognition.

Revenue Seasonality

Historically, orders and revenue have been lowest in our first
quarter and highest in our fourth quarter, with a material
decline between the fourth quarter of one year and the first
quarter of the next year. We expect the first quarter will
remain our lowest quarter for orders and revenues; orders and
revenues in other quarters will vary based on the particular
timing and type of licenses entered into with large customers.

International Operations

We have approximately 60 design centers, research facilities and
sales offices located around the world. We consider customer
sales and support requirements, the availability of a skilled
workforce, and costs and efficiencies, among other relative
benefits, when determining what operations to locate
internationally. For additional information regarding our
international operations, see

“The effect of foreign
exchange rate fluctuations and other risks to our international
operations may seriously harm our financial condition”

in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Note 21
to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Employees

As of December 31, 2005, we employed approximately 5,000
individuals, with approximately 2,200 in sales, services,
marketing, support and manufacturing activities, approximately
2,300 in product development and approximately 500 in
management, administration and finance. None of our employees
are represented by a labor union, and we have experienced no
work stoppages. We believe that our employee relations are good.



Item 1A. Risk Factors

Our business faces many risks. Described below are what we
believe to be the material risks that we face. If any of the
events or circumstances described in the following risks
actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of
operations could suffer.

Risks Related to Our Business

We are subject to the cyclical nature of the integrated
circuit and electronics systems industries, and any

downturn in these
industries may reduce our revenue.

Purchases of our products and services are dependent upon the
commencement of new design projects by IC manufacturers and
electronics systems companies. The IC and electronics systems
industries are cyclical and are characterized by constant and
rapid technological change, rapid product obsolescence and price
erosion, evolving standards, short product life cycles and wide
fluctuations in product supply and demand.

The IC and electronics systems industries have experienced
significant downturns, often connected with, or in anticipation
of, maturing product cycles of both these industries’ and
their customers’ products and a decline in general economic
conditions. These downturns have been characterized by
diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high
inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling
prices.

Over the past several years, IC manufacturers and electronics
systems companies have experienced a downturn in demand and
production, which has resulted in reduced research and
development spending by many of our customers. Many of these
companies appear to have experienced a gradual recovery in 2004
and 2005, but they have continued to spend cautiously. Any
economic downturn in the industries we serve could harm our
business, operating results and financial condition.

Our failure to respond quickly to technological
developments could make our products uncompetitive

and obsolete.

The industries in which we compete experience rapid silicon
technology developments, changes in industry standards, changes
in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions
and improvements. Currently, the industries we serve are
experiencing several revolutionary trends:

•

Migration to nanometer design: the size of features such as
    wires, transistors and contacts on ICs continuously shrink due
    to the ongoing advances in semiconductor manufacturing
    processes. Process feature sizes refer to the width of the
    transistors and the width and spacing of interconnect on the IC.
    Feature size is normally identified by the transistor length,
    which is shrinking from 130 nanometers to 90 nanometers to
    65 nanometers and smaller. This is commonly referred to in the
    semiconductor industry as the migration to nanometer design. It
    represents a major challenge for participants in the
    semiconductor industry, from IC design and design automation to
    design of manufacturing equipment and the manufacturing process
    itself. Shrinkage of transistor length to such proportions is
    challenging the industry in the application of more complex
    physics and chemistry that is needed to realize advanced silicon
    devices. For EDA tools, models of each component’s
    electrical properties and behavior become more complex as do
    requisite analysis, design and verification capabilities. Novel
    design tools and methodologies must be invented quickly to
    remain competitive in the design of electronics in the nanometer
    range.

•

The challenges of nanometer design are leading some customers to
    work with older, less risky manufacturing processes. This may
    reduce their need to upgrade their EDA products and design flows.

•

The ability to design SoCs increases the complexity of managing
    a design that, at the lowest level, is represented by billions
    of shapes on the fabrication mask. In addition, SoCs typically
    incorporate microprocessors and digital signal processors that
    are programmed with software, requiring simultaneous design of
    the IC and the related software embedded on the IC.

•

With the availability of seemingly endless gate capacity, there
    is an increase in design reuse, or the combining of

off-the

-shelf design IP
    with custom logic to create ICs. The unavailability of
    high-quality design IP that can be reliably incorporated into a
    customer’s design with Cadence IC implementation products
    and services could reduce demand for our products and services.



•

Increased technological capability of the Field-Programmable
    Gate Array, which is a programmable logic chip, creates an
    alternative to IC implementation for some electronics companies.
    This could reduce demand for Cadence’s IC implementation
    products and services.

•

A growing number of low-cost design and methodology services
    businesses could reduce the need for some IC companies to invest
    in EDA products.

If we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these
developments, we may lose our competitive position, and our
products or technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete.
To compete successfully, we must develop or acquire new products
and improve our existing products and processes on a schedule
that keeps pace with technological developments and the
requirements for products addressing a broad spectrum of
designers and designer expertise in our industries. We must also
be able to support a range of changing computer software,
hardware platforms and customer preferences. We cannot guarantee
that we will be successful in this effort.

We have experienced varied operating results, and our
operating results for any particular fiscal period are

affected by the timing
of significant orders for our software products, fluctuations in
customer preferences

for license types and
the timing of recognition of revenue under those license
types.

We have experienced, and may continue to experience, varied
operating results. In particular, we have experienced net losses
for some past periods and we may experience net losses in future
periods. Various factors affect our operating results and some
of them are not within our control. Our operating results for
any period are affected by the timing of significant orders for
our software products because a significant number of licenses
for our software products are in excess of $5.0 million.

Our operating results are also affected by the mix of license
types executed in any given period. We license software using
three different license types: subscription, term and perpetual.
Product revenue associated with term and perpetual licenses is
generally recognized at the beginning of the license period,
whereas product revenue associated with subscription licenses is
recognized over multiple periods over the term of the license.
Revenue may also be deferred under term and perpetual licenses
until payments become due and payable from customers with
nonlinear payment terms or as cash is collected from customers
with lower credit ratings. In addition, revenue is impacted by
the timing of license renewals, the extent to which contracts
contain flexible payment terms and the mix of license types
(i.e., perpetual, term or subscription) for existing customers,
which changes could have the effect of accelerating or delaying
the recognition of revenue from the timing of recognition under
the original contract.

We plan operating expense levels primarily based on forecasted
revenue levels. These expenses and the impact of long-term
commitments are relatively fixed in the short term. A shortfall
in revenue could lead to operating results below expectations
because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed
expenses in response to these short-term business changes.

You should not view our historical results of operations as
reliable indicators of our future performance. If revenue or
operating results fall short of the levels expected by public
market analysts and investors, the trading price of our common
stock could decline dramatically.

Our future revenue is dependent in part upon our installed
customer base continuing to license or buy

additional products,
renew maintenance agreements and purchase additional
services.

Our installed customer base has traditionally generated
additional new license, service and maintenance revenues. In
future periods, customers may not necessarily license or buy
additional products or contract for additional services or
maintenance. Maintenance is generally renewable annually at a
customer’s option, and there are no mandatory payment
obligations or obligations to license additional software. If
our customers decide not to renew their maintenance agreements
or license additional products or contract for additional
services, or if they reduce the scope of the maintenance
agreements, our revenue could decrease, which could have an
adverse effect on our results of operations.



We may not receive significant revenue from our current
research and development efforts for several

years, if at all.

Internally developing software products and integrating acquired
software products into existing platforms is expensive, and
these investments often require a long time to generate returns.
Our strategy involves significant investments in software
research and development and related product opportunities. We
believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount
of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain
our competitive position. However, we cannot predict that we
will receive significant, if any, revenue from these investments.

We have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and
businesses and may not realize the expected

benefits of these
acquisitions.

We have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and
businesses in the future. While we expect to carefully analyze
each potential acquisition before committing to the transaction,
we may not be able to integrate and manage acquired products and
businesses effectively. In addition, acquisitions involve a
number of risks. If any of the following events occurs after we
acquire another business, it could seriously harm our business,
operating results and financial condition:

•

Difficulties in combining previously separate businesses into a
    single unit;

•

The substantial diversion of management’s attention from

day-to

-day business
    when evaluating and negotiating these transactions and
    integrating an acquired business;

•

The discovery, after completion of the acquisition, of
    liabilities assumed from the acquired business or of assets
    acquired for which we cannot realize the anticipated value;

•

The failure to realize anticipated benefits such as cost savings
    and revenue enhancements;

•

The failure to retain key employees of the acquired business;

•

Difficulties related to integrating the products of an acquired
    business in, for example, distribution, engineering and customer
    support areas;

•

Unanticipated costs;

•

Customer dissatisfaction with existing license agreements with
    Cadence which may dissuade them from licensing or buying
    products acquired by Cadence after the effective date of the
    license; and

•

The failure to understand and compete effectively in markets in
    which we have limited experience.

In a number of our acquisitions, we have agreed to make future
payments, or earnouts, based on the performance of the
businesses we acquired. The performance goals pursuant to which
these future payments may be made generally relate to
achievement by the acquired business of certain specified
bookings, revenue, product proliferation, product development or
employee retention goals during a specified period following
completion of the applicable acquisition. Future acquisitions
may involve issuances of stock as payment of the purchase price
for the acquired business, grants of incentive stock or options
to employees of the acquired businesses (which may be dilutive
to existing stockholders), expenditure of substantial cash
resources or the incurrence of material amounts of debt.

The specific performance goal levels and amounts and timing of
contingent purchase price payments vary with each acquisition.
In 2005, we recorded $27.5 million of goodwill for achieved
earnouts payable to former stockholders of acquired companies.
The $27.5 million of earnouts consisted of
$23.5 million of cash payments made prior to
December 31, 2005, the issuance of 0.1 million shares
of Cadence’s common stock valued at $1.3 million and
$2.7 million accrued in Accounts payable and accrued
liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
December 31, 2005.

In connection with our acquisitions completed prior to
December 31, 2005, we may be obligated to pay up to an
aggregate of $27.0 million in cash during the next
12 months and an additional $7.0 million in cash in
periods after the next 12 months through September 2008 if
certain performance goals related to one or more of the
following criteria are achieved in full: revenue, bookings,
product proliferation, product development and employee
retention.



Our failure to attract, train, motivate and retain key
employees may make us less competitive in our industries

and therefore harm our
results of operations.

Our business depends on the efforts and abilities of our senior
management, our research and development staff, and a number of
other key management, sales, support, technical and services
employees. The high cost of training new employees, not fully
utilizing these employees, or losing trained employees to
competing employers could reduce our gross margins and harm our
business and operating results. Competition for highly skilled
employees can be intense, particularly in geographic areas
recognized as high technology centers such as the Silicon Valley
area, where our principal offices are located, and the other
locations where we maintain facilities. If economic conditions
continue to improve and job opportunities in the technology
industry become more plentiful, we may experience increased
employee attrition and increased competition for skilled
employees. To attract, retain and motivate individuals with the
requisite expertise, we may be required to grant large numbers
of stock options or other stock-based incentive awards, which
may be dilutive to existing stockholders. Our adoption of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS,
No. 123R, “Share-Based Payments,” during our
first quarter of 2006 will result in additional equity-based
compensation expense. We may also be required to pay key
employees significant base salaries and cash bonuses, which
could harm our operating results.

In addition, regulations adopted by NASDAQ require stockholder
approval for new equity compensation plans and significant
amendments to existing plans, including increases in shares
available for issuance under such plans, and prohibit NASDAQ
member organizations from giving a proxy to vote on equity
compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has
given voting instructions. These regulations could make it more
difficult for us to grant equity compensation to employees in
the future. To the extent that these regulations make it more
difficult or expensive to grant equity compensation to
employees, we may incur increased compensation costs or find it
difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, which could
materially and adversely affect our business.

The competition in our industries is substantial and we
cannot assure you that we will be able to continue

to successfully
compete in our industries.

The EDA market and the commercial electronics design and
methodology services industries are highly competitive. If we
fail to compete successfully in these industries, it could
seriously harm our business, operating results and financial
condition. To compete in these industries, we must identify and
develop or acquire innovative and cost competitive EDA products,
integrate them into platforms and market them in a timely
manner. We must also gain industry acceptance for our design and
methodology services and offer better strategic concepts,
technical solutions, prices and response time, or a combination
of these factors, than those of other design companies and the
internal design departments of electronics manufacturers. We
cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully
in these industries. Factors that could affect our ability to
succeed include:

•

The development by others of competitive EDA products or
    platforms and design and methodology services, which could
    result in a shift of customer preferences away from our products
    and services and significantly decrease revenue;

•

Decisions by electronics manufacturers to perform design and
    methodology services internally, rather than purchase these
    services from outside vendors due to budget constraints or
    excess engineering capacity;

•

The challenges of developing (or acquiring externally-developed)
    technology solutions which are adequate and competitive in
    meeting the requirements of next-generation design challenges;

•

The significant number of current and potential competitors in
    the EDA industry and the low cost of entry;

•

Intense competition to attract acquisition targets, which may
    make it more difficult for us to acquire companies or
    technologies at an acceptable price or at all; and

•

The combination of or collaboration among many EDA companies to
    deliver more comprehensive offerings than they could
    individually.



We compete in the EDA products market primarily with Synopsys,
Inc., Mentor Graphics Corporation and Magma Design Automation,
Inc. We also compete with numerous smaller EDA companies, with
manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed or have
the capability to develop their own EDA products, and with
numerous electronics design and consulting companies.
Manufacturers of electronic devices may be reluctant to purchase
design and methodology services from independent vendors such as
us because they wish to promote their own internal design
departments.

We may need to change our pricing models to compete
successfully.

The highly competitive markets in which we compete can put
pressure on us to reduce the prices of our products. If our
competitors offer deep discounts on certain products in an
effort to recapture or gain market segment share or to sell
other software or hardware products, we may then need to lower
our prices or offer other favorable terms to compete
successfully. Any such changes would be likely to reduce our
profit margins and could adversely affect our operating results.
Any broadly-based changes to our prices and pricing policies
could cause sales and software license revenues to decline or be
delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust
to the new pricing policies. Some of our competitors may bundle
products for promotional purposes or as a long-term pricing
strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product
implementations. These practices could, over time, significantly
constrain the prices that we can charge for our products. If we
cannot offset price reductions with a corresponding increase in
the number of sales or with lower spending, then the reduced
license revenues resulting from lower prices could have an
adverse effect on our results of operations.

We rely on our proprietary technology as well as software
and other intellectual property rights licensed to

us by third parties,
and we cannot assure you that the precautions taken to protect
our rights will be

adequate or that we
will continue to be able to adequately secure such intellectual
property rights from

third parties.

Our success depends, in part, upon our proprietary technology.
We generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade
secret laws, licenses and restrictive agreements to establish
and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products.
Despite precautions we may take to protect our intellectual
property, we cannot assure you that third parties will not try
to challenge, invalidate or circumvent these safeguards. We also
cannot assure you that the rights granted under our patents or
attendant to our other intellectual property will provide us
with any competitive advantages, or that patents will be issued
on any of our pending applications, or that future patents will
be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Furthermore,
the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary
rights in those countries to the same extent as applicable law
protects these rights in the United States. Many of our products
include software or other intellectual property licensed from
third parties. We may have to seek new or renew existing
licenses for such software and other intellectual property in
the future. Our design and methodology services business holds
licenses to certain software and other intellectual property
owned by third parties, including that of our competitors. Our
failure to obtain, for our use, software or other intellectual
property licenses or other intellectual property rights on
favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation over these
licenses or rights, could seriously harm our business, operating
results and financial condition.

We could lose key technology or suffer serious harm to our
business because of the infringement of our

intellectual property
rights by third parties or because of our infringement of the
intellectual property

rights of third
parties.

There are numerous patents in the EDA industry and new patents
are being issued at a rapid rate. It is not always practicable
to determine in advance whether a product or any of its
components infringes the patent rights of others. As a result,
from time to time, we may be compelled to respond to or
prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to protect
our rights or defend a customer’s rights. These claims,
regardless of merit, could consume valuable management time,
result in costly litigation, or cause product shipment delays,
all of which could seriously harm our business, operating
results and financial condition. In settling these claims, we
may be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements
with the third parties claiming



infringement. These royalty or licensing agreements, if
available, may not have terms favorable to us. Being compelled
to enter into a license agreement with unfavorable terms could
seriously harm our business, operating results and financial
condition. Any potential intellectual property litigation could
compel us to do one or more of the following:

•

Pay damages, license fees or royalties to the party claiming
    infringement;

•

Stop licensing products or providing services that use the
    challenged intellectual property;

•

Obtain a license from the owner of the infringed intellectual
    property to sell or use the relevant technology, which license
    may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all; or

•

Redesign the challenged technology, which could be
    time-consuming and costly, or not be accomplished.

If we were compelled to take any of these actions, our business
and results of operations may suffer.

If our security measures are breached and an unauthorized
party obtains access to customer data, our

information systems
may be perceived as being unsecure and customers may curtail
their use of, or stop

their use of, our
products and services.

Our products and services involve the storage and transmission
of customers’ proprietary information, and breaches of our
security measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of
this information, litigation and potential liability. Because
techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage
information systems change frequently and generally are not
recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to
anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive
measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security
occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our
security measures could be harmed and we could lose existing
customers and our ability to obtain new customers.

We may not be able to effectively implement our
restructuring activities, and our restructuring
activities

may not result in the
expected benefits, which would negatively impact our future
results of operations.

The EDA market and the commercial electronics design and
methodology services industries are highly competitive and
change quickly. We have responded to increased competition and
changes in the industries in which we compete, in part, by
restructuring our operations and reducing the size of our
workforce. Despite our restructuring efforts over the last few
years, we cannot assure you that we will achieve all of the
operating expense reductions and improvements in operating
margins and cash flows currently anticipated from these
restructuring activities in the periods contemplated, or at all.
Our inability to realize these benefits, and our failure to
appropriately structure our business to meet market conditions,
could negatively impact our results of operations.

As part of our recent restructuring activities, we have reduced
the workforce in certain revenue-generating portions of our
business. This reduction in staffing levels could require us to
forego certain future opportunities due to resource limitations,
which could negatively affect our long-term revenues.

In addition, these workforce reductions could result in a lack
of focus and reduced productivity by remaining employees due to
changes in responsibilities or concern about future prospects,
which in turn may negatively affect our future revenues.
Further, we believe our future success depends, in large part,
on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel.
Our restructuring activities could negatively affect our ability
to attract such personnel as a result of perceived risk of
future workforce reductions.

During fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, we implemented
a new plan of restructuring. We also cannot assure you that we
will not be required to implement further restructuring
activities or reductions in our workforce based on changes in
the markets and industries in which we compete or that any
future restructuring efforts will be successful.



The long sales cycle of our products and services makes
the timing of our revenue difficult to predict and

may cause our
operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly.

We have a long sales cycle that generally extends at least three
to six months. The length of the sales cycle may cause our
revenue and operating results to vary from quarter to quarter.
The complexity and expense associated with our business
generally requires a lengthy customer education, evaluation and
approval process. Consequently, we may incur substantial
expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to
develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements
or revenue and may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities.

In addition, sales of our products and services may be delayed
if customers delay approval or commencement of projects because
of:

•

The timing of customers’ competitive evaluation
    processes; or

•

Customers’ budgetary constraints and budget cycles.

Long sales cycles for acceleration and emulation hardware
products subject us to a number of significant risks over which
we have limited control, including insufficient, excess or
obsolete inventory, variations in inventory valuation and
fluctuations in quarterly operating results.

Also, because of the timing of large orders and our
customers’ buying patterns, we may not learn of bookings
shortfalls, revenue shortfalls, earnings shortfalls or other
failures to meet market expectations until late in a fiscal
quarter, which could cause even more immediate and serious harm
to the trading price of our common stock.

The effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and other
risks to our international operations may

seriously harm our
financial condition.

We have significant operations outside the United States. Our
revenue from international operations as a percentage of total
revenue was approximately 54% in 2005, 50% in 2004 and 44% in
2003. We expect that revenue from our international operations
will continue to account for a significant portion of our total
revenue. We also transact business in various foreign
currencies. Recent economic and political uncertainty and the
volatility of foreign currencies in certain regions, most
notably the Japanese yen, European Union euro and the British
pound, have had, and may in the future have, a harmful effect on
our revenue and operating results.

Fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the United States
dollar and the currencies of other countries in which we conduct
business could seriously harm our business, operating results
and financial condition. For example, if there is an increase in
the rate at which a foreign currency exchanges into
United States dollars, it will take more of the foreign
currency to equal the same amount of United States dollars than
before the rate increase. If we price our products and services
in the foreign currency, we will receive fewer United States
dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect.
If we price our products and services in United States dollars,
an increase in the exchange rate will result in an increase in
the price for our products and services compared to those
products of our competitors that are priced in local currency.
This could result in our prices being uncompetitive in markets
where business is transacted in the local currency.

Exposure to foreign currency transaction risk can arise when
transactions are conducted in a currency different from the
functional currency of one of our subsidiaries. A
subsidiary’s functional currency is generally the currency
in which it primarily conducts its operations, including product
pricing, expenses and borrowings. Although we attempt to reduce
the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, significant
exchange rate movements may hurt our results of operations as
expressed in United States dollars.

Our international operations may also be subject to other risks,
including:

•

The adoption or expansion of government trade restrictions;

•

Limitations on repatriation of earnings;

•

Limitations on the conversion of foreign currencies;

•

Reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some
    countries;



•

Recessions in foreign economies;

•

Longer collection periods for receivables and greater difficulty
    in collecting accounts receivable;

•

Difficulties in managing foreign operations;

•

Political and economic instability;

•

Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;

•

Tariffs and other trade barriers; and

•

United States government licensing requirements for exports,
    which may lengthen the sales cycle or restrict or prohibit the
    sale or licensing of certain products.

We have offices throughout the world, including key research
facilities outside of the United States. Our operations are
dependent upon the connectivity of our operations throughout the
world. Activities that interfere with our international
connectivity, such as computer “hacking” or the
introduction of a virus into our computer systems, could
significantly interfere with our business operations.

Our operating results could be adversely affected as a
result of changes in our effective tax rates.

Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by
the following:

•

Earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we are
    taxed at lower rates as compared to the United States statutory
    tax rate;

•

An increase in expenses not deductible for tax purposes,
    including certain stock compensation, write-offs of acquired
    in-process research and development and impairment of goodwill;

•

Changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and
    liabilities;

•

Changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws;

•

New accounting standards or interpretations of such
    standards; or

•

A change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest foreign
    earnings.

Any significant change in our future effective tax rates could
adversely impact our results of operations for future periods.

We have received an examination report from the Internal
Revenue Service proposing a tax deficiency in

certain of our tax
returns, and the outcome of current and future tax examinations
may have a material

adverse effect on our
results of operations and cash flows.

The Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, and other tax authorities
regularly examine our income tax returns. In November 2003, the
IRS completed its field examination of our federal income tax
returns for the tax years 1997 through 1999 and issued a Revenue
Agent’s Report, or RAR, in which the IRS proposes to assess
an aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year period of
approximately $143.0 million, plus interest, which interest
will accrue until the matter is resolved. This interest is
compounded daily at rates published by the IRS, which rates are
adjusted quarterly and have been between four and nine percent
since 1997. The RAR is not a final Statutory Notice of
Deficiency, and we have filed a protest to certain of the
proposed adjustments with the Appeals Office of the IRS where
the matter is currently being considered. The IRS may also make
similar claims for years subsequent to 1999.

The most significant of the disputed adjustments relates to
transfer pricing arrangements that we have with a foreign
subsidiary. We believe that the proposed IRS adjustments are
inconsistent with the applicable tax laws, and that we have
meritorious defenses to the proposed adjustments. We are
challenging these proposed adjustments vigorously.

The IRS is currently examining our federal income tax returns
for tax years 2000 through 2002 and may challenge the tax
reported on these tax returns.

Significant judgment is required in determining our provision
for income taxes. The calculation of our tax liabilities
involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of
complex tax regulations. In determining the adequacy of our
provision for income taxes, we regularly assess the likelihood
of adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations, including
the current IRS examination and the IRS RAR for the tax years
1997 through 1999. We provide for tax liabilities on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets unless we consider it probable



that additional taxes will not be due. However, the ultimate
outcome of tax examinations cannot be predicted with certainty,
including the total amount payable or the timing of any such
payments upon resolution of these issues. In addition, we cannot
assure you that such amount will not be materially different
than that which is reflected in our historical income tax
provisions and accruals. Should the IRS or other tax authorities
assess additional taxes as a result of a current or a future
examination, we may be required to record charges to operations
in future periods that could have a material impact on the
results of operations, financial position or cash flows in the
applicable period or periods recorded.

Forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is
complex and subject to uncertainty, and material

differences between
forecasted and actual tax rates could have a material impact on
our results of

operations.

Forecasts of our income tax position and resultant effective tax
rate are complex and subject to uncertainty because our income
tax position for each year combines the effects of a mix of
profits and losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in tax
jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as
benefits from available deferred tax assets and costs resulting
from tax audits. To forecast our global tax rate, pre-tax
profits and losses by jurisdiction are estimated and tax expense
by jurisdiction is calculated. If the mix of profits and losses,
our ability to use tax credits, or effective tax rates by
jurisdiction is different than those estimates, our actual tax
rate could be materially different than forecasted, which could
have a material impact on our results of operations.

Failure to obtain export licenses could harm our business
by rendering us unable to ship products and transfer

our technology outside
of the United States.

We must comply with United States Department of Commerce
regulations in shipping our software products and transferring
our technology outside the United States and to foreign
nationals. Although we have not had any significant difficulty
complying with these regulations so far, any significant future
difficulty in complying with such regulations could harm our
business, operating results and financial condition.

Errors or defects in our products and services could
expose us to liability and harm our reputation.

Our customers use our products and services in designing and
developing products that involve a high degree of technological
complexity, each of which has its own specifications. Because of
the complexity of the systems and products with which we work,
some of our products and designs can be adequately tested only
when put to full use in the marketplace. As a result, our
customers or their end users may discover errors or defects in
our software or the systems we design, or the products or
systems incorporating our design and intellectual property may
not operate as expected. Errors or defects could result in:

•

Loss of current customers;

•

Loss of or delay in revenue;

•

Loss of market segment share;

•

Failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance;

•

Diversion of development resources to resolve the problem;

•

Increased service costs; and

•

Liability for damages.

New accounting standards related to equity compensation
will cause us to recognize additional expense.

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or
FASB, issued SFAS No. 123R, which requires the measurement
of all share-based payments to employees, including grants of
employee stock options, using a fair-value-based method and the
recording of such expense in our Consolidated Statements of
Operations. We are required to adopt SFAS No. 123R in
our first quarter of fiscal 2006. We expect the adoption of
SFAS No. 123R to have a significant adverse effect on
our Consolidated Statements of Operations, net income (loss) per
share and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.



If we become subject to unfair hiring claims, we could be
prevented from hiring needed employees, incur

liability for damages
and incur substantial costs in defending ourselves.

Companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with
competitors frequently claim that these competitors have engaged
in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these
persons would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets.
These claims could prevent us from hiring employees or cause us
to incur liability for damages. We could also incur substantial
costs in defending ourselves or our employees against these
claims, regardless of their merits. Defending ourselves from
these claims could also divert the attention of our management
away from our operations.

Our business is subject to the risk of earthquakes, floods
and other natural catastrophic events.

Our corporate headquarters, including certain of our research
and development operations and certain of our distribution
facilities, are located in the Silicon Valley area of Northern
California, which is a region known to experience seismic
activity. In addition, several of our facilities, including our
corporate headquarters, certain of our research and development
operations, and certain of our distribution operations, are in
areas of San Jose, California that have been identified by
the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or
FEMA, as being located in a special flood area. The areas at
risk are identified as being in a one hundred year flood plain,
using FEMA’s Flood Hazard Boundary Map or the Flood
Insurance Rate Map. If significant seismic or flooding activity
were to occur, our operations may be interrupted, which would
adversely impact our business and results of operations.

We maintain research and other facilities in parts of the
world that are not as politically stable as the

United States, and as
a result we may face a higher risk of business interruption from
acts of war or

terrorism than
businesses located only or primarily in the United
States.

We maintain international research and other facilities, some of
which are in parts of the world that are not as politically
stable as the United States. Consequently, we may face a greater
risk of business interruption as a result of terrorist acts or
military conflicts than businesses located domestically.
Furthermore, this potential harm is exacerbated given that
damage to or disruptions at our international research and
development facilities could have an adverse effect on our
ability to develop new or improve existing products as compared
to other businesses which may only have sales offices or other
less critical operations abroad. We are not insured for losses
or interruptions caused by acts of war or terrorism.

Risks
Related to Our Securities and Our Debt Obligations

Our debt obligations expose us to risks that could
adversely affect our business, operating results and
financial

condition, and could
prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such
indebtedness.

We have a substantial level of debt. As of December 31,
2005, we had $420.0 million of outstanding indebtedness
from our Zero Coupon Zero Yield Senior Convertible Notes due
2023, or the Notes, that we issued in August 2003, and a
$160.0 million term loan borrowed by a wholly-owned Irish
subsidiary and guaranteed by Cadence. The level of our
indebtedness, among other things, could:

•

make it difficult for us to satisfy our payment obligations on
    our debt as described below;

•

make it difficult for us to incur additional debt or obtain any
    necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital
    expenditures, debt service, acquisitions or general corporate
    purposes;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in
    our business;

•

reduce funds available for use in our operations;

•

make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our
    business;

•

make us more vulnerable in the event of an increase in interest
    rates if we must incur new debt to satisfy our obligations under
    the Notes; or

•

place us at a possible competitive disadvantage relative to less
    leveraged competitors and competitors that have greater access
    to capital resources.



If we experience a decline in revenue due to any of the factors
described in this Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” or
otherwise, we could have difficulty paying amounts due on our
indebtedness. In the case of the Notes, although the Notes
mature in 2023, the holders of the Notes may require us to
repurchase their notes at an additional premium of 0.25% in
2008, which makes it probable that we will be required to
repurchase the Notes in 2008 if the Notes are not otherwise
converted into our common stock. If we are unable to generate
sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make
required payments, or if we fail to comply with the various
requirements of our indebtedness, including the Notes and the
term loan, we would be in default, which would permit the
holders of our indebtedness to accelerate the maturity of the
indebtedness and could cause defaults under our other
indebtedness. Any default under our indebtedness could have a
material adverse effect on our business, operating results and
financial condition.

The terms of the Notes do not prohibit us from incurring
additional debt. In addition, our outstanding indebtedness under
the Notes does not restrict our ability to pay dividends, issue
or repurchase stock or other securities or require us to achieve
or maintain any minimum financial results relating to our
financial position or results of operations. Although the Notes
do not contain such financial and other restrictive covenants,
the documents governing the term loan do include such covenants,
including certain restrictions on the incurrence of additional
indebtedness and liens, disposition of assets, payment of cash
dividends by us to our stockholders and our ability to engage in
certain corporate transactions. We are also required to maintain
certain minimum interest coverage and leverage ratios. Under the
term loan, we are required to repay the principal amount thereof
over a three year period. See “Other Factors Affecting
Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7 below. If
we incur additional indebtedness or other liabilities, our
ability to pay our obligations on our outstanding indebtedness
could be adversely affected.

We may be unable to adequately service our indebtedness,
which may result in defaults and other costs to us.

We may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for
additional financing to pay the outstanding obligations due on
our indebtedness. Any future borrowing arrangements or debt
agreements to which we become a party may contain additional
restrictions on or prohibitions against our repayment on our
outstanding indebtedness, or otherwise have the effect of making
it more difficult to repay our existing outstanding
indebtedness. With respect to the Notes, at maturity, the entire
outstanding principal amount of the Notes will become due and
payable. Holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or
any portion of the Notes on August 15, 2008 for 100.25% of
the principal amount, August 15, 2013 for 100.00% of the
principal amount and August 15, 2018 for 100.00% of the
principal amount. As a result, although the Notes mature in
2023, the holders may require us to repurchase the Notes at an
additional premium in 2008, which makes it probable that we will
be required to repurchase the Notes in 2008 if the Notes are not
otherwise converted into our common stock. If we are prohibited
from paying our outstanding indebtedness, we could try to obtain
the consent of lenders under those arrangements, or we could
attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain the
restrictions. If we do not obtain the necessary consents or
refinance the borrowings, we may be unable to satisfy our
outstanding indebtedness. Any such failure would constitute an
event of default under our indebtedness, which could, in turn,
constitute a default under the terms of any other indebtedness
then outstanding.

In addition, a material default on our indebtedness could
suspend our eligibility to register securities using certain
registration statement forms under SEC guidelines which permit
incorporation by reference of substantial information regarding
us, which could potentially hinder our ability to raise capital
through the issuance of our securities and will increase the
costs of such registration to us.

Conversion of the Notes will dilute the ownership
interests of existing stockholders.

The terms of the Notes permit the holders to convert the Notes
into shares of our common stock. The Notes are convertible into
our common stock initially at a conversion price of
$15.65 per share, which would result in an aggregate of
approximately 26.8 million shares of our common stock being
issued upon conversion, subject to adjustment upon the
occurrence of specified events. The conversion of some or all of
the Notes will dilute the ownership interest of our existing
stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the common stock
issuable upon conversion could adversely affect prevailing
market prices of our common stock. Prior to the



conversion of the Notes, if the trading price of our common
stock exceeds the conversion price of the Notes by 145.00% or
more over specified periods, basic earnings per share will be
diluted if and to the extent the convertible notes hedge
instruments are not exercised. The holders of the Notes may
require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their
Notes on August 15, 2008 for 100.25% of the principal
amount, on August 15, 2013 for 100.00% of the principal
amount or on August 15, 2018 for 100.00% of the principal
amount, by providing to the paying agent a written repurchase
notice. The repurchase notice must be delivered during the
period commencing 30 business days prior to the relevant
repurchase date and ending on the close of business on the
business day prior to the relevant repurchase date. We may
redeem for cash all or any part of the Notes on or after
August 15, 2008 for 100.00% of the principal amount, except
for those Notes that holders have required us to repurchase on
August 15, 2008 or on other repurchase dates, as described
above.

Each $1,000 of principal of the Notes is initially convertible
into 63.879 shares of our common stock, subject to
adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders of
the Notes may convert their Notes prior to maturity only if:
(1) the price of our common stock reaches $22.69 during
certain periods of time specified in the Notes,
(2) specified corporate transactions occur, (3) the
Notes have been called for redemption or (4) the trading
price of the Notes falls below a certain threshold. As a result,
although the Notes mature in 2023, the holders may require us to
repurchase their notes at an additional premium in 2008, which
makes it probable that we will be required to repurchase the
Notes in 2008 if the Notes are not otherwise converted into our
common stock. As of December 31, 2005, none of the
conditions allowing holders of the Notes to convert had been met.

Although the conversion price is currently $15.65 per
share, the convertible notes hedge and warrant transactions that
we entered into in connection with the issuance of the Notes
effectively increased the conversion price of the Notes until
2008 to approximately $23.08 per share, which would result
in an aggregate issuance upon conversion prior to
August 15, 2008 of approximately 18.2 million shares
of our common stock. We have entered into convertible notes
hedge and warrant transactions to reduce the potential dilution
from the conversion of the Notes; however, we cannot guarantee
that such convertible notes hedge and warrant instruments will
fully mitigate the dilution. In addition, the existence of the
Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because
the conversion of the Notes could depress the price of our
common stock.

We may, at the option of the Noteholders and only in
certain circumstances, be required to repurchase the

Notes in cash or
shares of our common stock.

Under the terms of the Notes, we may be required to repurchase
the Notes following a significant change in our corporate
ownership or structure, such as a change of control, prior to
maturity of the Notes. Following a significant change in our
corporate ownership or structure, in certain circumstances, we
may choose to pay the repurchase price of the Notes in cash,
shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares
of our common stock. If we choose to pay all or any part of the
repurchase price of the Notes in shares of our common stock,
this would result in dilution to the holders of our common stock.

Convertible notes hedge and warrant transactions entered
into in connection with the issuance of the

Notes may affect the
value of our common stock.

We entered into convertible notes hedge transactions with JP
Morgan Chase Bank, an affiliate of one of the initial purchasers
of the Notes, at the time of issuance of the Notes, with the
objective of reducing the potential dilutive effect of issuing
our common stock upon conversion of the Notes. We also entered
into warrant transactions. In connection with our convertible
notes hedge and warrant transactions, JP Morgan Chase Bank or
its affiliates purchased our common stock in secondary market
transactions and entered into various

over-the

-counter
derivative transactions with respect to our common stock. This
entity or its affiliates is likely to modify its hedge positions
from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the Notes
by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock, other of
our securities or other instruments it may wish to use in
connection with such hedging. Any of these transactions and
activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock
and, as a result, the number of shares and the value of the
common stock holders will receive upon conversion of the Notes.
In addition, subject to movement in the price of our common
stock, if



the convertible notes hedge transactions settle in our favor, we
could be exposed to credit risk related to the other party.

Rating agencies may provide unsolicited ratings on the
Notes that could reduce the market value or

liquidity of our
common stock.

We have not requested a rating of the Notes from any rating
agency and we do not anticipate that the Notes will be rated.
However, if one or more rating agencies independently elects to
rate the Notes and assigns the Notes a rating lower than the
rating expected by investors, or reduces such rating in the
future, the market price or liquidity of the Notes and our
common stock could be harmed. A resulting decline in the market
price of the Notes as compared to the price of our common stock
may require us to repurchase the Notes.

Anti-takeover defenses in our governing documents and
certain provisions under Delaware law could

prevent an acquisition
of our company or limit the price that investors might be
willing to pay for our

common stock.

Our governing documents and certain provisions of the Delaware
General Corporation Law could make it difficult for another
company to acquire control of our company. For example:

•

Our certificate of incorporation allows our Board of Directors
    to issue, at any time and without stockholder approval,
    preferred stock with such terms as it may determine. No shares
    of preferred stock are currently outstanding. However, the
    rights of holders of any of our preferred stock that may be
    issued in the future may be superior to the rights of holders of
    our common stock.

•

Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law
    generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any
    business combination with a person owning 15% or more of its
    voting stock, or who is affiliated with the corporation and
    owned 15% or more of its voting stock at any time within three
    years prior to the proposed business combination, for a period
    of three years from the date the person became a 15% owner,
    unless specified conditions are met.

All or any one of these factors could limit the price that
certain investors would be willing to pay for shares of our
common stock and could delay, prevent or allow our Board of
Directors to resist an acquisition of our company, even if the
proposed transaction were favored by a majority of our
independent stockholders.

Item 2.

Properties

Our headquarters are located in San Jose, California, and
we own the related land and buildings. We also own buildings in
India. The total square footage of our owned buildings is
approximately 925,000.

During 2005, we entered into a definitive sale-leaseback
agreement involving certain land and buildings in San Jose,
California. The agreement stipulates that we and the purchaser
must receive certain approvals from local municipalities prior
to June 30, 2006. If these conditions are met or waived by
both us and the purchaser prior to June 30, 2006, we would
complete the sale of the buildings and lease the buildings from
the purchaser for two years, with an option to extend the lease
for an additional six months.

We lease additional facilities for our sales offices in the
United States and various foreign countries, and for our
research and development and design and methodology services
facilities worldwide. We sublease certain of these facilities
where space is not fully utilized or has been involved in
restructuring activities.

We believe that these facilities and the undeveloped land we own
adjacent to our current headquarters are adequate for our
current needs and that suitable additional or substitute space
will be available as needed to accommodate any expansion of our
operations.



Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

From time to time, we are involved in various disputes and
litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of
business. These include disputes and lawsuits related to
intellectual property, mergers and acquisitions, licensing,
contract law, distribution arrangements and employee relations
matters. Periodically, we review the status of each significant
matter and assess its potential financial exposure. If the
potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered
probable and the amount or the range of loss can be estimated,
we accrue a liability for the estimated loss in accordance with
SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies.”
Legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties, and the outcomes
are difficult to predict. Because of such uncertainties,
accruals are based only on the best information available at the
time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess
the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation
matters and may revise estimates.

While the outcome of these disputes and litigation matters
cannot be predicted with any certainty, management does not
believe that the outcome of any current matters will have a
material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position
or results of operations.

Overview

General

We develop electronic design automation, or EDA, software, and
intellectual property. We license software, sell or license
intellectual property, sell or lease hardware technology and
provide design and methodology services throughout the world to
help manage and accelerate electronics product development
processes. Our broad range of products and services are used by
the world’s leading electronics companies to design and
develop complex integrated circuits, or ICs, and personal and
commercial electronics systems.

During the last decade, the communications, business
productivity and consumer electronics markets accounted for much
of the growth in the electronics industry. Ever-decreasing
silicon manufacturing process geometries, coupled with the move
to 300 millimeter wafer production, are causing IC unit cost
decreases. This has enabled die-per-wafer volume efficiencies
and increased complexity for manufacturers of electronic
devices. At the same time, the development of ICs with greater
functionality makes it more difficult to effectively integrate
these components into complete electronics systems. These market
and technology forces create major challenges for the global
electronics design community, while simultaneously offering
significant opportunities for providers of EDA products and
services. In response to these opportunities, we have initiated
significant restructuring activities over the past several
years, including during the year ended December 31, 2005,
to better align our cost structure with projected demand for our
products and services.

We have identified certain items that management uses as
performance indicators to manage our business, including
revenue, certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow
from operations, and we describe these items more fully in the
“Results of Operations” below.

Acquisitions

We have acquired companies, businesses and technology, some of
which are described below, and we expect to acquire other
companies, businesses and technology in the future. We undertake
these acquisitions as part of our overall business strategy, and
specifically, to acquire key personnel, technology and customer
relationships of the acquired business. For each of these
acquisitions the results of operations and the estimated fair
value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been
included in our Consolidated Financial Statements from the date
of the acquisition. These acquisitions are described in more
detail below and in Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements.



Comparative pro forma financial information was not presented
for the acquisitions completed in 2005, 2004 or 2003 because
these acquisitions were not material to our Consolidated
Financial Statements, either individually or in the aggregate.

A summary of certain information regarding acquisitions, all of
which were for cash, we completed in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
including the aggregate initial purchase price paid, is as
follows:

The businesses or assets acquired include:

(A)

Verification process automation solutions.

(B)

Rapid analog design technology.

(C)

Functional verification technology.

(D)

Distribution rights to certain customers, certain assets and key
    personnel of this Japan-based developer and distributor of
    software, electronic devices and semiconductor manufacturing
    equipment.

(E)

Nanometer-scale synthesis.

(F)

Silicon modeling products and full-chip circuit simulation.

The purchase prices of our acquisitions generally consist of one
or more of the following: cash payments, shares of our common
stock, the fair value of assumed options, if any, and
acquisition costs. The purchase price and goodwill associated
with certain business acquisitions will be greater than the
initial purchase price paid if certain performance goals are
achieved, generally over a period of up to four years following
the completion of the respective acquisition, related to one or
more of the following: revenue, bookings, product proliferation,
product development and employee retention.

Concurrent with our acquisition of certain Innotech assets, we
also modified our distributor agreement with Innotech. Prior to
this acquisition, we licensed most of our software products in
Japan through Innotech. We now directly license our software
products to the customers for which we acquired the distribution
rights from Innotech. As of December 31, 2005, we were an
approximately 7% stockholder of Innotech.

Acquisition-Related
Earnouts

For many of our acquisitions of private companies, a portion of
the purchase price is payable only after the acquired business
group’s achievement of certain performance goals, which
generally relate to one or more of the following: revenue,
bookings, product proliferation, product development and
employee retention. The specific performance goal levels and
amounts and timing of contingent purchase price payments vary
with each acquisition. In connection with some acquisitions, we
may grant equity awards with either time-based or
performance-based vesting, or a combination of both, to
employees of the acquired business as performance incentives. As
a result, the amount of cash consideration or shares of our
common stock issued to former stockholders of the acquired
entity will increase as the performance goals are achieved,
generally over a period



of up to four years following the completion of the respective
acquisition. Accordingly, goodwill and stock compensation
expense will increase upon the attainment of such goals.

In connection with our acquisitions completed prior to
December 31, 2005, we may be obligated to pay up to an
aggregate of $27.0 million in cash during the next
12 months and an additional $7.0 million in cash in
periods after the next 12 months through September 2008 if
certain performance goals related to one or more of the
following criteria are achieved in full: revenue, bookings,
product proliferation, product development and employee
retention.

The goodwill recorded in connection with the below-described
contingent earnouts for acquisitions is not expected to be
deductible for income tax purposes.

2005 Earnouts

During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded
$27.5 million of goodwill for achieved earnouts payable to
former stockholders of acquired companies. The
$27.5 million of earnouts consisted of $23.5 million
of cash payments made prior to December 31, 2005, the
issuance of 0.1 million shares of our common stock valued
at $1.3 million and $2.7 million accrued in Accounts
payable and accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet as of December 31, 2005.

2004 Earnouts

During 2004, we recorded $40.6 million of goodwill as
contingent purchase price payable to stockholders of acquired
companies. The $40.6 million of goodwill consisted of
$17.0 million of actual cash payments, $7.2 million of
accrued payments and the issuance of 1.1 million shares of
our common stock valued at $16.4 million. In addition, we
recognized stock compensation expense of $1.2 million in
connection with these acquisitions in accordance with FASB
Interpretation No. 44, “Accounting for Certain
Transactions Involving Stock Compensation (an Interpretation of
APB No. 25).”

2003 Earnouts

During 2003, we paid $2.4 million in cash and issued or
reserved for issuance an additional 3.7 million shares of
our common stock valued at $57.7 million related to
acquisition earnouts. We recorded $52.3 million in
additional goodwill consisting of $2.4 million in cash and
$49.9 million representing the issuance or reserve for
issuance of 3.2 million shares. We also recorded additional
stock compensation expense of $7.8 million representing the
issuance or reserve for issuance of 0.4 million shares for
earnouts achieved during 2003. In addition, we recorded
$0.5 million in deferred stock compensation for estimated
future earnouts in accordance with FASB Interpretation
No. 28, “Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and
Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans.”

Legal Settlements

In September 2003, we entered into a settlement with Mentor
Graphics Corporation, pursuant to which Cadence, Mentor and
their respective affiliated parties settled all outstanding
litigation between the companies and such affiliated parties
relating to emulation and acceleration systems. The companies
also agreed that, for a period of seven years, neither will sue
the other over patented emulation and acceleration technology.
Mentor also paid us $18.0 million in cash as part of the
settlement. Net of related legal costs, we recorded a gain of
$14.5 million during the year ended January 3, 2004
for the settlement.

Critical Accounting
Estimates

In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we make
assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant
impact on our revenue, operating income (loss) and net income
(loss), as well as on the value of certain assets and
liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We base our
assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience
and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under
the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from
these estimates under different



assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our
assumptions, judgments and estimates and make changes
accordingly. We believe that the assumptions, judgments and
estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition,
accounting for income taxes, valuation of long-lived and
intangible assets, restructuring charges and valuation of
stock-based awards have the greatest potential impact on our
Consolidated Financial Statements; therefore, we consider these
to be our critical accounting estimates. Historically, our
assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical
accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual
results. For further information on our significant accounting
policies, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Revenue recognition

We apply the provisions of Statement of Position, or SOP, 97-2,
“Software Revenue Recognition,” as amended by SOP 98-9
“Modification of
SOP

97-2,

Software
Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions,”
to all product revenue transactions where the software is not
incidental. We also apply the provisions of SFAS No. 13,
“Accounting for Leases,” to all hardware lease
transactions. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of
an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the fee
is fixed or determinable, collection of the resulting receivable
is probable, and vendor-specific objective evidence of fair
value, or VSOE, exists.

We license software using three different license types:

•

Subscription licenses

— software licensed for a
    specific time period, generally two to three years, with no
    rights to return and limited rights to exchange the licensed
    software for unspecified technology in the future. In general,
    revenue associated with subscription licenses is recognized
    ratably over the term of the license commencing upon the later
    of the effective date of the license or delivery of the licensed
    product.

•

Term licenses

— software licensed for a
    specific time period, generally two to three years, with no
    rights to return and, generally, limited rights to exchange the
    licensed software for technology available at the time of
    purchase. In general, revenue associated with term licenses is
    recognized upon the later of the effective date of the license
    or delivery of the licensed product.

•

Perpetual licenses

— software licensed on a
    perpetual basis with no right to return or exchange the licensed
    software. In general, revenue associated with perpetual licenses
    is recognized upon the later of the effective date of the
    license or delivery of the licensed product.

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement

—
Generally, we use the customer signed contract as evidence of an
arrangement for subscription and term licenses and hardware
leases. If a customer signed contract does not exist, we have
historically used a purchase order as evidence of an arrangement
for perpetual licenses, hardware sales, maintenance renewals and
small fixed-price service projects, such as training classes and
small methodology service engagements of approximately $10,000
or less. For all other service engagements, we use a signed
professional services agreement and a statement of work to
evidence an arrangement. In cases where both a signed contract
and a purchase order exist, we consider the signed contract to
be the most persuasive evidence of the arrangement. Sales
through our distributors are evidenced by a master agreement
governing the relationship, together with binding purchase
orders from the distributor on a transaction-by-transaction
basis.

Product delivery

— Software and the
corresponding access keys are generally delivered to customers
electronically. Electronic delivery occurs when we provide the
customer access to the software. Occasionally, we will deliver
the software on a compact disc with standard transfer terms of

free-on

-board, or
F.O.B., shipping point. Our software license agreements
generally do not contain conditions for acceptance. With respect
to hardware, delivery of an entire system is deemed to occur
upon its successful installation. For certain hardware products,
installation is the responsibility of the customer, as the
system is fully functional at the time of shipment. For these
products, delivery is deemed to be complete when the products
are shipped with freight terms of F.O.B. shipping point.



Fee is fixed or determinable

— We assess
whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the
arrangement, primarily based on the payment terms associated
with the transaction. We have established a history of
collecting under the original contract without providing
concessions on payments, products or services. For our
installment contracts that do not include a substantial up front
payment, we may only determine that a fee is fixed or
determinable if the arrangement has payment periods that are
equal to or less than the term of the licenses and the payments
are collected in equal or nearly equal installments, when
evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement.

Significant judgment is involved in assessing whether a fee is
fixed or determinable, including assessing whether a contract
amendment to a term arrangement constitutes a concession. Our
experience has been that we are able to determine whether a fee
is fixed or determinable for term licenses. While we do not
expect that experience to change, if we no longer were to have a
history of collecting under the original contract without
providing concessions on term licenses, revenue from term
licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under
the installment contract become due and payable. Such a change
could have a material impact on our results of operations.

Collection is probable

— We have concluded that
collection is not probable for license arrangements executed
with customers in certain countries. For all other countries, we
assess the probability of collecting from each customer at the
outset of the arrangement based on a number of factors,
including the customer’s payment history and its current
creditworthiness. If in our judgment collection of a fee is not
probable, we defer the revenue until the uncertainty is removed,
which generally means revenue is recognized upon our receipt of
cash payment. Our experience has been that we are able to
estimate whether collection is probable. While we do not expect
that experience to change, if we were to determine that
collection is not probable for any license arrangement,
particularly those with installment payment terms, revenue from
such license would be recognized generally upon the receipt of
cash payment. Such a change could have a material impact on our
results of operations.

Vendor-specific objective evidence of fair
value

— Our VSOE for certain product elements of
an arrangement is based upon the pricing in comparable
transactions when the element is sold separately. VSOE for
maintenance is generally based upon the customer’s stated
annual renewal rates. VSOE for services is generally based on
the price charged when the services are sold separately. For
multiple element arrangements, VSOE must exist to allocate the
total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of the
arrangement. If VSOE does not exist for all elements to support
the allocation of the total fee among all delivered and
undelivered elements of the arrangement, revenue is deferred
until such evidence does exist for the undelivered elements, or
until all elements are delivered, whichever is earlier. If VSOE
of all undelivered elements exists but VSOE does not exist for
one or more delivered elements, revenue is recognized using the
residual method. Under the residual method, the VSOE of the
undelivered elements is deferred, and the remaining portion of
the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue as the elements are
delivered. Our experience has been that we are able to estimate
VSOE. While we do not expect that experience to change, if we
could no longer support VSOE for undelivered elements of
multiple element arrangements, revenue would be deferred until
we have VSOE for the undelivered elements or all elements are
delivered, whichever is earlier. Such a change could have a
material impact on our results of operations.

Finance fee revenue

— Finance fees result from
discounting to present value the product revenue derived from
our installment contracts in which the payment terms extend
beyond one year from the effective date of the contract. Finance
fees are recognized using a method that approximates the
effective interest method over the relevant license term and are
classified as product revenue. Finance fee revenue represented
2% of total revenue for each of the years ended
December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005 and 1% of total
revenue for the year ended January 3, 2004. Upon the sale
of an installment contract, we recognize the remaining finance
fee revenue associated with the installment contract.

Services revenue

— Services revenue consists
primarily of revenue received for performing design and
methodology services. These services are not related to the
functionality of the products licensed. Revenue from service
contracts is recognized either on the time and materials method,
as work is performed, or on the

percentage-of

-completion
method. For contracts with fixed or

not-to

-exceed fees, we
estimate on a monthly



basis the

percentage-of

-completion,
which is based on the completion of milestones relating to the
arrangement. We have a history of accurately estimating project
status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of
internal and external factors can affect our estimates,
including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and
specification and testing requirement changes. If different
conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could
not be made, then the use of the completed contract method would
be required and the recognition of all revenue and costs would
be deferred until the project was completed. Such a change could
have a material impact on our results of operations.

Accounting for income taxes

We provide for the effect of income taxes in our Consolidated
Financial Statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
“Accounting for Income Taxes.” Under
SFAS No. 109, income tax expense (benefit) is
recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the
current year, and for deferred tax assets and liabilities for
the tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an
entity’s financial statements or tax returns.

We must make significant assumptions, judgments and estimates to
determine our current provision for income taxes, our deferred
tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be
recorded against our deferred tax assets. Our judgments,
assumptions and estimates relating to the current provision for
income taxes take into account current tax laws, our
interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of
current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax
authorities. Changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax
laws and developments in current and future tax audits could
significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in
our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Our
assumptions, judgments and estimates relating to the value of
our net deferred tax assets take into account predictions of the
amount and category of future taxable income from potential
sources including tax planning strategies that would, if
necessary, be implemented to prevent a loss carryforward or tax
credit carryforward from expiring unused. Actual operating
results and the underlying amount and category of income in
future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and
estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate, thus
materially affecting our results of operations and financial
position.

See the factors affecting future results above in Item 1A,
“Risk Factors,” entitled

“Our operating
results could be adversely affected as a result of changes in
our effective tax rates,” “We have received an
examination report from the Internal Revenue Service proposing a
tax deficiency in certain of our tax returns, and the outcome of
current and future tax examinations may have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations and cash flows”

and

“Forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is
complex and subject to uncertainty, and material differences
between forecasted and actual tax rates could have a material
impact on our results of operations.”

Valuation of long-lived and intangible assets

We review long-lived assets, including certain identifiable
intangibles, for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the
asset’s carrying amount in accordance with
SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.”

For long-lived assets to be held and used, including acquired
intangibles, we initiate our review whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a
long-lived asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of an
asset is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the
expected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from
the use and eventual disposition of that asset, excluding future
interest costs that would be recognized as an expense when
incurred. Any impairment to be recognized is measured by the
amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its
fair market value. Significant management judgment is required
in:

•

identifying a triggering event that arises from a change in
    circumstances;

•

forecasting future operating results; and

•

estimating the proceeds from the disposition of long-lived or
    intangible assets.



In future periods, material impairment charges could be
necessary should different conditions prevail or different
judgments be made.

Restructuring charges

We account for restructuring charges in accordance with SEC
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100, “Restructuring
and Impairment Charges,” as amended. Since fiscal 2001, we
have undertaken significant restructuring initiatives. All
restructuring activities initiated prior to fiscal 2003 were
accounted for in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force, or
EITF, No. 94-3, “Liability Recognition for Certain
Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an
Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring)” and EITF No. 88-10, “Costs
Associated with Lease Modifications or Terminations.” For
restructuring activities initiated after fiscal 2002, we
accounted for the leased facilities in accordance with
SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities.” In addition, for all
periods presented, we accounted for the asset-related portions
of these restructurings in accordance with
SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” For all periods presented,
the severance and benefits charges were accounted for in
accordance with SFAS No. 112, “Employers’
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits — An Amendment
of FASB Statements No. 5 and 43.”

These restructuring initiatives have required us to make a
number of estimates and assumptions related to losses on excess
facilities vacated or consolidated, particularly estimating
when, if at all, we will be able to sublet vacated facilities
and, if we do, the sublease terms. Closure and space reduction
costs that are part of our restructuring charges include
payments required under leases, less any applicable estimated
sublease income after the facilities are abandoned, lease buyout
costs and certain contractual costs to maintain facilities
during the abandonment period.

In addition, we have recorded estimated provisions for
termination benefits and outplacement costs and other
restructuring costs. We regularly evaluate the adequacy of our
restructuring accrual, and adjust the balance based on changes
in estimates and assumptions. We may incur future charges for
new restructuring activities as well as changes in estimates to
amounts previously recorded.

Valuation of stock-based awards

Beginning in the first quarter of 2006, we will account for
stock-based compensation in accordance with the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R. Under
SFAS No. 123R, stock-based compensation cost is
measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and
is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining
the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires
judgment, including estimating the expected term of stock
options, the expected volatility of our stock and expected
dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating
the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be
forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these
estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of
operations could be materially affected.

Results of Operations

We primarily generate revenue from licensing our EDA software,
selling or leasing our hardware technology, selling or licensing
our intellectual property, providing maintenance for our
software and hardware and providing design and methodology
services. We principally utilize three license types:
subscription, term and perpetual. The different license types
provide a customer with different terms of use for our products,
such as (i) the right to access new technology,
(ii) the duration of the license, and (iii) payment
terms. Customer decisions regarding these aspects of license
transactions determine the license type, timing of revenue
recognition and potential future business activity. For example,
if a customer chooses a fixed term of use, this will result in
either a subscription or term license. A business implication of
this decision is that, at the expiration of the license period,
the customer must decide whether to continue using the
technology and therefore renew the license agreement. Because
larger customers generally use products from two or more of our
five product groups, rarely will a large customer completely
terminate its relationship with us at expiration



of the license. See “Critical Accounting Estimates”
above for additional discussion of license types and timing of
revenue recognition.

A substantial portion of our revenue is recognized over multiple
periods. As a result, we do not believe that pricing volatility
has been a material component of the change in our revenue from
period to period.

The amount of revenue recognized in future periods will depend
on, among other things, the terms and timing of our contract
renewals or additional product sales with existing customers,
the size of such transactions and sales to new customers.

The value and duration of contracts, and consequently product
revenue recognized, is affected by the competitiveness of our
products. Product revenue recognized in any period is also
affected by the extent to which customers purchase subscription,
term or perpetual licenses, and the extent to which contracts
contain flexible payment terms. The timing of product revenue
recognition is also affected by changes in the extent to which
existing contracts contain flexible payment terms and changes in
contractual arrangements (e.g., subscription to term) with
existing customers.

Revenue and Revenue Mix

We analyze our software and hardware businesses by product
group, combining revenues for both product and maintenance
because of their interrelationship. We have formulated a design
solution strategy that combines our design technologies into
“platforms,” which are included in the various product
groups described below.

Our product groups are:

Functional Verification:

Products in this group, which
include the
Incisive

tm

functional verification platform, are used to verify that the
high level, logical specification of an IC design is correct.
The technology acquired from Verisity has been incorporated into
the Incisive functional verification platform.

Digital IC Design:

Products in this group, which include
the
Encounter

tm

digital IC design platform, are used to accurately convert the
high-level, logical specification of a digital integrated
circuit into a detailed physical blueprint and then detailed
design information showing how the integrated circuit will be
physically implemented. This data is used for creation of the
photomasks used in chip manufacture.

Custom IC Design:

Our custom design products, which
include the
Virtuoso

®

custom design platform, are used for integrated circuits that
must be designed at the transistor level, including analog,
radio frequency, memories, high performance digital blocks and
standard cell libraries. Detailed design information showing how
the integrated circuit will be physically implemented is used
for creation of the photomasks used in chip manufacture.

Design for Manufacturing:

Included in this product group
are our physical verification and analysis products. These
products are used to analyze and verify that the physical
blueprint of the integrated circuit has been constructed
correctly and can be manufactured successfully.

System Interconnect:

This product group consists of our
PCB and IC package design products, including the
Allegro

®

system interconnect design platform, which enables consistent
co-design of integrated circuits, IC packages and PCBs.



Revenue by Year

The table below shows our revenue for the years ended 2005, 2004
and 2003 and the percentage change in revenue between those
years:

2005 compared to

Product revenue was higher in 2005, as compared to 2004,
primarily because of increased revenue from licenses for Digital
IC Design, Functional Verification and Custom IC products.
Services revenue was lower in 2005, as compared to 2004, due to
our reduced capacity to satisfy demand for our design services
after having implemented certain restructuring activities.

2004 compared to

Product revenue was higher in 2004, as compared to 2003,
primarily because of increased revenue from licenses for Digital
IC and System Interconnect products and sales of certain
intellectual property. Services revenue increased in 2004 due to
an increase in customer spending for design and methodology
services as the electronics industry experienced some recovery
from the economic downturn of 2002 and 2003.

Revenue by Product Group

The following table shows for 2005, 2004 and 2003 the percentage
of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each
of our five product groups, and Services and other:

Revenue generated by products acquired with Verisity is included
in the Functional Verification product group.

During 2004, we recognized $11.0 million of revenue from
the sale of intellectual property, or IP. This sale of IP is
included in Services and other in the preceding table and in
Product revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of
Operations.



Revenue by Geography

Revenue by Geography as a Percent of Total Revenue

Both our domestic and international businesses have been
affected by the revenue trends discussed above in this section
entitled “Results of Operations.” The rate of revenue
change varies geographically primarily due to differences in the
timing and size of term licenses in those regions.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates caused our revenue to
decrease by $5.7 million in 2005, as compared to 2004, and
to increase by $16.0 million in 2004, as compared to 2003,
primarily due to fluctuations of the Japanese yen in relation to
the United States dollar. Additional information about revenue
and other financial information by geography can be found in
Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

product primarily includes the cost of employee salaries and
benefits, amortization



of intangible assets directly related to Cadence products, the
cost of technical documentation and royalties payable to
third-party vendors. Cost of product associated with our
hardware products also includes materials, assembly labor and
overhead. These additional manufacturing costs make our cost of
hardware product higher, as a percentage of revenue, than our
cost of software product.

2005 compared to

Cost of product decreased $2.4 million in 2005, as compared
to 2004, primarily due to a decrease of $13.5 million in
the cost of hardware products sold as a result of sales of
products with lower costs, partially offset by a
$6.6 million increase in amortization of intangibles, a
$1.6 million increase in royalty expenses and an increase
in other individually insignificant items.

Cost of product in the future will depend primarily upon the
actual mix of hardware and software product sales in any given
period and the degree to which we license and incorporate
third-party technology in our products licensed or sold in any
given period.

Cost of services primarily includes employee salary and benefit
costs, costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage
a services organization, and provisions for contract losses, if
any. Cost of services decreased $0.7 million in 2005, as
compared to 2004, primarily due to a $1.5 million decrease
in other operating expenses, partially offset by a
$0.9 million increase in salary and benefit costs.

Cost of maintenance includes the cost of customer services, such
as hot-line and

on-site

support, certain employees and documentation of maintenance
updates. Cost of maintenance increased $5.8 million in
2005, as compared to 2004, due to a $3.1 million increase
in amortization of intangible assets and a $2.2 million
increase in salary and benefit costs. The remaining increase in
cost of maintenance is due to other individually insignificant
items.

2004 compared to

Cost of product increased $15.0 million in 2004, as
compared to 2003, primarily due to an increase of
$18.0 million in cost of goods sold for our hardware
business resulting from increased sales of our hardware
products, and an increase of $5.0 million in amortization
of intangible assets, partially offset by a $4.4 million
decrease in royalty expenses and a $3.6 million decrease in
amortized software costs.

Cost of services decreased $2.2 million in 2004, as
compared to 2003, primarily due to a decrease in salary and
benefit costs resulting from decreases in employees in our
services business. Services gross margin as a percentage of
services revenue increased during 2004, as compared to 2003, due
to increased services revenues and decreased cost of services.

Cost of maintenance decreased $3.5 million in 2004, as
compared to 2003, due to a $2.3 million decrease in salary
and benefit costs and a $1.2 million decrease in
information technology, facilities and general operating
expenses.

Operating Expense Summary

With the adoption of SFAS No. 123R in the first
quarter of 2006, we expect our operating expenses to increase
due to the expensing of the fair value of awards granted under
our equity compensation plans.

2005 compared to

Operating expenses increased $81.1 million during 2005, as
compared to 2004, primarily due to a $57.3 million increase
in employee salary and benefit costs, primarily due to our
acquisition of Verisity and increased bonus and commission
costs, and an $8.6 million increase in losses associated
with the sale of installment contract receivables. The increase
in operating expenses was also due to executive severance costs
and other individually insignificant items. These increases were
partially offset by our restructuring activities, as discussed
below.

2004 compared to

Operating expenses increased $8.3 million during 2004, as
compared to 2003, primarily due to a $31.8 million increase
in employee salary and benefit and related costs including
bonuses earned in 2004 that had not been earned in 2003. This
increase was partially offset by a $13.2 million decrease
in depreciation and amortization expense, a $7.4 million
decrease in outside services and a $7.2 million decrease in
commission payments to Innotech as a result of our acquisition
from Innotech in 2003 of distribution rights to certain of its
customers.

Foreign currency exchange rates increased operating expenses by
$10.9 million in 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due
to the strengthening of the European Union euro, British pound
and Japanese yen in relation to the United States dollar.

Marketing and Sales

2005 compared to

Marketing and sales expenses increased $30.1 million during
2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to a $27.9 million
increase in employee salary, commission and benefit costs. The
remaining increase in marketing and sales expense was due to
other individually insignificant items, partially offset by a
$1.9 million decrease in outside marketing program costs.



2004 compared to

Marketing and sales expenses decreased $0.7 million during
2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to a $7.2 million
decrease in commission payments to Innotech as a result of our
acquisition from Innotech of distribution rights to certain of
its customers and a $3.1 million reduction in depreciation
related to prior restructuring activities. This decrease was
partially offset by a $7.7 million increase in employee
salary and benefit and related costs and a $2.2 million
increase in marketing program costs.

Research and Development

2005 compared to

Research and development expense increased $18.8 million in
2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to a $22.4 million
increase in employee salary and benefit costs, partially offset
by a $3.9 million decrease in depreciation expense. The
increase in salary and benefit costs resulted primarily from the
acquisition of Verisity and increased staffing to support
product development.

2004 compared to

Research and development expense increased $11.2 million
during 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to a
$21.4 million increase in employee salary and benefit and
related costs resulting from an increase in employees due to
business acquisitions and increased staffing to support product
development. This increase was partially offset by a
$7.4 million decrease in expenses related to our use of
outside services and a $3.2 million decrease in costs
associated with outsourced research and development projects.

General and Administrative

2005 compared to

General and administrative expense increased $32.2 million
in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to an
$8.6 million increase in losses on the sale of installment
contract receivables, a $7.1 million increase in executive
severance costs, a $6.5 million increase in employee salary
and benefit costs and a $5.2 million increase in legal and
consulting services. The remaining increase in general and
administrative expense is due to other individually
insignificant items, partially offset by a $1.2 million
decrease in professional fees related to our annual audit and
Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 compliance.

2004 compared to

General and administrative expense decreased $2.2 million
in 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to a
$3.0 million decrease in losses on the sale of installment
contract receivables, a $2.6 million decrease in legal
expense, a $2.4 million decrease in bad debt expense and a
$1.3 million decrease in insurance expense, partially
offset by a $4.5 million increase in employee salary,
benefit and related costs and a $2.6 million increase in
professional fees related to our annual audit and Sarbanes-Oxley
Section 404 compliance.

Amortization of Acquired Intangibles




(In millions)

Amortization of acquired intangibles

$

$

$

62.6

We expect Amortization of acquired intangibles to significantly
decrease in 2006 due to the completed amortization of certain
existing intangible assets during 2005.

2005 compared to

Amortization of acquired intangibles decreased $7.9 million
in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to a
$21.0 million decrease in the amortization of acquired
intangibles reflecting the full amortization of



intangible assets from prior year acquisitions, partially offset
by increases of $13.1 million in amortization of acquired
intangibles in connection with acquisitions completed in 2005
and 2004.

2004 compared to

Amortization of acquired intangibles decreased $6.9 million
in 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to an
$11.4 million decrease in the amortization of acquired
intangibles reflecting the full amortization of intangible
assets from prior year acquisitions, partially offset by
increases of $5.6 million in amortization of acquired
intangibles in connection with acquisitions completed in 2004
and 2003.

Deferred Compensation

We amortize deferred stock compensation related to fixed awards
using the straight-line method over the period that the stock
options and restricted stock vest. We recognize stock
compensation expense related to variable awards using an
accelerated method over the period that the stock options and
restricted stock are earned.

With the adoption of SFAS No. 123R in the first
quarter of 2006, we expect deferred compensation to decrease as
the related equity compensation expense will be reflected
throughout our other operating expenses.

2005 compared to

Deferred compensation increased $18.9 million in 2005, as
compared to 2004, due to a $10.4 million increase in
deferred compensation related to our non-qualified deferred
compensation plans and a $9.1 million increase in deferred
stock compensation primarily related to incentive stock grants.

2004 compared to

Deferred stock compensation decreased $21.3 million in
2004, as compared to 2003, due to a $24.6 million decrease
in deferred stock compensation primarily related to our
previously completed acquisitions and an $11.6 million
decrease in deferred compensation expense related to our
non-qualified deferred compensation plans. This decrease was
partially offset by a $14.9 million increase in deferred
stock compensation primarily related to incentive stock grants.

Restructuring and Other Charges

We have initiated a separate plan of restructuring in each year
since 2001 in an effort to reduce operating expenses and improve
operating margins and cash flows.

The restructuring plans initiated each year from 2001 through
2004, or the 2001 Restructuring, 2002 Restructuring, 2003
Restructuring and 2004 Restructuring, respectively, were
intended to decrease costs through workforce reductions and
facility and resource consolidation, in order to improve our
cost structure. The 2001 and 2002 Restructurings primarily
related to our design services business and certain other
business or infrastructure groups throughout the world. The 2003
and 2004 Restructurings were targeted at reducing costs
throughout the company.

During 2005, we implemented a new plan of restructuring, or the
2005 Restructuring, in an effort to decrease costs by reducing
workforce and consolidating facilities throughout the company.

During 2005, in conjunction with the workforce reduction
involving our European design services business, we completed a
sale-leaseback transaction involving land and a building in
Livingston, Scotland. Proceeds from the sale were
$33.6 million and the total gain on the sale was
$3.6 million. We have agreed to lease back a portion of the
facility for the next two years and another portion for ten
years, with an option to



terminate the ten year lease at five years. We have deferred the
gain on the sale and will recognize the gain ratably over the
maximum remaining lease term of ten years.

A summary of restructuring and other charges by plan of
restructuring for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003 is as follows:

Frequently, asset impairments are based on significant estimates
and assumptions, particularly regarding remaining useful life
and utilization rates. We may incur other charges in the future
if management determines that the useful life or utilization of
certain long-lived assets has been reduced.

Facility closure and office space reduction costs include
payments required under leases less any applicable estimated
sublease income after the properties were abandoned, lease
buyout costs, and other contractual charges. To determine the
lease loss, which is the loss after our cost recovery efforts
from subleasing all or part of a building, certain assumptions
were made related to the time period over which the relevant
building would remain vacant and sublease terms, including
sublease rates and contractual common area charges.

As of December 31, 2005, our estimate of the accrued lease
loss related to all worldwide restructuring activities initiated
since 2001 was $34.8 million. This amount will be adjusted
in the future based upon changes in the assumptions used to
estimate the lease loss. The lease loss could range as high as
$38.8 million if sublease rental rates decrease in
applicable markets or if it takes longer than currently expected
to find a suitable tenant to sublease the facilities. Since
2001, we have recorded facilities consolidation charges under
the 2001 through 2005 Restructurings of $97.7 million
related to reducing space in or the closing of 49 sites, of
which 28 have been vacated and 21 have been downsized. We expect
to pay all of the facilities-related restructuring liabilities
for all our restructuring plans prior to 2016.

Because the restructuring charges and related benefits are
derived from management’s estimates made during the
formulation of the restructurings, based on then-currently
available information, our restructuring activities may not
achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the
level contemplated. Demand for our products and services and,
ultimately, our future financial performance, is difficult to
predict with any



degree of certainty. Accordingly, additional actions, including
further restructuring of our operations, may be required in the
future.

The following is further discussion of the activity under each
restructuring plan:

2005 Restructuring

— During the year ended
December 31, 2005, we reduced our workforce by
approximately 300 employees, including approximately 65
employees in our European design services business, and
consolidated facilities and resources throughout the company.
Costs resulting from the 2005 Restructuring included severance
payments, severance-related benefits, outplacement services,
lease costs associated with facilities vacated and downsized,
and charges for assets written-off as a result of the
restructuring. Severance and benefits expenses associated with
the 2005 Restructuring were approximately $20.8 million.

All terminations and termination benefits associated with the
workforce reductions under the 2005 Restructuring were
communicated to the affected employees prior to
December 31, 2005, with substantially all termination
benefits paid prior to December 31, 2005. The remaining
termination benefits are expected to be paid by April 1,
2006.

Asset-related and other charges of $2.4 million recorded in
the year ended December 31, 2005 are comprised of
$1.5 million of expenses from the restructuring activities,
primarily related to the write-off of leasehold improvements for
facilities vacated and downsized, and $0.9 million of other
charges related to the disposal of other assets not associated
with our restructuring activities.

Facilities-related expenses of $2.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2005 are comprised of $1.8 million
of expenses for facilities vacated or consolidated and
$0.6 million related to changes in lease loss estimates for
vacated and downsized facilities. Facilities-related expenses
include payments required under leases, net of estimated
sublease income, lease buyout costs and other contractual
charges.

We expect total ongoing annual savings of approximately
$38.3 million related to the actions of the 2005
Restructuring. We also expect to incur an additional
$1.0 million to $2.0 million of future costs in
connection with the 2005 Restructuring, primarily for
facilities-related charges, which will be expensed as incurred.
The actual amount of additional costs incurred could vary
depending on changes in market conditions and the timing of
these restructuring activities.

2004 Restructuring

— We recorded a net credit
of $0.3 million during 2005, which relates to reversing the
portion of the severance and other benefits accrual in excess of
the remaining expected obligation.

2003 Restructuring

— During 2005, we recorded
additional expense of $4.8 million, related primarily to
changes in estimated sublease income from vacated and downsized
facilities. Cadence also paid approximately $3.5 million of
fees related to headcount reductions at a foreign facility. The
liability associated with this payment was recorded prior to the
year ended December 31, 2005.

We expect to incur an additional $3.0 million to
$5.0 million of future costs in connection with the 2003
Restructuring, primarily for facilities-related charges, which
will be expensed as incurred. The actual amount of additional
costs incurred could vary depending on changes in market
conditions and the timing of these restructuring activities.

2002 Restructuring

— During 2005, we recorded a
net credit of $0.4 million related to changes in lease loss
estimates for facilities included in the 2002 Restructuring.

2001 Restructuring

— During 2005, we recorded
additional expense of $5.7 million related to a change in
the lease loss estimate for a facility included in the 2001
Restructuring.

Write-off of Acquired In-Process Research and
Development

Upon consummation of an acquisition, we immediately charge to
expense any acquired in-process research and development that
has not yet reached technological feasibility and has no
alternative future use. The value assigned to acquired
in-process research and development is determined by identifying
research projects in areas for which technological feasibility
has not been established. The values are determined by



estimating costs to develop the acquired in-process research and
development into commercially viable products, estimating the
resulting net cash flows from such projects and discounting the
net cash flows back to their present value. The discount rates
utilized include a factor that reflects the uncertainty
surrounding successful development of the acquired in-process
research and development.

Described below are the write-offs of acquired in-process
research and development charges in 2005, 2004 and 2003:

Described below is a summary of in-process research and
development acquired during 2005, 2004 and 2003 as of

Interest Expense

Interest expense

$

$

6.2

$

5.0

We expect interest expense to increase during 2006 due to the
$160.0 million term loan entered into by our Irish
subsidiary, Castlewilder, in December 2005.

2005 compared to

Interest expense decreased $0.8 million in 2005, as
compared to 2004, primarily due to a decrease of
$0.6 million in imputed interest on acquisition-related
payments which occur over time. The remaining decrease of
$0.2 million is due to other individually insignificant
items.



2004 compared to

Interest expense increased $1.2 million in 2004, as
compared to 2003, primarily due to an increase of
$1.8 million in amortization expense related to the costs
associated with the issuance of our Notes in August 2003, an
increase of $1.3 million in imputed interest on
acquisition-related payments which occur over time, partially
offset by a decrease of $1.9 million in interest expense
related to our 2002 credit facilities that were terminated in
2003 after the issuance of the Notes.

Other income (expense), net

Other income (expense), net, for the years ended 2005, 2004 and
2003 is as follows:

Provision for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes and the effective tax rates for
2005, 2004 and 2003 are as follows:

2005 compared to

The effective tax rate in 2005 increased from that in 2004
primarily due to $30.1 million of federal, state and
foreign income taxes incurred upon our repatriation of
$500.0 million of certain foreign earnings under the
American Jobs Creation Act, or AJCA, and an increase in foreign
income tax expense from operations.

2004 compared to

The income before provision for income taxes resulted in a
provision for income taxes in 2004 compared to a benefit for
income taxes in 2003. The 2004 provision for income taxes has a
greater benefit from foreign income that is taxed at a lower
rate than the United States Federal statutory rate when compared
to 2003.

Outlook for

We are currently projecting the effective income tax rate for
2006 to be approximately 40%. The decrease in the effective
income tax rate as compared to 2005 is primarily due to the
non-recurring income taxes related to the 2005 repatriation of
certain foreign earnings. With the adoption of
SFAS No. 123R in the first quarter of 2006, we may
have additional volatility in our effective income tax rate due
to certain stock-based compensation for which we are not allowed
to anticipate a tax deduction. The tax deduction will be
recognized in the period of the taxable event.



As of December 31, 2005, we had total net deferred tax
assets of approximately $148.3 million. Realization of the
deferred tax assets will depend on generating sufficient taxable
income of the appropriate character prior to the expiration of
certain net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit
carryforwards. Although realization is not assured, we believe
it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will
be realized. The amount of the net deferred tax assets, however,
could be reduced or increased in the near term if actual facts,
including the estimate of future taxable income, differ from
those estimated.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, we completed our evaluation
of the repatriation provisions of the AJCA, which created a
temporary one year incentive for United States corporations to
repatriate accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries by
providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain
qualifying dividends. We made the determination to repatriate
$500 million of certain foreign earnings which were
previously considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of
the United States. We will invest these earnings in the United
States pursuant to the AJCA guidelines. We completed the
repatriation and we recorded an income tax expense of
$30.1 million associated with the repatriation during the
fourth quarter of 2005. In the future, we intend to indefinitely
reinvest our foreign earnings outside of the United States.

The IRS and other tax authorities regularly examine our income
tax returns. In November 2003, the IRS completed its field
examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years
1997 through 1999 and issued a Revenue Agent’s Report, or
the RAR, in which the IRS proposes to assess an aggregate tax
deficiency for the three-year period of approximately
$143.0 million, plus interest, which interest will accrue
until the matter is resolved. This interest is compounded daily
at rates published by the IRS, which rates are adjusted
quarterly and have been between four and nine percent since
1997. The RAR is not a final Statutory Notice of Deficiency, and
we have protested certain of the proposed adjustments with the
Appeals Office of the IRS where the matter is presently being
considered. The most significant of the disputed adjustments
relates to transfer pricing arrangements that we have with a
foreign subsidiary. We believe that the proposed IRS adjustments
are inconsistent with applicable tax laws, and that we have
meritorious defenses to the proposed adjustments. The IRS may
also make similar claims for years subsequent to 1999.

The IRS is currently examining our federal income tax returns
for the tax years 2000 through 2002 and may challenge the tax
reported on these tax returns.

Significant judgment is required in determining our provision
for income taxes. The calculation of our tax liabilities
involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of
complex tax regulations. In determining the adequacy of our
provision for income taxes, we have assessed the likelihood of
adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations, including the
current IRS examination and the IRS RAR for tax years 1997
through 1999. We provide for tax liabilities on our Consolidated
Balance Sheets unless we consider it probable that additional
taxes will not be due. However, the ultimate outcome of tax
examinations cannot be predicted with certainty, including the
total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon
resolution of these issues. In addition, we cannot be certain
that such amount will not be materially different than that
which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and
accruals. Should the IRS or other tax authorities assess
additional taxes as a result of a current or a future
examination, we may be required to record charges to operations
in future periods that could have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations, financial position or cash flows in
the period or periods recorded.

Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates
relates primarily to our short-term investment portfolio and the
term loan entered into by our Irish subsidiary, Castlewilder.
While we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of
the world’s leading industrialized countries, our interest
income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the
general level of United States interest rates. In this regard,
changes in United States interest rates affect the interest
earned on our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and
long-term investments and costs associated with foreign currency
hedges and interest paid on the Castlewilder term loan.



We invest in high quality credit issuers and, by policy, limit
the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer. As part of
our policy, our first priority is to reduce the risk of
principal loss. Consequently, we seek to preserve our invested
funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment
risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality
credit securities that we believe to have low credit risk and by
positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a
significant reduction in the credit rating of any investment
issuer or guarantor. The short-term interest-bearing portfolio
includes only marketable securities with active secondary or
resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity.

The table below presents the carrying value and related weighted
average interest rates for our interest-bearing instruments. All
highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or
less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash
equivalents; investments with maturities between three and
12 months are considered to be short-term investments.
Investments with maturities greater than 12 months are
considered long-term investments. The carrying value of our
interest-bearing instruments approximated fair value at
December 31, 2005.

In connection with the Castlewilder term loan, we manage
interest rate risk by having the option to choose between two
interest rates: (i) a base rate equal to the higher of the
Federal Funds Rate plus a spread of 0.50% or the “prime
rate” publicly announced by Bank of America, N.A., or
(ii) a LIBOR-based rate equal to LIBOR plus a spread of
0.625%. The loan was initially a base rate loan that converted
on December 22, 2005 into a LIBOR-based rate loan, which
accrued interest monthly at a rate of 4.995% as of
December 31, 2005. We can change our interest rate election
each Interest Period, as defined in the loan agreement. The
margin with respect to the loan (if the loan is a LIBOR loan)
may be increased or decreased depending upon our consolidated
leverage ratio.

Foreign Currency Risk

Our operations include transactions in foreign currencies and,
therefore, we benefit from a weaker dollar, and we are adversely
affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies
worldwide. The primary effect of foreign currency transactions
on our results of operations from a weakening United States
dollar is an increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase in
expenses. Conversely, the primary effect of foreign currency
transactions on our results of operations from a strengthening
United States dollar is a reduction in revenue offset by a
smaller reduction in expenses.

We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with
financial institutions to protect against currency exchange
risks associated with existing assets and liabilities. A foreign
currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing
in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying
liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange
rates. Conversely, a foreign currency forward exchange contract
decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or
underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in
foreign exchange rates. These forward contracts are not
designated as accounting hedges under SFAS No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,” and, therefore, the unrealized gains and
losses are recognized in Other income (expense), net, in advance
of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of
these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or
other assets.



Our policy governing hedges of foreign currency risk does not
allow us to use forward contracts for trading purposes. Our
forward contracts generally have maturities of 180 days or
less. The effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our
ability to estimate future asset and liability exposures. We
enter into currency forward exchange contracts based on
estimated future asset and liability exposures. Recognized gains
and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will
ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the
amount of currency forward exchange contracts with actual
underlying asset and liability exposures.

The table below provides information, as of December 31,
2005, about our forward foreign currency contracts. The
information is provided in United States dollar equivalent
amounts. The table presents the notional amounts, at contract
exchange rates, and the weighted average contractual foreign
currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign
currency per United States dollar, which in some cases may not
be the market convention for quoting a particular currency. All
of these forward contracts mature prior to March 17, 2006.

While we actively monitor our foreign currency risks, there can
be no assurance that our foreign currency hedging activities
will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency
exchange rates on our results of operations, cash flows and
financial position.

Equity Price Risk

In August 2003, we issued $420.0 million principal amount
of the Notes to two initial purchasers in a private offering for
resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC
Rule 144A, for which we received net proceeds of
approximately $406.4 million after transaction fees of
approximately $13.6 million. The Notes are convertible into
our common stock initially at a conversion price of
$15.65 per share, which would result in an aggregate of
26.8 million shares issued upon conversion, subject to
adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. We may
redeem for cash all or any part of the Notes on or after
August 15, 2008 for 100.00% of the principal amount. The
holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion
of their Notes on August 15, 2008 for 100.25% of the
principal amount, on August 15, 2013 for 100.00% of the
principal amount or on August 15, 2018 for 100.00% of the
principal amount. The Notes do not contain restrictive financial
covenants.

Each $1,000 of principal of the Notes will initially be
convertible into 63.8790 shares of our common stock,
subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events.
Holders of the Notes may convert their Notes prior to maturity
only if: (1) the price of our common stock reaches $22.69
during certain periods of time specified in the Notes,
(2) specified corporate transactions occur, (3) the
Notes have been called for redemption or (4) the trading
price of the Notes falls below a certain threshold.

In addition, in the event of a significant change in our
corporate ownership or structure, the holders may require us to
repurchase all or any portion of their Notes for 100.00% of the
principal amount.



Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into
convertible notes hedge transactions with JP Morgan Chase
Bank, whereby we have options to purchase up to
26.8 million shares of our common stock at a price of
$15.65 per share. These options expire on August 15,
2008 and must be settled in net shares. The cost of the
convertible notes hedge transactions to us was approximately
$134.6 million. As of December 31, 2005, the estimated
fair value of the options acquired in the convertible notes
hedge transactions was $130.8 million.

In addition, we sold to JP Morgan Chase Bank warrants to
purchase up to 26.8 million shares of our common stock at a
price of $23.08 per share. The warrants expire on various
dates from February 2008 through May 2008 and must be settled in
net shares. We received approximately $56.4 million in cash
proceeds for the sales of these warrants. As of
December 31, 2005, the estimated fair value of the sold
warrants was $29.6 million.

For additional discussion of the Notes see “Liquidity and
Capital Resources” below.

We have a portfolio of equity investments that includes
marketable equity securities and non-marketable equity
securities. Our equity investments primarily are made in
connection with our strategic investment program. Under our
strategic investment program, from time to time we make cash
investments in companies with technologies that are potentially
strategically important to us.

The fair value of our portfolio of available-for-sale marketable
equity securities, which are included in Short-term investments
in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, was
$33.0 million as of December 31, 2005 and
$35.9 million as of January 1, 2005. While we actively
monitor these investments, we do not currently engage in any
hedging activities to reduce or eliminate equity price risk with
respect to these equity investments. Accordingly, we could lose
all or part of our investment portfolio of marketable equity
securities if there is an adverse change in the market prices of
the companies we invest in.

Our investments in non-marketable equity securities would be
negatively affected by an adverse change in equity market
prices, although the impact cannot be directly quantified. Such
a change, or any negative change in the financial performance or
prospects of the companies whose non-marketable securities we
own would harm the ability of these companies to raise
additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to
realize any gains or return of our investments through liquidity
events such as initial public offerings, acquisitions and
private sales. These types of investments involve a high degree
of risk, and there can be no assurance that any company we
invest in will grow or will be successful. Accordingly, we could
lose all or part of our investment.

Our investments in non-marketable equity securities had a
carrying amount of $37.9 million as of December 31,
2005 and $45.7 million as of January 1, 2005. If we
determine that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value
exists for a non-marketable equity security, we write down the
investment to its fair value and record the related write-down
as an investment loss in our Consolidated Statements of
Operations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources



Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments

As of December 31, 2005, our principal sources of liquidity
consisted of $894.6 million of Cash and cash equivalents
and short-term investments, as compared to $593.0 million
as of January 1, 2005 and $418.4 million as of
January 3, 2004. The primary sources of our cash in 2005
and 2004 were customer payments under software licenses and from
the sale or lease of our hardware products, payments for the
provision of design and methodology services, a term loan
facility, proceeds from the sale of receivables and proceeds
from the exercise of stock options and common stock purchases
under our employee stock purchase plans. Our primary uses of
cash in 2005 and 2004 consisted of payments relating to payroll,
product, services and other operating expenses, taxes, purchases
of treasury stock and business acquisitions.

Net working capital

Net working capital increased $149.5 million as of
December 31, 2005, as compared to January 1, 2005,
primarily due to the increase in Cash and cash equivalents and
short-term investments of $301.6 million, partially offset
by a decrease in Accounts receivable, net, of
$102.0 million, an increase of Accounts payable and accrued
liabilities of $22.6 million and an increase in Current
portion of long-term debt of $32.0 million.

Net working capital increased $160.7 million as of
January 1, 2005, as compared to January 3, 2004,
primarily due to the increase in Cash and cash equivalents and
short-term investments of $174.6 million, an increase in
Receivables, net, of $35.4 million, and an increase in
Prepaid expense and other of $14.1 million, partially
offset by an increase of Accounts payable and accrued
liabilities of $34.5 million and an increase in Deferred
revenue of $32.5 million.

Cash flows from operating activities

Cash flows from operating activities are provided by net income,
adjusted for certain non-cash charges, as well as changes in the
balance of certain assets and liabilities. Our cash flows from
operating activities are significantly influenced by the payment
terms set forth in our license agreements and by sales of
receivables.

We have entered into agreements whereby we may transfer accounts
receivable to certain financing institutions on a non-recourse
basis. These transfers are recorded as sales and accounted for
in accordance with SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments
of Liabilities.” During 2005, we transferred accounts
receivable totaling $192.1 million, which approximated fair
value, to financing institutions on a non-recourse basis, as
compared to $30.1 million in 2004 and $87.4 million in
2003.

Provision for sales returns is accounted for as a reduction of
revenue. Provision for sales returns decreased by
$0.5 million in 2005, as compared to 2004, and decreased
$7.0 million in 2004, as compared to 2003.

2005 compared to

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by
$53.8 million, during 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily
due to an increase in Proceeds from the sale of receivables of
$162.0 million and a decrease in payments associated with
Accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $18.3 million,
partially offset by a decrease in net income of
$25.1 million, a net decrease in cash received from
collection of Receivables and Installment contract receivables
of $71.9 million and a change in Other assets of
$14.8 million.

2004 compared to

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by
$201.5 million during 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily
due to an increase in net income of $92.0 million, an
increase in cash received from Installment contract receivables
of $128.5 million, a decrease in payments associated with
Accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $108.7 million,
partially offset by a decrease in Proceeds from the sale of
receivables of $57.3 million and a decrease of cash
collected on Accounts receivable, net, of $48.0 million.



Cash flows from investing activities

Our primary investing activities consisted of purchases and
proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment,
purchases and proceeds from short-term investments, acquiring
businesses and investing in venture capital partnerships and
equity investments.

As part of our overall investment strategy, we have limited
partnership interests in three venture capital funds, Telos
Venture Partners, L.P., or Telos I, Telos Venture
Partners II, L.P., or Telos II, and Telos Venture
Partners III, L.P., or Telos III (Telos I,
Telos II and Telos III are referred to collectively as
Telos).

We and certain of our deferred compensation trusts hold the
entire limited partnership interests in Telos I and
Telos III, and we hold the entire limited partnership
interest in Telos II. The Telos II general partner,
which is not affiliated with us, manages Telos II. The
contractual term of Telos I ended on December 31, 2005 and
Telos I is currently being liquidated. In December 2005, we
notified the general partner of Telos II of our intent to
dissolve the partnership effective December 31, 2006. We
also determined to liquidate Telos III and removed the
general partner of Telos III effective December 31,
2005. The new general partner, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
ours, will complete the liquidation of Telos III.

The partnership agreement governing Telos II requires us to
meet capital calls principally for the purpose of funding
investments that are recommended by the general partner and
approved by the Telos advisory committee as being consistent
with the partnership’s limitations and stated purpose. For
all three partnerships, the Telos advisory committee is
comprised solely of the members of the Venture Committee of our
Board of Directors, the current members of which are three
independent members of our Board of Directors.

As of December 31, 2005, we had contributed
$123.8 million to these partnerships and are contractually
committed to contribute up to an additional $4.3 million to
Telos II through December 31, 2006. Actual future
contributions will depend upon the level of investments made by
Telos II. Our investments in the Telos partnerships are
recorded in Other assets in the accompanying Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

In January 2006, KhiMetrics, Inc., a cost method investment held
by us and our 1996 Deferred Compensation Venture Investment Plan
Trust through Telos I, was acquired for consideration of
$6.53 per common share. Under the purchase agreement, 10%
of the consideration is held in escrow to pay unresolved claims
against KhiMetrics, Inc. through the first anniversary of the
acquisition, at which time the remaining escrow will be
distributed to the former stockholders of KhiMetrics. In
connection with this sale, Cadence received approximately
$17.5 million in cash and recorded a gain of approximately
$14.4 million in January 2006.

2005 compared to

Net cash used for investing activities increased by
$7.7 million during 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily
due to an increase of $182.0 in Cash paid in business
combinations and asset acquisitions, net of cash acquired,
partially offset by an increase in Proceeds from sale of
short-term investments, net of Purchases of short-term
investments of $141.2 million and an increase in Proceeds
from the sale of property, plant and equipment of
$30.0 million.

2004 compared to

Net cash used for investing activities decreased by
$171.3 million during 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily
due to a decrease of $67.1 million of net Cash paid in
business acquisitions, a decrease of $17.0 million of
investments in venture capital partnership and equity
investments, a decrease of $29.3 million in Purchases of
technology, a decrease of $21.1 million in Purchases of
property, plant and equipment, an increase of $98.6 million
of Sales of short-term investments and an increase of Proceeds
from the sale of available for sale securities and long-term
investments of $14.9 million, partially offset by an
increase of $71.2 million of Purchases of short-term
investments.



During 2003, we received $9.1 million in cash from the
sale-leaseback of certain equipment. We will make aggregate
payments under the resulting operating leases of
$9.1 million over the three to five year life of the
operating leases.

Cash flows from financing activities

Financing cash flows consisted primarily of a term loan in 2005
and a convertible note financing in 2003, the repurchase of
treasury stock and the issuance of stock under certain employee
plans and the cash impact of certain hedge transactions related
to the convertible note financing.

2005 compared to

Net cash provided by financing activities was
$205.3 million, as compared to net cash used for financing
activities of $21.1 million in 2004, a change of
$226.4 million. In 2005, our primary use of cash from
financing activities was the repurchase of $101.1 million
of treasury stock, as compared to $94.1 million in 2004. As
of December 31, 2005, the remaining repurchase
authorization under our stock repurchase program totaled
$21.9 million. In 2005, our primary source of cash from
financing activities was $146.5 million from the issuance
of common stock upon exercise of stock options and under our
employee stock purchase program, as compared to
$75.3 million in 2004. In addition during 2005, our
wholly-owned Irish subsidiary, Castlewilder, borrowed
$160.0 million to declare a cash dividend to Cadence under
the AJCA.

2004 compared to

Net cash used for financing activities was $21.1 million in
2004, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities
of $149.2 million in 2003, a change of $162.5 million.
In 2004, our primary use of cash from financing activities was
the repurchase of $94.1 million of treasury stock, as
compared to $213.8 million in 2003. As of January 1,
2005, the remaining repurchase authorization under our stock
repurchase program totaled $123.0 million. Our primary
source of cash from financing activities was $75.3 million
from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options
and under our employee stock purchase program, as compared to
$86.6 million in 2003. In addition during 2003, we issued
$420.0 million of convertible notes and received proceeds
from the sale of common stock warrants and purchased convertible
notes hedges of $134.6 million.

We expect to continue our financing activities and may use cash
reserves to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program.
We may also consider additional hedging transactions if
opportunities become available.

Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital
Resources

We provide for United States income taxes on the earnings of
foreign subsidiaries unless the earnings are considered
permanently invested outside of the United States. At
December 31, 2005, the cumulative amount of earnings upon
which United States income taxes have not been provided was
approximately $196.0 million. At December 31, 2005,
the unrecognized deferred tax liability for these earnings was
approximately $64.0 million.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, we completed our evaluation
of the repatriation provisions of the AJCA, which created a
temporary one year incentive for United States corporations to
repatriate accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries by
providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain
qualifying dividends. We made the determination to repatriate
$500 million of certain foreign earnings which were
previously considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of
the United States. We will invest these earnings in the United
States pursuant to the AJCA guidelines. We expect that we will
pay $24.5 million of federal and state income taxes related
to the repatriation during the first quarter of 2006. In the
future, we intend to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings
outside of the United States.

We received an RAR from the IRS in which the IRS proposes to
assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the tax years 1997
through 1999 of approximately $143.0 million, plus
interest, which interest will accrue until



the matter is resolved. The RAR is not a final Statutory Notice
of Deficiency, and we have filed a protest with the IRS to
certain of the proposed adjustments. We are challenging these
proposed adjustments vigorously. While we are protesting certain
of the proposed adjustments, we cannot predict with certainty
the ultimate outcome of the tax examination, including the
amount payable, or timing of such payments, which may materially
impact our cash flows in the period or periods resolved. The IRS
may also make similar claims for tax returns filed for years
subsequent to 1999.

The IRS is currently examining our federal income tax returns
for the tax years 2000 through 2002 and may challenge the tax
reported on these tax returns.

During 2005, we recorded Restructuring and other charges of
$35.3 million and made $33.5 million of cash payments
related to all of our restructuring activities. We expect to
incur an additional $4.0 million to $7.0 million of
future costs in connection with our restructuring activities in
subsequent periods, primarily for facilities-related charges in
connection with the 2003 and 2005 Restructurings, which amounts
will be expensed as incurred.

In December 2005, our Irish subsidiary, Castlewilder, entered
into a syndicated term facility agreement, or Credit Agreement,
with Banc of America Securities LLC as lead arranger, Bank of
America, N.A. as Administrative Agent. The Credit Agreement
provides for a three-year $160 million unsecured term loan.
With the consent of all of the lenders, we may, at the end of
the second year of the loan, extend the maturity date to
December 31, 2009. Castlewilder’s obligations under
the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by us and Cadence Technology
Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Castlewilder. Our guaranty
contains certain financial covenants that must be maintained by
us on a consolidated basis, as well as limitations on our
ability to incur additional indebtedness and liens, make
investments, dispose of assets, pay dividends or other
distributions, engage in certain corporate transactions and
certain other activities.

During the term of the Credit Agreement, we have the option to
choose between two interest rates: (i) a base rate equal to
the higher of the Federal Funds Rate plus a spread of 0.50% or
the “prime rate” publicly announced by Bank of
America, N.A., or (ii) a LIBOR-based rate equal to LIBOR
plus a spread of 0.625%. The loan was initially a base rate loan
that converted on December 22, 2005 into a LIBOR-based rate
loan, which accrued interest monthly at a rate of 4.995% as of
December 31, 2005. We can change our interest rate election
each Interest Period, as defined in the loan agreement. The
margin with respect to the loan (if the loan is a LIBOR loan)
may be increased or decreased depending upon our consolidated
leverage ratio.

Through Castlewilder, we are obligated to repay the outstanding
principal amount of the loan in quarterly installments in
amounts equal to $8.0 million per quarter during 2006,
$12.0 million per quarter during 2007 and
$20.0 million per quarter during 2008 (with the quarterly
repayment amount to be adjusted to $10.0 million per
quarter during 2008 and 2009 if the maturity date of the loan is
extended). We are also obligated to pay accrued interest on the
last day of each month or other interest period that we may
select under the terms of the Credit Agreement. If the loan is
converted into a base rate loan, we are obligated to pay accrued
interest on the last day of each quarter.

In August 2003, we issued $420.0 million principal amount
of Zero Coupon Zero Yield Senior Convertible Notes due 2023, or
the Notes, to two initial purchasers in a private offering for
resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC
Rule 144A. We received net proceeds of approximately
$406.4 million, after transaction fees of approximately
$13.6 million that were recorded in Other assets and are
being amortized to interest expense using the straight-line
method over five years, which is the duration of the first
redemption period. We issued the Notes at par and the Notes bear
no interest. The Notes are convertible into our common stock
initially at a conversion price of $15.65 per share, which
would result in an aggregate of 26.8 million shares issued
upon conversion, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of
specified events. The holders of the Notes may require us to
repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Notes on
August 15, 2008 for 100.25% of the principal amount, on
August 15, 2013 for 100.00% of the principal amount or on
August 15, 2018 for 100.00% of the principal amount, by
providing to the paying agent a written repurchase notice. The
repurchase notice must be delivered during the period commencing
30 business days prior to the relevant repurchase date and
ending on the close of business on the business day prior to the
relevant repurchase date. We may redeem for cash all or any part
of the Notes on or after August 15, 2008 for 100.00% of the
principal



amount, except for those Notes that holders have required us to
repurchase on August 15, 2008 or on other repurchase dates,
as described above.

Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into
convertible notes hedge transactions whereby we have options to
purchase up to 26.8 million shares of our common stock at a
price of $15.65 per share. These options expire on
August 15, 2008 and must be settled in net shares. The cost
of the convertible notes hedge transactions to us was
approximately $134.6 million. As of December 31, 2005,
the estimated fair value of the options acquired in the
convertible notes hedge transactions was $130.8 million.

In addition, we sold warrants to purchase up to
26.8 million shares of our common stock at a price of
$23.08 per share. The warrants expire on various dates from
February 2008 through May 2008 and must be settled in net
shares. We received approximately $56.4 million in cash
proceeds for the sales of these warrants. As of
December 31, 2005, the estimated fair value of the sold
warrants was $29.6 million.

In connection with our acquisitions completed prior to
December 31, 2005, we may be obligated to pay up to an
aggregate of $27.0 million in cash during the next
12 months and an additional $7.0 million in cash
during the three years following the next 12 months if
certain performance goals related to one or more of the
following are achieved in full: revenue, bookings, product
proliferation, product development and employee retention.

We expect that current cash and short-term investment balances
and cash flows that are generated from operations will be
sufficient to meet our working capital and other capital
requirements for at least the next 12 months.

As of December 31, 2005, we did not have any significant
off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in
Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC
Regulation

S-K.

New Accounting Standards

In June 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,
“Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,” which
changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of
a change in accounting principle. Previously, most voluntary
changes in accounting principles required recognition via a
cumulative effect adjustment within net income of the period of
the change. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective
application to prior periods’ financial statements, unless
it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific
effects or the cumulative effect of the change.
SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes made
in fiscal years



beginning after December 15, 2005; however,
SFAS No. 154 does not change the transition provisions
of any existing accounting pronouncements.

In March 2005, the FASB published FASB Interpretation, or FIN,
No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations,” which clarifies that the term,
“conditional asset retirement obligation,” as used in
SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations,” refers to a legal obligation to perform an
asset retirement activity in which the timing and
(or) method of settlement are conditional on a future event
that may or may not be within the control of the entity. The
uncertainty about the timing and (or) method of settlement
of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored
into the measurement of the liability when sufficient
information exists. The interpretation also clarifies when an
entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate
the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. This
interpretation was adopted effective December 31, 2005. The
adoption of this Interpretation did not have a material effect
on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R,
“Share-Based Payments,” which eliminates the ability
to account for share-based compensation transactions using the
intrinsic value method under APB No. 25 and requires
the measurement of all share-based payments to employees,
including grants of employee stock options, using a
fair-value-based method and the recording of such expense in our
Consolidated Statements of Operations. We are required to adopt
SFAS No. 123R in our first quarter of fiscal 2006.
SFAS No. 123R will result in the recognition of
substantial compensation expense relating to our employee stock
options and employee stock purchase plans. As noted in
Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, we
generally do not recognize any compensation expense related to
stock option grants issued under our stock option plans or
related to the discounts provided under our employee stock
purchase plans. Under the new rules, we will be required to
adopt a fair-value-based method for measuring the compensation
expense related to employee stock awards. The resulting
additional compensation expense will have a material adverse
effect on our reported results of operations. We will recognize
stock-based compensation expense on all awards on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service period using the
modified prospective method. In January 2005, the SEC issued
SAB No. 107, which provides supplemental
implementation guidance for SFAS No. 123R.

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 153, “Exchanges of
Nonmonetary Asset,” an amendment of APB No. 29.
SFAS No. 153 addresses the measurement of exchanges of
nonmonetary assets and redefines the scope of transactions that
should be measured based on the fair value of the assets
exchanged. SFAS No. 153 is effective for us for
nonmonetary asset exchanges beginning in the first quarter of
2006. The adoption of SFAS No. 153 is not expected to
have a material effect on our consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

Item 9A.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We carried out an evaluation required by
Rule

13a-15

of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange
Act, under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including the Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, and
the Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in
Rules

13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the
Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2005.

The evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures
included a review of our processes and implementation and the
effect on the information generated for use in this Annual
Report on
Form

10-K.

In the
course of this evaluation, we sought to identify any significant
deficiencies or material weaknesses in our disclosure controls
and procedures, to determine whether we had identified any acts
of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in our
disclosure controls and procedures, and to confirm that any
necessary corrective action, including process improvements, was
taken. This type of evaluation is done every fiscal quarter so
that our conclusions concerning the effectiveness of these
controls can be reported in our periodic reports filed with the
SEC. The overall goals of these evaluation activities are to
monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and to make
modifications as necessary. We intend to maintain these
disclosure controls and procedures, modifying them as
circumstances warrant.

Based on their evaluation as of December 31, 2005, our CEO
and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that
the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (ii) is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including the
CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2005 that
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that
our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control
over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and
all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and
operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the
design of a control system must



reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the
benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all
control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Cadence
have been detected.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule

13a-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Our
management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. In making
this assessment, our management used the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Our management has concluded that, as of
December 31, 2005, our internal control over financial
reporting is effective based on these criteria. Our independent
registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has issued an audit
report on our assessment of our internal control over financial
reporting, which is included herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Cadence Design Systems, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity
and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended December 31, 2005. In
connection with our audits of the consolidated financial
statements, we also have audited the accompanying financial
statement schedule. These consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
management of Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements
and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended December 31, 2005, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of Cadence Design Systems, Inc.’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005,
based on the criteria established in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission, and our report dated March 10, 2006 expressed
an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of, and
the effective operation of, internal control over financial
reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Cadence Design Systems, Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that Cadence
Design Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
consolidated financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Cadence Design
Systems, Inc. maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established
in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. Also, in our opinion, Cadence Design
Systems, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the COSO.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of Cadence Design System, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and January 1,
2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 2005, and the related financial statement
schedule, and our report dated March 10, 2006 expressed an
unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements
and financial statement schedule.

CADENCE

Cadence Design Systems, Inc., or Cadence, licenses electronic
design automation, or EDA, software, sells or leases hardware
technology and intellectual property and provides design and
methodology services throughout the world to help manage and
accelerate electronic product development processes.
Cadence’s broad range of products and services are used by
electronics companies to design and develop complex integrated
circuits, or ICs, and personal and commercial electronic systems.

NOTE 2.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of
Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

Cadence’s fiscal year end is the Saturday closest to
December 31. Fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 were

52-week

years. Fiscal
2003 was a

53-week

year. Fiscal 2006 will be a

52-week

year ending
December 30, 2006.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Cadence and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany
accounts and transactions.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Cash, Cash Equivalents
and Short-Term Investments

Cadence considers all highly liquid debt instruments, which
could include commercial paper, European Union euro time
deposits, repurchase agreements and certificates of deposit,
with remaining maturities of three months or less at the time of
purchase to be cash equivalents. Investments with maturities
greater than three months and less than one year are classified
as short-term investments.

Foreign Currency
Translation

Cadence transacts business in various foreign currencies. In
general, the functional currency of a foreign operation is the
local country’s currency except for Cadence’s
principal Irish, Israeli, Hungarian and Dutch subsidiaries,
whose functional currency is the United States dollar.
Non-functional currency monetary balances are re-measured into
the functional currency of the subsidiary with any related gain
or loss recorded in Other income (expense), net, in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Assets and
liabilities of operations outside the United States, for which
the functional currency is the local currency, are translated
into United States dollars using fiscal year-end exchange rates.
Revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange
rates in effect during each fiscal month during the year. The
effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are included
in Stockholders’ Equity as a component of Accumulated other
comprehensive income in the accompanying Consolidated Balance
Sheets.

Derivative Financial
Instruments

Cadence accounts for its foreign currency exchange contracts in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or
SFAS, No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities.” Cadence enters into foreign
currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions
to protect against currency exchange risks associated with
existing assets and liabilities. A foreign currency forward
exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when
underlying assets decrease in value or underlying



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

December 31, 2005

liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange
rates. Conversely, a foreign currency forward exchange contract
decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or
underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in
foreign exchange rates. The forward contracts are not designated
as accounting hedges under SFAS No. 133 and,
therefore, the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in
Other income (expense), net, in advance of the actual foreign
currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward
contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other assets.

Cadence does not use forward contracts for trading purposes.
Cadence’s forward contracts generally have maturities of
180 days or less. Recognized gains or losses with respect
to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how
accurately Cadence is able to match the amount of currency
forward exchange contracts with underlying asset and liability
exposures.

Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts

Cadence makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding
receivables and provide allowances for the portion of
receivables when collection becomes doubtful. Provisions are
made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding
invoices and are recorded in operating expenses. For those
invoices not specifically reviewed, provisions are made based on
Cadence’s historical bad debt experience. In determining
these percentages, Cadence analyzes its historical collection
experience and current economic trends. If the historical data
Cadence uses to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful
accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect
outstanding receivables, additional provisions may be needed
which could cause future results of operations to be materially
affected.

Allowance for Sales
Returns

Provisions for sales returns primarily relate to service
arrangements and are recorded as a reduction to revenue. These
provisions are made based on historical experience and changes
in customer preferences.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (using the

first-in,

first-out
method) or market value. Cadence’s inventories include high
technology parts and components for complex computer systems
that emulate the performance and operation of computer IC and
electronic systems. These parts and components may be
specialized in nature or subject to rapid technological
obsolescence. While Cadence has programs to minimize the
required inventories on hand and considers technological
obsolescence when estimating required reserves to reduce
recorded amounts to market values, it is reasonably possible
that such estimates could change in the near term.
Cadence’s practice is to reserve for inventory in excess of

12-month

demand.

Property, Plant and
Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost.
Depreciation and amortization are generally provided over the
estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, as
follows:

Cadence capitalizes the costs of software developed for internal
use in compliance with Statement of Position, or SOP, 98-1

Obtained for Internal Use” and with Emerging Issues Task

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Costs.” Capitalization of software developed for internal
use and web site development costs begins at the application
development phase of the project. Cadence capitalized
$32.6 million in 2005, $21.4 million in 2004 and
$21.0 million in 2003. Amortization of software developed
for internal use and web site development costs begins when the
computer software is ready for its intended use, and is computed
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the
software.

Cadence recorded depreciation and amortization expense in the
amount of $68.8 million for 2005, $68.7 million for
2004 and $81.9 million for 2003 for property, plant and
equipment.

Software Development
Costs

Cadence accounts for software development costs in accordance
with SFAS No. 86, “Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise
Marketed.” Software development costs are capitalized
beginning when a product’s technological feasibility has
been established by completion of a working model of the product
and amortization begins when a product is available for general
release to customers. The period between the achievement of
technological feasibility and the general release of
Cadence’s products has typically been of short duration.
Internally-generated software development costs have not been
material.

Cadence capitalized $0.5 million of purchased software
during 2005, $10.3 million of purchased software during
2004 and $4.3 million of purchased software during 2003.
Cadence has deemed the purchased software to have an alternative
future use in accordance with SFAS No. 86. Therefore,
Cadence begins amortization of purchased software when the
technology is available for general release to customers.
Amortization expense related to purchased software was
$4.4 million during 2005, $2.2 million during 2004,
and $0.5 million during 2003.

Acquired Intangibles,
including Goodwill

Acquired intangibles, which include purchased technology and
other intangible assets, are stated at cost less accumulated
amortization and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. In
accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets,” goodwill and purchased intangibles with
indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are reviewed for
impairment at least annually or when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that Cadence will not be able to recover
the asset’s carrying amount. Acquired intangibles with
definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
remaining estimated economic life of the underlying products and
technologies (original lives assigned are one to ten years).

During the third quarters of 2005, 2004 and 2003, Cadence
completed its annual impairment analysis of goodwill. Based on
the results of these impairment reviews, Cadence has determined
that no indicators of impairment existed for its one reporting
unit in 2005, two reporting units in 2004, and three reporting
units in 2003 and, accordingly, no impairment charge was
recognized during 2005, 2004 or 2003.

Long-lived Assets

Cadence’s long-lived assets consist of property, plant and
equipment and other acquired intangibles, excluding goodwill.
Cadence reviews its long-lived assets for impairment in
accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” For assets to
be held and used, Cadence initiates its review whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of an
asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the
expected future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is
expected to generate. If it is determined that an asset is not
recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded in the amount by
which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.
During 2005, Cadence abandoned certain assets and



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

December 31, 2005

recorded a charge of $2.4 million, which is included in
Restructuring and other charges in the accompanying Consolidated
Statements of Operations. During 2004, Cadence abandoned certain
assets and recorded a charge of $9.4 million on long-lived
assets, which charge is included in Restructuring and other
charges in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Operations.

Assets to be disposed of and for which management has committed
to a plan to dispose of the assets, whether through sale or
abandonment, are reported at the lower of carrying amount or
fair value less cost to sell. No assets were deemed to be held
for sale as of December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005.

Marketable and
Non-Marketable Securities

Marketable Securities

Management considers all of its investments in marketable
securities as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities
are stated at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses
presented net of tax and reported as a separate component of
Stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses are
determined using the specific identification method. Gains are
recognized when realized and are recorded in the Consolidated
Statement of Operations as Other income (expense), net. Losses
are recognized as realized or when Cadence has determined that
an other-than-temporary decline in fair value has occurred.

Cadence accounts for marketable securities held in its
non-qualified deferred compensation trusts as trading
securities. Trading securities are stated at fair value, with
the unrealized gains and losses recognized in the Consolidated
Statement of Operations as Other income (expense), net. These
trading securities are classified as Other assets in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets because the securities are not
available for Cadence’s use in its operations.

It is Cadence’s policy to review the fair value of these
marketable securities on a regular basis to determine whether
its investments in these companies are other-than-temporarily
impaired. This evaluation includes, but is not limited to,
reviewing each company’s cash position, financing needs,
earnings or revenue outlook, operational performance, management
or ownership changes and competition. If Cadence believes the
carrying value of an investment is in excess of its fair value,
and this difference is other-than-temporary, it is
Cadence’s policy to write down the investment to reduce its
carrying value to fair value.

Non-Marketable
Securities

Cadence’s non-marketable securities include investments in
privately-held companies that Cadence makes either directly, or
indirectly through venture capital limited partnerships. Cadence
has limited partnership interests in three venture capital
funds, Telos Venture Partners, L.P., or Telos I, Telos
Venture Partners II, L.P., or Telos II, and Telos
Venture Partners III, L.P., or Telos III
(Telos I, Telos II and Telos III are referred to
collectively as Telos).

Cadence and certain of its deferred compensation trusts hold the
entire limited partnership interests in Telos I and
Telos III, and Cadence holds the entire limited partnership
interest in Telos II. The Telos II general partner,
which is not affiliated with Cadence, manages Telos II. The
contractual term of Telos I ended on December 31, 2005 and
Telos I is currently being liquidated. In December 2005, Cadence
notified the general partner of Telos II of its intent to
dissolve the partnership effective December 31, 2006.
Cadence also determined to liquidate Telos III and removed
the general partner of Telos III effective
December 31, 2005. The new general partner, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Cadence, will complete the liquidation of
Telos III.

The partnership agreement governing Telos II requires
Cadence to meet capital calls principally for the purpose of
funding investments that are recommended by the general partner
and approved by the Telos advisory committee as being consistent
with the partnership’s limitations and stated purpose. For
all three partnerships, the Telos advisory committee is
comprised solely of the members of the Venture Committee of



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

December 31, 2005

Cadence’s Board of Directors, the current members of which
are three independent members of Cadence’s Board of
Directors.

As of December 31, 2005, Cadence had contributed
$123.8 million to these partnerships and is contractually
committed to contribute up to an additional $4.3 million to
Telos II through December 31, 2006. Actual future
contributions will depend upon the level of investments made by
Telos II. Cadence’s investments in the Telos
partnerships are recorded in Other assets in the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The investments made by Telos and directly by Cadence are
accounted for using either the cost or equity method of
accounting. Cadence accounts for investments made by Telos as if
Cadence had directly made the investment and, accordingly, all
investments recorded on the equity method of accounting are
adjusted to reflect Cadence’s share of the investee’s
income (loss).

Cadence’s non-marketable securities held by Telos, or by
Cadence directly, are not publicly-traded or contain trading
restrictions. To determine the fair value of publicly-traded
securities with trading restrictions, Cadence considers the
current market price of the security and the specific
characteristics of the restrictions. To determine the fair value
of privately-held investments, Cadence uses the most recent
round of financing or estimates of current fair value using
traditional valuation techniques. It is Cadence’s policy to
review the fair value of these investments held by Telos, as
well as its direct investments, on a regular basis to determine
whether the investments in these companies are
other-than-temporarily impaired. This evaluation includes, but
is not limited to, reviewing each company’s cash position,
financing needs, earnings or revenue outlook, operational
performance, management or ownership changes and competition. In
the case of privately-held companies, this evaluation is based
on information that Cadence requests from these companies. This
information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as
United States publicly-traded companies, and as such, the basis
for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy
of the data received from these companies. If Cadence believes
the carrying value of an investment is in excess of fair value,
and this difference is other-than-temporary, it is
Cadence’s policy to write down the investment to fair value.

Equity Method
Investments

Cadence applies the guidance in Accounting Principles Board
Opinion, or APB, No. 18, “The Equity Method of
Accounting for Investments in Common Stock,” as amended,
and EITF No. 02-14, “Whether an Investor Should Apply
the Equity Method of Accounting to Investments Other Than Common
Stock,” to classify investments as equity method
investments. These investments are held in the form of voting
preferred stock or convertible debt of privately-held companies.
If Cadence determined that it had the ability to exercise
significant influence over the investee and the investment was
in the form of in-substance common stock, the investment was
accounted for under the equity method.

In applying the equity method of accounting, Cadence applies
approach (a) of EITF No. 99-10, “Percentage Used
to Determine the Amount of Equity Method Losses.”
Accordingly, the portion of equity method loss or income
recorded by Cadence is based on its percentage ownership of each
investee’s preferred stock or convertible debt available to
absorb losses or with contractual rights to income. Its level of
participation in future financings of its equity method
investees may impact Cadence’s proportional share in future
income or losses. Cadence records its interest in equity method
gains and losses in the quarter following incurrence because it
is not practicable to obtain investee financial statements prior
to the issuance of Cadence’s Consolidated Financial
Statements.



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

December 31, 2005

Cost Method
Investments

Investments accounted for by Cadence under the cost method of
accounting are carried at historical cost and Cadence
periodically evaluates the fair value of each investment to
determine if an other-than-temporary decline in value has
occurred.

Deferred Revenue

Deferred revenue arises when customers are billed for products
and/or services in advance of revenue recognition.
Cadence’s deferred revenue consists primarily of unearned
revenue on maintenance and product licenses for which revenue is
recognized in installments over the duration of the license.
Maintenance on perpetual licenses is generally renewed annually,
billed in full in advance, and the corresponding revenue is
recognized over the ensuing

12-month

maintenance
term. The fees under product licenses for which revenue is not
recognized immediately and for maintenance in connection with
term and subscription licenses are generally billed quarterly in
advance and the related revenue is recognized over multiple
periods over the ensuing license period.

Stock-Based
Compensation

As of December 31, 2005, in addition to the Employee Stock
Purchase Plan, or ESPP, Cadence had four stock-based employee
compensation plans and a director stock option plan. Cadence
accounts for these plans under the recognition and measurement
principles of APB No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees,” and related interpretations. Under APB
No. 25, compensation expense is recognized if an
option’s exercise price on the measurement date is below
the fair value of Cadence’s common stock. The compensation,
if any, is amortized to expense over the vesting period.

The table below provides a pro forma illustration of the
financial results of operations as if Cadence had accounted for
its grants of employee stock options under the fair value method
of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock —
Based Compensation.” The impact of employee stock options
on the pro forma financial results of operations was estimated
at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model. Cadence used expected volatility, as well as other
economic data, to estimate the volatility for the option grants
during the years ended 2005, 2004 and 2003 because management
believes the amount yielded by this method is representative of
prospective trends. Cadence considered implied volatility in
market-traded options on its common stock as well as third party
volatility quotes. Cadence determined the estimated fair values
of its options granted and shares purchased under its ESPPs for
the years ended 2005, 2004 and 2003 using the following weighted
average assumptions, assuming a dividend yield of zero for all
periods:

The following table illustrates the effect on net income (loss)
and net income (loss) per share as if Cadence had applied the
fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to
stock-based compensation:

Cadence corrected its 2004 and 2003 pro forma stock compensation
disclosure to correct an error in the disclosure included in
stock-based employee compensation expense determined under the
fair-value method for all awards, net of related tax effects.
The correction resulted in a $23.8 million increase in 2004
and a $23.7 million increase in 2003 to the stock-based
employee compensation expense determined under the fair-value
method for all awards, net of related tax effects, and a
$23.8 million decrease to proforma net income in 2004 and a
$23.7 million increase in proforma net loss in 2003.

For fixed awards, as defined by APB No. 25, Cadence
amortizes deferred stock compensation to expense using the
straight-line method over the period that the stock options and
restricted stock vest, which is generally three to four years.
For variable awards, as defined by APB No. 25, stock-based
compensation expense is recognized on an accelerated basis in
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB,
Interpretation No. 28, “Accounting for Stock
Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award
Plans.”

Comprehensive Income

Other comprehensive income includes foreign currency translation
gains and losses and unrealized gains and losses on marketable
securities that are available-for-sale that have been excluded
from net income (loss) and reflected instead in
stockholders’ equity. Cadence has reported the components
of comprehensive income in its Consolidated Statements of
Stockholders’ Equity. Cadence reclassified
$9.2 million in 2005, net of $3.7 million of tax,
$6.8 million in 2004, net of $2.7 million of tax, and
$0 in 2003, from unrealized holding gains and losses on
marketable securities to realized gains included in Other income
(expense), net, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Operations. The tax expense (benefit) for gross unrealized
holding gains (losses) in marketable equity securities was
$(1.2) million in 2005, $(16.4) million in 2004 and
$3.8 million in 2003.

Revenue Recognition

Cadence applies the provisions of SOP, 97-2 “Software
Revenue Recognition,” as amended by SOP 98-9
“Modification of
SOP

97-2,

Software
Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions,”
to all product revenue transactions where the software is not
incidental. Cadence also applies the provisions of SFAS
No. 13, “Accounting for Leases,” to all hardware
lease transactions. Cadence recognizes revenue when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been
delivered, the fee is fixed or determinable, collection of the
resulting receivable is probable, and vendor-specific objective
evidence of fair value, or VSOE, exists.

Cadence licenses software using three different license types:

•

Subscription licenses

— software licensed for a
    specific time period, generally two to three years, with no
    rights to return and limited rights to exchange the licensed
    software for unspecified technology in the future. In general,
    revenue associated with subscription licenses is recognized
    ratably over the term of the license commencing upon the later
    of the effective date of the license or delivery of the licensed
    product.

•

Term licenses

— software licensed for a
    specific time period, generally two to three years, with no
    rights to return and, generally, limited rights to exchange the
    licensed software for technology available at the time of
    purchase. In general, revenue associated with term licenses is
    recognized upon the later of the effective date of the license
    or delivery of the licensed product.

•

Perpetual licenses

— software licensed on a
    perpetual basis with no right to return or exchange the licensed
    software. In general, revenue associated with perpetual licenses
    is recognized upon the later of the effective date of the
    license or delivery of the licensed product.

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement

—
Generally, Cadence uses the customer signed contract as evidence
of an arrangement for subscription and term licenses and
hardware leases. If a customer signed contract does not exist,
Cadence has historically used a purchase order as evidence of an
arrangement for perpetual licenses, hardware sales, maintenance
renewals and small fixed-price service projects, such as
training classes and small methodology service engagements of
approximately $10,000 or less. For all other service
engagements, Cadence uses a signed professional services
agreement and a statement of work to evidence an arrangement. In
cases where both a signed contract and a purchase order exist,
Cadence considers the signed contract to be the most persuasive
evidence of the arrangement. Sales through Cadence’s
distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the
relationship, together with binding purchase orders from the
distributor on a transaction-by-transaction basis.

Product delivery

— Software and the
corresponding access keys are generally delivered to customers
electronically. Electronic delivery occurs when Cadence provides
the customer access to the software. Occasionally, Cadence will
deliver the software on a compact disc with standard transfer
terms of

free-on

-board,
or F.O.B., shipping point. Cadence’s software license
agreements generally do not contain conditions for acceptance.
With respect to hardware, delivery of an entire system is deemed
to occur upon its successful installation. For certain hardware
products, installation is the responsibility of the customer, as
the system is fully functional at the time of shipment. For
these products, delivery is deemed to be complete when the
products are shipped with freight terms of F.O.B. shipping point.

Fee is fixed or determinable

— Cadence assesses
whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the
arrangement, primarily based on the payment terms associated
with the transaction. Cadence has established a history of
collecting under the original contract without providing
concessions on payments, products or services. For installment
contracts that do not include a substantial up front payment,
Cadence may only determine that a fee is fixed or determinable
if the arrangement has payment periods that are equal



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

December 31, 2005

to or less than the term of the licenses and the payments are
collected in equal or nearly equal installments, when evaluated
over the entire term of the arrangement.

Significant judgment is involved in assessing whether a fee is
fixed or determinable, including assessing whether a contract
amendment to a term arrangement constitutes a concession.
Cadence’s experience has been that it is able to determine
whether a fee is fixed or determinable for term licenses. While
Cadence does not expect that experience to change, if Cadence no
longer were to have a history of collecting under the original
contract without providing concessions on term licenses, revenue
from term licenses would be required to be recognized when
payments under the installment contract become due and payable.
Such a change could have a material impact on Cadence’s
results of operations.

Collection is probable

— Cadence has concluded
that collection is not probable for license arrangements
executed with customers in certain countries. For all other
countries, Cadence assesses the probability of collecting from
each customer at the outset of the arrangement based on a number
of factors, including the customer’s payment history and
its current creditworthiness. If in Cadence’s judgment
collection of a fee is not probable, Cadence defers the revenue
until the uncertainty is removed, which generally means revenue
is recognized upon receipt of cash payment. Cadence’s
experience has been that it is able to estimate whether
collection is probable. While Cadence does not expect that
experience to change, if Cadence were to determine that
collection is not probable for any license arrangement,
particularly those with installment payment terms, revenue from
such license would be recognized generally upon the receipt of
cash payment. Such a change could have a material impact on
Cadence’s results of operations.

Vendor-specific objective evidence of fair
value

— Cadence’s VSOE for certain product
elements of an arrangement is based upon the pricing in
comparable transactions when the element is sold separately.
VSOE for maintenance is generally based upon the customer’s
stated annual renewal rates. VSOE for services is generally
based on the price charged when the services are sold
separately. For multiple element arrangements, VSOE must exist
to allocate the total fee among all delivered and undelivered
elements of the arrangement. If VSOE does not exist for all
elements to support the allocation of the total fee among all
delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement, revenue
is deferred until such evidence does exist for the undelivered
elements, or until all elements are delivered, whichever is
earlier. If VSOE of all undelivered elements exists but VSOE
does not exist for one or more delivered elements, revenue is
recognized using the residual method. Under the residual method,
the VSOE of the undelivered elements is deferred, and the
remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as
revenue as the elements are delivered. Cadence’s experience
has been that it is able to estimate VSOE. While Cadence does
not expect that experience to change, if Cadence could no longer
support VSOE for undelivered elements of multiple element
arrangements, revenue would be deferred until Cadence has VSOE
for the undelivered elements or all elements are delivered,
whichever is earlier. Such a change could have a material impact
on Cadence’s results of operations.

Finance fee revenue

— Finance fees result from
discounting to present value the product revenue derived from
installment contracts in which the payment terms extend beyond
one year from the effective date of the contract. Finance fees
are recognized using a method that approximates the effective
interest method over the relevant license term and are
classified as product revenue. Finance fee revenue represented
2% of total revenue for each of the years ended
December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005 and 1% of total
revenue for the year ended January 3, 2004. Upon the sale
of an installment contract, Cadence recognizes the remaining
finance fee revenue associated with the installment contract.

Services revenue

— Services revenue consists
primarily of revenue received for performing design and
methodology services. These services are not related to the
functionality of the products licensed. Revenue from service
contracts is recognized either on the time and materials method,
as work is performed, or on the

percentage-of

-completion
method. For contracts with fixed or

not-to

-exceed fees,
Cadence estimates on a monthly basis the

percentage-of

-completion,
which is based on the completion of milestones relating to the



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

December 31, 2005

arrangement. Cadence has a history of accurately estimating
project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A
number of internal and external factors can affect these
estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency
variances and specification and testing requirement changes. If
different conditions were to prevail such that accurate
estimates could not be made, then the use of the completed
contract method would be required and the recognition of all
revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was
completed. Such a change could have a material impact on
Cadence’s results of operations.

Accounting for Income
Taxes

Cadence uses the asset and liability method to account for
income taxes. Under this method, Cadence is required to estimate
its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it
operates. This process involves estimating actual current tax
liabilities together with assessing temporary differences
resulting from differing treatment of items, such as deferred
revenue, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences
result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that includes the enactment date. Cadence
then assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be
recovered from future taxable income, and to the extent it
believes that recovery is not likely, Cadence must establish a
valuation allowance. To the extent Cadence establishes a
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets or increases this
allowance in a period, Cadence may need to include an expense
within the tax provision in its Consolidated Statements of
Operations.

Significant management judgment is required in determining the
provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities
and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax
assets. The valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable
income for each jurisdiction in which Cadence operates and the
period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable. In
the event that actual results differ from these estimates or
Cadence adjusts these estimates in future periods, Cadence may
need to establish an additional valuation allowance, which could
materially affect its financial position and results of
operations.

Restructuring Charges

Cadence accounts for restructuring charges in accordance with
SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100,
“Restructuring and Impairment Charges,” as amended.
Since 2001, Cadence has undertaken significant restructuring
initiatives. The individual components of the restructuring
activities initiated prior to fiscal 2003 were accounted for in
accordance with EITF No. 94-3, “Liability Recognition
for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to
Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring),” and EITF No. 88-10, “Costs
Associated with Lease Modifications or Terminations.”

For restructuring activities initiated after fiscal 2002,
Cadence accounted for the leased facilities in accordance with
SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities.” In addition, for all
periods presented, we accounted for the asset-related portions
of these restructurings in accordance with
SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” For all periods presented,
the severance and benefits charges were accounted for in
accordance with SFAS No. 112, “Employers’
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits — An Amendment
of FASB Statements No. 5 and 43.”

These restructuring initiatives have required Cadence to make a
number of estimates and assumptions related to losses on excess
facilities vacated or consolidated, particularly the timing of
subleases and sublease terms. Closure and space reduction costs
included in the restructuring charges include payments required
under leases less any applicable estimated sublease income after
the facilities are abandoned, lease buyout costs and costs to
maintain facilities during the period after abandonment.



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

December 31, 2005

In addition, Cadence has recorded estimated provisions for
termination benefits and outplacement costs, long-term asset
impairments, and other restructuring costs. Cadence regularly
evaluates the adequacy of its restructuring accrual, and adjusts
the balance based on changes in estimates and assumptions.
Cadence may incur future charges for new restructuring
activities as well as for changes in estimates to amounts
previously recorded.

Concentrations of Credit
Risk

Financial instruments, including derivative financial
instruments, that may potentially subject Cadence to
concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of cash and
cash equivalents, short-term investments, long-term investments,
accounts receivable and forward contracts. Concentration of
credit risk related to accounts receivable is limited, due to
the varied customers comprising Cadence’s customer base and
their dispersion across geographical locations. Credit exposure
related to the forward contracts is limited to the realized and
unrealized gains on these contracts. Cadence issued options and
warrants to hedge potential dilution of its convertible notes,
as described more fully in Note 8. Changes in the fair
value of these convertible notes hedge and warrant transactions
will not be recognized as long as the instruments remain
classified as equity. All financial instruments are executed
with financial institutions having strong credit ratings, which
minimizes risk of loss due to nonpayment.

Fair Value of Financial
Instruments

The fair value of Cadence’s cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments, receivables, foreign currency forward
exchange contracts and accounts payable approximate their
carrying value due to the short-term nature of these
instruments. The fair market values of Cadence’s long-term
investments, convertible notes, term loan, capital lease
obligations and installment contract receivables approximate
their carrying values based upon current market rates of
interest.

Leases

Cadence conducts its operations primarily under operating
leases. For leases that contain rent escalations or rent
concessions, Cadence records the total rent payable during the
lease term on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Cadence records the difference between the rents paid and the
straight-line rent as a deferred rent liability in the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Advertising

Cadence expenses the costs of advertising as incurred.
Advertising expense was approximately $9.0 million for
2005, $11.6 million for 2004 and $10.5 million for
2003, and is included in Marketing and sales in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Reclassifications

Cadence reclassified the net gains and losses from its
non-qualified deferred compensation plan in its Consolidated
Statements of Operations, which decreased Deferred compensation
by $5.0 million in 2004 and increased Deferred compensation
by $6.5 million in 2003. Cadence also reclassified the
losses on the sales of installment contract receivables, which
increased General and administrative expense by
$2.0 million in 2004 and $5.0 million in 2003.
Together, these reclassifications decreased Other income
(expense), net, by $3.0 million in 2004 and increased Other
income (expense), net, by $11.5 million in 2003.

ACQUISITIONS

For each of the acquisitions described below, the results of
operations and the estimated fair value of the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed have been included in Cadence’s
Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of the
acquisition.

Comparative pro forma financial information for all 2005, 2004
and 2003 acquisitions have not been presented because the
results of operations were not material to Cadence’s
Consolidated Financial Statements.

2005 Acquisition

Verisity Ltd.

In April 2005, Cadence acquired Verisity Ltd., or Verisity, an
Israeli corporation. Verisity was a publicly-held provider of
verification process automation solutions. Cadence purchased
Verisity to acquire key personnel and technology. The aggregate
initial purchase price was $325.4 million, which included
the payment of $304.6 million of cash, $10.6 million
of assumed options at fair value, $6.9 million of
acquisition costs and $3.3 million of contract termination
costs.

The following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the
purchase price for Verisity and the estimated amortization
period for the acquired intangibles:

The $9.4 million of purchase price allocated to acquired
in-process technology was determined through established
valuation techniques. The acquired in-process technology was
immediately expensed because technological feasibility had not
been established, and no future alternative use exists. The
write-off of acquired in-process technology is a component of
operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

For tax purposes, approximately $160.0 million of the
goodwill is expected to be deductible.

2004 Acquisitions

Neolinear, Inc.

In April 2004, Cadence acquired Neolinear, Inc., or Neolinear, a
privately-held developer of rapid analog design technology.
Cadence purchased Neolinear to acquire key personnel and
technology. As discussed in Note 7, prior to the
acquisition Cadence held an investment in Neolinear of
$3.0 million, representing 12% ownership, which was
accounted for under the equity method of accounting. In
accordance with SFAS No. 141, “Business
Combinations,” Cadence accounted for the acquisition of
Neolinear as a step acquisition. The aggregate initial purchase
price was $78.1 million, which included the payment of
cash, the fair value of assumed options and acquisition costs.
The purchase price and goodwill will increase if certain
performance goals related to revenue targets and product
development are achieved over a period of approximately four
years following the acquisition.

The following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the
purchase price for Neolinear and the estimated amortization
period for the acquired intangibles:

The $38.3 million of goodwill is not expected to be
deductible for income tax purposes.

Other 2004 Acquisition

During the year ended January 1, 2005, Cadence acquired one
other company for an aggregate initial purchase price of
$9.2 million, which included the payment of cash, the fair
value of assumed options and acquisition costs. The
$5.9 million of goodwill recorded in connection with this
acquisition is not expected to be deductible for income tax
purposes.

2003 Acquisitions

Verplex Systems, Inc.

In August 2003, Cadence acquired Verplex Systems, Inc., or
Verplex, a privately-held developer of verification technology.
Cadence purchased Verplex to acquire key personnel and
technology. The aggregate initial purchase price was
$87.6 million, which included the payment of cash, the fair
value of assumed options

increase if certain performance goals related to bookings and
product development are achieved over a period of approximately
three years following the acquisition.

The following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the
purchase price for Verplex and the estimated amortization period
for the acquired intangibles:

The $56.5 million of goodwill is not expected to be

Distribution Rights of
Innotech Corporation

In June 2003, Cadence acquired distribution rights to certain
customers, certain assets and key personnel from Innotech
Corporation, or Innotech, a publicly-traded developer and
distributor of software, electronic devices and semiconductor
manufacturing equipment in Japan. Concurrent with this
acquisition, Cadence also modified its distributor agreement
with Innotech. Prior to the acquisition, Cadence licensed most
of its software products in Japan through Innotech. Cadence now
directly licenses its software products to customers for which
Cadence acquired the distribution rights from Innotech. As of
December 31, 2005, Cadence was an approximately 7%
stockholder of Innotech.

Cadence considered SFAS No. 141, “Business
Combinations,” and EITF No. 98-3, “Determining
Whether a Nonmonetary Transaction Involves Receipt of Productive
Assets or of a Business,” in concluding that a business was
acquired in this transaction. Cadence also determined that the
modification to the distributor arrangement and the agreement to
acquire a portion of Innotech’s business should be combined
for the purposes of determining the total initial purchase
price, as both of these agreements with Innotech were entered
into concurrently.

technology. Cadence purchased Get2Chip to acquire key personnel
and technology. The aggregate initial purchase price was
$80.5 million, which included the payment of cash, the fair
value of assumed options and acquisition costs. The purchase
price and goodwill will increase if certain performance goals
related to bookings are achieved over a period of approximately
three years following the acquisition.

Other 2003
Acquisitions

In the year ended January 3, 2004, Cadence also acquired
two other companies for an initial aggregate purchase price of
$18.9 million, which included the payment of cash and
acquisition costs. The purchase price and goodwill will increase
if certain performance goals related to revenue, product
proliferation, product development or employee retention are
achieved over a period of approximately three or four years
following the acquisition.

Goodwill of $9.6 million recorded in connection with these
acquisitions is not expected to be deductible for income tax
purposes.

Acquisition-Related
Earnouts

For many of Cadence’s acquisitions, payment of a portion of
the purchase price is contingent upon the acquired
business’ achievement of certain performance goals, which
relate to one or more of the following criteria: revenue,
bookings, product proliferation, product development and
employee retention. The portion of the contingent purchase
price, or earnout, associated with employee retention is
recorded as compensation expense. The specific performance goal
levels, and amounts and timing of earnout payments, vary with
each acquisition.

During the year ended December 31, 2005, Cadence recorded
$27.5 million of goodwill for earnouts payable to former
stockholders of acquired companies as a result of the
achievement of certain performance goals. The $27.5 million
of earnouts consisted of $23.5 million of cash payments
made prior to December 31, 2005, the issuance of
0.1 million shares of Cadence’s common stock valued at
$1.3 million and $2.7 million accrued in Accounts
payable and accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet as of December 31, 2005.



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

payable to former stockholders of acquired companies as a result
of the achievement of certain performance goals. The
$40.6 million of goodwill consisted of $17.0 million
of actual cash payments, $7.2 million of accrued cash
payments and the issuance of 1.1 million shares of
Cadence’s common stock valued at $16.4 million. In
addition, Cadence recognized stock compensation expense of
$1.2 million in connection with these acquisitions in
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
Interpretation No. 44, “Accounting for Certain
Transactions Involving Stock Compensation (an Interpretation of
APB No. 25).”

In the year ended January 3, 2004, Cadence recorded
$52.3 million of goodwill as contingent purchase price
payable to former stockholders of acquired companies as a result
of the achievement of certain performance goals. The
$52.3 million of goodwill consisted of $2.4 million in
cash and the issuance of 3.2 million shares of
Cadence’s common stock valued at $49.9 million.
Cadence also recorded additional stock compensation expense of
$7.8 million representing the issuance or reserve for
issuance of 0.4 million shares for earnouts achieved during
2003. In addition, Cadence recorded $0.5 million in
deferred stock compensation for estimated future earnouts in
accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 28,
“Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other
Variable Stock Option or Award Plans.”

In connection with Cadence’s acquisitions completed prior
to December 31, 2005, Cadence may be obligated to pay up to
an aggregate of $27.0 million in cash during the next
12 months and an additional $7.0 million in cash in
periods after the next 12 months through September 2008 if
certain performance goals related to one or more of the
following criteria are achieved in full: revenue, bookings,
product proliferation, product development and employee
retention.

Write-off of Acquired
In-Process Research and Development

Acquired in-process research and development charges represent
in-process research and development that had not reached
technological feasibility at the time of acquisition and had no
probable alternative future use.

For acquisitions completed during 2005, 2004 and 2003, the
purchase price allocated to acquired in-process research and
development was determined through established valuation
techniques. The acquired in-process research and development was
immediately expensed because technological feasibility had not
been established, and no future alternative use exists. The
write-off of acquired in-process research and development is a

GOODWILL AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES

Goodwill

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets,” Cadence conducts an annual
impairment analysis of goodwill, which it completed during the
third quarter of 2005. Based on the results of the impairment
review, Cadence has determined that no indicators of impairment
existed for its single reporting unit during 2005.

For purposes of SFAS No. 142, Cadence operates under
one reporting unit. Cadence’s annual impairment review
process compares the fair value of its reporting unit to its
carrying value, including the goodwill related to the reporting
unit. To determine the reporting unit’s fair value, Cadence
utilized the market valuation approach in the current year
evaluation.

The market approach provides an estimate of the fair value of
Cadence based on the total number of Cadence common shares
outstanding multiplied by the price per common share. The
estimated fair value is then compared to the carrying value of
Cadence’s net assets. If the carrying value of
Cadence’s net assets is greater than the aggregate market
value of its common shares outstanding, additional fair value
analyses are performed on the individual intangible assets,

During the year ended December 31, 2005, Cadence recorded
other adjustments of $4.4 million in the carrying amount of
goodwill primarily as a result of a $3.0 million reduction
for foreign currency translation and a $1.4 million
reduction due to adjustments to the initial purchase price of
certain acquisitions, which primarily consists of changes
estimated sublease income from facilities acquired as part of
previous acquisitions.

Non-Marketable
Securities

Cadence uses either the cost or equity method of accounting to
account for its long-term, non-marketable investment securities,
which are included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets. Net realized gains on the sale of non-marketable
investments were $2.5 million in 2005, $5.7 million in
2004 and $0 in 2003. If Cadence determines that an
other-than-temporary decline exists in a non-marketable equity
security, Cadence writes down the investment to its fair value
and records the related write-down as an investment loss in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

NOTE 8.

CONVERTIBLE NOTES

In August 2003, Cadence issued $420.0 million principal
amount of Zero Coupon Zero Yield Senior Convertible Notes due
2023, or the Notes, to two initial purchasers in a private
offering for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant
to SEC Rule 144A. Cadence received net proceeds of
approximately $406.4 million after transaction fees of
approximately $13.6 million that were recorded in Other
long-term assets and are being amortized to interest expense
using the straight-line method over five years, which is the
duration of the first redemption period. The Notes were issued
by Cadence at par and bear no interest. The Notes are
convertible into Cadence common stock initially at a conversion
price of $15.65 per share, which would result in an
aggregate of 26.8 million shares issued upon conversion,
subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events.
Cadence may redeem for cash all or any part of the Notes on or
after August 15, 2008 for 100.00% of the principal amount.
The holders of the Notes may require Cadence to repurchase for
cash all or any portion of their Notes on August 15, 2008
for 100.25% of the principal amount, on August 15, 2013 for
100.00% of the principal amount or on August 15, 2018 for
100.00% of the principal amount, by providing to the paying
agent a written repurchase notice. The repurchase notice must be
delivered during the period commencing 30 business days prior to
the relevant repurchase date and ending on the close of business
on the

business day prior to the relevant repurchase date. Cadence may
redeem for cash all or any part of the Notes on or after
August 15, 2008 for 100.00% of the principal amount, except
for those Notes that holders have required Cadence to repurchase
on August 15, 2008 or on other repurchase dates, as
described above.

Each $1,000 of principal of the Notes will initially be
convertible into 63.8790 shares of Cadence common stock,
subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events.
Holders of the Notes may convert their Notes prior to maturity
only if: (1) the price of Cadence’s common stock
reaches $22.69 during certain periods of time specified in the
Notes, (2) specified corporate transactions occur,
(3) the Notes have been called for redemption or
(4) the trading price of the Notes falls below a certain
threshold. As this fourth conversion feature is linked to the
trading price of the Notes, which are traded in an observable
market that differs from the one in which Cadence’s common
stock is traded, the conversion feature meets the definition of
a derivative that must be accounted for separately at fair
value. The fair value of this conversion feature was not
material at inception of the Notes or as of December 31,
2005. As of December 31, 2005, none of the conditions
allowing holders of the Notes to convert had been met.

In addition, in the event of a significant change in
Cadence’s corporate ownership or structure, the holders may
require Cadence to repurchase all or any portion of their Notes
for 100.00% of the principal amount. Upon a significant change
in Cadence’s corporate ownership or structure, in certain
circumstances, Cadence may choose to pay the repurchase price in
cash, shares of Cadence’s common stock or a combination of
cash and shares of Cadence’s common stock.

Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, Cadence entered
into convertible notes hedge transactions with JP Morgan Chase
Bank whereby Cadence has the option to purchase up to
26.8 million shares of Cadence’s common stock at a
price of $15.65 per share. These options expire on
August 15, 2008 and must be settled in net shares. The cost
of the convertible notes hedge transactions to Cadence was
approximately $134.6 million.

In addition, Cadence sold warrants to JP Morgan Chase Bank for
the purchase of up to 26.8 million shares of Cadence’s
common stock at a price of $23.08 per share. The warrants
expire on various dates from February 2008 through May 2008 and
must be settled in net shares. Cadence received approximately
$56.4 million in cash proceeds for the sales of these
warrants.

The costs incurred in connection with the convertible notes
hedge transactions and the proceeds from the sale of the
warrants are included as a net reduction in common stock and
capital in excess of par in the accompanying Consolidated
Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2005 and January 1,
2004, in accordance with the guidance in EITF
No.

00-19,

“Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed
to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own
Stock.” As of December 31, 2005, the estimated fair
value of the options acquired in the convertible notes hedge
transaction was $130.8 million and the estimated fair value
of the warrants sold was $29.6 million, however subsequent
changes in the fair value of these convertible notes hedge and
warrant transactions will not be recognized as long as the
instruments remain classified as equity.

EITF No. 04-08, “Accounting Issues Related to Certain
Features of Contingently Convertible Debt and the Effect on
Diluted Earnings per Share,” requires Cadence to include in
diluted earnings per share the approximately 26.8 million
shares of Cadence common stock into which the Notes may be
converted, using the “if-converted” method. Because
Cadence entered into the convertible notes hedge transactions
and the sale of the warrants, upon conversion of the Notes there
will be no other impact on basic or dilutive earnings per share,
or EPS, except as described above under EITF No. 04-08,
unless the price of Cadence’s common stock exceeds the
warrant strike price of $23.08 per share. Up to
$23.08 per share, in connection with any conversion, the
operation of the convertible notes hedge transactions and sale
of the warrants would effectively result in no impact on basic
or dilutive EPS. In the event Cadence’s common stock
exceeds $23.08 per share, for the first $1.00 the price
exceeds $23.08, there would be dilution of approximately
1.1 million shares and the impact on the calculation of EPS
will vary depending on when during the quarter the
$23.08 per share price is

reached. As this share price continues to increase, dilution
would continue to occur but at a declining rate. If these
transactions settle in Cadence’s favor, Cadence could be
exposed to credit risk related to the other party to the
transactions.

Subsequent to the issuance of the Notes in 2003, Cadence
terminated its 2002 senior credit facilities.

NOTE 9.

TERM LOAN

On December 19, 2005, Castlewilder, a company incorporated
in Ireland and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cadence, entered
into a syndicated term facility agreement, or Credit Agreement,
with Banc of America Securities LLC as lead arranger, Bank of
America, N.A. as Administrative Agent. The Credit Agreement
provides for a three-year $160 million unsecured term loan.
With the consent of all of the lenders, Castlewilder may, at the
end of the second year of the loan, extend the maturity date to
December 31, 2009.

During the term of the Credit Agreement, Castlewilder has the
option to choose between two interest rates: (i) a base
rate equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate plus a spread
of 0.50% or the “prime rate” publicly announced by
Bank of America, N.A., or (ii) a LIBOR-based rate equal to
LIBOR plus a spread of 0.625%. The loan initially was a base
rate loan that converted on December 22, 2005 into a
LIBOR-based rate loan, which accrued interest monthly at a rate
of 4.995% as of December 31, 2005. Cadence can change its
interest rate election each Interest Period, as defined in the
loan agreement. The margin with respect to the loan (if the loan
is a LIBOR loan) may be increased or decreased depending upon
Cadence’s consolidated leverage ratio.

Castlewilder is obligated to repay the outstanding principal
amount of the loan in quarterly installments in amounts equal to
$8.0 million per quarter during 2006, $12.0 million
per quarter during 2007 and $20.0 million per quarter
during 2008 (with the quarterly repayment amount to be adjusted
to $10.0 million per quarter during 2008 and 2009, if the
maturity date of the loan is extended). Castlewilder is also
obligated to pay accrued interest on the last day of each month
or other interest period that Castlewilder may select under the
terms of the Credit Agreement. If the loan is converted into a
base rate loan, Castlewilder is obligated to pay accrued
interest on the last day of each quarter.

Castlewilder’s obligations under the Credit Agreement are
unconditionally guaranteed by Cadence and Cadence Technology
Limited, or CTL, a company incorporated in Ireland and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Castlewilder, pursuant to guaranties
entered into by Cadence and CTL in favor of the lenders on
December 19, 2005.

In the event of (i) non-payment of any amounts due under
the financing documents, (ii) non-compliance with any other
provisions of the financing documents, (iii) any
representation or statement made in the financing documents
proving to have been incorrect or misleading at the time it was
made, (iv) certain insolvency events, insolvency
proceedings or creditor’s process with respect to
Castlewilder and CTL, (v) Castlewilder or CTL ceasing to be
either direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Cadence,
(vi) it becoming unlawful for Castlewilder, CTL or Cadence
to perform any material obligation under the financing
documents, or (vii) any default under the Cadence Guaranty,
then the Administrative Agent may declare that all or part of
the loan, together with accrued interest and all other amounts
accrued and outstanding under the financing documents, to be
immediately due and payable.

The Credit Agreement and the CTL Guaranty contain certain
customary representations and warranties, affirmative and
negative covenants and indemnification obligations of
Castlewilder and CTL. The Credit Agreement also provides for
certain tax

gross-up

payment obligations of Castlewilder. The Cadence Guaranty also
contains representations and warranties, affirmative covenants,
negative covenants relating to, among other matters, incurrence
of liens and indebtedness, the making of investments and asset
dispositions, as well as a requirement to maintain a minimum
consolidated interest coverage ratio and consolidated leverage
ratio.

A breach by Castlewilder, Cadence or CTL of any of these
representations, warranties or covenants could cause an event of
default under the applicable financing document and allow the
Administrative Agent to declare that all or part of the loan,
together with accrued interest and all other amounts accrued and
outstanding under the financing documents, to be immediately due
and payable. The Cadence Guaranty also contains indemnification
obligations on the part of Cadence. As of December 31,

Agreement are as follows:

CONTINGENCIES

Legal Proceedings

From time to time, Cadence is involved in various disputes and
litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of
business. These include disputes and lawsuits related to
intellectual property, mergers and acquisitions, licensing,
contract law, distribution arrangements and employee relations
matters. Periodically, Cadence reviews the status of each
significant matter and assesses its potential financial
exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal
proceeding is considered probable and a range of possible losses
can be estimated, Cadence accrues a liability for the estimated
loss at the low end of the range. Legal proceedings are subject
to uncertainties, and the outcomes are difficult to predict.
Because of such uncertainties, accruals are based only on the
best information available at the time. As additional
information becomes available, Cadence reassesses the potential
liability related to pending claims and litigation matters and
may revise estimates.

While the outcome of these litigation matters cannot be
predicted with any certainty, management does not believe that
the outcome of any current matters will have a material adverse
effect on Cadence’s consolidated financial position or
results of operations.

Other Contingencies

Cadence provides its customers with a warranty on sales of
hardware products for a

90-day

period. These
warranties are accounted for in accordance with
SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies.”
To date, Cadence has not incurred any significant costs related
to warranty obligations.

Cadence’s product license and services agreements include a
limited indemnification provision for claims from third parties
relating to Cadence’s intellectual property. Such
indemnification provisions are accounted for in accordance with
SFAS No. 5. The indemnification is generally limited
to the amount paid by the customer. To date, claims under such
indemnification provisions have not been significant.

The Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, and other tax authorities
regularly examine Cadence’s income tax returns. In November
2003, the IRS completed its field examination of Cadence’s
federal income tax returns for the tax years 1997 through 1999
and issued a Revenue Agent’s Report, or the RAR, in which
the IRS proposes to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the
three-year period of approximately $143.0 million, plus
interest, which interest will accrue until the matter is
resolved. This interest is compounded daily at rates published
by the IRS, which rates are adjusted quarterly and have been
between four and nine percent since 1997. The RAR is not a final
Statutory Notice of Deficiency, and Cadence has protested
certain of the proposed adjustments with the Appeals Office of
the IRS where the matter is presently being considered. The most
significant of the disputed adjustments relates to transfer
pricing arrangements that Cadence has with a foreign subsidiary.
Cadence believes that the proposed IRS adjustments are
inconsistent with applicable tax laws, and that Cadence has
meritorious defenses to the proposed adjustments. The IRS may
also make similar claims for years subsequent to 1999.

The IRS is currently examining Cadence’s federal income tax
returns for the tax years 2000 through 2002 and may challenge
the tax reported on these tax returns.

Significant judgment is required in determining Cadence’s
provision for income taxes. The calculation of Cadence’s
tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the
application of complex tax regulations. In determining the
adequacy of its provision for income taxes, Cadence has assessed
the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax
examinations, including the current IRS examination and the IRS
RAR for tax years 1997 through 1999. Cadence provides for tax
liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheets unless it
considers it probable that additional taxes will not be due.
However, the ultimate outcome of tax examinations cannot be
predicted with certainty, including the total amount payable or
the timing of any such payments



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

December 31, 2005

upon resolution of these issues. In addition, Cadence cannot be
certain that such amount will not be materially different than
that which is reflected in its historical income tax provisions
and accruals. Should the IRS or other tax authorities assess
additional taxes as a result of a current or a future
examination, Cadence may be required to record charges to
operations in future periods that could have a material adverse
effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash
flows in the period or periods recorded.

During 2005, Cadence entered into a definitive sale-leaseback
agreement involving certain land and buildings in San Jose,
California. The agreement stipulates that Cadence and the
purchaser must receive certain approvals from local
municipalities prior to June 30, 2006. If these conditions
are met or waived by Cadence and the purchaser prior to
June 30, 2006, Cadence would complete the sale of the
buildings and lease the buildings from the purchaser for two
years, with an option to extend the lease for an additional six
months.

NOTE 12.

LEGAL SETTLEMENTS

In September 2003, Cadence entered into a settlement with Mentor
Graphics Corporation, pursuant to which Cadence, Mentor and
their respective affiliated parties settled all outstanding
litigation between the companies and such affiliated parties
relating to emulation and acceleration systems. The companies
also agreed that, for a period of seven years, neither will sue
the other over patented emulation and acceleration technology.
Mentor also paid Cadence $18.0 million in cash as part of
the settlement. Net of related legal costs, Cadence recorded a
gain for the settlement of $14.5 million during the year
ended January 3, 2004.

NOTE 13.

NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE

Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net
income (loss), the numerator, by the weighted average number of
shares of common stock outstanding, less unvested restricted
stock, the denominator, during the period. Diluted net income
(loss) per share gives effect to equity instruments considered
to be potential common shares, if dilutive, computed using the
treasury stock method of accounting.

Cadence accounts for the effect of its Zero Coupon Zero Yield
Senior Convertible Notes due 2023, or the Notes, in the diluted
earnings per common share calculation using the if-converted
method of accounting. Under that method, the Notes are assumed
to be converted to shares (weighted for the number of days
outstanding in the period) at a conversion price of $15.65, and
amortization of transaction fees, net of taxes, related to the
Notes is added back to net income (loss).

the date of grant and become exercisable over periods of up to
five years and generally expire five to ten years from the date
of grant. Awards of incentive stock granted under the 1987 Plan
vest at times and in installments set forth in the 1987 Plan and
approved by the Board of Directors or its Compensation
Committee, on the basis of continued employment, passage of time
and/or performance criteria.

Under the 1995 and 1993 Directors’ Stock Option Plans,
or the Directors’ Plans, Cadence may grant non-qualified
options to its non-employee directors for up to
3,532,502 shares of common stock at an exercise price not
less than the fair market value of the stock on the date of
grant. Options granted under the Directors’ Plans have
terms of up to ten years. Certain of the option grants vest one
year from the date of grant, and other option grants vest
one-third on the date which is one year from the date of grant
and two-thirds ratably over the subsequent two years. The
1993 Directors Stock Option Plan expired by its terms in
2003 and no further options may be granted thereunder. In
February 2005, the Board of Directors approved an amendment to
the 1995 Directors Stock Option Plan to increase the number
of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the
1995 Directors Stock Option Plan by 500,000 shares for
a total of 3,050,000 shares, which amendment was approved
by stockholders at the 2005 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

Cadence has assumed certain options granted to employees of
acquired companies, or Acquired Options. The Acquired Options
were assumed by Cadence outside of its stock option plans, and
each option is administered under the terms of the respective
original plans of the acquired companies. All of the Acquired
Options have been adjusted to effectuate the price conversion
under the terms of the acquisition agreement between Cadence and
the relevant acquired company. The Acquired Options generally
become exercisable over a four or five year period and generally
expire between five and ten years from the date of grant. No
additional options will be granted under any of the acquired
companies’ plans.

Employee Stock Purchase
Plans (ESPPs)

On July 1, 2001, Cadence adopted two employee stock
purchase plans to allow employees of Tality, the former name of
Cadence’s design services subsidiary, to participate in
Cadence’s employee stock purchase program. The two plans
included the 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which was a
qualified employee stock purchase plan under the Internal
Revenue Code which terminated in January 2003, and the 2001
Non-Qualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the 2001
Non-Qualified ESPP, which was an employee stock purchase plan
not qualified under the Internal Revenue Code and primarily used
for Tality employees located outside the United States. Tality,
now Cadence Engineering Services, employees, including officers
and employee directors of Tality, but excluding 5% or greater
stockholders, were eligible to participate if they were regular
employees who worked 20 hours or more per week. Under
Cadence’s 2001 Non-Qualified ESPP, eligible employees,
which were generally Cadence’s non-United States Design
Foundry employees, could purchase shares of Cadence common stock
during offering periods (not to exceed 27 months) and on
purchase dates as determined by the Board of Directors. The
purchase price of such shares was equal to 85% of the lower of
the fair market value of Cadence common stock on (i) the
first day of the offering period, or (ii) the last day of
the applicable purchase period. The 2001 Non-Qualified ESPP was
terminated in February 2005.

In November 1998, the Board of Directors adopted, and the
stockholders subsequently approved, Cadence’s Amended and
Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which amended and
restated the 1990 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the Employee
Plan. Subsequent amendments approved by the Board of Directors
and stockholders increased the number of shares of common stock
authorized for issuance under the Employee Plan to
38,500,000 shares.

Under the terms of the Employee Plan, employees can choose to
have up to 12% of their annual base earnings plus bonuses
withheld to purchase Cadence common stock. The purchase price of
the stock is 85% of the lower of the fair market value of
Cadence common stock as of the (i) first day of the
offering period or (ii) last day of the applicable purchase
period. The offering periods provide for concurrent
24 month offering periods with a new 24 month offering
period starting every six months. Each offering period will be
divided into four consecutive six-month purchase periods.

The following table presents the common shares issued under
Cadence’s employee stock purchase plans at years ended
2005, 2004 and 2003:

The purchase dates under the Employee Plan are in February and
August.

Stock-Based and Other
Deferred Compensation

Cadence records stock-based compensation expense resulting from
its completed acquisitions. Deferred stock compensation
resulting from these acquisitions represents the intrinsic value
of the stock option grants to employees of the acquired
companies multiplied by the percentage of the remaining vesting
period divided by the total vesting period. Cadence considers
certain stock awards to employees of certain acquired companies
to be variable awards. Accordingly, compensation cost is
adjusted each period for increases or decreases in the intrinsic
value of the shares until the final measurement date.

During 2005 and 2004, Cadence issued 3,798,161 and
3,470,938 shares, respectively, of restricted stock to
certain employees. The restrictions lapse over a period of three
to four years. The fair value of the restricted stock awards
granted was $62.0 million in 2005, $45.6 million in
2004 and $25.7 million in 2003. The fair value of the
restricted stock awards was recorded as a component of deferred
stock compensation and is amortized to stock-based compensation
expense as the restrictions lapse.

Cadence’s SPC Plan provided for the issuance of restricted
shares of Cadence common stock to former employees of Silicon
Perspective Corporation, or SPC, who are now Cadence employees,
upon the satisfaction of certain performance-based criteria in
connection with Cadence’s acquisition of SPC. Restricted
shares were first issued under the SPC Plan in February 2003 and
54% of such issued shares vested immediately. The remaining 46%
vested in 11 equal monthly installments beginning in February
2003 and became fully vested on December 31, 2003. The
second issue date was in April 2004, and these shares were fully
vested when issued. An aggregate of approximately
1.6 million shares were issued and recognized as
stock-based compensation expense under the SPC Plan.

Deferred stock compensation included in the accompanying
Statements of Stockholders’ Equity consists of the
following for the three years ended 2005, 2004 and 2003:

For fixed awards, Cadence amortizes deferred stock compensation
to expense using the straight-line method over the period that
the stock options and restricted stock vest, which is generally
three to four years. For variable awards, stock-based
compensation expense is recognized on an accelerated basis in
accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 28,
“Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other
Variable Stock Option or Award Plans.”

Deferred compensation expense includes stock-based compensation
expense and compensation expense associated with the net gains
and losses from Cadence’s non-qualified deferred
compensation plans. The following table presents the components
of the Deferred compensation expense for the three years ended
2005, 2004 and 2003:

STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Stock Repurchase Plan

In August 2001, the Cadence Board of Directors authorized a
program to repurchase shares of Cadence’s common stock with
a value of up to $500.0 million in the aggregate. Prior to
August 2001, Cadence had authorized three stock repurchase
programs under which it repurchased common stock to satisfy
estimated requirements for shares to be issued under its
employee stock option and purchase plans.

The table below presents the shares repurchased under
Cadence’s stock repurchase programs in 2005, 2004 and 2003:

As of December 31, 2005, the remaining repurchase
authorization under the August 2001 program totaled
$21.9 million. On February 8, 2006, Cadence’s
Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase shares of
Cadence’s common stock with a value of up to an additional
$500.0 million in the aggregate.

Stockholder Rights
Plan

Cadence had a stockholder rights plan to protect its
stockholders’ rights in the event of a proposed or actual
acquisition of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of Cadence
common stock. As amended in February 2000, each share of Cadence
common stock carried a right to purchase one one-thousandth
(1/1000) of a share of Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Cadence at a
price of $240.00 per one one-thousandth of a share, subject
to adjustment. The rights were subject to redemption at the
option of the Board of Directors at a price of $0.01 per
right until the occurrence of certain events. The rights expired
on February 9, 2006.

INCOME TAXES

The provision for income taxes consisted of the following
components in 2005, 2004 and 2003:

Income before provision for income taxes included income from
Cadence’s foreign subsidiaries of approximately
$87.1 million for 2005, $93.6 million for 2004 and
$39.3 million for 2003.

of the following as of December 31, 2005 and
January 1, 2005:



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

December 31, 2005

As of December 31, 2005, Cadence had total net deferred tax
assets of approximately $148.3 million. Realization of the
deferred tax assets will depend on generating sufficient taxable
income of the appropriate character prior to the expiration of
certain net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit
carryforwards. Although realization is not assured, management
believes that it is more likely than not that the net deferred
tax assets will be realized.

The valuation allowance decreased by $2.7 million during
2005 due to additional history of profitability in certain
states. As of December 31, 2005, the valuation allowance
was $5.1 million and is related to certain state net
operating losses and tax credits, the utilization of which is
not likely based on available evidence, including Cadence’s
estimation of future taxable income in these states.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, Cadence completed its
evaluation of the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs
Creation Act, or AJCA, which created a temporary one year
incentive for United States corporations to repatriate
accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries by providing an 85%
dividends received deduction for certain qualifying dividends.
Cadence made the determination to repatriate $500.0 million
of certain foreign earnings which were previously considered to
be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States.
Cadence will invest these earnings in the United States pursuant
to the AJCA guidelines. Cadence completed the repatriation and
recorded an income tax expense of $30.1 million associated
with the repatriation during the fourth quarter of 2005.

Cadence provides for United States income taxes on the earnings
of foreign subsidiaries unless the earnings are considered
permanently invested outside of the United States. At
December 31, 2005, the cumulative amount of earnings upon
which United States income taxes have not been provided was
approximately $196.0 million. At December 31, 2005,
the unrecognized deferred tax liability for these earnings was
approximately $64.0 million. Cadence intends to
indefinitely reinvest its foreign earnings outside of the United
States.

As of December 31, 2005, Cadence had federal and California
net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$21.6 million and $5.5 million, respectively,
available to reduce future taxable income. The federal net
operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates from
2008 through 2023. The California net operating loss
carryforwards will expire at various dates from 2011 through
2014. Cadence also has tax effected net operating losses from
states other than California of $2.5 million, net of
federal tax benefit, which will expire at various dates from
2006 through 2024.

As of December 31, 2005, Cadence had federal tax credits of
$12.6 million, California credits of $7.4 million, net
of federal tax benefit, credits from states other than
California of $4.4 million, net of federal tax benefit and
$0.6 million of tax credits in foreign jurisdictions.
$8.4 million of these tax credits do not expire and carry
forward indefinitely until utilized and the remaining
$16.6 million of tax credits will expire at various dates
from 2006 through 2023.

The IRS and other tax authorities regularly examine
Cadence’s income tax returns. In November 2003, the IRS
completed its field examination of Cadence’s federal income
tax returns for the tax years 1997 through 1999 and issued a
Revenue Agent’s Report, or the RAR, in which the IRS
proposes to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the
three-year period of approximately $143.0 million, plus
interest, which interest will accrue until the matter is
resolved. This interest is compounded daily at rates published
by the IRS, which rates are adjusted quarterly and have been
between four and nine percent since 1997. The RAR is not a final
Statutory Notice of Deficiency, and Cadence has protested
certain of the proposed adjustments with the Appeals Office of
the IRS where the matter is presently being considered. The most
significant of the disputed adjustments relates to transfer
pricing arrangements that Cadence has with a foreign subsidiary.
Cadence believes that the proposed IRS adjustments are
inconsistent with applicable tax laws, and that it has
meritorious defenses to the proposed adjustments. The IRS may
also make similar claims for years subsequent to 1999.



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

December 31, 2005

The IRS is currently examining Cadence’s federal income tax
returns for the tax years 2000 through 2002 and may challenge
the tax reported on these tax returns.

Significant judgment is required in determining Cadence’s
provision for income taxes. The calculation of Cadence’s
tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the
application of complex tax regulations. In determining the
adequacy of its provision for income taxes, Cadence has assessed
the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these
examinations, including the current IRS examination and the IRS
RAR for tax years 1997 through 1999. Cadence provides for tax
liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheets unless it
considers it probable that additional taxes will not be due.
However, the ultimate outcome of tax examinations cannot be
predicted with certainty, including the total amount payable or
the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues.
In addition, Cadence cannot be certain that such amount will not
be materially different than that which is reflected in its
historical income tax provisions and accruals. Should the IRS or
other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of a
current or a future examination, Cadence may be required to
record charges to operations in future periods that could have a
material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial
position or cash flows in the period or periods recorded.

NOTE 17.

EMPLOYEE AND DIRECTOR BENEFIT PLANS

Cadence maintains a 401(k) savings plan to provide retirement
benefits through tax-deferred salary deductions for all of its
United States employees. Cadence may make discretionary
contributions, as determined by the Board of Directors, which
cannot exceed a specified percentage of the annual aggregate
salaries of those employees eligible to participate. Cadence
made total contributions to the plan of $10.8 million for
2005, $9.6 million for 2004 and $9.2 million for 2003.

As part of its overall investment strategy, Cadence invested in
Telos. Cadence and the Cadence Design Systems, Inc. 1996
Deferred Compensation Venture Investment Plan Trust, or the 1996
Plan, hold the only limited partnership interests in Telos I.
The contractual term of Telos I ended on December 31, 2005
and Telos I is currently being liquidated. Cadence and the
Cadence Design Systems, Inc. 2002 Deferred Compensation Venture
Investment Plan Trust, or the 2002 Plan, hold the only limited
partnership interests in Telos III. Prior to
December 31, 2005, Directors and executive officers could
elect to defer compensation payable to them under the 2002 Plan.
Compensation deferred under the 2002 Plan was invested in
Telos III. In December 2005, Cadence determined to
liquidate Telos III and removed the general partner of
Telos III effective December 31, 2005. The new general
partner, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cadence, will complete the
liquidation of Telos III.

Executive Officers and Directors may also elect to defer
compensation payable to them under Cadence’s 1994
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan. Deferred compensation
payments are held in accounts with values indexed to the
performance of selected mutual funds, employee self-directed
accounts or money market accounts.

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS

is as follows:

NOTE 19.

RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES

Cadence initiated a separate plan of restructuring in each year
since 2001 in an effort to reduce operating expenses and improve
operating margins and cash flows.

The restructuring plans initiated each year from 2001 through
2004, or the 2001 Restructuring, 2002 Restructuring, 2003
Restructuring and 2004 Restructuring, respectively, were
intended to decrease costs through workforce reductions and
facility and resource consolidation, in order to improve
Cadence’s cost structure. The 2001 and 2002 Restructurings
primarily related to Cadence’s design services business and
certain other business or infrastructure groups throughout the
world. The 2003 and 2004 Restructurings were targeted at
reducing costs throughout the company.

During 2005, Cadence implemented a new plan of restructuring,
the 2005 Restructuring, in an effort to decrease costs by
reducing workforce and consolidating facilities throughout the
company.

Facility closure and office space reduction costs included in
these restructurings were comprised of payments required under
leases, less any applicable estimated sublease income after the
properties were abandoned, lease buyout costs and other
contractual charges. To estimate the lease loss, which is the
loss after Cadence’s cost recovery efforts from subleasing
all or part of a building, Cadence management made certain
assumptions related to the time period over which the relevant
building would remain vacant and sublease terms, including
sublease rates and contractual common area charges.

During 2005, in conjunction with the workforce reduction
involving Cadence’s European design services business,
Cadence completed a sale-leaseback transaction involving land
and a building in Livingston, Scotland. Proceeds from the sale
were $33.6 million and the total gain on the sale was
$3.6 million. Cadence has agreed to lease back a portion of
the facility for the next two years and another portion for ten
years, with an option to terminate the ten year lease at five
years. Cadence has deferred the gain on the sale and will
recognize the gain ratably over the maximum remaining lease term
of ten years.

Since 2001, Cadence has recorded facilities consolidation
charges of $97.7 million related to office space reductions
or facility closures of 49 sites. As of December 31, 2005,
28 of these sites had been vacated and office space reductions
had occurred at the remaining 21 sites. Cadence expects to pay
remaining facilities-related restructuring liabilities for all
of its restructuring plans prior to 2016.

As of December 31, 2005, Cadence’s estimate of the
accrued lease loss related to all worldwide restructuring
activities initiated since 2001 was $34.8 million. This
amount will be adjusted in the future based



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

December 31, 2005

upon changes in the assumptions used to estimate the lease loss.
The lease loss could range as high as $38.8 million if
sublease rental rates decrease in applicable markets or if it
takes longer than currently expected to find a suitable tenant
to sublease the facilities.

Total restructuring costs accrued as of December 31, 2005
were $34.9 million, consisting of $5.4 million in
Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and $29.5 million
in Other long-term liabilities. Cadence paid substantially all
remaining severance and benefits restructuring liabilities prior
to December 31, 2005.

Restructuring and other charges (credits) recorded by plan
of restructuring for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003 are as
follows:

Activity for the years ended December 31, 2005,
January 1, 2005 and January 3, 2004 associated with
each plan of restructuring is discussed below.

2005 Restructuring

During the year ended December 31, 2005, Cadence reduced
its workforce by approximately 300 employees, including
approximately 65 employees in its European design services
business, and consolidated facilities and resources throughout
the company. Costs resulting from the 2005 Restructuring
included severance payments, severance-related benefits,
outplacement services, lease costs associated with facilities
vacated and downsized, and charges for assets written-off as a
result of the restructuring. Severance and benefits expenses
associated with the 2005 Restructuring were approximately
$20.8 million.

All terminations and termination benefits associated with the
workforce reductions under the 2005 Restructuring were
communicated to the affected employees prior to
December 31, 2005, with substantially all

termination benefits paid prior to December 31, 2005. The
remaining termination benefits are expected to be paid by
April 1, 2006.

Asset-related and other charges of $2.4 million recorded in
the year ended December 31, 2005 are comprised of
$1.5 million of expenses from the restructuring activities,
primarily related to the write-off of leasehold improvements for
facilities vacated and downsized, and $0.9 million of other
charges related to the disposal of other assets not associated
with Cadence’s restructuring activities.

Facilities-related expenses of $2.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2005 are comprised of $1.8 million
of expenses for facilities vacated or consolidated and
$0.6 million related to changes in lease loss estimates for
vacated and downsized facilities. Facilities-related expenses
include payments required under leases, net of estimated
sublease income, lease buyout costs and other contractual
charges.

NOTE 21. SEGMENT REPORTING

SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information,” requires disclosures
of certain information regarding operating segments, products
and services, geographic areas of operation and major customers.
SFAS No. 131 reporting is based upon the
“management approach”: how management organizes the
company’s operating segments for which separate financial
information is (i) available and (ii) evaluated
regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how
to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
Cadence’s chief operating decision maker is its President
and Chief Executive Officer, or CEO. Cadence’s CEO reviews
Cadence’s consolidated results as only one segment. In
making operating decisions, the CEO primarily considers
consolidated financial information, accompanied by disaggregated
information about revenues by geographic region.

Outside the United States, Cadence markets and supports its
products and services primarily through its subsidiaries.
Revenue is attributed to geography based on the country in which
the customer is domiciled. Property, plant and equipment are
attributed to geography based on the country where the assets
are located. Until June 28, 2003, Cadence licensed most of
its software products in Japan through a distributor, Innotech
Corporation, or Innotech. In June 2003, Cadence purchased
certain assets from Innotech, including distribution rights for
certain customers in Japan. Since June 2003, Cadence has
directly licensed its software products to customers for which
Cadence acquired the distribution rights from Innotech. As of
December 31, 2005, Cadence was an approximately 7%
stockholder of Innotech.

NOTE 22. SUBSEQUENT EVENT

In January 2006, KhiMetrics, Inc., an investment held by Cadence
and the Cadence Design Systems, Inc. 1996 Deferred Compensation
Venture Investment Plan Trust through Telos I, was
acquired. Immediately prior to the closing, Telos converted its
Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock
to common stock to receive the consideration of $6.53 per
share of common stock. Under the purchase agreement, 10% of the
consideration is held in escrow to pay unresolved claims against
KhiMetrics, Inc. through the first anniversary of the
acquisition, at which time the remaining escrow will be
distributed to the former stockholders of KhiMetrics. In
connection with this sale, Cadence received approximately
$17.5 million in cash and recorded a gain of approximately
$14.4 million in January 2006.
