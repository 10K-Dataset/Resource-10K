used by companies to design and develop complex integrated
circuits, or ICs, and electronic systems, including
semiconductors, computer systems and peripherals,
telecommunications and networking equipment, mobile and wireless
devices, automotive electronics, consumer products and other
advanced electronics. These industries are experiencing a
general downturn.

Cadence was formed as a Delaware corporation in
May 1988. Cadence’s headquarters are located at
2655 Seely Avenue, San Jose, California 95134. Its
telephone number at that location is (408) 943-1234 and its
web-site can be accessed at www.cadence.com. Cadence makes
available free of charge copies of its SEC filings and
submissions on Cadence’s website as soon as practicable
after electronically filing or furnishing such documents with
the SEC.

Cadence manages its business through three
operating segments. The Products segment develops and markets
Cadence® software and hardware technologies to
Cadence’s customers. The Maintenance segment addresses the
on-going, after-sale support requirements of those products
through technical support and software updates. The Services
segment provides Cadence customers with educational services
focused on training customers for the efficient and effective
use of Cadence technologies, methodologies services to assist
customers to optimize the use of Cadence technologies within
their design processes and design services focused on the
development of complex IC and other electronic designs for
Cadence customers who select Cadence as their design provider.

Factors Driving The Electronic Design
Automation Industry

During the last decade, the worldwide
communications, business productivity and consumer electronics
markets drove development in the electronics industry.
Ever-decreasing silicon manufacturing process geometries coupled
with the move to 300mm wafer production drive IC cost decreases,
volume increases and greater complexity for providers of
electronics devices. At the same time, the development of more
comprehensive ICs complicates effective integration of
components into complete electronic systems. These market and
technology forces pose major challenges for the global
electronics design community, and consequently create
significant opportunities and challenges for EDA tool and
services providers.



From a design perspective, many of today’s
complex ICs are system-on-a-chip, referred to as SoC, devices.
These SoC devices, as described in more detail below, contain
one or more processors, memory and application-specific logic.
SoC design requires implementing an entire electronics
sub-system on a single IC. Smaller feature sizes make it more
attractive to put additional circuitry on a single segment of
silicon, or die. The ICs fabricated on these dies include one or
more processors (microprocessors and digital signal processors),
a high-performance bus for on-chip data communication, numerous
memory devices and peripherals, custom digital logic, custom
analog logic and millions of lines of software code. Such
devices offer benefits in terms of price, performance, power and
size. However, they are extremely difficult to design. Designing
these SoC devices requires the convergence of what have
previously been distinct domains for embedded software, digital
logic, analog circuitry and printed circuit board, or PCB,
design. This convergence is changing the way designs for these
devices are created.

The increasing complexity of electronic devices
poses major challenges for design teams in the migration to
nanometer, or one billionth of a meter, design and SoC design
(for reference, the diameter of the period at the end of this
sentence is approximately 400,000 nanometers). Nanometer
design refers to the design of ICs that will have feature sizes
smaller than 180 nanometers. IC feature sizes for wires,
transistors and contacts decrease with each advance in the
semiconductor manufacturing process. Each successive move to a
smaller feature size (e.g., decreasing from 180 nanometers
to 130 nanometers and smaller) requires introducing new
capabilities throughout the entire design and manufacturing flow
to account for new physical effects. For example, at
130 nanometers, signal integrity issues such as signal
interference between wires, or crosstalk; power distribution
management, or IR (voltage) drop; and electrical noise on
the IC, have become critical.

These trends pose significant new challenges for
electronics design teams. Specifically, nanometer design
requires designers to take into account many physical effects
they previously ignored. SoC design requires new approaches to
managing complexity and its related risks. The electronics
industry addresses these challenges in a number of ways,
including the use of new EDA tools, the upgrade of design
methodologies, and offering the advantages of integrated
front-to-back design solutions.

Cadence Electronic Design Automation
Tools

Cadence offers one of the most comprehensive sets
of EDA tools in the industry. Cadence tools improve designer
productivity and design quality throughout the electronic design
process.

Functional Verification Platform

Based on a single-kernel, or common,
architecture, the Cadence Incisive

TM

verification
platform supports a unified methodology from design of the total
system to design-in of particular ICs to specific systems, for
all design domains. Compared to traditional register-transfer
level, or RTL, simulation approaches, Incisive provides up to
100 times faster full-chip verification throughout the
entire design cycle and reduces total verification time by up to
50%.

Digital IC Design Platform

The Cadence Encounter platform leverages a
unified architecture for full RTL-to-GDSII digital
implementation of nanometer-scale designs. It is based on a
single user interface and unified in-memory data model, and was
specifically designed to focus on ensuring that interconnect is
analyzed and optimized throughout the design process. It is
comprised of the following core technologies: First
Encounter® Ultra, a silicon virtual prototyping system that
serves as a universal cockpit for the platform;
NanoRoute

TM

Ultra, which uses graph-based routing
technologies to efficiently support variable-spacing,
variable-width routes for nanometer process technologies; and
the CeltIC

TM

crosstalk analyzer, which is used by
leading silicon foundries for precision signal integrity signoff.

Unlike traditional “front-end/
back-end” systems, the Encounter platform does not require
translations between common tasks such as placement, clock-tree
synthesis, routing, and timing/crosstalk analysis. The
SoC Encounter

TM

configuration supports
hierarchical designs, with full-chip RTL-to-GDSII support for
designs containing more than 25 million gates. A gate is an
electronic switch that allows or prevents the flow of



current in a circuit. Nano Encounter

TM

supports full-chip gates-to-GDSII implementation for
non-hierarchical chips and blocks of up to 10 million gates.

Custom Design Tools

Cadence offers a broad range of analog and
mixed-signal design tools. The Cadence Analog Design Environment
is a front-to-back analog design automation solution for a range
of design styles including full-custom analog, digital
mixed-signal and radio frequency, or RF, IC design. Within
that environment, designers can use the Cadence Spectre®
Circuit Simulator. RF designers can use the Cadence Spectre
RF simulator on desktop workstations to perform full-chip,
transistor-level circuit simulation of RF designs with more than
5,000 devices. In late 2002, Cadence acquired certain
assets of Antrim Design Systems, Inc., bringing new tools to the
standard custom IC flow that allow better management of
design and simulation data, automation of time-consuming tasks,
and improved handling of engineering changes in later stages. In
early 2003, Cadence acquired Celestry Design Technologies, Inc.
whose technology verifies designs against silicon measurements.

The Cadence Virtuoso® suite of custom
IC layout tools provides a comprehensive set of layout
capabilities including layout editing, placement, routing and
physical verification for analog, custom digital mixed signal
and RF ICs. Virtuoso Custom IC Layout includes
automation techniques that dramatically boost designer
productivity compared to manual custom-layout techniques. These
techniques include correct-by-construction, connectivity-driven
capabilities. Virtuoso Custom IC Layout is integrated with
the Cadence Assura physical verification toolset, which offers
automated, interactive physical and batch IC layout
verification, extraction and layout enhancements for
manufacturing. The Assura tool utilizes hierarchical processing
techniques to significantly reduce verification cycle times and
provide effective debugging capabilities.

For years, analog/ mixed-signal design teams have
been seeking to move to a “top-down” approach. Cadence
AMS Designer enables them to do so. It is a mixed-signal
environment and analog/ mixed-signal simulator, the latter of
which is based on the Cadence NC-Sim and Spectre simulators.

Design For Manufacturing

The physical design of ICs requires detailed
analysis and optimization to ensure the design can be
manufactured. Cadence’s Fire & Ice products take the
designer’s representation of the IC and extract the
physical properties of the design to enable further analysis.
The SignalStorm® and VoltageStorm® products address
nanometer design challenges associated with on-chip distribution
of power, timing and crosstalk effects. Cadence’s Assura
products perform design rule checking to ensure the proposed
design meets the requirements of the foundry’s
manufacturing process rules. Cadence’s software and
services are designed to provide comprehensive, high-speed
verification that an IC will perform as designed, taking into
account the complex effects of nanometer semiconductor physics.

Printed Circuit Board and IC Packaging Design
Tools

Cadence produces integrated PCB and IC packaging
design flows targeted at solving the design complexities that
today’s nanometer-scale devices are creating at the package
and board level. PCB design products address both the
high-speed, high-end of the market and the mainstream segment
with scalable versions of Allegro® PCB layout,
SPECCTRA® autorouter, SPECCTRAQuest

TM

design and
analysis environment, Concept® HDL schematic capture,
Capture CIS, and PCB librarian.

Recent product introductions include advances in
signal integrity design and analysis technologies and
first-in-class differential signal capabilities targeted at the
network and communications design markets. For example, new
capabilities in SPECCTRAQuest allow IC manufacturers to
create silicon design-in kits, speeding the adoption of their
advanced chips into systems, speeding design-to-volume for both
themselves and their systems customers.



Unique IC package and PCB co-design
methodologies allow engineers to consider the package in context
of the board, and the board in context of the package, allowing
them to make tradeoffs and optimize product performance.

Cadence sells and supports its OrCAD product
line of personal productivity PCB design tools through a
worldwide network of value added resellers.

Third-Party Tool and Partner Support

Cadence supports the integration of third-party
design tools through its Connections® Program. The
Connections Program provides other EDA companies with
access to Cadence products to ensure that Cadence tools work
well in multiple design environments. Many EDA providers
are members of the Connections Program. Additionally, Cadence
manages relationships with foundry and library provider partners
to support customer-owned tooling, or COT, solutions for its
customers. Cadence also assists and supports library providers
in the integration of Cadence design and verification tools and
model formats into COT library solutions. These
relationships are an important aspect of providing complete
solutions to semiconductor designers, because these designers
depend on coordinated offerings from multiple suppliers.
Cadence’s programs are designed to support its
customers’ ability to address their business and technical
challenges, from IC design through to production
manufacturing in volume.

Maintenance and Support Services

Support services include product maintenance and
updates, and telephone and Internet-based technical support.
Maintenance and support are offered to customers either in
conjunction with Cadence product license agreements or under a
separate maintenance agreement.

Electronic Design Automation
Services

To complement its tools, Cadence provides a range
of electronic design services that help optimize design team
productivity. These include educational, support, design,
verification, application service provider, or ASP, and
methodology services.

Education Services

Cadence’s educational services include
Internet, classroom and custom courses, the content of which
ranges from how to use the most recent tool features to the
latest design techniques.

Design Services

The Cadence Design Foundry® offers
engineering services and re-usable design technologies to aid
customers with the design of complex ICs in advanced
semiconductor process technologies. The Design Foundry focuses
its offerings primarily on SoC devices including both
Application Specific Integrated Circuits, or ASICS, and
Application Specific Standard Parts, and on analog and mixed
signal ICs. The market for these services is primarily the
semiconductor and systems companies developing products for the
communications, computing, and consumer market segments. Cadence
Design Foundry offers engineering capabilities to assist
customers from product concept through volume manufacturing.

The Cadence Design Foundry also makes its
intellectual property, or design IP, portfolio available to
customers. These re-usable design technologies enable customers
to reduce the design complexity and time to market for the
development of complex SoCs. This IP portfolio includes
technology in four critical design domains:

•

Communications and networking (Ethernet MACs and
    encryption cores);

•

Digital building blocks (peripherals and memory
    access);

•

High speed Input/ Output (SPI4P2,
    PCI Express, RapidIO, FibreChannel);

•

Analog building blocks (DAC, ADC, PLL).



Design IP may be licensed to customers as a
component of an engineering service engagement, or sold on an
“as is” basis. Customers generally pay a license fee
for access to the design IP and a per unit royalty fee to
use it in volume production.

Through the Design Foundry’s collaboration
with customers in the design of today’s most advanced ICs,
Cadence is able to bridge what is often referred to as the
“design gap.” The design gap refers to the inability
of IC design techniques to keep pace with semiconductor
process technology advances. By designing first-of-their-kind
ICs, Cadence Design Foundry gains direct and early visibility to
industry design issues that may not be addressed adequately by
today’s design automation solutions. This enables Cadence
to accelerate the development of new software technology to meet
the market’s current and future design requirements.

Verification and ASP Services

Cadence offers verification and ASP services
through Time-to-Market Engineering, or TtME®, services and
the QuickCycles

TM

programs. The TtME staff provides
customers with consulting services, project services and/or
complete turnkey services for verification acceleration and
system emulation. QuickCycles allows customers to access
Palladium simulation acceleration and emulation products on a
pay-as-you-go basis, either on the customer site or remotely
over a high-speed, secure network connection.

Methodology Services

Cadence’s Methodology Services group offers
a variety of services to help customers effectively address
electronic design challenges. It leverages Cadence’s
cumulative experience and knowledge of design practices to
improve productivity. Cadence also offers virtual computer aided
design, or VCAD, through which engineering teams at one or more
Cadence locations provide technical support through a virtual
private network to customer design groups located at the
customers design sites.

Marketing and Sales

Cadence generally uses a direct sales force
consisting of sales people and applications engineers to license
its products and market its consulting and design services to
prospective customers. Applications engineers provide technical
pre-sales as well as post-sales support for software products.
The Cadence Methodology Services group provides on-site
capabilities to help customers improve productivity with Cadence
and other EDA products. Due to the complexity of
EDA products and the electronic design process in general,
the sales cycle is generally long, involving three to six months
or more. During the sales cycle, the Cadence direct sales force
generally provides technical presentations and product
demonstrations and supports on-site customer evaluations of
Cadence software. Cadence also uses traditional marketing
approaches to promote its products and services, including
advertising, direct mail, telemarketing, trade shows, public
relations and the Internet.

Cadence markets and supports its products and
services internationally through its subsidiaries and various
distributors. Cadence markets its emulation hardware and
consulting and design services in Japan through a wholly-owned
subsidiary. In Japan, Cadence licenses most of its software
products through Innotech Corporation, in which Cadence is an
approximately 15% stockholder.

Research and Development

Cadence’s investment in research and
development was $326.4 million in 2002, $297.3 million
in 2001, and $263.9 million in 2000.

The primary areas of Cadence’s research
include SoC design, the design of silicon devices in the
nanometer range, high-speed board design, architectural-level
design, high-performance logic verification technology and
hardware/ software co-design. Because the electronics industry
combines rapid innovation with rapidly increasing design and
manufacturing complexity, Cadence focuses significant investment
on enhancing current products, as well as creating new products
and techniques.

Cadence’s future performance depends largely
on its ability to maintain and enhance its current product
lines, develop new products and services, maintain technological
competitiveness and meet increasingly



complex customer requirements. In addition to
research and development conducted within each of our segments,
Cadence maintains Cadence Laboratories, an advanced research
group responsible for exploring new directions and applications
of its technologies, migrating new technologies into
Cadence’s existing offerings and maintaining strong
industry relationships.

Competition

Cadence currently competes primarily with two
large companies: Mentor Graphics Corporation and Synopsys, Inc.
In 2002, two large EDA companies, Synopsys, Inc. and Avant!
Corporation merged, and the combined company offers a broader
product range. Cadence also competes with numerous smaller
EDA companies, with manufacturers of electronic devices
that have developed or have the capability to develop their own
EDA products, and with numerous electronics design and
consulting companies. Manufacturers of electronic devices may be
reluctant to purchase services from independent vendors such as
Cadence because they wish to promote their own internal design
departments.

Proprietary Technology

Cadence’s success depends, in part, upon its
proprietary technology. Cadence generally relies on patents,
copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, licenses and
restrictive agreements to establish and protect its proprietary
rights in technology and products. Many Cadence products include
software or other intellectual property licensed from third
parties. Cadence may have to seek new or renew existing licenses
for such software and other intellectual property in the future.
The Cadence Design Foundry licenses certain software and other
intellectual property of third parties, including that of
competitors.

Manufacturing and Distribution

Cadence software production operations consist of
configuring the proper version of a product, outsourcing the
recording of the product on CD-ROM, and producing
customer-unique access keys allowing customers to use licensed
products. Software and documentation are generally made
available to customers electronically by secured electronic
delivery. User manuals and other documentation are generally
available on CD-ROM, but are occasionally supplied in hard copy
format.

Cadence performs final assembly and test of its
hardware verification acceleration and emulation products in San
Jose, California. Subcontractors manufacture all major
subassemblies, including all individual printed circuit boards
and custom ICs, and supply them to Cadence for qualification and
testing prior to their incorporation into the assembled product.

Backlog

Cadence’s backlog on December 28, 2002
was approximately $1.4 billion. Backlog consists of:

•

Revenue from subscription licenses for hardware
    and software products to be recognized on a ratable basis after
    December 28, 2002;

•

Revenue for maintenance contracts on hardware and
    software products to be recognized on a ratable basis after
    December 28, 2002;

•

Revenue from orders for hardware and software
    products sold on perpetual and term licenses on which customers
    have requested ship dates after December 28, 2002; and

•

Revenue from the undelivered portion of services
    contracts that is recognized on a percentage of completion basis.

Cadence has not historically experienced
significant cancellation of its contracts with customers.
Customers often reschedule the required completion dates of
services contracts which has the effect of deferring revenue
recognition under those contracts beyond the original expected
completion date.



Employees

As of March 1, 2003, Cadence employed
approximately 5,175 individuals, with approximately 2,455
in sales, services, marketing, support and manufacturing
activities, 1,970 in product development and 750 in management,
administration and finance. None of Cadence’s employees is
represented by a labor union, and Cadence has experienced no
work stoppages. Cadence believes that its employee relations are
good.

Factors That May Affect Future
Results

The following risk factors and other information
included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be
carefully considered. Additional risks and uncertainties not
currently known to Cadence or that Cadence currently deems
insignificant also may impair Cadence’s business
operations. If any of the following risks actually occurs,
Cadence’s business, operating results and financial
condition could be materially harmed.

Cadence is subject to the cyclical nature
of the integrated circuit and electronics systems industries,
and

the current
downturn or any future downturns may reduce Cadence’s
revenue

Purchases of Cadence’s products and services
are highly dependent upon the commencement of new design
projects by IC manufacturers and electronics systems companies.
The IC industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by
constant and rapid technological change, rapid product
obsolescence and price erosion, evolving standards, short
product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and
demand. The IC and electronics systems industries have
experienced significant downturns, often connected with, or in
anticipation of, maturing product cycles of both these
companies’ and their customers’ products and a decline
in general economic conditions. These downturns have been
characterized by diminished product demand, production
overcapacity, high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of
average selling prices. During these downturns, the number of
new design projects may decrease. IC manufacturers and
electronics systems companies experienced a downturn in demand
and production in 2001 and in 2002, which has continued in 2003.
Cadence expects revenue to continue to be adversely affected by
the general downturn in the economy and, in particular, the
electronics industry. The current downturn and any future
downturns may reduce Cadence’s software and maintenance
revenue and further reduce its services and hardware revenue and
harm its results of operations.

Fluctuations in operating results for any
fiscal period could hurt Cadence’s business and the
market

price of its
stock

Cadence has experienced, and may continue to
experience, varied quarterly operating results. Various factors
affect Cadence’s quarterly operating results and some of
them are not within Cadence’s control. Cadence’s
quarterly operating results are affected by the timing of
significant orders for its software products because a
significant number of contracts for software products are in
excess of $5.0 million. The failure to close a contract for
one or more orders for Cadence’s software products could
seriously harm its quarterly operating results.

Cadence’s operating results are also
affected by the mix of license types executed in any given
period. Cadence has three basic licensing models: term,
subscription and perpetual. Product revenue associated with term
and perpetual licenses is generally recognized at the beginning
of the license period, while product revenue associated with
subscription licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the
license. Revenue may also be deferred under term and perpetual
licenses until payments become due and payable from customers
with non-linear payment terms or as cash is collected from
customers with lower credit ratings.

In 2002, Cadence experienced increasing customer
preference for its subscription licenses, which give customers
limited access to new technology. Revenue recognized on a
ratable basis is expected to continue to increase as a
percentage of overall revenue to the extent customers continue
to prefer subscription licenses in the future, or continue to
request more flexible payment terms, both of which cause revenue
to be recognized ratably over time.



Cadence plans operating expense levels primarily
based on forecasted revenue levels. These expenses and the
impact of long-term commitments are relatively fixed in the
short term. A shortfall in revenue could lead to operating
results being below expectations as Cadence may not be able to
quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to short-term
business changes.

Stockholders should not view Cadence’s
historical results of operations as reliable indicators of its
future performance. If revenue or operating results fall short
of the levels expected by public market analysts and investors,
the trading price of Cadence common stock could decline
dramatically.

The lengthy sales cycle of Cadence’s
products and services makes the timing of its revenue difficult
to

predict and
may cause its operating results to fluctuate
unexpectedly

Cadence has a lengthy sales cycle that generally
extends at least three to six months. The length of the sales
cycle may cause Cadence’s revenue and operating results to
vary unexpectedly from quarter to quarter. The complexity and
expense associated with Cadence’s business generally
requires a lengthy customer education, evaluation and approval
process. Consequently, Cadence may incur substantial expenses
and devote significant management effort and expense to develop
potential relationships that do not result in agreements or
revenue and may prevent Cadence from pursuing other
opportunities.

In addition, sales of Cadence products and
services may be delayed if customers delay approval or
commencement of projects because of:

•

Customers’ budgetary constraints and
    internal acceptance review procedures;

•

The timing of customers’ budget cycles; or

•

The timing of customers’ competitive
    evaluation processes.

Lengthy sales cycles for acceleration and
emulation hardware products subject Cadence to a number of
significant risks over which Cadence has limited control,
including insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory, variations
in inventory valuation and fluctuations in quarterly operating
results.

Also, because of the timing of large orders and
its customers’ buying patterns, Cadence may not learn of
bookings shortfalls, revenue shortfalls, earnings shortfalls or
other failures to meet market expectations until late in a
fiscal quarter, which could cause even more immediate and
serious harm to the trading price of Cadence common stock.

Cadence’s failure to respond quickly
to technological developments could make its products
uncompetitive

and
obsolete

The industries in which Cadence competes
experience rapid technology developments, changes in industry
standards, changes in customer requirements and frequent new
product introductions and improvements. Currently, the
industries Cadence serves are experiencing several revolutionary
trends:

•

Migration to Nanometer Design: The size of
    features such as wires, transistors and contacts on ICs is
    shrinking due to advances in semiconductor manufacturing
    processes. Process feature sizes refer to the width of the
    transistors and the width and spacing of the interconnect on the
    IC. Feature size is normally identified by the headline
    transistor length, which is shrinking from 180 nanometers to 130
    nanometers and smaller. This is commonly referred to in the
    semiconductor industry as the migration to nanometer design. It
    represents a major challenge for all levels of the semiconductor
    industry, from IC design and design automation to design of
    manufacturing equipment and the manufacturing process itself.
    Shrinkage of transistor length to such infinitesimal proportions
    is challenging fundamental laws of physics and chemistry.

•

The ability to design SoC ICs increases the
    complexity of managing a design that at the lowest level is
    represented by billions of shapes on the fabrication mask. In
    addition, SoCs typically incorporate microprocessors and digital
    signal processors that are programmed with software, requiring
    simultaneous design of the IC and the related software embedded
    on the IC.



If Cadence is unable to respond quickly and
successfully to these developments and the evolution of these
changes, Cadence may lose its competitive position, and its
products or technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete.
To compete successfully, Cadence must develop or acquire new
products and improve its existing products and processes on a
schedule that keeps pace with technological developments in its
industries. Cadence must also be able to support a range of
changing computer software, hardware platforms and customer
preferences. Cadence cannot guarantee that it will be successful
in this respect.

Cadence has historically suffered losses in
its electronics design services business

The market for electronics design services is
sensitive to customer budgetary constraints and engineering
capacity. Cadence’s design services business has
historically suffered losses. If Cadence’s design services
business fails to increase its revenue to offset its expenses,
the design services business will continue to experience losses.
Cadence’s failure to succeed in the design services
business may harm Cadence’s business, operating results and
financial condition.

The profitability of Cadence’s
services business depends on factors that are difficult to
control

To be successful in its services business,
Cadence must overcome several factors that are difficult to
control, including the following:

•

Cadence’s cost of services employees is
    high and reduces services gross
    margin.

Gross margin represents the
    difference between the amount of revenue from the sale of
    services and Cadence’s cost of providing those services.
    Cadence must pay high salaries to attract and retain
    professional services employees. This results in a lower gross
    margin than the gross margin in Cadence’s software
    business. In addition, the high cost of training new services
    employees or not fully utilizing these employees can
    significantly lower gross margin. It is difficult to adjust
    staffing levels quickly to reflect customer demand for services;
    therefore, the services business could experience losses.

•

A portion of services contracts consists of
    fixed-price contracts.

Certain Cadence
    customers pay a fixed price for services provided, regardless of
    the cost Cadence must incur to perform the contract. If
    Cadence’s cost in performing the services were to exceed
    the amount the customer has agreed to pay Cadence will
    experience a loss on such contract, which could harm
    Cadence’s business, operating results and financial
    condition.

Cadence’s inability to compete in its
industries could seriously harm its business

The EDA market and the commercial electronics
design and methodology services industries are highly
competitive. If Cadence were unable to compete successfully in
these industries, it could seriously harm Cadence’s
business, operating results and financial condition. To compete
in these industries, Cadence must identify and develop or
acquire innovative and cost competitive EDA products and market
them in a timely manner. It must also gain industry acceptance
for its design and methodology services and offer better
strategic concepts, technical solutions, prices and response
time, or a combination of these factors, than those of other
design companies and the internal design departments of
electronics manufacturers. Cadence cannot assure you that it
will be able to compete successfully in these industries.
Factors that could affect Cadence’s ability to succeed
include:

•

The development of competitive EDA products and
    design and methodology services could result in a shift of
    customer preferences away from Cadence’s products and
    services and significantly decrease revenue;

•

Due to budgeting constraints or excess
    engineering capacity, electronics manufacturers often choose to
    perform design and methodology services internally, rather than
    purchase these services from outside vendors;

•

The need to develop (or acquire
    externally-developed) technology solutions which are adequate
    and competitive in addressing the complexities of
    next-generation designs;

•

There are a significant number of current and
    potential competitors in the EDA industry and the cost of entry
    is low; and



•

Many EDA companies have combined to deliver more
    comprehensive offerings than they could individually.

Cadence currently competes primarily with two
large companies: Mentor Graphics Corporation and Synopsys, Inc.
In 2002, two large EDA companies, Synopsys, Inc. and Avant!
Corporation merged, and the combined company offers a broader
product range. Cadence also competes with numerous smaller EDA
companies, with manufacturers of electronic devices that have
developed or have the capability to develop their own EDA
products, and with numerous electronics design and consulting
companies. Manufacturers of electronic devices may be reluctant
to purchase services from independent vendors such as Cadence
because they wish to promote their own internal design
departments.

Cadence’s failure to obtain software
or other intellectual property licenses or adequately protect
its

proprietary
rights could seriously harm its business

Cadence’s success depends, in part, upon its
proprietary technology. Cadence generally relies on patents,
copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, licenses and
restrictive agreements to establish and protect its proprietary
rights in technology and products. Despite precautions Cadence
may take to protect its intellectual property, Cadence cannot
assure you that third parties will not try to challenge,
invalidate or circumvent these safeguards. Cadence also cannot
assure you that the rights granted under its patents or
attendant to its other intellectual property will provide it
with any competitive advantages, or that patents will be issued
on any of its pending applications, or that future patents will
be sufficiently broad to protect Cadence’s technology.
Furthermore, the laws of foreign countries may not protect
Cadence’s proprietary rights in those countries to the same
extent as U.S. law protects these rights in the United States.
Many Cadence products include software or other intellectual
property licensed from third parties. Cadence may have to seek
new or renew existing licenses for such software and other
intellectual property in the future. The Cadence Design Foundry
licenses certain software and other intellectual property of
third parties, including that of competitors. Cadence’s
failure to obtain, for its use, software or other intellectual
property licenses or other intellectual property rights on
favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation over these
licenses or rights, could seriously harm Cadence’s
business, operating results and financial condition.

Cadence cannot assure you that its reliance on
licenses from restrictive agreements with third parties, or that
patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protections, will
be enough to be successful and profitable in the industries in
which Cadence competes.

Intellectual property infringement by or
against Cadence could seriously harm its business

There are numerous patents in the EDA industry
and new patents are being issued at a rapid rate. It is not
always practicable to determine in advance whether a product or
any of its components infringes the patent rights of others. As
a result, from time to time, Cadence may be forced to respond to
or prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to
protect its rights or defend a customer’s rights. These
claims, regardless of merit, could consume valuable management
time, result in costly litigation, or cause product shipment
delays, all of which could seriously harm Cadence’s
business, operating results and financial condition. In settling
these claims, Cadence may be required to enter into royalty or
licensing agreements with the third parties claiming
infringement. These royalty or licensing agreements, if
available, may not have terms favorable to Cadence. Being forced
to enter into a license agreement with unfavorable terms could
seriously harm Cadence’s business, operating results and
financial condition. Any potential intellectual property
litigation could force Cadence to do one or more of the
following:

•

Pay damages, license fees or royalties to the
    party claiming infringement;

•

Stop licensing products, or providing services
    that use the challenged intellectual property;

•

Obtain a license from the owner of the infringed
    intellectual property to sell or use the relevant technology,
    which license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at
    all; or

•

Redesign the challenged technology, which could
    be time-consuming and costly.

If Cadence were forced to take any of these
actions, Cadence’s business and results of operations may
suffer.



Cadence obtains key components for its
hardware products from a limited number of
suppliers

Cadence depends on several suppliers for certain
key components and board assemblies used in its hardware-based
verification products. Cadence’s inability to develop
alternative sources or to obtain sufficient quantities of these
components or board assemblies could result in delays or
reductions in product shipments. In particular, Cadence
currently relies on International Business Machines Corporation,
or IBM, to manufacture hardware components for Cadence’s
Palladium

TM

products. If there were such a reduction
or interruption, Cadence’s results of operations would be
seriously harmed. Even if Cadence could eventually obtain these
components from alternative sources, a significant delay in
Cadence’s ability to deliver products would result.

Cadence has acquired and expects to acquire
other companies and businesses and may not realize
the

expected
benefits of these acquisitions

Cadence has acquired and expects to acquire other
companies and businesses in the future. While Cadence expects to
analyze carefully all potential transactions before committing
to them, Cadence cannot assure you that any transaction that is
completed will result in long-term benefits to Cadence or its
stockholders, or that Cadence’s management will be able to
manage the acquired businesses effectively. In addition, growth
through acquisition involves a number of risks. If any of the
following events occurs after Cadence acquires another business,
it could seriously harm Cadence’s business, operating
results and financial condition:

•

Difficulties in combining previously separate
    businesses into a single unit;

•

The substantial diversion of management’s
    attention from day-to-day business when evaluating and
    negotiating these transactions and then integrating an acquired
    business;

•

The discovery, after completion of the
    acquisition, of liabilities assumed from the acquired business
    or of assets acquired that are not realizable;

•

The failure to realize anticipated benefits such
    as cost savings and revenue enhancements;

•

The failure to retain key employees of the
    acquired business;

•

Difficulties related to assimilating the products
    of an acquired business in, for example, distribution,
    engineering and customer support areas;

•

Unanticipated costs, including increases in the
    purchase price due to contingent consideration;

•

Adverse effects on existing relationships with
    suppliers and customers; and

•

Failure to understand and compete effectively in
    markets in which Cadence has limited previous experience.

Cadence’s international operations may
seriously harm its financial condition because of several weak

foreign economies and the effect
of foreign exchange rate fluctuations

Cadence has significant operations outside the
United States. Cadence’s revenue from international
operations as a percentage of total revenue was approximately
45% in 2002 and 2001. Cadence expects that revenue from its
international operations will continue to account for a
significant portion of its total revenue. Cadence also transacts
business in various foreign currencies. Recent economic and
political uncertainty and the volatility of foreign currencies
in certain regions, most notably the Japanese Yen and the euro,
have had, and may continue to have, a seriously harmful effect
on Cadence’s revenue and operating results.

Fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the
U.S. dollar and the currencies of other countries in which
Cadence conducts business could seriously harm its business,
operating results and financial condition. For example, if there
is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency exchanges
into U.S. dollars, it will take more of the foreign currency to
equal a specified amount of U.S. dollars than before the rate
increase. If Cadence prices its products and services in the
foreign currency, it will receive less in U.S. dollars than it
did before the rate increase went into effect. If Cadence prices
its products and services in U.S. dollars, an increase in the
exchange rate will result in an increase in the price for
Cadence’s products and services compared to those products
of its competitors that are priced in local currency. This could
result in Cadence’s prices being uncompetitive in markets
where business is transacted in the local currency.



Exposure to foreign currency transaction risk can
arise when transactions are conducted in a currency different
from the functional currency of a Cadence subsidiary. A
subsidiary’s functional currency is the currency in which
it primarily conducts its operations, including product pricing,
expenses and borrowings. Although Cadence attempts to reduce the
impact of foreign currency fluctuations, significant exchange
rate movements may hurt Cadence’s results of operations as
expressed in U.S. dollars.

Foreign currency exchange risk occurs for some of
Cadence’s foreign operations whose functional currency is
the local currency. The primary effect of foreign currency
translation on Cadence’s results of operations is a
reduction in revenue from a strengthening U.S. dollar,
offset by a smaller reduction in expenses. Exchange rate gains
and losses on the translation into U.S. dollars of amounts
denominated in foreign currencies are included as a separate
component of stockholders’ equity.

Cadence’s international operations may also
be subject to other risks, including:

•

The adoption and expansion of government trade
    restrictions;

•

Limitations on repatriation of earnings;

•

Limitations on the conversion of foreign
    currencies;

•

Reduced protection of intellectual property
    rights in some countries;

•

Recessions in foreign economies;

•

Longer collection periods for receivables and
    greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;

•

Difficulties in managing foreign operations;

•

Political and economic instability;

•

Business interruptions or slowdowns from
    terrorism, military operations and war;

•

Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;

•

Tariffs and other trade barriers; and

•

U.S. government licensing requirements for
    exports which may lengthen the sales cycle or restrict or
    prohibit the sale or licensing of certain products.

Changes in effective tax rates could affect
    Cadence’s results of operations

Cadence’s future effective tax rates could
be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated
in countries where Cadence is taxed at lower statutory rates, by
changes in the valuation of Cadence’s deferred tax assets
and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or interpretations of
such tax laws.

Failure to obtain export licenses could
    harm Cadence’s business

Cadence must comply with U.S. Department of
Commerce regulations in shipping its software products and other
technologies outside the United States. Although Cadence has not
had any significant difficulty complying with these regulations
so far, any significant future difficulty in complying could
harm Cadence’s business, operating results and financial
condition.

Cadence’s failure to attract, train,
    motivate and retain key employees may harm its
    business

Competition for highly skilled employees is often
intense. Cadence’s business depends on the efforts and
abilities of its senior management, its research and development
staff, and a number of other key management, sales, support,
technical and services employees. The high cost of training new
employees, not fully utilizing these employees, or losing
trained employees to competing employers could reduce
Cadence’s gross margins and harm its business and operating
results. Competition for these employees may be intense,
particularly in geographic areas recognized as high technology
centers such as the Silicon Valley area, where Cadence’s
principal offices are located, and the other locations where it
maintains facilities. To attract and retain individuals with the
requisite expertise, Cadence may be required to grant large
numbers of stock options or other stock-based incentive awards,
which may be dilutive to existing stockholders. Cadence may also
be required to pay significant base salaries and cash bonuses,
which could harm its operating results.

In addition, new regulations proposed by the New
York Stock Exchange requiring shareholder approval for all stock
option plans, and prohibiting New York Stock Exchange member
organizations from giving a



proxy to vote on equity compensation plans unless
the beneficial owner of the shares has given voting
instructions, could make it more difficult for Cadence to grant
options to employees in the future. To the extent that new
regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant options
to employees, Cadence may incur increased cash compensation
costs or find it difficult to attract, retain and motivate
employees, which could materially and adversely affect its
business.

If Cadence becomes subject to unfair hiring
claims, Cadence could be prevented from hiring
needed

employees,
incur liability for damages and incur substantial costs in
defending itself

Companies in Cadence’s industry whose
employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim
that these competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices
or that the employment of these persons would involve the
disclosure or use of trade secrets. These claims could prevent
Cadence from hiring employees or cause it to incur liability for
damages. Cadence could also incur substantial costs in defending
itself or its employees against these claims, regardless of
their merits. Defending itself from these claims could also
divert the attention of Cadence’s management from its
operations.

Errors or defects in Cadence’s
products and services could expose it to liability and harm its
reputation

Cadence’s customers use its products and
services in designing and developing products that involve a
high degree of technological complexity, each of which has its
own specifications. Because of the complexity of the systems and
products with which Cadence works, some of its products and
designs can be adequately tested only when put to full use in
the marketplace. As a result, its customers or their end users
may discover errors or defects in Cadence’s software or the
systems Cadence designs, or the products or systems
incorporating its design and intellectual property may not
operate as expected. Errors or defects could result in:

•

Loss of current customers and loss of or delay in
    revenue and loss of market share;

•

Failure to attract new customers or achieve
    market acceptance;

•

Diversion of development resources to resolve the
    problem;

•

Increased service costs; and

•

Liability for damages.

Anti-takeover defenses in Cadence’s
certificate of incorporation, by-laws, and under Delaware law
could

prevent an acquisition of Cadence or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for Cadence common stock

Cadence’s by-laws and provisions of the
Delaware General Corporation Law that apply to Cadence and its
Certificate of Incorporation could make it difficult for another
company to acquire control of Cadence. For example:

•

Cadence’s Certificate of Incorporation
    allows Cadence’s Board of Directors to issue, at any time
    and without stockholder approval, preferred stock with such
    terms as it may determine. No shares of preferred stock are
    currently outstanding. However, the rights of holders of any
    Cadence preferred stock that may be issued in the future may be
    superior to the rights of holders of its common stock.

•

Cadence has a rights plan, commonly known as a
    “poison pill,” which would make it difficult for
    someone to acquire Cadence without the approval of
    Cadence’s Board of Directors.

•

Section 203 of the Delaware General
    Corporation Law generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from
    engaging in any business combination with a person owning 15% or
    more of its voting stock, or who is affiliated with the
    corporation and owned 15% or more of its voting stock at any
    time within three years prior to the proposed business
    combination, for a period of three years from the date the
    person became a 15% owner, unless specified conditions are met.

All or any one of these factors could limit the
price that certain investors would be willing to pay for shares
of Cadence common stock and could delay, prevent or allow
Cadence’s Board of Directors to resist an acquisition of
Cadence, even if the proposed transaction was favored by a
majority of Cadence’s independent stockholders.



Cadence’s business is subject to the
risk of earthquakes, floods and other natural catastrophic
events

Cadence’s corporate headquarters, including
certain of Cadence’s research and development operations,
and certain of Cadence’s distribution facilities, are
located in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California, which
is a region known to experience seismic activity. In addition,
several of Cadence’s facilities, which include the
corporate headquarters, certain of Cadence’s research and
development operations, and certain of Cadence’s
distribution operations, are in areas of San Jose, that have
been identified by the Director of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA), as being located in a special flood
area. The areas at risk are identified as being in a
100 year flood plain, using FEMA’s Flood Hazard
Boundary Map or the Flood Insurance Rate Map. If significant
seismic or flooding activity were to occur, Cadence’s
operations may be interrupted, which would adversely impact its
business.

Item 2. Properties

Cadence’s headquarters are located in San
Jose, California, and Cadence owns the related land and
buildings. Additionally, Cadence owns buildings in India and
land and buildings in Scotland. The total square footage of
Cadence’s owned buildings is approximately
979,000 square feet.

Cadence leases additional facilities for its
sales offices in the United States and various foreign
countries, and its research and development and design services
facilities worldwide. Cadence subleases certain of these
facilities where space is not fully utilized or has been
involved in restructuring activities.

Cadence believes that these facilities and the
undeveloped land it owns adjacent to its current headquarters
are adequate for its current needs and that suitable additional
or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate
any expansion of Cadence’s operations.

Item 3. Legal
Proceedings

From time to time, Cadence is involved in various
disputes and litigation matters that arise in the ordinary
course of business. These include disputes and lawsuits related
to intellectual property, mergers and acquisitions, licensing,
contract law, distribution arrangements and employee relations
matters.

In February 1998, Aptix Corporation and Meta
Systems, Inc. filed a lawsuit against Quickturn Design Systems,
Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District
of California alleging that Quickturn infringed a
U.S. patent owned by Aptix and licensed to Meta. In June
2000, the District Court entered judgment in favor of Quickturn,
dismissing the complaint and declaring the patent unenforceable.
The Court also granted summary judgment to Aptix, denying
Quickturn’s abuse of process counterclaim. On
September 8, 2000, the Court ordered Aptix to pay
$4.2 million to Quickturn as reimbursement of
attorneys’ fees and costs it incurred in the litigation.
Aptix appealed the District Court’s judgment and posted a
$2.0 million bond to secure the judgment. On June 8,
2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
affirmed the District Court’s dismissal of Quickturn’s
abuse of process counterclaim. On November 5, 2001, the
Federal Circuit vacated the District Court’s judgment of
unenforceability, but affirmed the District Court’s
dismissal of Aptix’s and Meta’s complaint and the
award of attorneys fees and costs. Cadence received the bonded
portion of the judgment in April 2002 and has taken steps to
enforce the balance of the judgment.

On January 7, 1999, in a suit captioned
Mentor Graphics Corporation, et al. v. Lobo, et al., Delaware
Chancery Court, New Castle County, Civ. Action No. 16843-NC
(“Mentor II”), Mentor filed and served an amended
complaint asserting claims against Cadence, Quickturn and the
Quickturn Board of Directors for declaratory and injunctive
relief for various alleged breaches of fiduciary duty
purportedly owed by Quickturn and its Board of Directors to
Quickturn’s shareholders in connection with the merger
between Quickturn and Cadence. Mentor further alleged that
Cadence aided and abetted Quickturn and its Board of Directors
in those purported breaches. Mentor acknowledged that the suit
became moot upon consummation of the Cadence acquisition of
Quickturn, and on February 13, 2002, the Court dismissed
the case on that basis. However, Mentor sought an award of
attorney’s fees in the case, as well as in a prior related
case in which Cadence was not a party. In May 2000, Mentor
advised the Delaware Chancery Court of its objection to the
settlement of a companion action brought on behalf of certain
Quickturn shareholders, a settlement which is



conditioned upon approval of the settlement by
the Chancery Court and upon Mentor’s not being awarded
attorneys’ fees in either Mentor II or the related
case. In an order dated August 17, 2001, the Chancery Court
denied Mentor’s fee application. Mentor filed a notice of
appeal with the Delaware Supreme Court of the denial of the fee
application. On July 25, 2002, the Chancery Court approved
the settlement of the companion action. Mentor filed a notice of
appeal from that order. The appeals were subsequently
consolidated, and the Delaware Supreme Court heard argument on
March 4, 2003. Cadence is vigorously defending this matter,
but the ultimate outcome is currently unknown. Management
believes that the ultimate resolution of this litigation will
not have a material adverse effect on Cadence’s business,
operating results or financial condition.

On July 21, 1999, Mentor filed suit against
Quickturn in the U.S. District Court for the District of
Delaware, alleging that Quickturn’s Mercury

TM

hardware emulation system infringed U.S. Patent
Nos. 5,777,489 and 5,790,832, allegedly assigned to Mentor.
Upon motion of Quickturn, the action was transferred to the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
California, Civil Action No. C 00-5464 SI. At
Quickturn’s request, Cadence was added as a defendant. In
response, Cadence and Quickturn filed counterclaims for
declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity of these
patents. After filing the suit, Mentor additionally alleged that
Quickturn’s Mercury Plus

TM

product infringed
these patents. Mentor subsequently filed Civil Action
No. C 02-1426 SI, realleging that
Quickturn’s Mercury

TM

hardware emulation systems
infringed U.S. Patent No. 5,777,489. This action was
consolidated with Civil Action No. C 99-5464 SI.
Cadence intends to vigorously defend this matter, but the
ultimate outcome is currently unknown. Management believes that
the ultimate resolution of this litigation will not have a
material adverse effect on Cadence’s business, operating
results or financial condition.

On March 24, 2000, Mentor and Meta and
several founders of Meta filed suit against Quickturn and
Cadence and a former Quickturn employee in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
California, Civil Action No. C-00-01030 SI. The suit
alleged infringement of U.S. Patent No. 5,754,827
allegedly assigned to Mentor, misappropriation of trade secrets,
common law misappropriation and breach of confidence, and sought
unspecified damages, injunctive relief and the assignment to
Mentor of a patent previously issued to Quickturn
(U.S. Patent No. 5,943,490). Quickturn and Cadence
filed counterclaims for declaratory judgment of
non-infringement, unenforceability and invalidity of
U.S. Patent No. 5,754,827. Quickturn and Cadence also
counterclaimed for declaratory judgment of non-infringement,
unenforceability and invalidity of two additional patents
allegedly assigned to Mentor, U.S. Patent
Nos. 5,999,725 and 6,057,706 which Mentor previously
threatened to assert against Quickturn. Mentor’s response
to Quickturn’s counterclaims affirmatively alleged
infringement of both of these patents. This action was
consolidated with the actions described in the preceding
paragraph. Cadence intends to vigorously defend this matter, but
the ultimate outcome is currently unknown. Management believes
that the ultimate resolution of this litigation will not have a
material adverse effect on Cadence’s business, operating
results or financial condition.

On September 11, 2000, Mentor filed a
complaint against Quickturn and Cadence in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
California, Civil Action No. C-00-03291 SI, accusing
Quickturn and Cadence of infringing U.S. Patent
No. 5,574,388, purportedly owned by Mentor, and seeking
unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Cadence and Quickturn
filed counterclaims for declaratory judgment of invalidity,
unenforceability and non-infringement of this patent. The
parties agreed to consolidate this action with Civil Action
Nos. C 99-5464 SI, C 00-01030 SI and
C 02-1426 SI, described above. Prior to trial, the
Court ruled that the claims of the U.S. Patent
Nos. 5,777,489, 6,057,706 and 5,574,388 at issue were
invalid and, accordingly, dismissed from the case all
allegations concerning those patents. On January 24, 2003,
the Court dismissed Mentor’s breach of confidence claim
with prejudice. Trial on the remaining allegations in all four
lawsuits (Civil Action Nos. C 99-5464 SI,
C 00-1030 SI, C-00-3291 SI and C 02-1426-SI)
began on January 6, 2003. On February 19, 2003, the
jury found in favor of Quickturn and Cadence on all remaining
claims before them. Mentor has indicated that it intends to
appeal the jury’s verdict. Cadence intends to vigorously
defend this matter, but the ultimate outcome is currently
unknown. Management believes that the ultimate resolution of
this litigation will not have a material adverse effect on
Cadence’s business, operating results or financial
condition.

On November 2, 2000, Mentor and Meta filed a
complaint for declaratory judgment against Quickturn and Cadence
in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon (Case
No. C-00-1489) seeking a ruling that



Mentor’s proposed design verification
approach (in which IC designers would use U.S.-based computer
terminals to operate SimExpress emulation systems located
overseas) will not infringe Quickturn’s patents and will
not violate the permanent injunction entered by the Oregon
District Court on July 7, 1999 in Civil Action
No. C-96-00342. In January 2001, Quickturn and Cadence
filed a Motion to Dismiss the action, based on lack of subject
matter jurisdiction. On May 1, 2001, the Court
provisionally granted Quickturn’s motion to dismiss.
Cadence and Quickturn believe that Mentor’s complaint is
without merit. Cadence intends to vigorously defend this matter,
but the ultimate outcome is currently unknown. Management
believes that the ultimate resolution of this litigation will
not have a material adverse effect on Cadence’s business,
operating results or financial condition.

On July 29, 2002, IKOS Systems, Inc., a
subsidiary of Mentor, filed a complaint against Cadence and
Quickturn in the U.S. District Court, District of Delaware,
Civil Action No. 02-1335, accusing Quickturn’s
Palladium

TM

product of infringing IKOS’ U.S.
Patent No. 5,847,578, and seeking unspecified damages and
injunctive relief. On October 22, 2002, upon motion by
Cadence and Quickturn, the court ordered the action to be
transferred to the U.S. District Court, Northern District
of California. Cadence believes the claim is without merit and
is vigorously defending this matter, but the ultimate outcome is
currently unknown. Management believes that the ultimate
resolution of this litigation will not have a material adverse
effect on Cadence’s business, operating results or
financial condition.

On December 30, 2002, Cadence filed a
complaint against IKOS and Mentor in the U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of California, Civil Action
No. C 02-5343 JF, alleging that IKOS’ products
infringe U.S. Patent No. 5,036,473 and seeking
unspecified damages and injunctive relief. On January 6,
2003, Quickturn filed a motion to amend its Answer and
Counterclaims in this suit to add a counterclaim alleging that
IKOS’ products infringe U.S. Patent
No. 5,036,473. On February 24, 2003, the Court granted
this motion and agreed to consolidate this action with Civil
Action No. 02-1335, described in the preceding paragraph.

On February 25, 2000, Cadence and several of
its officers were named as defendants in a lawsuit filed in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
California, entitled Maxick v. Cadence Design Systems,
Inc., File No. C 00-0658PJH. The action was brought on
behalf of a class of shareholders of OrCAD, Inc., and alleged
violations of the tender offer rules under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. The lawsuit arose out of Cadence’s
acquisition of OrCAD, which was completed in August 1999. The
parties have settled the matter and Cadence has paid
$1.25 million. The settlement was approved by the Court on
November 13, 2002.

For any of the disputes and litigation matters
discussed above, were an unfavorable ruling to occur in any
specific fiscal period, there exists the possibility of a
material adverse impact on the results of operations for such
period.

Overview

General

Cadence Design Systems, Inc. provides a broad
range of software and other technology and offers design and
methodology services for the product development requirements of
the world’s leading electronics companies. Cadence licenses
its electronic design automation, or EDA, software and hardware
technology and provides a range of services to companies
throughout the world to help accelerate and manage their product
development processes. Cadence’s products and services are
used by companies to design and develop complex ICs and
electronic systems, including semiconductors, computer systems
and peripherals, telecommunications and networking equipment,
mobile and wireless devices, automotive electronics, consumer
products and other advanced electronics. These industries are
experiencing a general downturn.

IC manufacturers and electronics systems
companies experienced a downturn in demand and production in
2001 and 2002, which has continued in 2003. Cadence expects
revenue to continue to be adversely affected by the general
downturn in the economy and, in particular, the electronics
industry.

Acquisitions

Cadence has acquired companies and businesses,
some of which are described below. Cadence expects to acquire
other companies or businesses in the future. For each of these
acquisitions the results of operations and the estimated fair
value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been
included in Cadence’s Consolidated Financial Statements
from the date of the acquisition. These acquisitions are
described in more detail in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

In September 2002, Cadence acquired IBM’s
Test Design Automation, or TDA, business and paid a total cash
purchase price of approximately $70.0 million. Concurrent
with the acquisition, Cadence licensed software to IBM under
subscription and term licenses, and entered into an agreement to
provide services. Payments for these arrangements are for cash
to be paid over the duration of the respective contracts under
Cadence’s standard payment terms. Cash expected to be paid
by IBM will be significantly in excess of the cash paid by
Cadence for the TDA business. The software licenses and services
transactions were determined to have fair value based upon
pricing for comparable transactions. Cadence purchased
IBM’s TDA business to acquire key technology and personnel.



In June 2002, Cadence acquired 100% of the
outstanding common stock of Simplex Solutions, Inc., a
publicly-traded company that provides software and services for
the design and verification of ICs. The aggregate purchase price
was $329.7 million which included the issuance of
approximately 14.6 million shares of Cadence common stock,
valued at $267.3 million, 4.5 million shares of
Cadence common stock issuable on the exercise of assumed
options, with a fair value of $46.4 million, and
acquisition costs of $16.0 million. The value of the common
stock issued was determined based on the average market price of
Cadence’s common stock for the five day period including
two days before and after the acquisition was announced. Cadence
purchased Simplex to acquire key personnel and technology.

In December 2001, Cadence acquired Silicon
Perspective Corporation, or SPC, a privately-held design
technology firm, for approximately 6.2 million shares of
Cadence common stock, valued at $129.4 million,
0.8 million shares of stock issuable upon the exercise of
assumed options with a fair value of $2.0 million, and
acquisition costs of $3.3 million, for a total initial
purchase price of $134.7 million. The purchase price will
increase as certain predetermined bookings and product
development goals, referred to as earnouts, are achieved in
fiscal 2002 and 2003. SPC provides electronic design tools that
bridge the gap between front-end logic designers and the
back-end physical design process. Earnouts totaling
12.2 million shares valued at $190.9 million were
earned for the fiscal year ending December 28, 2002, and
were issued in February 2003. Cadence recorded approximately 89%
of the value associated with the 12.2 million shares as
goodwill and the remaining 11% of the value as deferred
stock-based compensation. In connection with the acquisition,
Cadence initially allocated $108.8 million of the purchase
price to goodwill, which has been adjusted to
$280.2 million as a result of the earnouts. The goodwill,
deferred stock compensation and shares issued as consideration
will increase upon the achievement of earnouts in fiscal 2003.
The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
The technology and other acquired intangibles are being
amortized over one to five years. Compensation expense in
connection with the earnouts for the year ended
December 28, 2002 was $9.7 million.

In February 2001, Cadence acquired CadMOS Design
Technology, Inc., a privately-held design tools firm, for
approximately 3.6 million shares of Cadence common stock
and assumed options, valued at $92.7 million. The
acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. CadMOS provides
solutions to the signal integrity problems experienced in
nanometer processes. In the first quarter of 2002, Cadence
issued an additional 0.2 million shares, valued at
$3.6 million, due to CadMOS’ achievement of certain
predetermined performance goals. In addition, the purchase price
will increase by up to an additional 0.3 million Cadence
shares if certain predetermined performance goals are achieved
during the second and third years following the acquisition.
These goals are related to bookings, product development and
continued employment of certain CadMOS employees. In connection
with the acquisition, Cadence allocated the purchase price
primarily to goodwill of $50.2 million, which has been
adjusted to $53.8 million as a result of the achievement of
performance goals. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible
for tax purposes. Technology and other acquired intangibles of
$12.9 million were also recorded and are being amortized
over three to five years.

Tality
Separation, Restructuring and Reorganization

In July 2000, Cadence announced its plan to
separate its electronics design services group into a new
company named Tality Corporation, or Tality, and Tality filed a
registration statement with the SEC for Tality’s initial
public offering, or IPO. Tality’s separation from Cadence
was substantially completed in October 2000, and the electronic
design services business thereafter operated as a subsidiary of
Cadence. In October 2000, Cadence announced the postponement of
Tality’s IPO due to unfavorable market conditions. As a
result of the postponement of the Tality IPO, Cadence expensed
$2.8 million of IPO-related costs in the first quarter of
2001. In addition to the $2.8 million, in 2001 Cadence also
expensed $2.0 million of Tality separation costs related
primarily to information systems separation, legal and
consulting fees. In April 2001, Cadence announced the withdrawal
of the Tality IPO registration statement. Tality was reorganized
and restructured during 2001, and in the first and second
quarters of 2002. With the acquisition of Simplex in June 2002,
Simplex’s SoC Design Foundry business was combined with
Tality to operate as Cadence Design Foundry. Cadence Design
Foundry focuses on high-end digital, analog and mixed-signal IC
design in close



conjunction with Cadence technology development
groups. As a result, Cadence no longer has a separate design
services group named Tality.

Avant! Restitution and Settlement

On November 13, 2002, Cadence announced the
settlement of civil litigation filed against Avant! seeking
damages related to theft of Cadence intellectual property,
including software code, as well as other trade secrets. The
settlement with Avant!, its parent corporation Synopsys, Inc.
and several individuals included an agreement to dismiss all
pending claims and counterclaims in the litigation and required
the payment to Cadence of $265.0 million, which was
received in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2002. This amount, net
of related costs, is recorded in Avant! restitution and
settlement in Cadence’s Consolidated Income Statement.

On July 25, 2001, Avant! was ordered to pay
Cadence $195.4 million in criminal restitution after Avant!
entered a plea of no contest and was found guilty by the
Superior Court of the State of California of conspiracy to take
and use Cadence’s trade secrets. This conspiracy included
the theft by Avant! and certain individuals of Cadence
intellectual property, including software code, as well as other
trade secrets. As of December 29, 2001, approximately
$196.0 million, consisting of all of the restitution award
plus interest was received. This amount, net of related costs,
is recorded in Avant! restitution and settlement in
Cadence’s Consolidated Income Statement.

Critical Accounting Policies

Cadence’s critical accounting policies are
as follows:

•

revenue recognition;

•

estimating valuation allowances and accrued
    liabilities;

•

accounting for income taxes; and

•

valuation of long-lived and intangible assets and
    goodwill.

Revenue recognition.

Cadence derives revenue from three sources:

•

product revenue, which includes software
    licensing, hardware sales and hardware leases;

•

maintenance revenue from software and hardware;
    and

•

services revenue.

As described below, significant management
judgments and estimates are made and used to determine the
revenue recognized in any accounting period.

Cadence applies the provisions of Statement of
Position 97-2, “Software Revenue Recognition,” as
amended by Statement of Position 98-9 “Modification of
SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to
Certain Transactions,” to all product revenue transactions
where the software is not incidental. Cadence also applies the
provisions of SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for
Leases”, to all hardware lease transactions.

Cadence recognizes product revenue when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has
been delivered, the fee is fixed or determinable, collection of
the resulting receivable is probable, and vendor-specific
objective evidence of fair value, or VSOE, exists to allocate
the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements in
the arrangement. If VSOE does not exist for all elements to
support the allocation of the total fee among all delivered and
undelivered elements of the arrangement, revenue is deferred
until such evidence does exist for the undelivered elements, or
until all elements are delivered, whichever is earlier. If VSOE
of all undelivered elements exists but VSOE does not exist for
one or more delivered elements, revenue is recognized using the
residual method. Under the residual method, the VSOE of the
undelivered elements is deferred, and the remaining portion of
the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue.

Cadence’s VSOE for certain product elements
of an arrangement is based upon the pricing for comparable
transactions when the element is sold separately. Cadence’s
VSOE for maintenance is based upon



the customer’s annual renewal rates. VSOE
for services is based on the price charged when the services are
sold separately. The timing of revenue recognition for both
delivered and undelivered elements is in accordance with the
relevant provisions of SOP 97-2.

Cadence sells software using three license types.
These license types are:

•

Subscription licenses — software
    licensed for a specific time period, generally two to three
    years, with no rights to return and limited rights to remix the
    licensed software for unspecified future technology;

•

Term licenses — software licensed for a
    specific time period, generally two to three years, with no
    rights to return or exchange the licensed software; and

•

Perpetual licenses — software licensed
    on a perpetual basis with no right to return or exchange the
    licensed software.

For subscription and term licenses and hardware
leases, Cadence uses the license agreement and a signed contract
as evidence of an arrangement. For perpetual licenses, hardware
sales, maintenance renewals and small fixed-price service
projects, such as training classes and small, standard
methodology service engagements of approximately $10,000 or
less, Cadence uses a purchase order as evidence of an
arrangement. For all other service engagements, Cadence uses a
signed professional services agreement and a statement of work
to evidence an arrangement. Sales through its Japanese
distributor are evidenced by a master agreement governing the
relationship, together with binding purchase orders from the
distributor on a transaction-by-transaction basis.

Software is delivered to customers electronically
or on a CD-ROM. With respect to hardware, delivery of an entire
system is deemed to occur upon installation.

Cadence assesses whether a fee is fixed or
determinable primarily based on the payment terms associated
with the transaction. Cadence uses installment contracts for
subscription and term licenses and has established a history of
collecting under the original contract without providing
concessions on payments, products or services. The time periods
of installment contracts are equal to or less than the time
period of the licenses and payments are generally collected
quarterly. If different conditions were to prevail, and Cadence
no longer had a history of collecting under the original
contract without providing concessions on term licenses, revenue
from term licenses would be recognized as payments under the
installment contract become due and payable. This change could
have a material impact on Cadence’s results of operations.

Cadence assesses collectibility based on a number
of factors, including the customer’s past payment history
and its current creditworthiness. If collection of a fee is not
probable, Cadence defers the revenue and recognizes it at the
time collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally
upon receipt of cash payment.

Provided all the related conditions discussed
above are met, Cadence recognizes revenue for each software
license type as follows:

•

Subscription licenses — revenue
    associated with licensed software is recognized ratably over the
    term of the license commencing upon the effective date of the
    license and delivery of the licensed product; and

•

Term licenses and Perpetual licenses —
    all revenue associated with licensed software is recognized upon
    the effective date of the license and delivery of the licensed
    product.

Maintenance revenue consists of fees for
providing technical support and software updates on a
when-and-if available basis. Cadence recognizes all maintenance
revenue ratably over the maintenance period under each software
license agreement. For term and perpetual licenses, customers
renew maintenance agreements annually. For subscription
licenses, a portion of the revenue is allocated to maintenance
revenue.

Services revenue consists primarily of revenue
received for performing methodology and design services. Revenue
from service contracts is recognized on either a time and
materials basis as work is performed or using the
percentage-of-completion method. Cadence estimates the
percentage-of-completion on contracts with fixed or
not-to-exceed fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred
to date as a percentage of total



estimated hours to complete the project. Cadence
has a history of accurately estimating project status and the
hours necessary to complete projects. If different conditions
were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made,
then the use of the completed contract method would be required
and all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project
was completed. This change could have a material impact on
Cadence’s results of operations. For small fixed-price
projects, such as training classes and small, standard
methodology service engagements of approximately $10,000 or
less, revenue is recognized when the work is completed.

In September 2002, Cadence acquired IBM’s
TDA business. Concurrent with the acquisition, Cadence licensed
software to IBM and entered into an agreement to provide
services.

For concurrent transactions, Cadence considers
SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations”, and EITF
Issue No. 98-3, “Determining Whether a Nonmonetary
Transaction Involves Receipt of Productive Assets or of a
Business”, to determine whether the acquisition of the TDA
business qualified for accounting as a purchase business
combination. In addition, Cadence considered APB Opinion
No. 29, “Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions”
and EITF Issue No. 01-02, “Interpretation of APB
Opinion No. 29,” to determine whether the concurrent
transactions were appropriately recorded at their respective
fair values. Monetary transactions and nonmonetary transactions
that represent the culmination of an earnings process are
recorded at the fair values of the products delivered or
products or services received, whichever is more readily
determinable, if the fair values are reasonably determinable. In
concluding that the fair values were reasonably determinable,
Cadence considered its recent history of cash sales for similar
products or services in similar sized transactions with similar
terms. Approximately 3% of revenue recognized in 2002 resulted
from this concurrent transaction.

Estimating
valuation allowances and accrued liabilities.

The preparation of consolidated financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Management specifically analyzes accounts
receivable and also analyzes historical bad debts, customer
concentrations, customer creditworthiness, current economic
trends and changes in customer payment terms, changes in
customer demand and sales returns when evaluating the adequacy
of the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns in any
accounting period. Material differences may result in the amount
and timing of revenue and/or expenses for any period if
management made different judgments or utilized different
estimates.

Cadence has restructured business units in the
past and has established reserves at the low end of the range of
estimable cost against outstanding commitments for leased
properties that it has vacated. These reserves are based upon
management’s estimate of the landlord’s willingness to
negotiate a termination fee, the time required to sublet the
properties and the amount of sublease income that Cadence
estimates will be generated between the date the property was
vacated and expiration of the lease for each of the vacated
properties. These estimates are reviewed and revised quarterly
and may result in a substantial change to restructuring expense
should different conditions prevail than were anticipated in
original management estimates. See Note 2 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for the expected impact of new
accounting standards on future restructuring charges.

Accounting for
income taxes.

In preparing its Consolidated Financial
Statements, Cadence is required to estimate its income taxes in
each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. This process
involves estimating actual current tax liability together with
assessing temporary differences resulting from differing
treatment of items, such as deferred revenue, for tax and
accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax
assets and liabilities, which are included within the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cadence then assesses the
likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from
future taxable income, and to the extent it believes that
recovery is not likely,



Cadence must establish a valuation allowance. To
the extent Cadence establishes a valuation allowance for
deferred tax assets or increases this allowance in a period,
Cadence may need to include an expense within the tax provision
in its Consolidated Income Statements.

Significant management judgment is required in
determining the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets
and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net
deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance is based on
estimates of taxable income for each jurisdiction in which
Cadence operates and the period over which deferred tax assets
will be recoverable. In the event that actual results differ
from these estimates or Cadence adjusts these estimates in
future periods, Cadence may need to establish an additional
valuation allowance, which could materially affect its financial
position and results of operations.

Valuation of
long-lived intangible assets and goodwill.

Cadence reviews, at least annually, goodwill
resulting from purchase business combinations for impairment in
accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets.” Cadence reviews long-lived assets,
including certain identifiable intangibles, for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
Cadence will not be able to recover the asset’s carrying
amount in accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.”

For long-lived assets to be held and used,
including acquired intangibles, Cadence initiates its review
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable.
Recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its
carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows
expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that
asset, excluding future interest costs that would be recognized
as an expense when incurred. Any impairment to be recognized is
measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset
exceeds its fair market value. Significant management judgment
is required in the forecasting of future operating results and
proceeds from disposition which are used in the preparation of
projected cash flows and, should different conditions prevail or
judgments be made, material impairment charges could be
necessary.

Results of Operations

Revenue

Sources of Revenue as a Percent of Total
Revenue

Product revenue decreased $18.6 million in
2002 compared to 2001, primarily due to a shift in the mix of
software license types executed in each period. In 2002, Cadence
experienced increasing customer preference for its subscription
licenses, which give customers limited access to new technology.
Product revenue associated with subscription licenses is
recognized ratably over the term of the license, which has the
effect of deferring the timing of revenue recognition to future
periods. Revenue may also be deferred under term and perpetual
licenses until payments become due and payable from customers
with non-linear payment terms or



as cash is collected from customers with lower
credit ratings. Product revenue from Cadence’s software
licenses recognized on a ratable basis comprised 45%, 32% and
19% of software revenue for the years ended 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.

Revenue recognized on a ratable basis is expected
to continue to increase as a percentage of overall revenue to
the extent customers continue to prefer subscription licenses in
the future, or continue to request more flexible payment terms,
both of which cause revenue to be recognized ratably over time.

Product revenue increased $203.1 million in
2001 compared to 2000, primarily due to an overall increase in
volume of license renewals with major customers, and to a lesser
extent, an increase in sales of Cadence’s software products
to new customers. The increase in sales volume was primarily due
to an increase in sales volume of Cadence’s IC
implementation products, which include synthesis place and route
physical design and physical verification products. The
increases were partially offset by a decrease in Cadence
Verification Acceleration, or CVA, product sales.

Services revenue decreased $113.5 million in
2002 compared to 2001, primarily due to a reduction in customer
spending for external services as a result of the economic
downturn experienced in the electronics industry which Cadence
serves. Services revenue declined primarily due to fewer new
engagements and fewer services hours billed on existing
engagements. Reduced customer spending can be expected to affect
services revenue in the future to the extent the economy in
general, and the electronics industry in particular, continue to
experience slow economic growth.

Services revenue decreased $72.6 million in
2001 compared to 2000, primarily due to a reduction in customer
spending for external services as a result of the economic
downturn experienced in the industries Cadence serves,
particularly telecommunication. Tality’s revenue declined
$49.9 million in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to
fewer new engagements and fewer services hours billed on
existing engagements. Methodology Services revenue declined
$22.2 million in 2001 compared to 2000, primarily due to a
general weakness in customer demand for short-term consulting
services.

Maintenance revenue decreased $5.2 million
in 2002 compared to 2001, primarily due to fewer renewals of
maintenance contracts. Maintenance revenue increased
$20.4 million in 2001 compared to 2000, primarily due to
the growth of Cadence’s installed customer base and the
renewal of maintenance and support contracts.

Additional financial information about segments
can be found in Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Revenue by Geography

Revenue by Geography as a Percent of Total
Revenue

International revenue decreased
$67.1 million in 2002 compared to 2001, due to decreases in
services revenue worldwide and decreases in product revenue in
Europe, slightly offset by an increase in product revenue in
Japan. Revenue in Japan accounted for 33% of total international
revenue in 2002 compared to 28% in 2001. The slight increase in
product revenue in Japan was due to the timing of license
renewals for existing



customers and was partially offset by a decrease
in services revenue. Cadence does not expect significant revenue
growth in Japan in the foreseeable future due to continuing
stagnant economic conditions in Japan.

International revenue increased
$86.2 million in 2001 compared to 2000, primarily due to
increases in product revenue worldwide, partially offset by a
decrease in services revenue worldwide. Revenue in Japan
accounted for 28% of total international revenue in 2001
compared to 35% in 2000. Revenue in Japan decreased as a result
of lower services revenue.

Differences in the rate of revenue growth over
the periods presented, and as compared geographically, are
primarily due to fluctuations in product sales volume and the
timing of significant customer contracts.

Foreign currency exchange rates negatively
affected revenue by $8.4 million in 2002, primarily due to
the weakening of the Japanese yen in relation to the
U.S. dollar. Foreign currency exchange rates negatively
affected revenue by $19.9 million in 2001, primarily due to
the weakening of the Japanese yen. Foreign currency exchange
rates negatively affected revenue by $3.8 million in 2000,
primarily due to the weakening of the British pound and German
mark in relation to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by
the strengthening of the Japanese yen in relation to the
U.S. dollar. Additional information about revenue and other
financial information by geography can be found in Note 19
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Cost of Revenue

Cost of Revenue as a Percent of Related
Revenue

Cost of product revenue includes costs of
employee salary and benefits, documentation and royalties.
Manufacturing costs associated with CVA products also include
materials, labor and overhead.

A summary of Cost of product is as follows:

Cost of product revenue decreased
$25.1 million in 2002 compared to 2001, primarily due to a
decrease in sales of CVA products and lower amounts of inventory
write-offs in 2002 compared to 2001. Cost of product revenue
increased $8.3 million in 2001 compared to 2000. The
increase was primarily due to increases in inventory write-offs,
partially offset by decreases in manufacturing expenses
associated with the decrease in sales of CVA products.

In the year ended December 28, 2002, Cadence
recorded a $9.3 million write-off for excess inventory in
cost of product revenue, for excess inventory from decreased
sales forecasts. In the year ended December 29,



2001, Cadence recorded an $18.9 million
write-off for excess inventory in cost of product revenue. Of
the $18.9 million, $15.2 million of the write-off was
related to excess inventory from decreased sales forecasts and
$3.7 million related to two product lines that were
discontinued as part of Cadence’s restructuring. The excess
inventory charges of $9.3 million in 2002 and
$15.2 million in 2001 were due to significant decreases in
forecasted revenue for emulation products and were calculated in
accordance with Cadence’s policy, which is based on
inventory in excess of 12-month demand. Inventory purchases and
commitments are based on future sales forecasts. Cadence
typically buys and builds inventory levels for certain key
components to mitigate component supply constraints. Based on
Cadence’s current 12-month demand forecast, Cadence does
not anticipate that the excess inventory will be used at a later
date. Cadence has determined that inventory levels at
December 28, 2002 were within forecasted usage for the
succeeding 12-month period.

Product gross margin increased slightly in 2002
when compared to 2001 primarily due to lower inventory
write-offs in 2002. Product gross margin increased in 2001
compared to 2000, primarily due to an increase in volume of
license renewals with major customers.

Cost of services revenue primarily includes
employee salary and benefits, costs to maintain the
infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization and
provisions for contract losses, if any. Cost of services revenue
decreased $78.7 million in 2002 compared to 2001, primarily
due to decreases in employee salary and benefit costs resulting
from Cadence’s reduction of services professionals in
connection with its restructuring actions initiated in 2001.
Cost of services revenue decreased $24.2 million in 2001
compared to 2000, primarily due to decreases in employee salary
and benefit costs resulting from Cadence’s reduction of
services professionals in connection with its restructuring
initiated in 2001.

Services gross margin decreased in 2002 compared
to 2001, primarily due to the downturn in the industries Cadence
serves, particularly telecommunications, resulting in revenue
declining faster than costs. Services gross margin decreased in
2001 compared to 2000, also primarily due to revenue declining
faster than costs. Services gross margin has been, and may
continue to be reduced by, Cadence’s inability to fully
utilize its services resources.

Cost of maintenance revenue includes the cost of
customer services, such as hot-line and on-site support,
production employees and documentation of maintenance updates.
Cost of maintenance revenue decreased $1.1 million in 2002
compared to 2001, primarily due to a decrease in employee salary
and benefit costs resulting from a decrease in employee
headcount. Cost of maintenance revenue increased
$2.0 million in 2001 compared to 2000, primarily due to an
increase in employee salary and benefit costs resulting from an
increase in employee headcount.

Operating Expenses

Operating Expenses as a Percent of Total
    Revenue



Marketing and Sales

Marketing and sales expenses increased
$6.0 million in 2002 compared to 2001, primarily due to an
increase in employee salary and benefit costs resulting from an
increase in employee headcount, primarily from acquisitions,
partially offset by a decrease in marketing program expenses.
Marketing and sales expenses increased $3.5 million in 2001
compared to 2000, primarily due to an increase in employee
salary and benefit costs resulting from an increase in employee
headcount, partially offset by a decrease in commissions
expense. Cadence expects marketing and sales expenses to
decrease in 2003 as a result of a decrease in employee headcount.

Research and Development

The increase in research and development expense
of $29.1 million for 2002 compared to 2001, was primarily
due to an increase in employee salary and benefit costs
resulting from an increase in employee headcount, primarily from
acquisitions. The increase in research and development expense
of $33.4 million for 2001 compared to 2000, was primarily
due to an increase in employee salary and benefit costs
resulting from an increase in employee headcount. Cadence
expects research and development expenses to increase in 2003
compared to 2002.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expense decreased
$3.6 million in 2002 compared to 2001, primarily due to a
decrease in bad debt expense, particularly related to the design
services business, and a decrease in employee salary and benefit
costs resulting from a decrease in employee headcount. The
decrease was partially offset by $11.1 million of
litigation expense. General and administrative expense increased
$18.1 million in 2001 compared to 2000, primarily due to an
increase of employee salary and benefit costs resulting from an
increase in employee headcount, increases in bad debt expense
related to Tality, and increased use of outside consulting
services.

Foreign currency exchange rates negatively
affected operating expenses by $1.2 million in 2002,
compared to 2001, primarily due to the strengthening of the euro
and British pound in relation to the U.S. dollar. Foreign
currency exchange rates positively affected operating expenses
by $9.3 million in 2001, compared to 2000, primarily due to
the weakening of the Japanese yen and British pound in relation
to the U.S. dollar.

Amortization of Acquired
Intangibles

Amortization of Acquired Intangibles as a
Percent of Total Revenue

Amortization of acquired intangibles decreased
$10.6 million in 2002 compared to 2001, primarily due to
the effects of implementing SFAS, No. 142, “Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets” which requires that goodwill
no longer be amortized. This reduction was partially offset by
amortization of intangibles acquired from SPC and Simplex.
Amortization of acquired intangibles increased
$11.8 million in 2001 compared to 2000, primarily due to
the 2001 acquisition of CadMOS,

partially offset
by a reduction attributable to the write-off of Diablo Research
Company LLC, or Diablo, goodwill in the second quarter of 2001.
See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



Amortization of Deferred Stock
Compensation

Amortization of Deferred Stock Compensation
as a Percent of Total Revenue

Cadence recorded deferred stock compensation
resulting from stock options granted in 2001 and 2000, which
were subsequently retired, to purchase Tality stock and sales of
Tality restricted stock. Deferred stock compensation from Tality
option grants and restricted stock sales represents the
difference between the exercise price of stock option grants to
Tality employees and directors, and the price paid for
restricted stock by certain Cadence executives and employees,
and the deemed fair market value of Tality’s common stock
at the time of those grants and sales.

In addition, Cadence recorded deferred stock
compensation resulting from Cadence’s acquisition of
CadMOS, Simplex, SPC and Plato Design Systems Incorporated.
Deferred stock compensation resulting from these acquisitions
represents the difference between the exercise price of unvested
stock option grants to employees of the acquired companies and
the fair market value of Cadence’s common stock at the time
of such acquisitions.

Deferred compensation expense of
$9.7 million related to the SPC acquisition was recorded in
2002 because a portion of the additional shares issued upon
attaining performance goals required continued employment with
Cadence of certain SPC employees. The acquisition agreement
provides for the issuance of additional shares of Cadence’s
common stock as certain performance goals are achieved in fiscal
2003.

Amortization of deferred stock compensation
increased $19.6 million in 2002 compared to 2001, primarily
due to the deferred stock compensation related to the Plato,
Simplex and SPC acquisitions. Amortization of deferred stock
compensation increased $6.5 million in 2001 compared to
2000, primarily due to the absence of similar costs in the first
six months of 2000.

For the years ended December 28, 2002 and
December 29, 2001, Cadence recorded on its balance sheet a
total of $37.7 million and $40.4 million of deferred
stock compensation, respectively. Of the $37.7 million,
$19.5 million is related to SPC’s achievement of
certain predetermined goals, $9.9 million is related to the
acquisition of Plato and $8.3 million is related to the
acquisition of Simplex. Of the $40.4 million,
$27.4 million is related to the acquisition of SPC,
$10.0 million is related to the acquisition of CadMOS, and
$3.0 million is related to Tality stock option grants.
Cadence is amortizing deferred stock compensation to expense
using the straight-line method over the period that the stock
options and restricted stock vest. For the year ended
December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001, Cadence
reversed deferred stock compensation of $10.9 million and
$27.8 million, respectively, related to the cancellation of
unvested options.

Avant! Restitution and
Settlement

On November 13, 2002, Cadence announced the
settlement of civil litigation filed against Avant! seeking
damages related to theft of Cadence intellectual property,
including software code, as well as other trade secrets. The
settlement with Avant!, its parent corporation Synopsys, Inc.
and several individuals included an agreement to dismiss all
pending claims and counterclaims in the litigation and required
the payment to Cadence of $265.0 million, which was received in
the fourth fiscal quarter of 2002. This amount, net of related
costs, is recorded in Avant! restitution and settlement in
Cadence’s Consolidated Income Statement.

On July 25, 2001, Avant! was ordered to pay
Cadence $195.4 million in criminal restitution after Avant!
entered a plea of no contest and was found guilty by the
Superior Court of the State of California of conspiracy to take
and use Cadence’s trade secrets. This conspiracy included
the theft by Avant! and certain individuals



of Cadence intellectual property, including
software code, as well as other trade secrets. As of
December 29, 2001, approximately $196.0 million,
consisting of all of the restitution award plus interest was
received. This amount, net of related costs, is recorded in
Avant! restitution and settlement in Cadence’s Consolidated
Income Statement.

Restructuring and Other
Charges

In 2001, Cadence announced a plan of
restructuring activities throughout the company targeted at
eliminating redundancies and consolidating facilities and
resources. The restructuring activities were initiated primarily
due to the severe economic downturn in the electronics industry.
The restructuring was primarily aimed at reducing excess
personnel and capacity costs within Cadence’s Design
Foundry business (formerly Tality) and certain other
business/infrastructure groups.

A summary of restructuring charges and asset
impairment is as follows:

For the year ended December 29, 2001,
Cadence recorded $61.6 million of restructuring and other
charges. Cadence’s restructuring costs and other charges
consisted of $21.6 million for workforce reduction,
$21.9 million to downsize and close excess facilities and
$18.1 million of asset-related charges related to certain
long-lived assets that were abandoned. Management estimates that
the restructuring will result in annualized cost reductions of
approximately $70.4 million in employee salary and benefit
costs related to the 2001 workforce reduction.

For the year ended December 28, 2002,
Cadence recorded $134.3 million of restructuring and other
charges. Cadence’s restructuring costs and other charges
consisted of $52.2 million for workforce reduction,
$46.9 million in changes in estimates for previously
recorded accruals and to downsize and close excess facilities,
and $35.2 million of asset-related charges related to
certain long-lived assets that were abandoned. Management
estimates that Cadence will realize annualized cost reductions
of approximately $159 million in salary and benefit costs
related to the 2002 workforce reduction and $16 million in
facility costs related to facilities downsized or closed since
the commencement of the restructuring activity in 2001, which
amounts could vary based on changes in estimates.

The 2001 restructuring activities resulted in a
reduction of 705 employees, which were predominately Tality
employees. While employee reductions were across all business
functions, operating units and geographic regions,
Cadence’s wireless communications-related areas within
Tality were affected more than other areas. In addition, the
number of temporary and contract workers employed by Cadence
were reduced. Severance costs resulting from the restructuring
included severance benefits, notice pay and out-placement
services. As the result of the separation of Tality from
Cadence, approximately $5.3 million of the restructuring
charges was paid to certain Tality employees who were
participants in Cadence’s employee stock purchase plan
prior to Tality’s separation from Cadence in October 2000.
All terminations and termination benefits were communicated to
the affected employees prior to December 29, 2001. All
severance benefits were paid out before the end of the first
quarter of 2002.

The 2002 restructuring activities will result in
the termination of employment of approximately 1,370 employees.
While such terminations of employment are across various
business functions, operating units and geographic regions, the
communications-related areas within the design services business
are the most affected. Costs resulting from the restructuring
included severance benefits, notice pay and outplacement
services. All terminations and termination benefits were
communicated to the affected employees prior to
December 28, 2002. All severance benefits are expected to
be paid by December 27, 2003.



For the year ended December 29, 2001,
facilities consolidation charges of $21.9 million were
incurred in connection with the downsizing and closing of 16
sites. As of December 29, 2001, six sites had been vacated
and eight sites had been downsized.

For the year ended December 28, 2002,
facilities consolidation charges of $46.9 million were
incurred in connection with the further downsizing of four
previously downsized sites, the downsizing and closing of 16
additional sites, and changes in lease loss estimates for three
sites. Of the $46.9 million, $17.3 million related to
changes in lease loss estimates. The low end of the lease loss
range related to all worldwide restructuring activities
initiated in 2001 is $25.6 million, which will be adjusted
in the future upon triggering events, such as changes in
estimates of time to sublease and actual sublease rates. Cadence
has estimated that the high end of the lease loss could be as
much as $55.0 million if facilities operating lease rental
rates continue to decrease in applicable markets or if it takes
longer than expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease the
facilities. Since June 2001, 33 sites have been selected for
downsizing or closure. As of December 28, 2002, 16 sites
had been vacated, nine sites had been downsized, and actions
related to the eight remaining sites are scheduled to occur by
the end of 2003.

Closure and downsizing costs included payments
required under lease contracts, less any applicable estimated
sublease income after the properties were abandoned, lease
buyout costs, restoration costs associated with certain lease
arrangements and costs to maintain facilities during the period
after abandonment. To determine the lease loss, which is the
loss after Cadence’s cost recovery efforts from subleasing
a building, certain assumptions were made related to the:
(1) time period over which the relevant building would
remain vacant, (2) sublease terms, and (3) sublease
rates, including common area charges. The lease loss is an
estimate and represents the low end of the range.

For the year ended December 29, 2001,
Cadence incurred asset-related and other restructuring charges
of $18.1 million, consisting primarily of $14.4 million of
leasehold improvements for facilities and other fixed assets
that were either abandoned or for which the resulting estimated
future reduced cash flows were insufficient to cover the
associated expenses. Cadence also recorded $2.2 million of
asset-related charges for abandoned software.

For the year ended December 28, 2002,
asset-related and other restructuring charges of
$35.2 million were incurred in connection with leasehold
improvements for facilities, other fixed assets and software
license agreements that were abandoned and contract termination
costs.

Write-off of Acquired in-Process
Technology

Upon consummation of the acquisition of
IBM’s TDA business in September 2002, Cadence immediately
charged to expense $6.6 million representing acquired
in-process technology that had not yet reached technological
feasibility and had no alternative future use. The purchase
price allocated to acquired in-process technology was determined
by identifying research projects in areas for which
technological feasibility has not been established. The value
was determined by estimating costs to develop the acquired
in-process technology into commercially viable products,
estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects and
discounting the net cash flows back to their present value. The
discount rate included a factor that reflects the uncertainty
surrounding successful development of the acquired in-process
technology. The in-process technology is expected to be
commercially viable in September 2003. As of December 28,
2002, expenditures to complete the in-process technology totaled
$2.5 million and expenditures to complete the remaining
in-process technology are expected to total approximately
$8.8 million. These estimates are subject to change, given
the uncertainties of the development process, and no assurance
can be given that deviations from these estimates will not
occur. Additionally, these projects will require additional
research and development after they have reached a state of
technological and commercial feasibility.

At the time of its acquisition by Cadence, the
IBM TDA business’ in-process research and
development projects were related to the development of
TestBench Tools. The nature of the efforts to complete these
projects related, in varying degrees, to the completion of all
planning, designing, prototyping, verification and testing
activities necessary to establish that the proposed technologies
meet their design specifications including functional, technical
and economic performance requirements.



The net cash flows resulting from the projects
underway in the IBM TDA business used to value the
purchased research and development were based on
management’s estimates of revenue, cost of revenue,
research and development costs, selling, general and
administrative costs and income taxes from such projects. The
revenue projections were based on the potential market size that
the projects address, Cadence’s ability to gain market
acceptance in these segments and the life cycle of this
in-process technology.

Estimated total revenue from the acquired
in-process technology is expected to peak primarily in 2006 and
decline rapidly thereafter as other new products are expected to
enter the market. In addition, a portion of the anticipated
revenue had been attributed to enhancements of the base
technology under development, and has been excluded from net
cash flow calculations. Existing technology was valued at
$12.2 million. The net cash flows generated from the
acquired in-process technology were expected to reflect earnings
before interest, taxes and depreciation of approximately 65% of
the revenue generated from in-process technology. However, there
can be no assurance that these estimates will prove accurate, or
that Cadence will realize the anticipated benefit of the
acquisition.

The rate used to discount the net cash flows from
purchased in-process technology was approximately 24%. The
discount rate is sometimes higher than Cadence’s weighted
average cost of capital, or WACC, due to the inherent
uncertainties in the estimates, including the uncertainty
surrounding the successful development of the acquired
in-process technology, the useful life of such technology, the
profitability levels of such technology, if any, and the
uncertainty of technological advances, all of which were unknown
at that time.

Upon consummation of the Simplex acquisition in
June 2002, Cadence immediately charged to expense
$27.4 million representing acquired in-process technology
that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no
alternative future use. The purchase price allocated to acquired
in-process technology was determined by identifying research
projects in areas for which technological feasibility has not
been established. The value was determined by estimating costs
to develop the acquired in-process technology into commercially
viable products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from
such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their
present value. The discount rate included a factor that reflects
the uncertainty surrounding successful development of the
acquired in-process technology. The in-process technology is
expected to be commercially viable in March 2003. As of
December 28, 2002, expenditures to complete the in-process
technology totaled $3.8 million, and expenditures to
complete the remaining in-process technology are expected to
total approximately $0.4 million. These estimates are
subject to change, given the uncertainties of the development
process, and no assurance can be given that deviations from
these estimates will not occur. Additionally, these projects
will require additional research and development after they have
reached a state of technological and commercial feasibility.

At the time of its acquisition by Cadence,
Simplex’s in-process research and development projects were
related to the development of extraction and power analysis
technologies. The nature of the efforts to complete these
projects related, in varying degrees, to the completion of all
planning, designing, prototyping, verification and testing
activities necessary to establish that the proposed technologies
meet their design specifications including functional, technical
and economic performance requirements.

The net cash flows resulting from the projects
underway at Simplex used to value the purchased research and
development were based on management’s estimates of
revenue, cost of revenue, research and development costs,
selling, general and administrative costs and income taxes from
such projects. The revenue projections were based on the
potential market size that the projects address, Cadence’s
ability to gain market acceptance in these segments, and the
life cycle of this in-process technology.

Estimated total revenue from the acquired
in-process technology is expected to primarily peak in 2004 and
decline rapidly thereafter as other new products are expected to
enter the market. In addition, a portion of the anticipated
revenue had been attributed to enhancements of the base
technology under development, and has been excluded from net
cash flow calculations. Existing technology was valued at
$13.9 million. The net cash flows generated from the
acquired in-process technology were expected to reflect earnings
before interest, taxes, and depreciation of approximately 53% of
the revenue generated from in-process technology. However, there
can be no assurance that these estimates will prove accurate, or
that Cadence will realize the anticipated benefit of the
acquisition.



The rate used to discount the net cash flows from
purchased in-process technology was approximately 30%. The
discount rate is sometimes higher than Cadence’s WACC,
due to the inherent uncertainties in the estimates, including
the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the
acquired in-process technology, the useful life of such
technology, the profitability levels of such technology, if any,
and the uncertainty of technological advances, all of which were
unknown at that time.

Upon completion of the SPC acquisition, Cadence
immediately charged to expense $8.6 million representing
acquired in-process technology that had not yet reached
technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. The
purchase price allocated to acquired in-process technology was
determined by identifying research projects in areas for which
technological feasibility has not been established. The value
was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired
in-process technology into commercially viable products,
estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects and
discounting the net cash flows back to their present value. The
discount rate included a factor that took into account the
uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the
acquired in-process technology. The in-process technology was
completed in March 2002. Expenditures to complete the in-process
technology totaled $1.5 million.

At the time of its acquisition by Cadence,
SPC’s in-process research and development projects were
related to the development of an enhanced version of its
routing-estimation technology and the development of a signal
integrity analysis and optimization tool. These capabilities are
important for IC design at and below 130 nanometer
geometries. The nature of the efforts to complete these projects
related, in varying degrees, to the completion of all planning,
designing, prototyping, verification and testing activities
necessary to establish that the proposed technologies meet their
design specifications, including functional, technical and
economic performance requirements.

The net cash flows resulting from the projects
underway at SPC used to value the purchased research and
development were based on management’s estimates of
revenue, cost of revenue, research and development costs,
selling, general and administrative costs, and income taxes from
such projects. The revenue projections were based on the
potential market size that the projects address, Cadence’s
ability to gain market acceptance in these segments, and the
life cycle of this in-process technology.

Estimated total revenue from the acquired
in-process technology is expected to peak in 2004 and decline
rapidly thereafter as other new products are expected to enter
the market. In addition, a portion of the anticipated revenue
had been attributed to enhancements of the base technology under
development, and has been excluded from net cash flow
calculations. Existing technology was valued at
$8.4 million. The net cash flows generated from the
acquired in-process technology were expected to reflect earnings
before interest, taxes and depreciation of approximately 35% of
the revenue generated from in-process technology. However, there
can be no assurance that these assumptions will prove accurate,
or that Cadence will realize the anticipated benefit of the
acquisition.

The discount of the net cash flows to their
present value was based on Cadence’s WACC.
Cadence’s WACC calculation produces the average
required rate of return of an investment in an operating
enterprise, based on the required rates of return from
investments in various areas of the enterprise. The rate used to
discount the net cash flows from purchased in-process technology
was 36%. The discount rate is sometimes higher than
Cadence’s WACC due to the inherent uncertainties in
the estimates, including the uncertainty surrounding the
successful development of the acquired in-process technology,
the useful life of such technology, the profitability levels of
such technology, if any, and the uncertainty of technological
advances, all of which were unknown at that time.

During 2001, Cadence acquired substantially all
of the assets of two companies for an initial aggregate price of
$10.5 million, of which $4.4 million was cash and
$6.1 million was shares of Cadence common stock, plus
future contingent payments. The acquisitions were accounted for
as purchases. Upon consummation of the acquisitions, Cadence
charged to expense, immediately after the respective
acquisition, an aggregate of $1.0 million representing
acquired in-process technology that had not yet reached
technological feasibility and had no alternative future use.



Upon consummation of the CadMOS acquisition,
Cadence immediately charged to expense $12.1 million
representing acquired in-process technology that had not yet
reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future
use. The amount of purchase price allocated to acquired
in-process technology was determined, in part, by a third party
appraiser through valuation techniques. The value was determined
by estimating the costs to develop the acquired in-process
technology into commercially viable products, estimating the
resulting net cash flows from such projects and discounting the
net cash flows back to their present value. The discount rate
included a factor that reflected the uncertainty surrounding the
successful development of the acquired in-process technology.
The in-process technology was completed as of September 28,
2002. Expenditures to complete the in-process technology totaled
$1.9 million.

At the time of its acquisition by Cadence,
CadMOS’ in-process research and development projects were
related to the development of a static timing analysis tool, the
development of advanced fixing capabilities in the noise
analysis area, and in the mixed signal area, the development of
a flow to integrate with Cadence tools and a tool to analyze
large application-specific IC designs for substrate noise. The
nature of the efforts to complete these projects related, in
varying degrees, to the completion of all planning, designing,
prototyping, verification and testing activities necessary to
establish that the proposed technologies meet their design
specifications including functional, technical and economic
performance requirements.

The net cash flows resulting from the projects
underway at CadMOS used to value the purchased research and
development were based on management’s estimates of
revenue, cost of revenue, research and development costs,
selling, general and administrative costs and income taxes from
such projects. The revenue projections were based on the
potential market size that the projects address, Cadence’s
ability to gain market acceptance in these segments, and the
life cycle of this in-process technology.

Estimated total revenue from the acquired
in-process technology is expected to peak in 2004 and decline
rapidly thereafter as other new products are expected to enter
the market. In addition, a portion of the anticipated revenue
had been attributed to enhancements of the base technology under
development, and has been excluded from net cash flow
calculations. Existing technology was valued at
$3.6 million. The net cash flows generated from the
acquired in-process technology were expected to reflect earnings
before interest, taxes, and depreciation of approximately 50% of
the revenue generated from in-process technology. However, there
can be no assurance that these assumptions will prove accurate,
or that Cadence will realize the anticipated benefit of the
acquisition.

The discount of the net cash flows to their
present value was based on Cadence’s WACC. The rate used to
discount the net cash flows from purchased in-process technology
was 28%. The discount rate is sometimes higher than
Cadence’s WACC due to the inherent uncertainties in the
estimates, including the uncertainty surrounding the successful
development of the acquired in-process technology, the useful
life of such technology, the profitability levels of such
technology, if any, and the uncertainty of technological
advances, all of which were unknown at that time.

Impairment of Goodwill

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 142,
discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, Cadence evaluated goodwill for impairment whenever
events or circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of
goodwill may not be recoverable. Cadence recorded a charge of
$25.8 million in 2001 related to the impairment of goodwill
and acquired intangibles associated with the acquisition of
Diablo. This impairment was due to the decline in business
conditions generally and the wireless communications industry in
particular. Key factors in determining this impairment were
significant downsizing or reassignment of personnel directly
related to these assets and abandonment of most of Diablo’s
line of business. The impairment was calculated as the
difference between the carrying value of the intangible assets
associated with Diablo’s acquisition and the fair value of
those assets.



Other Income (loss), net

Other income (loss), net for 2002, 2001 and 2000
are as follows:

Total other income (loss), net, decreased
$18.3 million in 2002, when compared to 2001, primarily due
to $10.0 million of investment write-downs from two venture
capital funds, Telos Venture Partners, L.P., and Telos Venture
Partners II, L.P., collectively referred to as Telos, in
which Cadence holds a limited partnership interest, included in
Other expense, net, and $9.4 million of investment
write-downs in Cadence’s long-term investments, included in
Other expense, net. Total other income (loss), net, decreased
$2.7 million in 2001, when compared to 2000, primarily due
to a decrease in foreign exchange gains, partially offset by an
increase in interest income.

Provision for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes and the effective
tax rates for 2002, 2001 and 2000 are as follows:

As of December 28, 2002, Cadence had total
net deferred tax assets of approximately $105.3 million.
Realization of the deferred tax assets will depend on generating
sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of certain net
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Although
realization is not assured, management believes that it is more
likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be
realized. The amount of the net deferred tax assets, however,
could be reduced or increased in the near term if actual facts,
including the estimate of future taxable income, differ from
those estimated.

The 2002 effective tax rate includes Avant! civil
settlement proceeds of $265.0 million, the write-off of
acquired in-process technology of approximately
$34.0 million and stock compensation of approximately
$44.4 million. The 2002 effective tax rate, excluding the
Avant! civil settlement proceeds, the write-off of acquired
in-process technology and stock compensation was 26.0%. The 2001
effective tax rate includes Avant! criminal restitution proceeds
of approximately $196.0 million, the write-off of acquired
in-process technology of approximately $21.7 million and
stock compensation amortization of approximately
$17.9 million. The 2001 effective tax rate, excluding the
Avant! criminal restitution proceeds, the write-off of acquired
in-process technology and stock compensation was 26.5%.

Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

Cadence’s exposure to market risk for
changes in interest rates relates primarily to its short-term
investment portfolio. While Cadence is exposed to interest rate
fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized
countries, Cadence’s interest income and expense is most
sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of
U.S. interest rates. In this regard, changes in U.S.
interest rates affect the interest earned on Cadence’s



cash and cash equivalents, short-term and
long-term investments and interest paid on its long-term debt
obligations as well as costs associated with foreign currency
hedges.

Cadence invests in high quality credit issuers
and, by policy, limits the amount of its credit exposure to any
one issuer. As part of its policy, Cadence’s first priority
is to reduce the risk of principal loss. Consequently, Cadence
seeks to preserve its invested funds by limiting default risk,
market risk and reinvestment risk. Cadence mitigates default
risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that it
believes to be low risk and by positioning its portfolio to
respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit
rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The short-term
interest-bearing portfolio includes only marketable securities
with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio
liquidity.

On September 27, 2002, Cadence entered into
two syndicated, senior unsecured credit facilities, or the 2002
Facilities, that allow Cadence to borrow up to
$375.0 million. One of the 2002 Facilities is a
$187.5 million three-year revolving credit facility, or the
Three-Year Facility, which terminates on September 27,
2005. The other 2002 Facility consists of a $187.5 million,
364-day revolving credit facility convertible into a term loan,
or the 364-Day Facility. The 364-Day Facility will terminate on
September 26, 2003; provided, that at the request of
Cadence and with the consent of members of the bank group that
wish to do so, the date of termination may be extended for one
additional 364-day period with respect to the portion of the
amounts outstanding under the 364-Day Credit Agreement that a
consenting bank holds. Upon the scheduled and/or extended
termination, amounts outstanding under the 364-Day Facility may
be converted to a one-year term loan.

For both of the 2002 Facilities, Cadence has the
option to pay interest based on LIBOR plus a spread of between
1.25% and 1.50%, based on a pricing grid tied to a financial
covenant, or the higher of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50% or
the prime rate. In addition, commitment fees are payable on the
unused portion of the Three-Year Facility at rates between 0.25%
and 0.335% based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant
and on the unused portion of the 364-Day Facility at a fixed
rate of 0.225%. A utilization fee of 0.25% is payable on amounts
borrowed under the 2002 Facilities whenever combined borrowings
under the 2002 Facilities exceed $123.8 million. Cadence
may not borrow under the 364-Day Facility at any time that any
portion of the Three-Year Facility remains unused.

The 2002 Facilities contain certain financial and
other covenants, which must be maintained. The financial
covenants specify that Cadence must maintain a minimum Earnings
Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization, or EBITDA,
of not less than $200.0 million. Additionally, Cadence must
maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (the ratio of
EBITDA to the sum of (i) interest expense plus
(ii) 20% of funded debt plus (iii) taxes paid in cash
plus (iv) capital lease payments) of not less than 1.5 to
1.0. Other covenants require Cadence to maintain a minimum
one-to-one ratio of current assets to current liabilities and a
maximum two-to-one funded debt to EBITDA ratio, and to directly
own not less than 51% of its consolidated total assets. From
time to time, Cadence borrows amounts under the 2002 Facilities.
At December 28, 2002, Cadence was in compliance with the
covenants in the 2002 Facilities and had outstanding borrowings
of $52.0 million under the Three-Year Facility.

The 2002 Facilities replaced two previously
existing credit facilities, which terminated on
September 27, 2002. In connection with the termination of
the previously existing credit facilities, Cadence paid in full
all interest, principal, fees, and other amounts owing
thereunder.



The table below presents the carrying value and
related weighted average interest rates for Cadence’s
interest bearing instruments. All highly liquid investments with
an original maturity of three months or less at the date of
purchase are considered to be cash equivalents; investments with
original maturities between three and 12 months are
considered to be short-term investments. Investments with
original maturities greater than 12 months are considered
long-term investments. The carrying value approximated fair
value at December 28, 2002.

Foreign Currency Risk

Cadence’s operations include transactions in
foreign currencies and, as such, Cadence benefits from a weaker
dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative
to major currencies worldwide. The primary effect of foreign
currency transactions on Cadence’s results of operations
from a weakening U.S. dollar is an increase in revenue
offset by a smaller increase in expenses. Conversely, the
primary effect of foreign currency transactions on
Cadence’s results of operations from a strengthening
U.S. dollar is a reduction in revenue offset by a smaller
reduction in expenses.

Cadence enters into foreign currency forward
exchange contracts with financial institutions to protect
against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets
and liabilities. A foreign currency forward exchange contract
acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying asset
exposures decrease in value or underlying liability exposures
increase in value. Conversely, a foreign currency forward
exchange contract decreases in value when underlying asset
exposures increase in value or underlying liability exposures
decrease in value. Forward contracts are not accounted for as
hedges and, therefore, the unrealized gains and losses are
recognized in Other income (loss), net in advance of the actual
foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward
contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities.

Cadence does not use forward contracts for
trading purposes. Cadence’s ultimate realized gain or loss
with respect to currency fluctuations will depend on the
currency exchange rates in effect as the forward contracts
mature.

The table below provides information as of
December 28, 2002 about Cadence’s forward foreign
currency contracts. The information is provided in U.S.
dollar equivalent amounts. The table presents the notional



amounts, at contract exchange rates, and the
weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates.
These forward contracts mature prior to March 14, 2003.

While Cadence actively manages its foreign
currency risks on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance
that Cadence’s foreign currency hedging activities will
substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency
exchange rates on its results of operations, cash flows and
financial position. On a net basis, foreign currency
fluctuations did not materially impact Cadence’s results of
operations and financial position during the year ended
December 28, 2002. The realized gain (loss) on the forward
contracts as they matured was not material to the consolidated
operations of Cadence.

Equity Price Risk

Cadence repurchases shares of its common stock
under its stock repurchase program. Repurchased shares may be
used for general corporate purposes including the share issuance
requirements of Cadence’s employee stock option and
purchase plans and acquisitions. Cadence may purchase stock in
the open market for cash, or may purchase call options or sell
put warrants to mitigate equity price risk associated with its
stock repurchase program. The put warrants, if exercised and
settled by physical delivery of shares, would entitle the holder
to sell shares of Cadence common stock to Cadence at a specified
price. Similarly, the call options entitle Cadence to buy shares
of Cadence common stock at a specified price. Cadence has the
option to elect “net share settlement,” rather than
physical settlement, of put warrants that are exercised; that
is, Cadence has the right to settle the exercised put warrants
with shares of Cadence common stock valued at the difference
between the exercise price and the fair value of the stock at
the date of exercise. These transactions may result in sales of
a large number of shares and consequent decline in the market
price of Cadence common stock. Cadence’s stock repurchase
program includes the following characteristics:

•

Cadence may purchase shares of its common stock
    on the open market at the prevailing market prices.

•

Call options allow Cadence to buy shares of its
    common stock on a specified day at a specified price. If the
    market price of the stock is greater than the exercise price of
    a call option, Cadence will typically exercise the option and
    receive shares of its stock. If the market price of the common
    stock is less than the exercise price of a call option, Cadence
    typically will not exercise the option.

•

Call option issuers may accumulate a substantial
    number of shares of Cadence common stock in anticipation of
    Cadence’s exercising its call option and may dispose of
    these shares if and when Cadence fails to exercise its call
    option. This could cause the market price of Cadence common
    stock to fall.

•

Depending on the exercise price of the put
    warrants and the market price of Cadence common stock at the
    time of exercise, “net share settlement” of the put
    warrants with Cadence common



stock could cause Cadence to issue a substantial
    number of shares to the holder of the put warrant. The holder
    may sell these shares in the open market, which could cause the
    price of Cadence common stock to fall.

•

Put warrant holders may accumulate a substantial
    number of shares of Cadence common stock in anticipation of
    exercising their put warrants and may dispose of these shares if
    and when they exercise their put warrants and Cadence issues
    shares in settlement of their put warrants. This could also
    cause the market price of Cadence common stock to fall.

As of December 28, 2002, there were no put
warrants or call options outstanding.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

At December 28, 2002, Cadence’s
principal sources of liquidity consisted of $395.6 million
of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments,
compared to $274.8 million at December 29, 2001, and
two syndicated senior unsecured credit facilities totaling
$375.0 million. As of December 28, 2002, Cadence had a
total of $52.0 million outstanding under these credit
facilities.

Cash provided by operating activities decreased
$60.6 million, to $350.2 million at December 28,
2002 when compared to the year ended December 29, 2001,
primarily due to lower net income of $69.3 million, a
decrease in the proceeds from the sale of receivables of
$53.8 million, an increase in receivables of
$66.3 million, partially offset by an increase in non-cash
restructuring and other charges of $6.9 million and a
decrease in installment contract receivables of
$37.9 million.

Cadence has entered into agreements whereby it
may transfer qualifying accounts receivable to certain financing
institutions on a non-recourse basis. These transfers are
recorded as sales and accounted for in accordance with SFAS
No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of
Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities.”
During the fiscal years ended December 28, 2002 and
December 29, 2001, Cadence transferred accounts receivable
totaling $182.0 million and $235.8 million,
respectively, which approximated fair value, to financing
institutions on a non-recourse basis. For the years ended
December 29, 2001 and December 30, 2000, Cadence has
restated its Statements of Cash Flows to include proceeds from
the sale of receivables as a component of cash flows from
operating activities rather than as a component of cash flows
from financing activities, which is consistent with the guidance
of SFAS No. 95, “Statement of Cash Flows.”

At December 28, 2002, Cadence had net
working capital of $246.8 million, as compared with
$162.5 million at December 29, 2001. The working
capital increase was driven primarily by increases in cash and
cash equivalents of $165.0 million, increases in net
receivables of $55.6 million, partially offset by decreases
in short-term investments of $44.2 million, decreases in
prepaid expenses and other of $44.1 million, and increases
in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of
$38.4 million.

In addition to its short-term investments,
Cadence’s primary investing activities in 2002 consisted of
business combinations, purchases of property, plant and
equipment and venture capital partnership investments, which
combined represented $178.0 million and $169.6 million
of cash used for investing activities for the years ended
December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001, respectively.

Cadence provides for U.S. income taxes on
the earnings of its foreign subsidiaries unless they are
considered permanently invested outside of the United States. At
December 28, 2002, the cumulative amount of earnings upon
which U.S. income taxes have not been provided are
approximately $550 million. At December 28, 2002, the
unrecognized deferred tax liability for these earnings was
approximately $114 million.

Cadence has previously sold put warrants and
purchased call options through private placements. See
Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. At
December 28, 2002, there were no put warrants or call
options outstanding.

Cadence also purchased $181.8 million of its
stock with cash and reissued $77.2 million of stock through
its employee option and stock purchase programs during the year
ended December 28, 2002.

As part of its overall investment strategy,
Cadence is a limited partner in Telos. As of December 28,
2002, Cadence has committed $77.3 million to Telos and is
contractually committed to contribute up to an



additional $53.7 million. Cadence’s
investments in Telos are recorded in Other assets in the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

As compared to the prior year, Other long-term
liabilities increased $79.6 million to $214.4 million for
the year ended December 28, 2002. The increase was
primarily attributable to an increase in income taxes payable
and long-term lease obligations of the restructuring activities.
The primary components of Other long-term liabilities are income
taxes payable of $145.5 million, deferred compensation of
$34.9 million, and lease obligations related to
restructuring activities of $33.6 million.

On September 27, 2002, Cadence entered into
two syndicated, senior unsecured credit facilities, or the 2002
Facilities, that allow Cadence to borrow up to
$375.0 million. One of the 2002 Facilities is a
$187.5 million three-year revolving credit facility, or the
Three-Year Facility, which terminates on September 27,
2005. The other 2002 Facility consists of a $187.5 million,
364-day revolving credit facility convertible into a term loan,
or the 364-Day Facility. The 364-Day Facility will terminate on
September 26, 2003; provided, that at the request of
Cadence and with the consent of members of the bank group that
wish to do so, the date of termination may be extended for one
additional 364-day period with respect to the portion of the
amounts outstanding under the 364-Day Credit Agreement that a
consenting bank holds. Upon the scheduled and/or extended
termination, amounts outstanding under the 364-Day Facility may
be converted to a one-year term loan.

For both of the 2002 Facilities, Cadence has the
option to pay interest based on LIBOR plus a spread of between
1.25% and 1.50%, based on a pricing grid tied to a financial
covenant, or the higher of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50% or
the prime rate. In addition, commitment fees are payable on the
unused portion of the Three-Year Facility at rates between 0.25%
and 0.335% based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant
and on the unused portion of the 364-Day Facility at a fixed
rate of 0.225%. A utilization fee of 0.25% is payable on amounts
borrowed under the 2002 Facilities whenever combined borrowings
under the 2002 Facilities exceed $123.8 million. Cadence
may not borrow under the 364-Day Facility at any time that any
portion of the Three-Year Facility remains unused.

The 2002 Facilities contain certain financial and
other covenants, which must be maintained. The financial
covenants specify that Cadence must maintain a minimum Earnings
Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization, or EBITDA,
of not less than $200.0 million. Additionally, Cadence must
maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (the ratio of
EBITDA to the sum of (i) interest expense plus
(ii) 20% of funded debt plus (iii) taxes paid in cash
plus (iv) capital lease payments) of not less than 1.5 to
1.0. Other covenants require Cadence to maintain a minimum
one-to-one ratio of current assets to current liabilities and a
maximum two-to-one funded debt to EBITDA ratio, and to directly
own not less than 51% of its consolidated total assets. From
time to time, Cadence borrows amounts under the 2002 Facilities.
At December 28, 2002, Cadence was in compliance with the
covenants in the 2002 Facilities and had outstanding borrowings
of $52.0 million under the Three-Year Facility.

The 2002 Facilities replaced two previously
existing credit facilities, which terminated on
September 27, 2002. In connection with the termination of
the previously existing credit facilities, Cadence paid in full
all interest, principal, fees, and other amounts owing
thereunder.

Management estimates that the restructuring
actions for 2002 will result in annualized cost reductions of
approximately $159 million in salary and benefits. All
severance benefits are expected to be paid by December 27,
2003. Cadence expects to pay approximately $15 million in
rental and operating expenses in 2003, related to facilities
downsized or closed since the commencement of the restructuring
activity in 2001.



A summary of contractual obligations follows:

Cadence anticipates that current cash and
short-term investment balances and cash flow from operations
will be sufficient to meet its working capital and other capital
requirements for at least the next 12 months.

New Accounting Standards

In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No. 46, or FIN 46, “Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities — An Interpretation of
ARB No. 51.” FIN 46 requires companies to include
in their consolidated financial statements the assets,
liabilities and results of activities of variable interest
entities if the company holds a majority of the variable
interests. The consolidation requirements of FIN 46 are
effective for variable interest entities created after
January 31, 2003 or for entities in which an interest is
acquired after January 31, 2003. The consolidation
requirements of FIN 46 are effective June 15, 2003 for
all variable interest entities acquired before February 1,
2003. FIN 46 also requires companies that expect to
consolidate a variable interest entity they acquired before
February 1, 2003 to disclose the entity’s nature,
size, activities, and the company’s maximum exposure to
loss in financial statements issued after January 31, 2003.
Cadence has determined FIN 46 will not have a material
effect on its consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

In December 2002, the FASB, issued SFAS
No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation — Transition and Disclosure.” SFAS
No. 148 amends SFAS No. 123 “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation,” to provide alternative methods
of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based
method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In
addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements
of SFAS No. 123 to require disclosures in both annual and
interim financial statements about the method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method
used on reported results. The annual and interim disclosure
provisions are effective for financial reports containing
financial statements for annual and interim periods ending after
December 15, 2002. Cadence has adopted the disclosure
provisions for these annual financial statements and will adopt
the interim disclosure provisions for its interim financial
statements beginning with the period ending March 28, 2003.
Cadence has determined that the adoption of SFAS No. 148
will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No. 45, or FIN 45,
“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others.” FIN 45 requires that upon issuance of a
guarantee, a guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair
value of an obligation assumed under a guarantee. FIN 45
also requires additional disclosures by a guarantor in its
interim and annual financial statements about the obligations
associated with guarantees issued. The recognition provisions of
FIN 45 are effective for any guarantees issued or modified
after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements are
effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods
ending after December 15, 2002. See Note 9 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures required by
FIN 45. The adoption of FIN 45 did not have a material
effect on Cadence’s consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146,
“Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities.” SFAS No. 146 eliminates EITF Issue
No. 94-3 “Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity
(Including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructur-



ing).” Under SFAS No. 146, liabilities
for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity are
recognized when the liabilities are incurred, as opposed to
being recognized at the date of entity’s commitment to an
exit plan under EITF No. 94-3. Furthermore, SFAS
No. 146 establishes that fair value is the objective for
initial measurement of the liabilities. SFAS No. 146 will
be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated
after December 31, 2002. Cadence has determined SFAS
No. 146 will not have a material effect on its consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
However, SFAS No. 146 will impact the timing of accruals
for future restructurings, if any.

Item 14. Controls and
Procedures

Within 90 days prior to the filing date of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Cadence carried out an
evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of
the company’s management, including its Chief Executive
Officer (CEO) and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of Cadence’s
“disclosure controls and procedures” and
“internal controls” as specified in Item 307 of
Regulation S-K.

Disclosure controls and procedures are designed
with the objective of ensuring that (i) information
required to be disclosed in Cadence’s reports filed under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and
(ii) information is accumulated and communicated to
management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Internal
controls are procedures designed with the objective of providing
reasonable assurance that the company’s
(A) transactions are properly authorized; (B) assets
are safeguarded against unauthorized or improper use; and
(C) transactions are properly recorded and reported; all to
permit the preparation of the company’s financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

The evaluation of Cadence’s disclosure
controls and procedures and internal controls included a review
of their objectives and processes, implementation by the company
and effect on the information generated for use in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K. In the course of this evaluation,
Cadence sought to identify any significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses in Cadence’s controls, whether the
company had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who
have a significant role in the company’s internal controls,
and to confirm that any necessary corrective action, including
process improvements, were being undertaken. This type of
evaluation will be done on a quarterly basis so that the
conclusions concerning the effectiveness of these controls can
be reported in the company’s Quarterly Reports on
Form 10-Q and Annual Report on Form 10-K. The
company’s internal controls are also evaluated on an
ongoing basis by Cadence’s internal auditors and by other
personnel in Cadence’s Finance organization. The overall
goals of these evaluation activities are to monitor the
company’s disclosure and internal controls and to make
modifications as



necessary. The company intends to maintain these
controls as processes that may be appropriately modified as
circumstances warrant.

Based on the evaluation described above and
subject to the discussion below, the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer concluded that Cadence’s controls
and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material
information relating to the company (including its consolidated
subsidiaries) required to be included in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K. There have been no significant changes in the
company’s internal controls or in other factors that could
significantly affect those controls since the date of their last
evaluation. However, a control system, no matter how well
conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system
are met. Management necessarily applied its judgment in
assessing the benefits of controls relative to their costs.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all
control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the
company have been detected. The design of any system of controls
is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood
of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design
will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential
future conditions, regardless of how remote. Because of the
inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be
detected.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

The Stockholders and Board of Directors

Cadence Design Systems, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet of Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries
as of December 28, 2002 and the related consolidated income
statement, and consolidated statements of stockholders’
equity and cash flows for the year then ended (collectively, the
2002 consolidated financial statements). In connection with our
audit of the 2002 consolidated financial statements, we also
have audited the 2002 financial statement schedule listed in
Item 15.(a)2. These consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedule based on our audit. The accompanying 2001 and
2000 consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedules of Cadence Design Systems, Inc. were audited by other
auditors who have ceased operations. Those auditors expressed an
unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements
and financial statement schedules, before the revisions
described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements, in their report dated March 11, 2002.

We conducted our audit in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the 2002 consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Cadence Design Systems, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December 28, 2002, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the related
2002 financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein.

As discussed above, the 2001 and 2000
consolidated financial statements of Cadence Design Systems,
Inc. were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations.
As described in Note 2, the consolidated statements of cash
flows have been restated to include proceeds from the sale of
receivables as a component of cash flows from operating
activities rather than as a component of cash flows from
financing activities. We audited the adjustments described in
Note 2 that were applied to restate the 2001 and 2000
consolidated statements of cash flows. In our opinion, such
adjustments are appropriate and have been properly applied. As
also described in Note 2, the consolidated financial
statements have been revised to include the transitional
disclosures required by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets” (SFAS No. 142), which was adopted by the
Company as of December 30, 2001 (the beginning of the
Company’s fiscal year 2002). In our opinion, the
disclosures for 2001 and 2000 related to the adoption of
SFAS No. 142 in Note 2 are appropriate. However,
we were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to
the 2001 and 2000 consolidated financial statements of Cadence
Design Systems, Inc. other than with respect to such adjustments
and disclosures and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion
or any other form of assurance on the 2001 and 2000 consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC
ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of
Cadence Design Systems, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (a Delaware
corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 29, 2001 and
December 30, 2000, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each
of the three fiscal years in the period ended December 29,
2001. These financial statements and the schedule referred to
below are the responsibility of Cadence’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
consolidated financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Cadence Design Systems, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December 29, 2001 and
December 30, 2000, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the
period ended December 29, 2001, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

Our audits were made for the purpose of forming
an opinion on the basic financial statements taken as a whole.
The schedule listed in Item 14.(a)2. is presented for
purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s rules and is not part of the basic
consolidated financial statements. This schedule has been
subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the
basic consolidated financial statements and, in our opinion,
fairly states in all material respects the financial data
required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

NOTE 1. CADENCE

Cadence Design Systems, Inc. provides a broad
range of software and other technology and offers design and
methodology services for the product development requirements of
the world’s leading electronics companies. Cadence licenses
its leading-edge electronic design automation, or EDA, software
and hardware technology and provides a range of services to
companies throughout the world to help accelerate and manage
their product development processes. Cadence’s products and
services are used by companies to design and develop complex
integrated circuits, or ICs, and electronic systems, including
semiconductors, computer systems and peripherals,
telecommunications and networking equipment, mobile and wireless
devices, automotive electronics, consumer products and other
advanced electronics.

NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles
of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

Cadence’s fiscal year end is the Saturday
closest to December 31.

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Cadence and its subsidiaries after elimination of
intercompany accounts and transactions. Investments in companies
in which voting interests range from 20% to 50%, and for which
Cadence has significant influence, are accounted for using the
equity method of accounting.

In the second quarter of 2002, Simplex Solutions,
Inc.’s System-on-a-Chip, or SoC, Design Foundry was
combined with Cadence’s Tality group to operate as Cadence
Design Foundry. Cadence Design Foundry focuses on high-end
digital, analog and mixed-signal IC design in close
conjunction with Cadence technology development groups. As a
result, Cadence no longer has a separate design services group
named Tality.

Restated
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and Other
Reclassifications

For the years ended December 29, 2001 and
December 30, 2000, Cadence has restated its Statements of
Cash Flows to include proceeds from the sale of receivables as a
component of cash flows from operating activities rather than as
a component of cash flows from financing activities, which is
consistent with the guidance of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 95, “Statement of
Cash Flows.” Certain other prior year consolidated
financial statement balances have been reclassified to conform
to the 2002 presentation. Such reclassifications are not
considered significant.

Use
of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Cash,
Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

Cadence considers all highly liquid debt
instruments, including commercial paper, euro time deposits,
repurchase agreements and certificates of deposit with remaining
maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be
cash equivalents. Investments with maturities greater than three
months and less than one year are classified as short-term
investments. Investments with maturities greater than one year
are classified as long-term investments.



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)

December 28, 2002

Management considers all of its investments in
marketable securities as available-for-sale in accordance with
SFAS No. 115. Securities classified as available-for-sale
are stated at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses
reported as a component of stockholders’ equity until
realized. The cost of securities sold is determined using the
specific identification method when computing realized gains and
losses.

Foreign
Currency Translation

Cadence transacts business in various foreign
currencies. In general, the functional currency of a foreign
operation is the local country’s currency. Consequently,
assets and liabilities of operations outside the United States
are translated into U.S. dollars using year-end exchange
rates. Revenue and expenses are translated at the exchange rates
in effect at the end of each month during the year. The effects
of foreign currency translation adjustments are included in
Stockholders’ Equity as a component of Accumulated other
comprehensive income in the accompanying Consolidated Balance
Sheets.

Derivative
Financial Instruments

Cadence enters into foreign currency forward
exchange contracts with financial institutions to protect
against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets
and liabilities. A foreign currency forward exchange contract
acts as an economic hedge by increasing in value when underlying
asset exposures decrease in value or underlying liability
exposures increase in value. Conversely, a foreign currency
forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying
asset exposures increase in value or underlying liability
exposures decrease in value. Forward contracts are not accounted
for as hedges and, therefore, the unrealized gains and losses
are recognized in Other income (loss), net in advance of the
actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these
forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities.

Cadence does not use forward contracts for
trading or hedging purposes. Cadence’s ultimate realized
gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend
on the currency exchange rates in effect as the forward
contracts mature.

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts

Cadence makes judgments as to its ability to
collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the
portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful.
Provisions are made based upon a specific review of all
significant outstanding invoices. For those invoices not
specifically reviewed, provisions are provided at differing
rates, based upon the age of the receivable. In determining
these percentages, Cadence analyzes its historical collection
experience and current economic trends. If the historical data
Cadence uses to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful
accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect
outstanding receivables, additional provisions for doubtful
accounts may be needed and the future results of operations
could be materially affected.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost
(using the first-in, first-out method) or market. Cadence’s
inventories include high technology parts and components for
complex computer systems that emulate the performance and
operation of computer IC and electronic systems. These
parts and components may be specialized in nature or subject to
rapid technological obsolescence. While Cadence has programs to
minimize the required inventories on hand and considers
technological obsolescence when estimating required reserves to
reduce recorded amounts to market values, it is reasonably
possible that such estimates could change in the near term.

Property,
Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost.
Depreciation and amortization are provided over the estimated
useful lives, using the straight-line method, as follows:

Computer equipment and related software

3-8 years

Buildings

10-32 years

Leasehold and building improvements

Shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful
    life

Furniture and fixtures

3-5 years

Equipment

3-5 years

Cadence capitalizes the costs of software
developed for internal use in compliance with Statement of
Position, or SOP, 98-1 “Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use”
and with Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue 00-2
“Accounting for Web Site Development Costs.”
Capitalization of software developed for internal use and web
site development costs begins at the application development
phase of the project. In 2002 and 2001 Cadence capitalized
$48.1 million and $68.0 million, respectively, of
costs relating to the implementation, and consulting services
from third parties for software that is used internally.
Amortization of software developed for internal use and web site
development costs begins when the products are placed in
productive use, and is computed on a straight-line basis over
the estimated useful life of the product.

Cadence recorded depreciation expense of
property, plant and equipment for the fiscal years 2002, 2001,
and 2000 in the amount of $100.1 million,
$83.2 million and $76.7 million, respectively.

Software
Development Costs

In accordance with SFAS No. 86,
“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold,
Leased, or Otherwise Marketed”, development costs incurred
in the research and development of new software products to be
sold, leased or otherwise marketed are expensed as incurred
until technological feasibility in the form of a working model
has been established. Internally generated capitalizable
software development costs have not been material.

Acquired
Intangibles

Acquired intangibles, which include goodwill,
purchased technology, and other intangible assets, are stated at
cost less accumulated depreciation and are reviewed periodically
for impairment. In accordance with SFAS No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” which was
adopted on December 30, 2001 (the beginning of
Cadence’s fiscal year 2002), goodwill and purchased
intangibles with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized
but are reviewed periodically for impairment. Accordingly,
Cadence has ceased to amortize approximately $178.8 million
of goodwill, net of amortization, including workforce
intangibles that were subsumed into goodwill upon adoption of
SFAS No. 142. Acquired intangibles with definite lives are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated
economic life of the underlying products and technologies
(original lives assigned are one to seven years).

During the third quarter of 2002, Cadence
completed its annual impairment analysis of acquired technology,
goodwill and intangibles. Based on the results of the impairment
review, Cadence has determined that no indicators of impairment
existed for any of its reporting units, and therefore no
impairment charge has been recognized for the fiscal year ended
December 28, 2002.



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)

December 28, 2002

The pro forma effects of the adoption of SFAS
No. 142 are as follows:

Long-lived
Assets

Cadence’s long-lived assets consist of
property, plant and equipment and other acquired intangibles,
excluding goodwill. Cadence periodically reviews its long-lived
assets for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144
“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets.” For assets to be held and used, Cadence initiates
its review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be
recoverable. Recoverability of an asset is measured by
comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future
undiscounted cash flows (without interest charges) that the
asset is expected to generate. If it is determined that an asset
is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded in the amount
by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.

Assets to be disposed of and for which management
has committed to a plan to dispose of the assets, whether
through sale or abandonment, are reported at the lower of
carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

Deferred
Revenue

Deferred revenue arises when customers are billed
for products and/or services in advance of delivery and
completion of the earnings process. Cadence’s deferred
revenue consists primarily of unearned revenue on maintenance
and product licenses for which revenue is recognized in
installments over the duration of the license, or ratable
product licenses. Maintenance on perpetual licenses is generally
renewed annually, billed in full in advance, and earned ratably
over the ensuing 12 month maintenance period. Ratable
product licenses and maintenance on term licenses are generally
billed quarterly in advance and earned ratably over the ensuing
license period.

Stock-Based
Compensation

At December 28, 2002, Cadence has six
stock-based employee compensation plans, which are described
more fully in Note 10. Cadence accounts for these plans under
the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting
Principles Board, or APB, Opinion No. 25 “Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees”, and related
interpretations. Under APB Opinion No. 25, compensation
expense is recognized if an option’s exercise price on the
measurement date is below the fair value of the Company’s
common stock. The compensation, if any, is amortized to expense
over the vesting period.

The following table illustrates the effect on net
income (loss) and income (loss) per share if Cadence had applied
the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” to
stock-based compensation.

Comprehensive
Income

Other comprehensive income includes foreign
currency translation gains and losses and unrealized gains and
losses on marketable securities that are available-for-sale that
have been excluded from net income and reflected instead in
stockholders’ equity. Cadence has reported the components
of comprehensive income on its Consolidated Statements of
Stockholders’ Equity.

The following table sets forth the activity in
other comprehensive income, net of income tax:



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Revenue
Recognition

Cadence derives revenue from three sources:

•

product revenue, which includes software
    licensing, hardware sales and hardware leases;

•

maintenance revenue from software and hardware;
    and

•

services revenue.

As described below, significant management
judgments and estimates are made and used to determine the
revenue recognized in any accounting period.

Cadence applies the provisions of SOP 97-2,
“Software Revenue Recognition,” as amended by
SOP 98-9 “Modification of SOP 97-2, Software
Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions,”
to all product revenue transactions where the software is not
incidental. Cadence also applies the provisions of
SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for Leases”, to all
hardware lease transactions.

Cadence recognizes product revenue when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has
been delivered, the fee is fixed or determinable, collection of
the resulting receivable is probable, and vendor-specific
objective evidence of fair value, or VSOE, exists to allocate
the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements in
the arrangement. If VSOE does not exist for all elements to
support the allocation of the total fee among all delivered and
undelivered elements of the arrangement, revenue is deferred
until such evidence does exist for the undelivered elements, or
until all elements are delivered, whichever is earlier. If VSOE
of all undelivered elements exists but VSOE does not exist for
one or more delivered elements, revenue is recognized using the
residual method. Under the residual method, the VSOE of the
undelivered elements is deferred, and the remaining portion of
the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue.

Cadence’s VSOE for certain product elements
of an arrangement is based upon the pricing for comparable
transactions when the element is sold separately. Cadence’s
VSOE for maintenance is based upon the customer’s annual
renewal rates. VSOE for services is based on the price charged
when the services are sold separately. The timing of revenue
recognition for both delivered and undelivered elements is in
accordance with the relevant provisions of SOP 97-2.

Cadence sells software using three license types.
These license types are:

•

Subscription licenses — software
    licensed for a specific time period, generally two to three
    years, with no rights to return and limited rights to remix the
    licensed software for unspecified future technology;

•

Term licenses — software licensed for a
    specific time period, generally two to three years, with no
    rights to return or exchange the licensed software; and

•

Perpetual licenses — software licensed
    on a perpetual basis with no right to return or exchange the
    licensed software.

For subscription and term licenses and hardware
leases, Cadence uses the license agreement and a signed contract
as evidence of an arrangement. For perpetual licenses, hardware
sales, maintenance renewals and small fixed-price service
projects, such as training classes and small, standard
methodology service engagements of approximately $10,000 or
less, Cadence uses a purchase order as evidence of an
arrangement. For all other service engagements, Cadence uses a
signed professional services agreement and a statement of work
to evidence an arrangement. Sales through its Japanese
distributor are evidenced by a master agreement governing the
relationship, together with binding purchase orders from the
distributor on a transaction-by-transaction basis.

Software is delivered to customers electronically
or on a CD-ROM. With respect to hardware, delivery of an entire
system is deemed to occur upon installation.



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)

December 28, 2002

Cadence assesses whether a fee is fixed or
determinable primarily based on the payment terms associated
with the transaction. Cadence uses installment contracts for
subscription and term licenses and has established a history of
collecting under the original contract without providing
concessions on payments, products or services. The time periods
of installment contracts are equal to or less than the time
period of the licenses and payments are generally collected
quarterly. If different conditions were to prevail, and Cadence
no longer had a history of collecting under the original
contract without providing concessions on term licenses, revenue
from term licenses would be recognized as payments under the
installment contract become due and payable. This change could
have a material impact on Cadence’s results of operations.

Cadence assesses collectibility based on a number
of factors, including the customer’s past payment history
and its current creditworthiness. If collection of a fee is not
probable, Cadence defers the revenue and recognizes it at the
time collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally
upon receipt of cash payment.

Provided all the related conditions discussed
above are met, Cadence recognizes revenue for each software
license type as follows:

•

Subscription licenses — revenue
    associated with licensed software is recognized ratably over the
    term of the license commencing upon the effective date of the
    license and delivery of the licensed product; and

•

Term licenses and Perpetual licenses —
    all revenue associated with licensed software is recognized upon
    the effective date of the license and delivery of the licensed
    product.

Maintenance revenue consists of fees for
providing technical support and software updates on a
when-and-if available basis. Cadence recognizes all maintenance
revenue ratably over the maintenance period under each software
license agreement. For term and perpetual licenses, customers
renew maintenance agreements annually. For subscription
licenses, a portion of the revenue is allocated to maintenance
revenue.

Services revenue consists primarily of revenue
received for performing methodology and design services. Revenue
from service contracts is recognized either on a time and
materials basis as work is performed or using the
percentage-of-completion method. Cadence estimates the
percentage-of-completion on contracts with fixed or
not-to-exceed fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred
to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the
project. Cadence has a history of accurately estimating project
status and the cost to complete projects. If different
conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could
not be made, then the use of the completed contract method would
be required and all revenue and costs would be deferred until
the project was completed. This change could have a material
impact on Cadence’s results of operations. For small
fixed-price projects, such as training classes and small,
standard methodology service engagements of approximately
$10,000 or less, revenue is recognized when the work is
completed.

In September 2002, Cadence acquired International
Business Machine Corporation’s, or IBM’s, Test Design
Automation, or TDA, business. Concurrent with the acquisition,
Cadence licensed software to IBM and entered into an agreement
to provide services.

For concurrent transactions, Cadence considers
SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations”, and EITF
Issue No. 98-3, “Determining Whether a Nonmonetary
Transaction Involves Receipt of Productive Assets or of a
Business”, to determine whether the acquisition of the TDA
business qualified for accounting as a purchase business
combination. In addition, Cadence considered APB Opinion
No. 29, “Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions”
and EITF Issue No. 01-02, “Interpretation of APB
Opinion No. 29,” to determine whether the concurrent
transactions were appropriately recorded at their respective
fair values. Monetary transactions and nonmonetary transactions
that represent the culmination of an earnings process are
recorded at the fair values of the products delivered or
products or services received, whichever is more readily



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)

December 28, 2002

determinable, if the fair values are reasonably
determinable. In concluding that the fair values were reasonably
determinable, Cadence considered its recent history of cash
sales for similar products or services in similar sized
transactions with similar terms. Approximately 3% of revenue
recognized in 2002 resulted from this concurrent transaction.

Accounting
for Income Taxes

Cadence uses the asset and liability method to
account for income taxes. Cadence is required to estimate its
income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates.
This process involves estimating actual current tax liability
together with assessing temporary differences resulting from
differing treatment of items, such as deferred revenue, for tax
and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred
tax assets and liabilities, which are measured using enacted tax
rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date. Cadence then assesses the
likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from
future taxable income, and to the extent it believes that
recovery is not likely, Cadence must establish a valuation
allowance. To the extent Cadence establishes a valuation
allowance for deferred tax assets or increases this allowance in
a period, Cadence may need to include an expense within the tax
provision in its Consolidated Income Statements.

Significant management judgment is required in
determining the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets
and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net
deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance is based on
estimates of taxable income for each jurisdiction in which
Cadence operates and the period over which deferred tax assets
will be recoverable. In the event that actual results differ
from these estimates or Cadence adjusts these estimates in
future periods, Cadence may need to establish an additional
valuation allowance, which could materially affect its financial
position and results of operations.

Concentrations
of Credit Risk

Financial instruments, including derivative
financial instruments, that may potentially subject Cadence to
concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of cash, cash
equivalents, short-term investments, long-term investments,
accounts receivable, forward contracts and call options
purchased in conjunction with Cadence’s stock repurchase
programs. Cadence’s investment policy limits investments to
short-term, low-risk instruments. Concentration of credit risk
related to accounts receivable is limited, due to the varied
customers comprising Cadence’s customer base and their
dispersion across geographies. Credit exposure related to the
forward contracts and the call options is limited to the
realized and unrealized gains on these contracts. All financial
instruments are executed with financial institutions with strong
credit ratings, which minimizes risk of loss due to nonpayment.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

The fair value of Cadence’s cash and cash
equivalents, short term and long term investments, receivables,
accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and deferred revenue
approximate their carrying value due to the short-term nature of
these instruments. The fair market values of Cadence’s debt
and capital lease obligations and installment contract
receivables approximate their carrying values based upon current
market rates of interest.

Advertising

Cadence expenses the production costs of
advertising as incurred. Advertising expense was approximately
$13.4 million, $19.3 million and $22.9 million
for the fiscal years ended 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively,
and is included in marketing and sales in the accompanying
Consolidated Income Statements.

New
Accounting Standards

In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No. 46, or FIN 46, “Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities — An Interpretation of
ARB No. 51.” FIN 46 requires companies to include
in their consolidated financial statements the assets,
liabilities and results of activities of variable interest
entities if the company holds a majority of the variable
interests. The consolidation requirements of FIN 46 are
effective for variable interest entities created after
January 31, 2003 or for entities in which an interest is
acquired after January 31, 2003. The consolidation
requirements of FIN 46 are effective June 15, 2003 for
all variable interest entities acquired before February 1,
2003. FIN 46 also requires companies that expect to
consolidate a variable interest entity they acquired before
February 1, 2003 to disclose the entity’s nature,
size, activities, and the company’s maximum exposure to
loss in financial statements issued after January 31, 2003.
Cadence has determined FIN 46 will not have a material
effect on its consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

In December 2002, the FASB, issued SFAS
No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation — Transition and Disclosure.” SFAS
No. 148 amends SFAS No. 123 “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation,” to provide alternative methods
of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based
method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In
addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements
of SFAS No. 123 to require disclosures in both annual and
interim financial statements about the method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method
used on reported results. The annual and interim disclosure
provisions are effective for financial reports containing
financial statements for annual and interim periods ending after
December 15, 2002. Cadence has adopted the disclosure
provisions for these annual financial statements and will adopt
the interim disclosure provisions for its interim financial
statements beginning with the period ending March 28, 2003.
Cadence has determined that the adoption of
SFAS No. 148 will not have a material impact on its
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No. 45, or FIN 45,
“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others.” FIN 45 requires that upon issuance of a
guarantee, a guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair
value of an obligation assumed under a guarantee. FIN 45
also requires additional disclosures by a guarantor in its
interim and annual financial statements about the obligations
associated with guarantees issued. The recognition provisions of
FIN 45 are effective for any guarantees issued or modified
after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements are
effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods
ending after December 15, 2002. See Note 9 for
disclosures required by FIN 45. The adoption of FIN 45
did not have a material effect on Cadence’s consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146,
“Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities.” SFAS No. 146 eliminates EITF Issue
No. 94-3 “Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity
(Including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring).”
Under SFAS No. 146, liabilities for costs associated with
an exit or disposal activity are recognized when the liabilities
are incurred, as opposed to being recognized at the date of
entity’s commitment to an exit plan under EITF
No. 94-3. Furthermore, SFAS No. 146 establishes that
fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the
liabilities. SFAS No. 146 will be effective for exit or
disposal activities that are initiated after December 31,
2002. Cadence has determined SFAS No. 146 will not have a
material effect on its consolidated financial position, results
of operations or cash flows. However, SFAS No. 146 will
impact the timing of accruals for future restructurings, if any.

IBM
TDA

In September 2002, Cadence acquired IBM’s
TDA business and paid a total cash purchase price of
approximately $70.0 million. Concurrent with the
acquisition, Cadence licensed software to IBM under subscription
and term licenses, and entered into an agreement to provide
services. Payments for these arrangements are to be paid over
the duration of the respective contracts under Cadence’s
standard payment terms. Cash expected to be paid by IBM will be
significantly in excess of the cash paid by Cadence for the TDA
business. The software licenses and services transactions were
determined to have fair value based upon pricing for comparable
transactions. Cadence purchased IBM’s TDA business to
acquire key technology and personnel.

The following table summarizes the allocation of
the purchase price of the TDA business and the estimated
amortization period for the acquired intangibles:

The $6.6 million of purchase price allocated
to acquired in-process technology was determined, in part, by a
third party appraiser through established valuation techniques.
The acquired in-process technology was immediately expensed
because technological feasibility had not been established and
no future alternative use exists. The in-process technology
write-off is a component of operating expenses in the
Consolidated Income Statements. The weighted-average useful
lives of the acquired intangibles, excluding in-process
technology, is approximately five years.

The $38.9 million of goodwill was assigned
to the Product segment. For tax purposes, $19.9 million of
the goodwill is expected to be deductible.

Simplex
Solutions, Inc.

In June 2002, Cadence acquired 100% of the
outstanding common stock of Simplex Solutions, Inc., a
publicly-traded company that provides software and services for
the design and verification of ICs. The aggregate purchase price
was $329.7 million which included the issuance of
approximately 14.6 million shares of Cadence common stock,
valued at $267.3 million, 4.5 million shares of
Cadence common stock issuable on the exercise of assumed
options, with a fair value of $46.4 million, and
acquisition costs of $16.0 million. The value of the common
stock issued was determined based on the average market price of
Cadence’s common stock for the five day period including
two days before and after the acquisition was announced. Cadence
purchased Simplex to acquire key personnel and technology.

December 28, 2002

The following table summarizes the allocation of
the purchase price for Simplex and the estimated amortization
period for the acquired intangibles:

The $27.4 million of purchase price
allocated to acquired in-process technology was determined, in
part, by a third party appraiser through established valuation
techniques. The acquired in-process technology was immediately
expensed because technological feasibility had not been
established and no future alternative use exists. The in-process
technology write-off is included as a component of operating
expenses in the Consolidated Income Statements. The
weighted-average useful lives of the acquired intangibles,
excluding in-process technology, is approximately four years.

The $225.2 million of goodwill was assigned
to the Product and Services segments in the amounts of
$115.1 million and $110.1 million, respectively. None
of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

Other
2002 Acquisitions

For the year ended December 28, 2002,
Cadence also acquired: four companies; substantially all of the
assets of one company; and the assets of one division of another
company. The initial aggregate purchase price for these
acquisitions was $67.0 million, of which $33.5 million
was cash and the remainder related to the issuance of shares of
Cadence common stock with a fair value of $33.5 million.
Certain of these acquisitions also include contingent
consideration for which the amounts have not yet been determined.

Goodwill recognized in these transactions was
$44.7 million, all of which was assigned to the Product
segment. Of the total goodwill, $8.5 million is expected to
be deductible for tax purposes.

Comparative pro forma financial information for
all 2002 acquisitions has not been presented because the results
of operations were not material to Cadence’s Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Silicon
Perspective Corporation

In December 2001, Cadence acquired Silicon
Perspective Corporation, or SPC, a privately-held design
technology firm, for approximately 6.2 million shares of
Cadence common stock, valued at $129.4 million,
0.8 million shares of stock issuable upon the exercise of
assumed options with a fair value of $2.0 million, and
acquisition costs of $3.3 million, for a total initial
purchase price of $134.7 million. The purchase price will
increase as certain predetermined bookings and product
development goals, referred to as earnouts, are achieved in
fiscal 2002 and 2003. SPC provides electronic design tools that
bridge the gap between front-end logic designers and the
back-end physical design process. Earnouts totaling
12.2 million shares valued at $190.9 million were
earned for the fiscal year ending December 28, 2002, and
were issued in February 2003. Cadence recorded approximately 89%
of the value associated with the 12.2 million shares as
goodwill and the remaining 11% of the value as deferred
stock-based compensation. In connection with the acquisition,
Cadence initially allocated $108.8 million of the purchase
price to goodwill, which has been adjusted to
$280.2 million as a result of the earnouts. The goodwill,
deferred stock compensation and shares issued as consideration
will increase upon the achievement of earnouts in fiscal 2003.
The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
The technology and other acquired intangibles are being
amortized over one to five years. Compensation expense in
connection with the earnouts for the year ended
December 28, 2002 was $9.7 million.

Upon consummation of the SPC acquisition, Cadence
immediately charged to expense $8.6 million representing
acquired in-process technology that had not yet reached
technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. The
amount of purchase price allocated to acquired in-process
technology was determined, in part by a third party appraiser
through established valuation techniques. The value was
determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired
in-process technology into commercially viable products,
estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects and
discounting the net cash flows back to their present value. The
discount rate included a factor that took into account the
uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the
acquired in-process technology. The in-process technology was
completed as of March 2002. Expenditures to complete the
in-process technology totaled $1.5 million.

CadMOS
Design Technology, Inc.

In February 2001, Cadence acquired CadMOS Design
Technology, Inc., a privately-held design tools firm, for
approximately 3.6 million shares of Cadence common stock
and assumed options, valued at $92.7 million. The
acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. CadMOS provides
solutions to the signal integrity problems experienced in
nanometer processes. In the first quarter of 2002, Cadence
issued an additional 0.2 million shares, valued at
$3.6 million, due to CadMOS’ achievement of certain
predetermined performance goals. In addition, the purchase price
will increase by up to an additional 0.3 million Cadence
shares if certain predetermined performance goals are achieved
during the second and third years following the acquisition.
These goals are related to bookings, product development and
continued employment of certain CadMOS employees. In connection
with the acquisition, Cadence allocated the purchase price
primarily to goodwill of $50.2 million, which has been
adjusted to $53.8 million as a result of the achievement of
performance goals. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible
for tax purposes. Technology and other acquired intangibles of
$12.9 million were also recorded and are being amortized
over three to five years.

Upon consummation of the CadMOS acquisition,
Cadence immediately charged to expense $12.1 million,
representing acquired in-process technology that had not yet
reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future
use. The amount of purchase price allocated to acquired
in-process technology was determined, in part, by a third party
appraiser through established valuation techniques. The value
was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired
in-process technology into commercially viable products,
estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects and
discounting the net cash flows back to their present value. The
discount rate included a factor that reflected the uncertainty
surrounding successful

development of the acquired in-process
technology. The in-process technology was completed as of
September 28, 2002. Expenditures to complete the in-process
technology totaled $1.9 million.

Other
2001 Acquisitions

During 2001, Cadence acquired substantially all
of the assets of two companies for an initial aggregate price of
$10.5 million, of which $4.4 million was cash and
$6.1 million was shares of Cadence stock. Each acquisition
was accounted for as a purchase. Upon consummation of the
acquisitions, Cadence charged to expense, immediately after the
respective acquisition, an aggregate of $1.0 million
representing acquired in-process technology that had not yet
reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future
use.

Comparative pro forma financial information for
all 2001 acquisitions has not been presented because the results
of operations were not material to Cadence’s Consolidated
Financial Statements.

NOTE 5. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Investments

The following tables summarize Cadence’s
investment activities as of December 28, 2002 and
December 29, 2001:



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)

December 28, 2002

Cadence’s marketable securities are
classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value.
Unrealized gains, net of taxes, are included in other
comprehensive income. If Cadence determines that an investment
has an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, generally
defined as when the cost basis exceeds the fair value for
approximately six months, Cadence recognizes the investment loss
in Other income (loss), net. Realized gains and losses are
recognized based on the specific identification method and are
recognized in Other income (loss). Net realized gains on
marketable securities were $9.2 million, $17.7 million
and $14.3 million for the years ended December 28,
2002, December 29, 2001, and December 30, 2000,
respectively.

As part of its overall investment strategy,
Cadence is a limited partner in two venture capital funds, Telos
Venture Partners, L.P., and Telos Venture Partners II,
L.P., collectively referred to as Telos. As of December 28,
2002, Cadence has committed $77.3 million to Telos and is
contractually committed to contribute up to an additional
$53.7 million. Undistributed investments in Telos are
included in non-marketable securities.

Telos and Cadence’s other non-marketable
securities are carried at cost and are included in Other assets
in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. If Cadence determines that
an other-than-temporary decline exists in a non-marketable
equity security, Cadence writes down the investment to its fair
value and records the related write-down as an investment loss
in its Consolidated Income Statements.

Sale
of Receivables

Cadence has entered into agreements whereby it
may transfer qualifying accounts receivable to certain financing
institutions on a non-recourse basis. These transfers are
recorded as sales and accounted for in accordance with SFAS
No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of
Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities.”
During the fiscal years ended December 28, 2002 and
December 29, 2001, Cadence transferred accounts receivable
totaling $182.0 million and $235.8 million,
respectively, which approximated fair value, to financing
institutions on a non-recourse basis. For the years ended
December 29, 2001 and December 30, 2000, Cadence has
restated its Statements of Cash Flows to include proceeds from
the sale of receivables as a component of cash flows from
operating activities rather than as a component of cash flows
from financing activities, which is consistent with the guidance
of SFAS No. 95, “Statement of Cash Flows.”

Derivative
Financial Instruments

The following table shows the notional principal
and fair value of Cadence’s derivative financial
instruments as of December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001:

The estimates of fair value are based on
financial market information as of December 28, 2002 and
December 29, 2001. As of December 28, 2002 and
December 29, 2001, the credit risk associated with the
forward contracts was negligible. Although the table above
reflects the notional principal and fair value amounts of
Cadence’s foreign exchange instruments, it does not reflect
the gains or losses associated with the underlying exposures and
underlying transactions. The amounts ultimately realized upon
settlement of these financial instruments, together with the
gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on
actual market conditions during the remaining life of the
instruments.

NOTE 7. CREDIT FACILITIES

On September 27, 2002, Cadence entered into
two syndicated, senior unsecured credit facilities, or the 2002
Facilities, that allow Cadence to borrow up to
$375.0 million. One of the 2002 Facilities is a
$187.5 million three-year revolving credit facility, or the
Three-Year Facility, which terminates on September 27,
2005. The other 2002 Facility consists of a $187.5 million,
364-day revolving credit facility convertible into a term loan,
or the 364-Day Facility. The 364-Day Facility will terminate on
September 26, 2003; provided, that at the request of
Cadence and with the consent of members of the bank group that
wish to do so, the date of termination may be extended for one
additional 364-day period with respect to the portion of the
amounts outstanding under the 364-Day Credit Agreement that a
consenting bank holds. Upon the scheduled and/or extended
termination, amounts outstanding under the 364-Day Facility may
be converted to a one-year term loan.

For both of the 2002 Facilities, Cadence has the
option to pay interest based on LIBOR plus a spread of between
1.25% and 1.50%, based on a pricing grid tied to a financial
covenant, or the higher of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50% or
the prime rate. In addition, commitment fees are payable on the
unused portion of the Three-Year Facility at rates between 0.25%
and 0.335% based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant
and on the unused portion of the 364-Day Facility at a fixed
rate of 0.225%. A utilization fee of 0.25% is payable on amounts
borrowed under the 2002 Facilities whenever combined borrowings
under the 2002 Facilities exceed $123.8 million. Cadence
may not borrow under the 364-Day Facility at any time that any
portion of the Three-Year Facility remains unused.

The 2002 Facilities contain certain financial and
other covenants, which must be maintained. The financial
covenants specify that Cadence must maintain a minimum Earnings
Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization, or EBITDA,
of not less than $200.0 million. Additionally, Cadence must
maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (the ratio of
EBITDA to the sum of (i) interest expense plus
(ii) 20% of funded debt plus (iii) taxes paid in cash
plus (iv) capital lease payments) of not less than 1.5 to
1.0. Other covenants require Cadence to maintain a minimum
one-to-one ratio of current assets to current liabilities and a
maximum two-to-one funded debt to EBITDA ratio, and to directly
own not less than 51% of its consolidated total assets. From
time to time, Cadence borrows amounts under the 2002 Facilities.
At December 28, 2002, Cadence was in compliance with the
covenants in the 2002 Facilities and had outstanding borrowings
of $52.0 million under the Three-Year Facility.

The 2002 Facilities replaced two previously
existing credit facilities, which terminated on
September 27, 2002. In connection with the termination of
the previously existing credit facilities, Cadence paid in full
all interest, principal, fees, and other amounts owing
thereunder.

NOTE 8. LEASE COMMITMENTS

Equipment and facilities are leased under various
capital and operating leases expiring at various dates through
the year 2025. Certain of these leases contain renewal options.
Rental expense was $23.3 million for 2002, $25.6 million
for 2001 and $22.2 million for 2000.

At December 28, 2002, future minimum lease
payments under capital and operating leases and the present
value of the capital lease payments were as follows:

The cost of equipment under capital leases
included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as property, plant
and equipment at December 28, 2002 and December 29,
2001 was approximately $6.3 million and $6.0 million,
respectively. Accumulated amortization of the leased equipment
at December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001 was
approximately $4.7 million and $3.2 million,
respectively.

NOTE 9. CONTINGENCIES

Legal Proceedings

From time to time, Cadence is involved in various
disputes and litigation matters that arise in the ordinary
course of business. These include disputes and lawsuits related
to intellectual property, mergers and acquisitions, licensing,
contract law, distribution arrangements and employee relations
matters. Periodically, Cadence reviews the status of each
significant matter and assesses its potential financial
exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal
proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be
estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Legal
proceedings are subject to uncertainties, and the outcomes are
difficult to predict. Because of such uncertainties, accruals
are based only on the best information available at the time. As
additional information becomes available, we reassess the
potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation
and may revise our estimates.

On January 7, 1999, in a suit captioned
Mentor Graphics Corporation, et al. v. Lobo, et al., Delaware
Chancery Court, New Castle County, Civ. Action No. 16843-NC
(“Mentor II”), Mentor filed and served an amended
complaint asserting claims against Cadence, Quickturn and the
Quickturn Board of Directors for declaratory and injunctive
relief for various alleged breaches of fiduciary duty
purportedly owed by Quickturn and its Board of Directors to
Quickturn’s shareholders in connection with the merger
between Quickturn and Cadence. Mentor further alleged that
Cadence aided and abetted Quickturn and its Board of Directors
in those purported breaches. Mentor acknowledged that the suit
became moot upon consummation of the Cadence acquisition of
Quickturn, and on February 13, 2002, the Court dismissed
the case on that basis. However, Mentor sought an award of
attorney’s fees in the case, as well as in a prior related
case in which

Cadence was not a party. In May 2000, Mentor
advised the Delaware Chancery Court of its objection to the
settlement of a companion action brought on behalf of certain
Quickturn shareholders, a settlement which is conditioned upon
approval of the settlement by the Chancery Court and upon
Mentor’s not being awarded attorneys’ fees in either
Mentor II or the related case. In an order dated August 17,
2001, the Chancery Court denied Mentor’s fee application.
Mentor filed a notice of appeal with the Delaware Supreme Court
of the denial of the fee application. On July 25, 2002, the
Chancery Court approved the settlement of the companion action.
Mentor filed a notice of appeal from that order. The appeals
were subsequently consolidated, and the Delaware Supreme Court
heard argument on March 4, 2003. Cadence is vigorously
defending this matter, but the ultimate outcome is currently
unknown. Management believes that the ultimate resolution of
this litigation will not have a material adverse effect on
Cadence’s business, operating results or financial
condition.

On July 21, 1999, Mentor filed suit against
Quickturn in the U.S. District Court for the District of
Delaware, alleging that Quickturn’s Mercury

TM

hardware emulation system infringed U.S. Patent Nos. 5,777,489
and 5,790,832, allegedly assigned to Mentor. Upon motion of
Quickturn, the action was transferred to the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of California, Civil Action No. C
00-5464 SI. At Quickturn’s request, Cadence was added as a
defendant. In response, Cadence and Quickturn filed
counterclaims for declaratory judgment of non-infringement and
invalidity of these patents. After filing the suit, Mentor
additionally alleged that Quickturn’s Mercury
Plus

TM

product infringed these patents. Mentor
subsequently filed Civil Action No. C 02-1426 SI,
realleging that Quickturn’s Mercury

TM

hardware
emulation systems infringed U.S. Patent No. 5,777,489. This
action was consolidated with Civil Action No. C 99-5464 SI.
Cadence intends to vigorously defend this matter, but the
ultimate outcome is currently unknown. Management believes that
the ultimate resolution of this litigation will not have a
material adverse effect on Cadence’s business, operating
results or financial condition.

On March 24, 2000, Mentor and Meta and
several founders of Meta filed suit against Quickturn and
Cadence and a former Quickturn employee in the U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of California, Civil Action
No. C-00-01030 SI. The suit alleged infringement of
U.S. Patent No. 5,754,827 allegedly assigned to
Mentor, misappropriation of trade secrets, common law
misappropriation and breach of confidence, and sought
unspecified damages, injunctive relief and the assignment to
Mentor of a patent previously issued to Quickturn
(U.S. Patent No. 5,943,490). Quickturn and Cadence
filed counterclaims for declaratory judgment of
non-infringement, unenforceability and invalidity of
U.S. Patent No. 5,754,827. Quickturn and Cadence also
counterclaimed for declaratory judgment of non-infringement,
unenforceability and invalidity of two additional patents
allegedly assigned to Mentor, U.S. Patent
Nos. 5,999,725 and 6,057,706 which Mentor previously
threatened to assert against Quickturn. Mentor’s response
to Quickturn’s counterclaims affirmatively alleged
infringement of both of these patents. This action was
consolidated with the actions described in the preceding
paragraph. Cadence intends to vigorously defend this matter, but
the ultimate outcome is currently unknown. Management believes
that the ultimate resolution of this litigation will not have a
material adverse effect on Cadence’s business, operating
results or financial condition.

On September 11, 2000, Mentor filed a
complaint against Quickturn and Cadence in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
California, Civil Action No. C-00-03291 SI, accusing
Quickturn and Cadence of infringing U.S. Patent
No. 5,574,388, purportedly owned by Mentor, and seeking
unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Cadence and Quickturn
filed counterclaims for declaratory judgment of invalidity,
unenforceability and non-infringement of this patent. The
parties agreed to consolidate this action with Civil Action
Nos. C 99-5464 SI, C 00-01030 SI and
C 02-1426 SI, described above. Prior to trial, the Court
ruled that the claims of the U.S. Patent Nos. 5,777,489,
6,057,706 and 5,574,388 at issue were invalid and, accordingly,
dismissed from the case all allegations concerning those
patents. On January 24, 2003, the Court dismissed
Mentor’s breach of confidence claim with prejudice. Trial
on the remaining allegations in all four lawsuits (Civil Action
Nos. C 99-5464 SI, C 00-1030 SI, C-00-3291 SI and
C 02-1426-SI) began on January 6, 2003. On
February 19, 2003, the jury found in favor of Quickturn and
Cadence on all remaining

claims before them. Mentor has indicated that it
intends to appeal the jury’s verdict. Cadence intends to
vigorously defend this matter, but the ultimate outcome is
currently unknown. Management believes that the ultimate
resolution of this litigation will not have a material adverse
effect on Cadence’s business, operating results or
financial condition.

On November 2, 2000, Mentor and Meta filed a
complaint for declaratory judgment against Quickturn and Cadence
in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon (Case
No. C-00-1489) seeking a ruling that Mentor’s proposed
design verification approach (in which IC designers would
use U.S.-based computer terminals to operate SimExpress
emulation systems located overseas) will not infringe
Quickturn’s patents and will not violate the permanent
injunction entered by the Oregon District Court on July 7,
1999 in Civil Action No. C-96-00342. In January 2001,
Quickturn and Cadence filed a Motion to Dismiss the action,
based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On May 1,
2001, the Court provisionally granted Quickturn’s motion to
dismiss. Cadence and Quickturn believe that Mentor’s
complaint is without merit. Cadence intends to vigorously defend
this matter, but the ultimate outcome is currently unknown.
Management believes that the ultimate resolution of this
litigation will not have a material adverse effect on
Cadence’s business, operating results or financial
condition.

On July 29, 2002, IKOS Systems, Inc., a
subsidiary of Mentor, filed a complaint against Cadence and
Quickturn in the U.S. District Court, District of Delaware,
Civil Action No. 02-1335, accusing Quickturn’s
Palladium

TM

product of infringing IKOS’
U.S. Patent No. 5,847,578, and seeking unspecified
damages and injunctive relief. On October 22, 2002, upon
motion by Cadence and Quickturn, the court ordered the action to
be transferred to the U.S. District Court, Northern
District of California. Cadence believes the claim is without
merit and is vigorously defending this matter, but the ultimate
outcome is currently unknown. Management believes that the
ultimate resolution of this litigation will not have a material
adverse effect on Cadence’s business, operating results or
financial condition.

On December 30, 2002, Cadence filed a
complaint against IKOS and Mentor in the U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of California, Civil Action
No. C 02-5343 JF, alleging that IKOS’ products
infringe U.S. Patent No. 5,036,473 and seeking
unspecified damages and injunctive relief. On January 6,
2003, Quickturn filed a motion to amend its Answer and
Counterclaims in this suit to add a counterclaim alleging that
IKOS’ products infringe U.S. Patent
No. 5,036,473. On February 24, 2003, the Court granted
this motion and agreed to consolidate this action with Civil
Action No. 02-1335, described in the preceding paragraph.

While the outcome of the disputes and litigation
matters discussed above cannot be predicted with any certainty,
management does not believe that the outcome of these matters
will have a material adverse effect on Cadence’s
consolidated position or results of operations.

NOTE 10. STOCKHOLDERS’
EQUITY

Net Income per
Share

Basic net income per share is computed by
dividing net income (numerator) by the weighted average number
of shares of common stock outstanding (denominator) during
the period. Diluted net income per share gives effect to stock
options considered to be potential common shares, if dilutive,
computed using the treasury stock method.

The following table presents the calculation for
the number of shares used in the basic and diluted net income
per share computations for the fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000:

Options to purchase 34,724,386 shares of
common stock were outstanding at December 28, 2002, but
were not included in the computation of diluted net income per
share because their effect would be antidilutive. These options
expire at various dates through 2012. Put warrants to purchase
463,723 shares of common stock were not included in the
computation of diluted net income per share because their effect
would be antidilutive. The put warrants expired at various dates
through May 2002.

Options to purchase 10,134,014 shares of
common stock were outstanding at December 29, 2001, but
were not included in the computation of diluted net income per
share because their effect would be antidilutive. These options
expire at various dates through 2011. Put warrants to purchase
2,897,500 shares of common stock were outstanding at
December 29, 2001, but were not included in the computation
of diluted net income per share because their effect would be
antidilutive. The outstanding put warrants expired at various
dates through May 2002.

Options to purchase 2,660,253 shares of
common stock were outstanding at December 30, 2000, but
were not included in the computation of diluted net income per
share because their effect would be antidilutive. These options
expire at various dates through 2010. Put warrants to purchase
5,496,807 shares of common stock were outstanding at
December 30, 2000, but were not included in the computation
of diluted net income per share because their effect would be
antidilutive. The outstanding put warrants expired at various
dates through November 2001.

non-qualified options to its employees to purchase up to
30,000,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price not
less than the fair market value of the stock on the date of
grant. Options granted under the 1997 Plan become exercisable
over periods up to five years, with, generally, one-fifth of the
shares vesting one year from the vesting commencement date with
respect to initial grants, and the remaining shares vesting in
48 equal monthly installments. Options under the 1997 Plan
generally expire ten years from the date of grant.

Cadence’s 1987 Employee Stock Option Plan,
referred to as the 1987 Plan, provides for the issuance of
either incentive or non-qualified options to its employees to
purchase up to 71,370,100 shares of common stock at an

on the date of grant. Options granted under the 1993
Non-Statutory Plan become exercisable over a four year period,
with one-fourth of the shares vesting one year from the vesting
commencement date, and the remaining shares vesting in 36 equal
monthly installments. Options under the 1993 Non-Statutory Plan
generally expire ten years from the date of grant.

Under the 1995 and 1993 Directors’ Stock
Option Plans, referred to as the Directors’ Plans, Cadence
may grant non-qualified options to its non-employee directors
for up to 2,432,502 shares of common stock at an exercise
price not less than the fair market value of the stock on the
date of grant. Options granted under the Directors’ Plans
have terms of up to ten years. Certain of the option grants vest
one year from the date of grant, and other option grants vest
one-third on the date which is one year from the date of grant
and two-thirds ratably over the subsequent two years.

Cadence has assumed certain options granted to
employees of acquired companies, referred to as Acquired
Options. The Acquired Options were assumed by Cadence outside of
its stock option plans, and each option is administered as if
issued under the respective original plan of the acquired
entity. All of the Acquired Options have been adjusted to
effectuate the price conversion under the terms of the
acquisition agreement between Cadence and the relevant acquired
company. The Acquired Options generally become exercisable over
a four or five year period and generally expire between five and
ten years from the date of grant. No additional options will be
granted under any of the acquired companies’ plans.

A summary of the status of all of Cadence’s
stock option plans at December 28, 2002 follows:

Stock Repurchase Plan

On August 1, 2001, Cadence authorized a
share repurchase program under which repurchased shares with a
value of up to $500.0 million are used for general
corporate purposes, including the share issuance requirements of
Cadence’s employee stock option and purchase plans and
acquisitions. Under this program, Cadence spent
$69.1 million to repurchase 5.3 million shares during
the year ended December 28, 2002. As of December 28,
2002, the remaining repurchase authorization under this program
totaled $430.9 million.

Cadence had previously authorized three stock
repurchase programs under which it repurchased common stock to
satisfy estimated requirements for shares to be issued under its
employee stock option and purchase plans. During the year ended
December 28, 2002, Cadence repurchased 7.5 million
shares under these programs at a total cost of
$116.1 million. As of December 28, 2002, there was no
remaining repurchase authorization under these three programs.



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)

December 28, 2002

As part of its authorized stock repurchase
program, Cadence previously sold put warrants and purchased call
options through private placements to manage equity price risk
and dilution. On December 28, 2002, there were no put
warrants or call options outstanding.

Employee Stock Purchase Plans

On July 1, 2001, Cadence adopted two
employee stock purchase plans to allow Tality employees to
participate in Cadence’s employee stock purchase program.
The two plans are the 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan which is
a qualified employee stock purchase plan under the Internal
Revenue Code, and the 2001 Non-Qualified Employee Stock Purchase
Plan, which is an employee stock purchase plan not qualified
under the Internal Revenue Code and will be primarily used for
Tality employees located outside the United States. Other than
the qualified nature of the 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan,
the provisions of the two plans are generally the same. Under
the 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and 2001 Non-Qualified
Employee Stock Purchase Plan, Cadence is authorized to issue up
to 1,750,000 and 750,000 shares of common stock,
respectively, to its employees. The plans are administered by
Cadence’s board of directors or by a committee appointed by
the board. Tality, now Cadence Design Foundry, employees,
including officers and employee directors of Tality, but
excluding 5% or greater stockholders, are eligible to
participate if they are regular employees who work 20 hours
or more per week.

In November 1998, the Board of Directors adopted,
and the stockholders subsequently approved, Cadence’s
Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan, referred to
as the Employee Plan. Subsequent amendments approved by the
Board of Directors and stockholders increased the number of
shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the
Employee Plan to 23,500,000 shares. On October 30,
2002, the Board approved amendments to the Employee Plan to
increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for
issuance under the Employee Plan by 6,000,000 shares for a
total of 29,500,000 shares and to enable Cadence to effect
the reorganization of its Cadence Design Foundry Business.

Under the terms of the Employee Plan, employees
can choose to have up to 12% of their annual base earnings plus
bonuses withheld to purchase Cadence common stock. The purchase
price of the stock is 85% of the lesser of the fair market value
as of the beginning or the end of the offering periods. The
offering periods provide for concurrent 24 month offering
periods with a new 24 month offering period starting every
six months. Each offering period will be divided into four
consecutive six-month purchase periods.

Under Cadence’s employee stock purchase
plans, Cadence issued 2,548,500 shares to employees in
2002, 3,025,646 shares in 2001 and 3,168,839 shares in
2000. The weighted average purchase price of shares issued in
2002, 2001 and 2000 were $13.68, $10.64 and $9.36, respectively.
The weighted average fair value of shares issued in 2002, 2001
and 2000 were $16.57, $25.95 and $20.75, respectively.

Pro Forma Information

The pro forma information included in Note 2

assumptions assuming a dividend yield of zero for all periods:

Warrants

In connection with the purchase of the business
and certain assets of Comdisco Systems, Inc., a subsidiary of
Comdisco, Inc., in 1993, Cadence issued a warrant to purchase
shares of Cadence’s stock at $3.23 per share. The warrant
for the remaining 140,000 shares expires in June 2003 and
can be exercised at any time in increments of not less than
50,000 shares.

Reserved for Future Issuance

At December 28, 2002, Cadence had reserved
the following shares of authorized but unissued common stock for
future issuance:

Stockholder Rights Plan

Cadence has a stockholder rights plan to protect
its stockholders’ rights in the event of a proposed or
actual acquisition of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of
Cadence common stock. As amended in February 2000, each share of
Cadence common stock carries a right to purchase one
one-thousandth (1/1000) of a share of Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Cadence at a price of $240.00 per one one-thousandth of a share,
subject to adjustment. The rights are subject to redemption at
the option of the Board of Directors at a price of $0.01 per
right until the occurrence of certain events. The rights expire
on February 20, 2006.

Deferred Stock Compensation

Cadence recorded deferred stock compensation
resulting from stock options granted, which were subsequently
retired, to purchase Tality stock and sales of Tality restricted
stock in 2001 and 2000. Deferred stock compensation from Tality
option grants and restricted stock sales represents the
difference between the exercise price of stock option grants to
Tality employees and directors, and the price paid for
restricted stock by certain Cadence executives and employees,
and the deemed fair value of Tality’s common stock at the
time of those grants and sales.

In addition, Cadence recorded deferred stock
compensation resulting from Cadence’s acquisition of
CadMOS, Simplex, SPC and Plato Design Systems Incorporated.
Deferred stock compensation resulting from these acquisitions
represents the difference between the exercise price of unvested
stock option grants to employees of the acquired companies and
the fair value of Cadence’s common stock at the time of
such acquisitions.

Deferred compensation expense of
$9.7 million related to the SPC acquisition was recorded in
2002 because a portion of the additional shares require
continued employment with Cadence of certain SPC employees. The
acquisition agreement provides for the issuance of additional
shares of Cadence’s common stock as certain performance
goals are achieved in fiscal 2002 and 2003. Deferred
compensation was recorded because one of the performance goals
requires continued employment with Cadence of certain employees.

For the years ended December 28, 2002 and
December 29, 2001, Cadence recorded a total of
$37.7 million and $40.4 million of deferred stock
compensation, respectively. Of the $37.7 million,
$19.5 million is related to SPC’s achievement of
certain predetermined goals, $9.9 million is related to the
acquisition of Plato and $8.3 million is related to the
acquisition of Simplex. Of the $40.4 million,
$27.4 million is related to the acquisition of SPC,
$10.0 million is related to the acquisition of CadMOS, and
$3.0 million is related to Tality stock option grants.
Cadence is amortizing deferred stock compensation to expense
using the straight-line method over the period that the stock
options and restricted stock vest. For the year ended
December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001, Cadence
reversed deferred stock compensation of $10.9 million and
$27.8 million, respectively, related to the cancellation of
options for terminated employees. For the year ended
December 28, 2002, December 29, 2001 and
December 28, 2000 Cadence recorded deferred compensation
expense of $37.5 million, $17.9 million and
$11.4 million, respectively.

NOTE 11. INCOME TAXES

The provision for income taxes consisted of the
following components:

December 28, 2002

Income before provision for income taxes included
income from Cadence’s foreign subsidiaries of approximately
$106.3 million for 2002, $139.2 million for 2001 and
$43.2 million for 2000.

The provision for income taxes differs from the
amount estimated by applying the statutory federal income tax
rate to income before provision for income taxes as follows:

The components of deferred tax assets and
liabilities consisted of the following:



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)

December 28, 2002

Cadence provides for U.S. income taxes on the
earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the earnings are
considered permanently invested outside of the United States. At
December 28, 2002, the cumulative amount of earnings upon
which U.S. income taxes have not been provided are approximately
$550 million. At December 28, 2002, the unrecognized
deferred tax liability for these earnings was approximately
$114 million.

The total valuation allowance decreased by
$42.4 million in 2002. The valuation allowance for
provision for income taxes decreased by $9.2 million
primarily due to the cancellation or exercise of stock options
originally issued in conjunction with the Tality separation. The
valuation allowance for equity and intangibles decreased by
$33.2 million in 2002 due to Cadence generating sufficient
taxable income including the deduction of stock option
deductions to utilize certain net operating losses and research
and development tax credits. The valuation allowance for equity
and intangibles is due to the uncertainty of domestic entities
generating sufficient taxable income, including the deduction
for stock options to realize certain domestic deferred tax
assets. This portion of the valuation allowance, identified in
the above table as “valuation allowance — equity
and intangibles”, if realizable, may reduce other
intangibles or increase equity and may not be available to
offset future provision for income taxes.

Cadence has net operating loss carryforwards
totaling $8.7 million for 2002, $49.6 million for 2001
and $28.9 million for 2000, and tax credit carryforwards of
$7.4 million for 2002 and $39.5 million for 2001. The
remaining net operating loss carryforwards will expire at
various dates from 2002 through 2021 and tax credit
carryforwards will expire at various dates from 2002 through
2017.

Income tax returns filed by Cadence are currently
under examination by the Internal Revenue Service as well as
certain state and foreign governments. Cadence regularly
assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these
examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for
income taxes.

NOTE 12. EMPLOYEE AND DIRECTOR BENEFIT
PLANS

Cadence maintains a 401(k) savings plan to
provide retirement benefits through tax deferred salary
deductions for all of its U.S. employees. Cadence may make
discretionary contributions, as determined by the Board of
Directors, which cannot exceed a specified percentage of the
annual aggregate salaries of those employees eligible to
participate. Cadence made total contributions to the plan of
$10.4 million for 2002, $10.5 million for 2001 and
$9.3 million for 2000.

As part of its overall investment strategy,
Cadence invests in Telos. Cadence and the Cadence 1996 Deferred
Compensation Venture Investment Plan, or the 1996 Plan, are the
sole limited partners of Telos. As of December 28, 2002,
Cadence has committed $77.3 million to Telos and is
contractually committed to contribute up to an additional
$53.7 million. Cadence’s investments in Telos are
recorded in Other assets in the accompanying Consolidated
Balance Sheets. Under the 1996 Plan, Cadence directors can defer
some or all of their compensation, and certain executives can
defer payment of a portion of their compensation to be invested
in Telos.

SETTLEMENT

Avant! Civil Settlement

On November 13, 2002, Cadence announced the
settlement of civil litigation filed against Avant! seeking
damages related to theft of Cadence intellectual property,
including software code, as well as other trade secrets. The
settlement with Avant!, its parent corporation Synopsys, Inc.
and several individuals included an agreement to dismiss all
pending claims and counterclaims in the litigation and required
the payment to Cadence of $265.0 million, which was
received in the fourth quarter of 2002.

Avant! Criminal Restitution

On July 25, 2001, Avant! was ordered to pay
Cadence $195.4 million in criminal restitution after Avant!
entered a plea of no contest and was found guilty by the
Superior Court of the State of California of conspiracy to take
and use Cadence’s trade secrets. This conspiracy included
the theft by Avant! and certain individuals of Cadence
intellectual property, including software code, as well as other
trade secrets. As of December 29, 2001, approximately
$196.0 million, consisting of all of the restitution award
plus interest was received.

NOTE 15. RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER
CHARGES

In 2001, Cadence announced a plan of
restructuring activities throughout the company targeted at
eliminating redundancies and consolidating facilities and
resources. The restructuring activities were initiated primarily
due to the severe economic downturn in the electronics industry.
The restructuring was primarily aimed at reducing excess
personnel and capacity costs within Cadence’s Design
Foundry business (formerly Tality) and certain other
business/infrastructure groups. Cadence accounts for its
restructuring charges and accruals in accordance with SEC Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 100 and EITF No. 94-3.

For the year ended December 29, 2001,
Cadence recorded $61.6 million of restructuring and other
charges. Cadence’s restructuring costs and other charges
consisted of $21.6 million for workforce reduction,



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 28, 2002

$21.9 million to downsize and close excess
facilities and $18.1 million of asset-related charges
related to certain long-lived assets that were abandoned.

For the year ended December 28, 2002,
Cadence recorded $134.3 million of restructuring and other
charges. Cadence’s restructuring costs and other charges
consisted of $52.2 million for workforce reduction,
$46.9 million in changes in estimates for previously
recorded accruals and to downsize and close excess facilities,
and $35.2 million of asset-related charges related to
certain long-lived assets that were abandoned.

The 2001 restructuring activities resulted in a
reduction of 705 employees, which were predominately Tality
employees. Severance costs resulting from the restructuring
included severance benefits, notice pay and out-placement
services. As the result of the separation of Tality from
Cadence, approximately $5.3 million of the restructuring
charges was paid to certain Tality employees who were
participants in Cadence’s employee stock purchase plan
prior to Tality’s separation from Cadence in October 2000.
All terminations and termination benefits were communicated to
the affected employees prior to December 29, 2001.

The 2002 restructuring activities will result in
the termination of employment of approximately 1,370 employees.
Costs resulting from the restructuring included severance
benefits, notice pay and outplacement services. All terminations
and termination benefits were communicated to the affected
employees prior to December 28, 2002.

For the year ended December 29, 2001,
facilities consolidation charges of $21.9 million were
incurred in connection with the downsizing and closing of 16
sites. As of December 29, 2001, six sites had been vacated
and eight sites had been downsized.

For the year ended December 28, 2002,
facilities consolidation charges of $46.9 million were
incurred in connection with the further downsizing of four
previously downsized sites, the downsizing and closing of 16
additional sites, and changes in lease loss estimates for three
sites. Of the $46.9 million, $17.3 million related to
changes in lease loss estimates. The low end of the lease loss
range related to all worldwide restructuring activities
initiated in 2001 is $25.6 million, which will be adjusted
in the future upon triggering events, such as changes in
estimates of time to sublease and actual sublease rates. Cadence
has estimated that the high end of the lease loss could be as
much as $55.0 million if facilities operating lease rental
rates continue to decrease in applicable markets or if it takes
longer than expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease the
facilities.

Closure and downsizing costs included payments
required under lease contracts, less any applicable estimated
sublease income after the properties were abandoned, lease
buyout costs, restoration costs associated with certain lease
arrangements and costs to maintain facilities during the period
after abandonment. To determine the lease loss, which is the
loss after Cadence’s cost recovery efforts from subleasing
a building, certain assumptions were made related to the:
(1) time period over which the relevant building would
remain vacant, (2) sublease terms, and (3) sublease
rates, including common area charges. The lease loss is an
estimate and represents the low end of the range.

For the year ended December 29, 2001,
Cadence incurred asset-related and other restructuring charges
of $18.1 million, consisting primarily of
$14.4 million of leasehold improvements for facilities and
other fixed assets that were either abandoned or for which the
resulting estimated future reduced cash flows were insufficient
to cover the associated expenses. Cadence also recorded
$2.2 million of asset-related charges for abandoned
software.

For the year ended December 28, 2002,
asset-related and other restructuring charges of
$35.2 million were incurred in connection with leasehold
improvements for facilities, other fixed assets and software
license agreements that were abandoned and contract termination
costs.

Liabilities for excess facilities and other
restructuring charges are included in accrued and other
long-term liabilities, while severance and benefits liabilities
are included in payroll and payroll-related accruals. The
following table summarizes Cadence’s restructuring activity
during fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000:

NOTE 16. WRITE-OFF OF ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS
TECHNOLOGY

Described below are the write-offs of acquired
in-process technology charges in 2002 and 2001. There were no
write-offs of acquired in-process technology in 2000.

During 2001, Cadence acquired substantially all
of the assets of two companies for an initial aggregate price of
$10.5 million, of which $4.4 million was cash and
$6.1 million was shares of Cadence common stock. The
acquisitions were accounted for as purchases. Upon consummation
of the acquisitions, Cadence charged to expense, immediately
after the respective acquisition, an aggregate of
$1.0 million representing acquired in-process technology
that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no
alternative future use.

Acquired in-process technology charges represent
in-process technology that had not reached technological
feasibility and had no probable alternative future use. See
Note 4.

NOTE 17. IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 142,
discussed in Note 2, Cadence evaluated goodwill for
impairment whenever events or circumstances indicated that the
carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. During 2001,
Cadence recorded a charge of $25.8 million in 2001 related
to the impairment of goodwill and acquired intangibles
associated with the acquisition of Diablo Research Company LLC,
or Diablo. This impairment was due to the decline in business
conditions generally and the wireless communications industry in
particular. Cadence restructured certain of its businesses and
realigned resources to focus on profit contribution, high-growth
markets and core opportunities. Key factors in determining this
impairment were significant downsizing or reassignment of
personnel directly related to these assets and abandonment of
most of Diablo’s line of business. The impairment was
calculated as the difference between the carrying value of the
intangible assets associated with Diablo’s acquisition and
the fair value of those assets.

NOTE 18. OTHER INCOME (LOSS),
NET

Other income (loss), net components for 2002,
2001 and 2000 are as follows:

Other income (loss), net, for the year ended
December 28, 2002 includes $10.0 million of investment
write-downs from Telos, in which Cadence holds a limited
partnership interest, included in other expense, net, and
$9.4 million of investment write-downs in Cadence’s
long-term investments, included in other expense, net.

NOTE 19. SEGMENT REPORTING

Cadence’s chief operating decision maker is
its President and Chief Executive Officer, or CEO.
Cadence’s CEO reviews Cadence’s consolidated results
within three segments: Product, Services and Maintenance.

The Product segment includes revenue and
associated costs to design and license to customers a variety of
EDA products. The Services segment includes revenue and
associated costs to offer methodology and design services either
to assist companies in developing electronic designs or to
assume responsibility for the design effort when customers wish
to outsource this work. The Maintenance segment includes revenue
and associated costs primarily for a technical support
organization, and maintenance agreements are offered to
customers either as part of Cadence’s product license
agreements or separately.

Segment income from operations is defined as
gross margin under generally accepted accounting principles and
excludes Amortization of acquired intangibles, operating
expenses (Marketing and sales, Research and development and
General and administrative), Amortization of deferred stock
compensation, Avant! restitution and settlement, Restructuring
and other charges, Write-off of acquired in-process technology,
Impairment of goodwill, Interest expense and Other income
(loss), net and Provision for income taxes. Profitability
information about Cadence’s segments is available only to
the extent of gross margin by segment, and operating expenses
and other income and expense items are managed on a functional
basis. There are no

differences between the accounting policies used
to measure profit and loss for segments and those used on a
consolidated basis. Revenue is defined as revenue from external
customers with no inter-segment revenue.

Cadence does not identify or allocate its assets,
including capital expenditures, by operating segment.
Accordingly, assets are not being reported by segment because
the information is not available by segment and is not reviewed
by Cadence’s Executive Staff to make decisions about
resources to be allocated among the segments or to assess their
performance. Depreciation and amortization of purchased software
is allocated among the segments to determine each segment’s
gross margin.

The following tables present information about
reported segments for the years ended December 28, 2002,
December 29, 2001 and December 30, 2000:

Internationally, excluding Japan, Cadence markets
and supports its products and services primarily through its
subsidiaries and various distributors. Cadence licenses its
software products in Japan through Innotech Corporation, in
which Cadence is an approximately 15% stockholder.

Revenue is attributed to geography based on the
country in which the customer is domiciled. In 2002, 2001 and
2000, no one customer accounted for more than 10% of total
revenue. Long-lived assets are attributed to geography based on
the country where the assets are located.

by geography for years ended December 28, 2002,
