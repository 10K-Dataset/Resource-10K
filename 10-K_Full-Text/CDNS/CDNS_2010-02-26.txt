Factors
    Driving the Electronic Design Automation Industry

During 2008 and 2009, the semiconductor industry’s growth
    declined as the overall macroeconomic environment deteriorated.
    Electronics companies faced financial challenges in 2008 and
    2009 because consumer spending on electronics was adversely
    affected by increased unemployment, and corporate spending was
    restrained by the tightened credit market and the economic
    downturn. During 2009, semiconductor unit volumes decreased and
    average selling prices declined. These factors, combined with
    the macroeconomic environment, affect how electronics companies
    address traditional challenges of cost, quality, innovation and

time-to-market

associated with highly complex electronics systems and IC
    product development.



Although estimates project moderate growth for the semiconductor
    industry in 2010, we believe that increased spending on EDA and
    other tools may grow more slowly than the semiconductor industry
    as a whole in 2010.

Electronics companies demand ever higher levels of productivity
    from their design teams, better predictability in their
    development schedules and higher quality products in order to be
    competitive and profitable in the price-conscious markets they
    serve. Electronics companies are responding to demand for
    increased functionality and miniaturization by combining
    subsystems — such as radio frequency, or RF, wireless
    communication, video signal processing and microprocessors
    — onto a single silicon chip, creating a

system-on-chip,

or SoC, or multiple chips into a single chip package in a format
    referred to as

system-in-package,

or SiP. These trends toward subsystem integration have required
    chip makers to find solutions to challenges previously addressed
    by system companies, such as verifying system-level
    functionality and hardware-software interoperability.

SoC designs put many more transistors on each chip, increasing
    the need for tight control over power consumption. This is done
    not only to increase battery life in portable devices, but also
    to minimize energy cost for computing and networking equipment.
    Higher power devices generate more heat, which further increases
    both system cost as well as operating expenses for cooling.
    Evolving semiconductor manufacturing processes with smaller
    features (transistors and wires) and lower supply voltages
    address both of these issues to some degree, but introduce new
    challenges of their own. Contemporary portable electronic
    devices contain chips in which individual features can be as
    small as 45 nanometers, or 45/1,000,000ths of a millimeter.
    Because of the electrical characteristics of the materials used
    to construct the transistors, which are essentially microscopic
    switches, chips continue to consume power even when transistors
    in the device are switched off. To overcome these and other
    power-related issues, specific “low power” design
    techniques must be developed and are most effective if they are
    integrated throughout the design flow, from logic design and
    verification through physical implementation.

Variability in the processes and materials used to manufacture
    silicon chips have become so pervasive at 65 nanometers and
    below that traditional connections between design and
    manufacturing teams are insufficient to ensure chip performance
    and yield. Integrating detailed models of the manufacturing
    process into the chip design environment is desirable so
    engineers can craft a design to avoid or overcome these
    manufacturing process variations. Similarly, manufacturing teams
    can optimize their processes if, along with the design, they are
    provided with information about the most critical parts of the
    chip. However, sharing information between design and
    manufacturing processes is complicated because current data
    formats used to describe the chip design differ from data
    formats used to describe the manufacturing process and control
    the manufacturing equipment. Moreover, design and manufacturing
    most often involve two or more separate companies, because
    multiple companies may participate in the design of the chip and
    in the manufacturing and assembly of the final device.

These trends represent significant new challenges for
    electronics design processes. Specifically, product performance
    and size requirements of the mobile consumer electronics market
    require microelectronic systems to be smaller, consume less
    power and provide multiple functions all in one SoC or SiP. This
    requires designers to pay close attention to many electrical,
    physical and manufacturing effects that were inconsequential in
    previous generations of chip designs. The design challenge
    becomes more complex with each new generation of electronics and
    providers of EDA solutions must deliver products that address
    these technical challenges while improving the productivity,
    predictability, reliability and profitability of the design
    process.

Products
    and Product Strategy

Our products are engineered to improve our customers’
    design productivity and design quality by providing a
    comprehensive set of EDA tools. Product revenues include all
    fees earned from granting licenses to use our software and from
    sales and leases of our hardware products, and exclude revenues
    derived from maintenance and services. We offer customers three
    license types for our software: perpetual, term and
    subscription. See “Software Licensing Arrangements”
    for additional discussion of our license types.

We combine our products and technologies into
    “platforms” for four major design activities:

•

Functional Verification;

•

Digital IC Design and Implementation;

•

Custom IC Design and Verification; and

•

System Interconnect Design.

    Cadence

®

design platforms are branded as
    Incisive

®

functional verification,
    Encounter

®

digital IC design,
    Virtuoso

®

custom design and
    Allegro

®

system interconnect design. In addition, we augment these
    platform product offerings with a set of design for
    manufacturing, or DFM, products that service both the digital
    and custom IC design flows. We updated all of our foundation
    technologies between December 2008 and December 2009.

The products and technologies that comprise our platforms are
    combined with services, ready-to-use packages of technologies
    assembled from our broad portfolio and other associated
    components that provide comprehensive solutions for low power,
    mixed signal, enterprise verification and advanced node designs.
    These solutions and their constituent elements are marketed to
    users who specialize in areas such as system design and
    verification, functional verification, logic design, digital
    implementation, custom IC design and printed circuit board, or
    PCB, and IC package / SiP design.

Our Product revenue was $400.8 million, or 47% of our total
    revenue, during fiscal 2009, $516.6 million, or 50% of our
    total revenue, during fiscal 2008, and $1,104.0 million, or
    68% of our total revenue, during fiscal 2007. For additional
    description of our Product revenue, including the current year

Design
    for Manufacturing

With the advent of silicon manufacturing technologies at
    geometries of 65 nanometer and below, our customers are
    increasingly concerned about manufacturability of their designs.
    The physical layout of each IC requires detailed analysis and
    optimization to ensure that the design can be manufactured in
    volume while performing as expected. Our strategy is to
    integrate DFM awareness into our core design platforms of
    Encounter Digital IC and Virtuoso Custom IC. Some of our DFM
    capabilities include:

•

Parasitic extraction products that take a physical
    representation of a design and determine the electrical
    properties to enable additional simulation and timing analysis;

•

On-chip power distribution for digital, analog and SoC designs;

•

Manufacturing design rule checks to ensure the proposed design
    meets foundry process requirements; and

•

Analytical and design tools for physical and electrical effects,
    process proximity correction, and yield / failure
    analysis diagnostics.

Our primary focus in DFM is to address manufacturing effects as
    early in the product development process as possible. As a
    result, we are enhancing the DFM awareness of our core Encounter
    Digital IC and Virtuoso Custom IC product offerings. Where
    upstream integration is not possible, we offer certain
    stand-alone DFM products.

Third
    Party Programs and Initiatives

In addition to our products, many customers use
    internally-developed design tools or design tools provided by
    other EDA companies, as well as IP available from multiple
    suppliers. We support the use of third-party design products and
    IP through vehicles such as our
    Connections

®

program and through our participation in the OpenAccess
    Coalition, the Power Forward Initiative and other programs and
    initiatives. We also contribute to the development and
    deployment of EDA industry standards.

    and education services. These services may be sold separately or
    sold and performed in conjunction with the sale, lease or
    license of our products.

Our Services revenue was $106.5 million, or 13% of our
    total revenue, during fiscal 2009, $133.5 million, or 13%
    of our total revenue, during fiscal 2008, and
    $125.8 million, or 8% of our total revenue, during fiscal
    2007. For additional description of our Services revenue, see
    the discussion under the heading “Results of
    Operations” under Item 7, “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.”

Engineering
    Services

We offer engineering services to aid our customers with the
    design of complex ICs and the implementation of key design
    capabilities, including low power, IC packaging and board
    design, mixed-signal design, functional verification, digital
    implementation, analog/mixed-signal and system-level. The
    customers for these services primarily consist of semiconductor
    and systems companies developing products for the consumer,
    communications, military and aerospace and computing markets.
    These ICs range from digital SoCs, analog and RF designs to
    complex mixed-signal ICs.

We offer engineering capabilities to assist customers from
    product concept to volume manufacturing. We leverage our
    experience and knowledge of design techniques, our products,
    leading practices and different design environments to improve
    the productivity of our own and our customers’ engineering
    teams. Depending on the customers’ projects and needs, we
    work with customers using outsourcing, consultative and
    collaborative offerings. Our Virtual Computer-Aided Design
    offering enables our engineering teams at one or more of our
    locations to collaborate with our customers’ teams located
    elsewhere in the world during the course of their design and
    engineering projects through a secure network infrastructure. We
    also make our design IP portfolio available to customers as part
    of our technology and services solutions. These reusable design
    and methodology components enable us to efficiently deliver our
    services and allow our customers to reduce the design complexity
    and time to market when developing complex SoCs.

Through collaboration with our customers, we are able to design
    advanced ICs and gain direct and early visibility to industry
    design issues that may not be addressed adequately by
    today’s EDA technologies. This enables us to target and
    accelerate the development of new software technology and
    products to satisfy current and future design requirements.

Education
    Services

Our education services offerings can be customized and include
    training programs that are conducted via the internet or in a
    classroom setting. The content of these offerings ranges from
    the latest IC design techniques to methodologies for using the
    most recent features of our EDA products. The primary focus of
    education services is to accelerate our customers’ path to
    productivity in the use of our products.



Marketing
    and Sales

We generally market our products and provide maintenance and
    services to existing and prospective customers through a direct
    sales force consisting of sales people and applications
    engineers. Applications engineers provide technical pre-sales
    and post-sales support for software products. Due to the
    complexity of many of our EDA products and the electronic design
    process, the sales cycle is generally long, requiring three to
    six months or more. During the sales cycle, our direct sales
    force generally provides technical presentations, product
    demonstrations and support for

on-site

customer evaluation of our solutions. We also use traditional
    marketing approaches to promote our products and services,
    including advertising, direct mail, trade shows, public
    relations and the internet. We selectively utilize value added
    resellers to broaden our reach and reduce cost of sales. All
    OrCAD and selected Incisive products are primarily marketed
    through these channels. With respect to international sales, we
    generally market and support our products and services through
    our subsidiaries. We also use a third-party distributor to sell
    our products and services to certain customers in Japan.

Software
    Licensing Arrangements

We sell software using three license types: subscription, term
    and perpetual. Customers who prefer to license technology for a
    specified, limited period of time will choose either a
    subscription or term license, and customers who prefer to have
    the right to use the technology continuously without time
    restriction will choose a perpetual license. Customers who
    desire to use new technology during the life of the contract
    will select a subscription license, which allows them limited
    access to unspecified new technology on a

when-and-if-available

basis, as opposed to a term or perpetual license, which does not
    include rights to use new technology. Payment terms for
    subscription and term licenses generally provide for payments to
    be made in installments over the license period and payment
    terms for perpetual licenses generally are net 30 days.

We offer a delivery mechanism for term and subscription licenses
    called eDA Cards. eDA cards have an overall “face”
    value amount that customers draw down against as they select
    specific products that are priced based on the particular
    duration of use the customer desires. The selection and
    licensing of the specific products is accomplished through an
    automated on-line system. The card expires when all of the face
    value is consumed, or on the pre-determined expiration date,
    whichever comes first. There are two types of eDA Cards. An eDA
    Gold Card is a term license that enables a customer to access a
    predetermined list of existing products. An eDA Platinum Card is
    a subscription license that enables a customer to access
    existing and new technology.

For a further description of our license agreements, revenue
    recognition policies and results of operations, please refer to
    the discussion under the heading “Critical Accounting
    Estimates” under Item 7, “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.”

Backlog

Our backlog as of January 2, 2010 was approximately
    $1.6 billion, as compared to approximately
    $1.8 billion as of January 3, 2009. Backlog consists
    of revenue to be recognized in fiscal periods after
    January 2, 2010 from a variety of license types, which
    generally include, but are not limited to:

•

Subscription licenses for software products;

•

Sale or lease of hardware;

•

Maintenance contracts on hardware and software products;

•

Orders for hardware and software products sold on perpetual and
    term licenses on which customers have delivery dates after
    January 2, 2010;

•

Licenses with payments that are outside our customary
    terms; and

•

The undelivered portion of engineering services contracts.

The substantial majority of our backlog is generated by our
    product and maintenance businesses because customer licenses
    generally include both product and maintenance components.
    Historically, we have not experienced significant cancellations
    of our contracts with customers. However, we occasionally
    reschedule the required completion dates of engineering services
    contracts, deferring revenue recognition under those contracts
    beyond the original anticipated completion date. Changes in
    customer license types or payment terms also can



impact the timing of revenue recognition. We currently expect
    approximately 80% of our fiscal 2010 revenue to come from our
    backlog as of January 2, 2010.

Revenue
    Seasonality

Historically, revenue has been lowest in our first quarter and
    highest in our fourth quarter, with a material decline between
    the fourth quarter of one year and the first quarter of the
    following year. However, our license mix has changed such that a
    substantial proportion of licenses require ratable revenue
    recognition. Although we still expect the first quarter to
    remain our lowest quarter for revenue within a fiscal year, we
    do not expect the decrease in revenue from the fourth quarter of
    one year to the first quarter of the following year to be as
    significant as it has been historically.

Research
    and Development

Our investment in research and development was
    $354.7 million during fiscal 2009, $457.9 million
    during fiscal 2008 and $494.0 million during fiscal 2007.

The primary areas of our research and development include SoC
    design, the design of silicon devices in the nanometer range,
    high-performance IC packaging, SiP and PCB design, system-level
    modeling and verification, high-performance logic verification
    technology and hardware/software co-verification. The
    electronics industry combines rapid innovation with rapidly
    increasing design and manufacturing complexity, so we make
    significant investments in enhancing our current products, as
    well as creating new products and technologies and integrating
    those products and technologies together into segmented
    solutions.

Our future performance depends largely on our ability to
    maintain and enhance our current product development and
    commercialization, to develop, acquire or operate with new
    products from third parties, and to develop solutions that meet
    increasingly demanding productivity, quality, predictability and
    cost requirements on a schedule that keeps pace with our
    customers’ technical developments and industry standards.

Manufacturing
    and Software Distribution

We perform final assembly and testing of our hardware
    verification, acceleration and emulation products at our
    headquarters in San Jose, California. Subcontractors
    manufacture all major subassemblies, including all individual
    PCBs and custom ICs, and supply them for qualification and
    testing before their incorporation into the assembled product.

Software and documentation are primarily distributed to
    customers by secure electronic delivery or on DVD.

Proprietary
    Technology

Our success depends, in part, upon our proprietary technology.
    We generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade
    secret laws, licenses and restrictive agreements to establish
    and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products.
    Many of our products include software or other intellectual
    property licensed from third parties. We may have to seek new
    licenses or renew existing licenses for third party software and
    other intellectual property in the future. As part of performing
    engineering services for customers, our engineering services
    business uses certain software and other intellectual property
    licensed from third parties, including that of our competitors.

Competition

We compete in the EDA industry for products and maintenance
    primarily with three companies: Synopsys, Inc., Mentor Graphics
    Corporation and Magma Design Automation, Inc. We also compete
    with numerous smaller EDA companies, with manufacturers of
    electronic devices that have developed or have the capability to
    develop their own EDA products, and with numerous electronics
    design and consulting companies. We generally compete on the
    basis of product quality, product features, level of integration
    or compatibility with other tools, price, payment terms and
    maintenance offerings.



Our maintenance business flows directly from our product
    business. The competitive issues associated with our maintenance
    business are substantially similar to those for our product
    business in that every maintenance contract is the direct result
    of a product contract, and once we have entered into a product
    contract, maintenance is generally purchased by the customer to
    ensure access to bug fixes and service releases, as and when
    they are made available, and other continued support.

Certain competitive factors in the engineering services business
    as described herein differ from those of the products and
    maintenance businesses. While we do compete with other EDA
    companies in the engineering services business, our principal
    competitors are independent engineering service businesses.
    These companies vary greatly in focus, geographic location,
    capability, cost structure and pricing. In addition,
    manufacturers of electronic devices may be reluctant to purchase
    services from independent vendors, including us, because they
    wish to promote their own internal design departments. We
    compete with these companies by focusing on the design of
    complex analog, digital and mixed-signal ICs and SoCs. It is our
    strategy to use engineering services as a differentiator to
    further promote our products and maintenance businesses.

International
    Operations

We have 56 sales offices, design centers and research and
    development facilities, approximately half of which are located
    outside of the United States. We consider customer sales and
    support requirements, the availability of a skilled workforce,
    and costs and efficiencies, among other relative benefits, when
    determining what operations to locate internationally. For
    additional information regarding our international operations,
    see the discussion under the heading “The effect of foreign
    exchange rate fluctuations and other risks to our international
    operations may seriously harm our financial condition”
    under Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Note 21 to
    our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Employees

As of January 2, 2010, we employed approximately 4,400
    individuals, with approximately 1,800 in sales, services,
    marketing, support and manufacturing activities, approximately
    2,000 in product research and development and approximately 600
    in management, administration and finance. None of our employees
    is represented by a labor union and we have experienced no work
    stoppages. We believe that our employee relations are good.

Item 1A. Risk
    Factors

Our business faces many risks. Described below are what we
    believe to be the material risks that we face. If any of the
    events or circumstances described in the following risks
    actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of
    operations could suffer.

Risks
    Related to Our Business

We are
    subject to the cyclical nature of the integrated circuit and
    electronics systems industries, and any downturn in these
    industries may reduce our orders and revenue.

Purchases of our products and services are dependent upon the
    commencement of new design projects by IC manufacturers and
    electronics systems companies. The IC and electronics systems
    industries are cyclical and are characterized by constant and
    rapid technological change, rapid product obsolescence and price
    erosion, evolving standards, short product life cycles and wide
    fluctuations in product supply and demand.

The IC and electronics systems industries experienced
    significant challenges in 2008 and 2009. The IC and electronic
    systems industries have also experienced significant downturns
    in connection with, or in anticipation of, maturing product
    cycles of both these industries’ and their customers’
    products. As in the past, the economic downturn in 2008 and 2009
    was characterized by diminished product demand, production
    overcapacity, high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of
    average selling prices. Although estimates project moderate
    growth for the semiconductor industry in 2010, we believe that
    increased spending on EDA and other tools may grow more slowly
    than the semiconductor industry as a whole in 2010. The economic
    downturn in the industries we serve has contributed to the
    reduction in our revenue in the past and could continue to
    adversely affect our business, operating results and financial
    condition.

We have
    experienced varied operating results, and our operating results
    for any particular fiscal period are affected by the timing of
    significant orders for our software products, fluctuations in
    customer preferences for license types and the timing of revenue
    recognition under those license types.

We have experienced, and may continue to experience, varied
    operating results. In particular, we incurred net losses during
    fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, and we expect to incur a net loss
    during fiscal 2010. Various factors affect our operating results
    and some of them are not within our control. Our operating
    results for any period are affected by the timing of certain
    orders for our software products.

Our operating results are also affected by the mix of license
    types executed in any given period. We license software using
    three different license types: subscription, term and perpetual.
    Product revenue associated with term and perpetual licenses is
    generally recognized at the beginning of the license period,
    whereas product revenue associated with subscription licenses is
    recognized over multiple periods during the term of the license.
    Revenue may also be deferred under term and perpetual licenses
    until payments become due and payable from customers with
    nonlinear payment terms or as cash is collected from customers
    with lower credit ratings. In addition, revenue is impacted by
    the timing of license renewals, the extent to which contracts
    contain flexible payment terms, changes in existing contractual
    arrangements with customers and the mix of license types (i.e.,
    perpetual, term or subscription) for existing customers. These
    changes could have the effect of accelerating or delaying the
    recognition of revenue from the timing of recognition under the
    original contract. Our license mix has changed such that a
    substantial proportion of licenses require ratable revenue
    recognition, and we expect the change in license mix, combined
    with the slow growth in spending by our customers in the
    semiconductor sector, may make it difficult for us to increase
    our revenue.

We plan operating expense levels primarily based on forecasted
    revenue levels. These expenses and the impact of long-term
    commitments are relatively fixed in the short term. In addition,
    revenue levels are harder to forecast in a difficult economic
    environment. A shortfall in revenue could lead to operating
    results below expectations because we may not be able to quickly
    reduce these expenses in response to short-term business changes.

Generally, the majority of our contracts are executed in the
    final few weeks of a fiscal quarter. This makes it difficult to
    estimate with accuracy how much business will be executed before
    the end of each fiscal quarter. Due to



the volume or complexity of transactions that we review at the
    very end of the quarter, or due to operational matters regarding
    particular agreements, we may not finish processing or ship
    products under some contracts that have been signed during that
    fiscal quarter, which means that the associated revenue cannot
    be recognized in that particular period.

The methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our
    accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of
    operations (see “Critical Accounting Estimates” under
    Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations”). Such
    methods, estimates and judgments are, by their nature, subject
    to substantial risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and factors
    may arise over time that lead us to change our methods,
    estimates and judgments. Changes in those methods, estimates and
    judgments could significantly affect our results of operations.

You should not view our historical results of operations as
    reliable indicators of our future performance. If our revenue,
    operating results or business outlook for future periods fall
    short of the levels expected by securities analysts or
    investors, the trading price of our common stock could decline.

Our
    operating results and revenue could be adversely affected by
    customer payment delays, customer bankruptcies and defaults or
    modifications of licenses or supplier modifications.

As a result of the challenging economic environment, our
    customers, who are primarily concentrated in the semiconductor
    sector, have experienced and may continue to experience adverse
    changes in their business and, as a result, may delay or default
    on their payment obligations, file for bankruptcy or modify or
    cancel plans to license our products, and our suppliers may
    significantly and quickly increase their prices or reduce their
    output. If our customers are not successful in generating
    sufficient cash or are precluded from securing financing, they
    may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts
    receivable that are owed to us, although these obligations are
    generally not cancelable. Our customers’ inability to
    fulfill payment obligations may adversely affect our revenue and
    cash flow. Additionally, our customers may seek to renegotiate
    pre-existing contractual commitments. Payment defaults by our
    customers or significant reductions in existing contractual
    commitments could have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition and operating results. Because of the high
    volatility driving material fluctuations in asset prices, the
    capital and credit markets have contracted, and if we were to
    seek funding from the capital or credit markets in response to
    any material level of customer defaults, we may not be able to
    secure funding on terms acceptable to us or at all, which, may
    have a material negative impact on our business.

Our
    failure to respond quickly to technological developments could
    make our products uncompetitive and obsolete.

The industries in which we compete experience rapid technology
    developments, changes in industry standards and customer
    requirements and frequent new product introductions and
    improvements. Currently, the industries we serve are
    experiencing the following trends:

•

Migration to nanometer design — when the size of
    process features and features, such as wires, transistors and
    contacts on ICs, continuously shrink due to the ongoing advances
    in the semiconductor manufacturing processes —
    represents a major challenge for participants in the
    semiconductor industry, from IC design and design automation to
    design of manufacturing equipment and the manufacturing process
    itself. Shrinkage of transistor length to such proportions is
    challenging the industry in the application of more complex
    physics and chemistry that is needed to realize advanced silicon
    devices. For EDA tools, models of each component’s
    electrical properties and behavior become more complex as do
    requisite analysis, design and verification capabilities. Novel
    design tools and methodologies must be invented quickly to
    remain competitive in the design of electronics in the smallest
    nanometer ranges.

•

The challenges of nanometer design are leading some customers to
    work with older, less risky manufacturing processes that may
    reduce their need to upgrade or enhance their EDA products and
    design flows.

•

The ability to design SoCs increases the complexity of managing
    a design that, at the lowest level, is represented by billions
    of shapes on the fabrication mask. In addition, SoCs typically
    incorporate



microprocessors and digital signal processors that are
    programmed with software, requiring simultaneous design of the
    IC and the related software embedded on the IC.

•

With the availability of seemingly endless gate capacity, there
    is an increase in design reuse, or the combining of

off-the-shelf

design IP with custom logic to create ICs. The unavailability of
    high-quality design IP that can be reliably incorporated into a
    customer’s design with our IC implementation products and
    services could reduce demand for our products and services.

•

Increased technological capability of the Field-Programmable
    Gate Array, which is a programmable logic chip, creates an
    alternative to IC implementation for some electronics companies.
    This could reduce demand for our IC implementation products and
    services.

•

A growing number of low-cost engineering services businesses
    could reduce the need for some IC companies to invest in EDA
    products.

If we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these
    trends, we may lose our competitive position, and our products
    or technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete. To compete
    successfully, we must develop or acquire new products and
    improve our existing products and processes on a schedule that
    keeps pace with technological developments and the requirements
    for products addressing a broad spectrum of designers and
    designer expertise in our industries. We must also be able to
    support a range of changing computer software, hardware
    platforms and customer preferences. We cannot guarantee that we
    will be successful in this effort.

Our stock
    price has been subject to significant fluctuations, and may
    continue to be subject to fluctuations.

The market price of our common stock has experienced significant
    fluctuations and may fluctuate or decline in the future, and as
    a result you could lose the value of your investment. The market
    price of our common stock may be affected by a number of
    factors, including, but not limited to:

•

Announcements of our quarterly operating results and revenue and
    earnings forecasts that fail to meet or are inconsistent with
    earlier projections or the expectations of our securities
    analysts or investors;

•

Changes in our orders, revenue or earnings estimates;

•

Announcements of a restructuring plan;

•

Changes in management;

•

A gain or loss of a significant customer or market segment share;

•

Announcements of new products or acquisitions of new
    technologies by us, our competitors or our customers; and

•

Market conditions in the IC, electronics systems and
    semiconductor industries.

In addition, equity markets in general, and technology
    companies’ equities in particular, have experienced extreme
    price and volume fluctuations. Such price and volume
    fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common
    stock for reasons unrelated to our business or operating results.

Litigation
    could adversely affect our financial condition or
    operations.

We are currently, and in the future may be, involved in various
    disputes and litigation that arise in the ordinary course of
    business. These include disputes and lawsuits related to
    intellectual property, mergers and acquisitions, licensing,
    contracts, distribution arrangements and employee relations
    matters. We are also currently engaged in a consolidated
    securities class action lawsuit and shareholder derivative
    lawsuits. For information regarding the litigation matters in
    which we are currently engaged, please refer to the discussion
    under Item 1, “Legal Proceedings.” We cannot
    provide any assurances that the final outcome of these lawsuits
    or any other proceedings that may arise in the future will not
    have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
    results, financial condition or cash flows. Litigation can be
    time-consuming and expensive and could divert management’s
    time and attention from our business, which could have a
    material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results.



Our
    future revenue is dependent in part upon our installed customer
    base continuing to license or buy additional products, renew
    maintenance agreements and purchase additional
    services.

Our installed customer base has traditionally generated
    additional new license, service and maintenance revenues. In
    future periods, customers may not necessarily license or buy
    additional products or contract for additional services or
    maintenance. In some cases, maintenance is renewable annually at
    a customer’s option, and there are no mandatory payment
    obligations or obligations to license additional software. If
    our customers decide not to renew their maintenance agreements
    or license additional products or contract for additional
    services, or if they reduce the scope of the maintenance
    agreements, our revenue could decrease, which could have an
    adverse effect on our operating results. Our customers, many of
    which are large semiconductor companies, often have significant
    bargaining power in negotiations with us. Mergers or
    acquisitions of our customers can reduce the total level of
    purchases of our software and services, and in some cases,
    increase customers’ bargaining power in negotiations with
    their suppliers, including us.

We depend
    upon our management team and key employees, and our failure to
    attract, train, motivate and retain management and key employees
    may make us less competitive in our industries and therefore
    harm our results of operations.

Our business depends upon the efforts and abilities of our
    executive officers and other key employees, including key
    development personnel. From time to time, there may be changes
    in our management team resulting from the hiring and departure
    of executive officers, and as a result, we may experience
    disruption to our business that may harm our operating results
    and our relationships with our employees, customers and
    suppliers may be adversely affected. Competition for highly
    skilled executive officers and employees can be intense,
    particularly in geographic areas recognized as high technology
    centers such as the Silicon Valley area, where our principal
    offices are located, and the other locations where we maintain
    facilities. To attract, retain and motivate individuals with the
    requisite expertise, we may be required to grant large numbers
    of stock options or other stock-based incentive awards, which
    may be dilutive to existing stockholders and increase
    compensation expense, and pay significant base salaries and cash
    bonuses, which could harm our operating results. The high cost
    of training new employees, not fully utilizing these employees,
    or losing trained employees to competing employers could also
    reduce our operating margins and harm our business or operating
    results.

In addition, the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules require stockholder
    approval for new equity compensation plans and significant
    amendments to existing equity compensation plans, including
    increases in shares available for issuance under such plans, and
    prohibit NASDAQ member organizations from giving a proxy to vote
    on equity compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the
    shares has given voting instructions. These regulations could
    make it more difficult for us to grant equity compensation to
    employees in the future. To the extent that these regulations
    make it more difficult or expensive to grant equity compensation
    to employees, we may incur increased compensation costs or find
    it difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, which
    could materially and adversely affect our business.

We may
    not be able to effectively implement our restructuring plans,
    and our restructuring plans may not result in the expected
    benefits we have anticipated, possibly having a negative affect
    on our future operating results.

During fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009, we initiated restructuring
    plans in an effort to decrease costs by reducing our workforce
    and by consolidating facilities. We may not be able to
    successfully complete and realize the expected benefits of our
    restructuring plans, such as improvements in operating margins
    and cash flows, in the restructuring periods contemplated. The
    restructuring plans have involved and may continue to involve
    higher costs or a longer timetable than we currently anticipate
    or may fail to improve our operating results as we anticipate.
    Our inability to realize these benefits may result in an
    inefficient business structure that could negatively impact our
    results of operations. Our restructuring plans have caused us
    and will cause us to incur substantial costs related to
    severance and other employee-related costs. Our restructuring
    plans may also subject us to litigation risks and expenses. In
    addition, our restructuring plans may have other consequences,
    such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce, a
    negative impact on employee morale or our ability to attract
    highly skilled employees and our competitors may seek to gain a
    competitive advantage over us. The restructuring plans could
    also cause our



remaining employees to leave or result in reduced productivity
    by our employees, and, in turn, this may affect our revenue and
    other operating results in the future.

We may
    not receive significant revenue from our current research and
    development efforts for several years, if at all.

Developing EDA technology and integrating acquired technology
    into existing platforms is expensive, and these investments
    often require a long time to generate returns. Our strategy
    involves significant investments in research and development and
    related product opportunities. We believe that we must continue
    to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research
    and development efforts to maintain and improve our competitive
    position. However, we cannot predict that we will receive
    significant, if any, revenue from these investments.

The
    competition in our industries is substantial and we may not be
    able to continue to successfully compete in our
    industries.

The EDA industry and the commercial electronics engineering
    services industry are highly competitive. If we fail to compete
    successfully in these industries, it could seriously harm our
    business, operating results or financial condition. To compete
    in these industries, we must identify and develop or acquire
    innovative and cost-competitive EDA products, integrate them
    into platforms and market them in a timely manner. We must also
    gain industry acceptance for our engineering services and offer
    better strategic concepts, technical solutions, prices and
    response time, or a combination of these factors, than those of
    our competitors and the internal design departments of
    electronics manufacturers. We may not be able to compete
    successfully in these industries. Factors that could affect our
    ability to succeed include:

•

The development by others of competitive EDA products or
    platforms and engineering services, possibly resulting in a
    shift of customer preferences away from our products and
    services and significantly decrease revenue;

•

Decisions by electronics manufacturers to perform engineering
    services internally, rather than purchase these services from
    outside vendors due to budget constraints or excess engineering
    capacity;

•

The challenges of developing (or acquiring externally-developed)
    technology solutions that are adequate and competitive in
    meeting the requirements of next-generation design challenges;

•

The significant number of current and potential competitors in
    the EDA industry and the low cost of entry;

•

Intense competition to attract acquisition targets, possibly
    making it more difficult for us to acquire companies or
    technologies at an acceptable price or at all; and

•

The combination of or collaboration among many EDA companies to
    deliver more comprehensive offerings than they could
    individually.

We compete in the EDA products market with Synopsys, Inc., Magma
    Design Automation, Inc. and Mentor Graphics Corporation. We also
    compete with numerous smaller EDA companies, with manufacturers
    of electronic devices that have developed or have the capability
    to develop their own EDA products, and with numerous electronics
    design and consulting companies. Manufacturers of electronic
    devices may be reluctant to purchase engineering services from
    independent vendors such as us because they wish to promote
    their own internal design departments.

We may
    need to change our pricing models to compete
    successfully.

The highly competitive markets in which we compete can put
    pressure on us to reduce the prices of our products. If our
    competitors offer deep discounts on certain products in an
    effort to recapture or gain market segment share or to sell
    other software or hardware products, we may then need to lower
    our prices or offer other favorable terms to compete
    successfully. Any such changes would be likely to reduce our
    profit margins and could adversely affect our operating results.
    Any substantial changes to our prices and pricing policies could
    cause sales and software license revenues to decline or be
    delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust
    to the new pricing policies. Some of our competitors may bundle
    products for promotional purposes or as a long-term pricing
    strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product
    implementations. These practices could, over time,



significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for our
    products. If we cannot offset price reductions with a
    corresponding increase in the number of sales or with lower
    spending, then the reduced license revenues resulting from lower
    prices could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

We have
    acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses
    and may not realize the expected benefits of these
    acquisitions.

We have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and
    businesses in the future. While we expect to carefully analyze
    each potential acquisition before committing to the transaction,
    we may not consummate any particular transaction, but may
    nonetheless incur significant costs, or if a transaction is
    consummated, we may not be able to integrate and manage acquired
    products and businesses effectively. In addition, acquisitions
    involve a number of risks. If any of the following events occurs
    when we acquire another business, it could seriously harm our
    business, operating results or financial condition:

•

Difficulties in combining previously separate businesses into a
    single unit;

•

The substantial diversion of management’s attention from

day-to-day

business when evaluating and negotiating these transactions and
    integrating an acquired business;

•

The discovery, after completion of the acquisition, of
    unanticipated liabilities assumed from the acquired business or
    of assets acquired, such that we cannot realize the anticipated
    value of the acquisition;

•

The failure to realize anticipated benefits such as cost savings
    and revenue enhancements;

•

The failure to retain key employees of the acquired business;

•

Difficulties related to integrating the products of an acquired
    business in, for example, distribution, engineering and customer
    support areas;

•

Unanticipated costs;

•

Customer dissatisfaction with existing license agreements with
    us, possibly dissuading them from licensing or buying products
    acquired by us after the effective date of the license; and

•

The failure to understand and compete effectively in markets
    where we have limited experience.

In a number of our previously completed acquisitions, we have
    agreed to make future payments, either in the form of employee
    bonuses or contingent purchase price payments, or earnouts,
    based on the performance of the acquired businesses or the
    employees who joined us with the acquired businesses. We may use
    earnouts for acquisitions in the future. The performance goals
    pursuant to which these future payments may be made generally
    relate to achievement by the acquired business or the employees
    who joined us with the acquired business of certain specified
    orders, revenue, run rate, product proliferation, product
    development or employee retention goals during a specified
    period following completion of the applicable acquisition.
    Future acquisitions may involve issuances of stock as full or
    partial payment of the purchase price for the acquired business,
    grants of incentive stock or options to employees of the
    acquired businesses (which may be dilutive to existing
    stockholders), expenditure of substantial cash resources or the
    incurrence of material amounts of debt.

The specific performance goal levels and amounts and timing of
    employee bonuses or contingent purchase price payments vary with
    each acquisition. While we expect to derive value from an
    acquisition in excess of such contingent payment obligations,
    our strategy may change and we may be required to make certain
    contingent payments without deriving the anticipated value.

We rely
    on our proprietary technology, as well as software and other
    intellectual property rights licensed to us by third parties,
    and we cannot assure you that the precautions taken to protect
    our rights will be adequate or that we will continue to be able
    to adequately secure such intellectual property rights from
    third parties.

Our success depends, in part, upon our proprietary technology.
    We generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade
    secret laws, licenses and restrictive agreements to establish
    and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products.
    Despite the precautions we may take to protect our intellectual
    property, third parties have tried in the past, and may try in
    the future, to challenge, invalidate or circumvent these
    safeguards. The rights granted under our patents or attendant to
    our other intellectual property may not provide us with any
    competitive advantages. Patents may not be issued on any of our
    pending applications and our issued patents may not be



sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Furthermore, the
    laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights
    in those countries to the same extent as applicable law protects
    these rights in the United States. The protection of our
    intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant
    financial and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take
    to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect
    our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or
    misappropriating our proprietary rights.

Many of our products include software or other intellectual
    property licensed from third parties. We may have to seek new or
    renew existing licenses for such software and other intellectual
    property in the future. Our engineering services business holds
    licenses to certain software and other intellectual property
    owned by third parties, including that of our competitors. Our
    failure to obtain software or other intellectual property
    licenses or other intellectual property rights that is necessary
    or helpful for our business on favorable terms, or the need to
    engage in litigation over these licenses or rights, could
    seriously harm our business, operating results or financial
    condition.

We could
    lose key technology or suffer serious harm to our business
    because of the infringement of our intellectual property rights
    by third parties or because of our infringement of the
    intellectual property rights of third parties.

There are numerous patents in the EDA industry and new patents
    are being issued at a rapid rate. It is not always practicable
    to determine in advance whether a product or any of its
    components infringes the patent rights of others. As a result,
    from time to time, we may be compelled to respond to or
    prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to protect
    our rights or defend a customer’s rights.

Intellectual property infringement claims, regardless of merit,
    could consume valuable management time, result in costly
    litigation, or cause product shipment delays, all of which could
    seriously harm our business, operating results or financial
    condition. In settling these claims, we may be required to enter
    into royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties
    claiming infringement. These royalty or licensing agreements, if
    available, may not have terms favorable to us. Being compelled
    to enter into a license agreement with unfavorable terms could
    seriously harm our business, operating results or financial
    condition. Any potential intellectual property litigation could
    compel us to do one or more of the following:

•

Pay damages (including the potential for treble damages),
    license fees or royalties (including royalties for past periods)
    to the party claiming infringement;

•

Stop licensing products or providing services that use the
    challenged intellectual property;

•

Obtain a license from the owner of the infringed intellectual
    property to sell or use the relevant technology, which license
    may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all; or

•

Redesign the challenged technology, which could be
    time-consuming and costly, or not be accomplished.

If we were compelled to take any of these actions, our business
    or operating results may suffer.

If our
    security measures are breached and an unauthorized party obtains
    access to customer data, our information systems may be
    perceived as being unsecure and customers may curtail or stop
    their use of our products and services.

Our products and services involve the storage and transmission
    of customers’ proprietary information, and breaches of our
    security measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of
    this information, litigation and potential liability. Because
    techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage
    information systems change frequently and generally are not
    recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to
    anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive
    measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security
    occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our
    security measures could be harmed and we could lose existing
    customers and our ability to obtain new customers.



The long
    sales cycle of our products and services makes the timing of our
    revenue difficult to predict and may cause our operating results
    to fluctuate unexpectedly.

Generally, we have a long sales cycle that can extend up to six
    months or longer. The complexity and expense associated with our
    business generally require a lengthy customer education,
    evaluation and approval process. Consequently, we may incur
    substantial expenses and devote significant management effort
    and expense to develop potential relationships that do not
    result in agreements or revenue and may prevent us from pursuing
    other opportunities.

In addition, sales of our products and services have been and
    may in the future be delayed if customers delay approval or
    commencement of projects because of:

•

The timing of customers’ competitive evaluation
    processes; or

•

Customers’ budgetary constraints and budget cycles.

Long sales cycles for acceleration and emulation hardware
    products subject us to a number of significant risks over which
    we have limited control, including insufficient, excess or
    obsolete inventory, variations in inventory valuation and
    fluctuations in quarterly operating results.

The majority of our contracts are executed in the final few
    weeks of a fiscal quarter. This makes it difficult to determine
    with accuracy how much business will be executed in each fiscal
    quarter. Also, because of the timing of large orders and our
    customers’ buying patterns, we may not learn of orders
    shortfalls, revenue shortfalls, earnings shortfalls or other
    failures to meet market expectations until late in a fiscal
    quarter. These factors may cause our operating results to
    fluctuate unexpectedly, which can cause significant fluctuations
    in the trading price of our common stock.

Our
    reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes
    in United States generally accepted accounting
    principles.

United States generally accepted accounting principles are
    subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards
    Board, or FASB, the American Institute of Certified Public
    Accountants, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and
    interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these
    principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on
    our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting
    of transactions completed before the announcement of a change.
    In addition, the SEC has announced a multi-year plan that could
    ultimately lead to the use of International Financial Reporting
    Standards by United States issuers in their SEC filings. Any
    such change could have a significant effect on our reported
    financial results.

The
    effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and other risks to
    our international operations may seriously harm our financial
    condition.

We have significant operations outside the United States. Our
    revenue from international operations as a percentage of total
    revenue was approximately 57% during fiscal 2009, 58% during
    fiscal 2008 and 54% during fiscal 2007. We expect that revenue
    from our international operations will continue to account for a
    significant portion of our total revenue. We also transact
    business in various foreign currencies, primarily the Japanese
    yen. The volatility of foreign currencies in certain regions,
    most notably the Japanese yen, European Union euro, British
    pound and Indian rupee have had, and may in the future have, a
    harmful effect on our revenue or operating results.

Fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the United States
    dollar and the currencies of other countries where we conduct
    business could seriously harm our business, operating results or
    financial condition. For example, when a foreign currency
    declines in value relative to the United States dollar, it takes
    more of the foreign currency to purchase the same amount of
    United States dollars than before the change. If we price our
    products and services in the foreign currency, we receive fewer
    United States dollars than we did before the change. If we price
    our products and services in United States dollars, the decrease
    in value of the local currency results in an increase in the
    price for our products and services compared to those products
    of our competitors that are priced in local currency. This could
    result in our prices being uncompetitive in markets where
    business is transacted in the local currency. On the other hand,
    when a foreign currency increases in value relative to the
    United States dollar, it takes more United States



dollars to purchase the same amount of the foreign currency. As
    we use the foreign currency to pay for payroll costs and other
    operating expenses in our international operations, this results
    in an increase in operating expenses.

Exposure to foreign currency transaction risk can arise when
    transactions are conducted in a currency different from the
    functional currency of one of our subsidiaries. A
    subsidiary’s functional currency is generally the currency
    in which it primarily conducts its operations, including product
    pricing, expenses and borrowings. Although we attempt to reduce
    the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, significant
    exchange rate movements may hurt our results of operations as
    expressed in United States dollars.

Our international operations may also be subject to other risks,
    including:

•

The adoption or expansion of government trade restrictions;

•

Limitations on repatriation of earnings;

•

Limitations on the conversion of foreign currencies;

•

Reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some
    countries;

•

Recessions in foreign economies;

•

Longer collection periods for receivables and greater difficulty
    in collecting accounts receivable;

•

Difficulties in managing foreign operations;

•

Compliance with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations
    applicable to our worldwide operations;

•

Political and economic instability;

•

Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;

•

Tariffs and other trade barriers; and

•

United States and other governments’ licensing requirements
    for exports, which may lengthen the sales cycle or restrict or
    prohibit the sale or licensing of certain products.

We have offices throughout the world, including key research and
    development facilities outside of the United States. Our
    operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations
    throughout the world. Activities that interfere with our
    international connectivity, such as computer hacking or the
    introduction of a virus into our computer systems, could
    significantly interfere with our business operations.

Our
    operating results could be adversely affected as a result of
    changes in our effective tax rates.

Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by
    the following:

•

Changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws,
    including potential United States and international tax reforms;

•

Earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we are
    taxed at lower rates as compared to the United States federal
    and state statutory tax rates;

•

An increase in expenses not deductible for tax purposes,
    including certain stock-based compensation and impairment of
    goodwill;

•

Changes in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax
    assets;

•

Changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information that
    results in a recognition, derecognition, or change in
    measurement of a tax position taken in a prior period;

•

Increases to interest expenses classified in the financial
    statements as income taxes;

•

New accounting standards or interpretations of such standards;

•

A change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest foreign
    earnings outside the United States; or

•

Results of tax examinations by the Internal Revenue Service, or
    IRS, and state and foreign tax authorities.

Any significant change in our future effective tax rates could
    adversely impact our results of operations for future periods.



We have
    received examination reports from the IRS proposing deficiencies
    in certain of our tax returns, and the outcome of current and
    future tax examinations may have a material adverse effect on
    our results of operations and cash flows.

The IRS and other tax authorities regularly examine our income
    tax returns, and the IRS is currently examining our federal
    income tax returns for the tax years 2006 through 2008. In July
    2006, the IRS completed its field examination of our federal
    income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2002 and
    issued a Revenue Agent’s Report, or RAR, in which the IRS
    proposed to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the
    three-year period of approximately $324.0 million. In
    November 2006, the IRS revised the proposed aggregate tax
    deficiency for the three-year period to approximately
    $318.0 million. The IRS is contesting our qualification for
    deferred recognition of certain proceeds received from
    restitution and settlement in connection with litigation during
    the period. The proposed tax deficiency for this item is
    approximately $152.0 million. The remaining proposed tax
    deficiency of approximately $166.0 million is primarily
    related to proposed adjustments to our transfer pricing
    arrangements with foreign subsidiaries and to our deductions for
    foreign trade income. We have filed a timely protest with the
    IRS and are seeking resolution of the issues through the Appeals
    Office of the IRS, or the Appeals Office.

In May 2009, the IRS completed its field examination of our
    federal income tax returns for the tax years 2003 through 2005
    and issued a RAR, in which the IRS proposed to assess an
    aggregate deficiency for the three-year period of approximately
    $94.1 million. In August 2009, the IRS revised the proposed
    aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year period to
    approximately $60.7 million. The IRS is contesting our
    transfer pricing arrangements with our foreign subsidiaries and
    deductions for foreign trade income. The IRS made similar claims
    against our transfer pricing arrangements and deductions for
    foreign trade income in prior examinations and may make similar
    claims in its examinations of other tax years. We have filed a
    timely protest with the IRS and will seek resolution of the
    issues through the Appeals Office.

We believe that the proposed IRS adjustments are inconsistent
    with applicable tax laws and we are vigorously challenging these
    proposed adjustments. The RARs are not final Statutory Notices
    of Deficiency, but the IRS imposes interest on the proposed
    deficiencies until the matters are resolved. Interest is
    compounded daily at rates published and adjusted quarterly by
    the IRS and have been between 4% and 10% since 2001.

The calculation of our provision (benefit) for income taxes
    requires us to use significant judgment and involves dealing
    with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and
    regulations. In determining the adequacy of our provision
    (benefit) for income taxes, we regularly assess the potential
    settlement outcomes resulting from income tax examinations.
    However, the final outcome of tax examinations, including the
    total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon
    resolution of these issues, cannot be estimated with certainty.
    In addition, we cannot be certain that such amount will not be
    materially different from the amount that is reflected in our
    historical income tax provisions and accruals. Should the IRS or
    other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of a
    current or a future examination, we may be required to record
    charges to operations in future periods that could have a
    material impact on the results of operations, financial position
    or cash flows in the applicable period or periods.

Forecasting
    our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject
    to uncertainty, and material differences between forecasted and
    actual tax rates could have a material impact on our results of
    operations.

Forecasts of our income tax position and resultant effective tax
    rate are complex and subject to uncertainty because our income
    tax position for each year combines the effects of estimating
    our annual income or loss, the mix of profits and losses earned
    by us and our subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad
    range of income tax rates, as well as benefits from available
    deferred tax assets, the impact of various accounting rules and
    changes to these rules and results of tax audits. To forecast
    our global tax rate, pre-tax profits and losses by jurisdiction
    are estimated and tax expense by jurisdiction is calculated
    based on such estimates. Forecasts of annual income or loss that
    are near break-even will cause our estimated annual effective
    tax rate to be particularly sensitive to any changes to our
    estimates of tax expense. If our estimate of the pre-tax profit
    and losses, the mix of our profits and losses, our ability to
    use deferred tax assets, the results of tax audits, or effective
    tax rates by jurisdiction is different than those estimates, our
    actual tax rate could be materially different than forecasted,
    which could have a material impact on our results of operations.



Failure
    to obtain export licenses could harm our business by rendering
    us unable to ship products and transfer our technology outside
    of the United States.

We must comply with regulations of the United States and of
    certain other countries in shipping our software products and
    transferring our technology outside the United States and to
    foreign nationals. Although we have not had any significant
    difficulty complying with such regulations so far, any
    significant future difficulty in complying could harm our
    business, operating results or financial condition.

Errors or
    defects in our products and services could expose us to
    liability and harm our reputation.

Our customers use our products and services in designing and
    developing products that involve a high degree of technological
    complexity, each of which has its own specifications. Because of
    the complexity of the systems and products with which we work,
    some of our products and designs can be adequately tested only
    when put to full use in the marketplace. As a result, our
    customers or their end users may discover errors or defects in
    our software or the systems we design, or the products or
    systems incorporating our design and intellectual property may
    not operate as expected. Errors or defects could result in:

•

Loss of customers;

•

Loss of market segment share;

•

Failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance;

•

Diversion of development resources to resolve the problem;

•

Loss of or delay in revenue;

•

Increased service costs; and

•

Liability for damages.

If we
    become subject to unfair hiring claims, we could be prevented
    from hiring needed employees, incur liability for damages and
    incur substantial costs in defending ourselves.

Companies in our industry that lose employees to competitors
    frequently claim that these competitors have engaged in unfair
    hiring practices or that the employment of these persons would
    involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets. These claims
    could prevent us from hiring employees or cause us to incur
    liability for damages. We could also incur substantial costs in
    defending ourselves or our employees against these claims,
    regardless of their merits. Defending ourselves from these
    claims could also divert the attention of our management away
    from our operations.

Our
    business is subject to the risk of earthquakes.

Our corporate headquarters, including certain of our research
    and development operations and certain of our distribution
    facilities, is located in the Silicon Valley area of Northern
    California, a region known to experience seismic activity. If
    significant seismic activity were to occur, our operations may
    be interrupted, which would adversely impact our business and
    results of operations.

We
    maintain research and development and other facilities in parts
    of the world that are not as politically stable as the United
    States, and as a result we may face a higher risk of business
    interruption from acts of war or terrorism than businesses
    located only or primarily in the United States.

We maintain international research and development and other
    facilities, some of which are in parts of the world that are not
    as politically stable as the United States. Consequently, we may
    face a greater risk of business interruption as a result of
    terrorist acts or military conflicts than businesses located
    domestically. Furthermore, this potential harm is exacerbated
    given that damage to or disruptions at our international
    research and development facilities could have an adverse effect
    on our ability to develop new or improve existing products as
    compared to other businesses which may only have sales offices
    or other less critical operations abroad. We are not insured for
    losses or interruptions caused by acts of war or terrorism.



Risks
    Related to Our Securities and Indebtedness

Our debt
    obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our
    business, operating results or financial condition, and could
    prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such
    indebtedness.

We have a substantial level of debt. As of January 2, 2010,
    we had outstanding indebtedness with a principal balance of
    $500.2 million as follows:

•

$250.0 million related to our 1.375% Convertible
    Senior Notes Due December 2011, or the 2011 Notes;

•

$250.0 million related to our 1.500% Convertible
    Senior Notes Due December 2013, or the 2013 Notes and,
    together with the 2011 Notes, the Convertible Senior
    Notes; and

•

$0.2 million related to our Zero Coupon Zero Yield Senior
    Convertible Notes Due 2023, or the 2023 Notes.

The level of our current or future indebtedness, among other
    things, could:

•

Make it difficult for us to satisfy our payment obligations on
    our debt as described below;

•

Make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our
    business;

•

Reduce funds available for use in our operations or for
    developments or acquisitions of new technologies;

•

Make it difficult for us to incur additional debt or obtain any
    necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital
    expenditures, debt service, acquisitions or general corporate
    purposes;

•

Impose operating or financial covenants on us;

•

Limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in
    our business; or

•

Place us at a possible competitive disadvantage relative to less
    leveraged competitors and competitors that have greater access
    to capital resources.

While we are not currently a party to any loans that would
    prohibit us from making payment on our outstanding convertible
    notes, we are not prevented by the terms of the convertible
    notes from entering into other loans that could prohibit such
    payments. If we are prohibited from paying our outstanding
    indebtedness, we could try to obtain the consent of the lenders
    under those arrangements to make such payment, or we could
    attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain the
    restrictions. If we do not obtain the necessary consents or
    refinance the borrowings, we may be unable to satisfy our
    outstanding indebtedness. Any such failure would constitute an
    event of default under our indebtedness, which could, in turn,
    constitute a default under the terms of any other indebtedness
    then outstanding.

If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise
    obtain funds necessary to make required payments, or if we fail
    to comply with the various requirements of our indebtedness, we
    would be in default, which would permit the holders of our
    indebtedness to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness and
    could cause defaults under any other indebtedness as well.

We have in the past and may in the future attempt to access the
    capital or credit markets in order to obtain funding to meet
    particular capital or liquidity needs. The capital and credit
    markets have contracted and, when compounded by the difficult
    economic environment and our lower levels of business, we may
    not be able to secure additional funding on terms acceptable to
    us or at all, which may adversely impact our business and
    operating results.

Any default under our indebtedness could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, operating results and financial
    condition. In addition, a material default on our indebtedness
    could suspend our eligibility to register securities using
    certain registration statement forms under SEC guidelines that
    permit incorporation by reference of substantial information
    regarding us and potentially hindering our ability to raise
    capital through the issuance of our securities and will increase
    the costs of such registration to us.

On the first day of fiscal 2009, we retrospectively adopted new
    accounting principles as required by the “Debt with
    Conversion and Other Options” subtopic of the FASB
    Accounting Standards Codification, and adjusted all periods for
    which the Convertible Senior Notes were outstanding before the
    date of adoption. This adoption had an adverse effect on our
    operating results and financial condition, particularly with
    respect to interest expense ratios



commonly referred to by lenders, and could potentially hinder
    our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt or
    equity securities.

Conversion
    of the Convertible Senior Notes will dilute the ownership
    interests of existing stockholders.

The terms of the Convertible Senior Notes permit the holders to
    convert the Convertible Senior Notes into shares of our common
    stock. The terms of the Convertible Senior Notes stipulate a net
    share settlement, which upon conversion of the Convertible
    Senior Notes requires us to pay the principal amount in cash and
    the conversion premium, if any, in shares of our common stock
    based on a daily settlement amount, calculated on a
    proportionate basis for each day of the relevant 20

trading-day

observation period. The initial conversion rate for the
    Convertible Senior Notes is 47.2813 shares of our common
    stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes,
    equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $21.15 per
    share of our common stock. The conversion price is subject to
    adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued
    interest, except in limited circumstances. The conversion of
    some or all of the Convertible Senior Notes will dilute the
    ownership interest of our existing stockholders. Any sales in
    the public market of the common stock issuable upon conversion
    could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common
    stock.

Each $1,000 of principal of the Convertible Senior Notes is
    initially convertible into 47.2813 shares of our common
    stock, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified
    events. Holders of the Convertible Senior Notes may convert
    their notes at their option on any day before the close of
    business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding
    December 15, 2011 in the case of the 2011 Notes and
    December 15, 2013 in the case of the 2013 Notes, in each
    case only if:

•

The price of our common stock reaches $27.50 during certain
    periods of time specified in the Convertible Senior Notes;

•

Specified corporate transactions occur; or

•

The trading price of the Convertible Senior Notes falls below
    98% of the product of (i) the last reported sale price of
    our common stock and (ii) the conversion rate on that date.

From November 2, 2011, in the case of the 2011 Notes, and
    November 1, 2013, in the case of the 2013 Notes, and until
    the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately
    preceding the maturity date of such Convertible Senior Notes,
    holders may convert their Convertible Senior Notes at any time,
    regardless of the foregoing circumstances. As of January 2,
    2010, none of the conditions allowing holders of the Convertible
    Senior Notes to convert had been met.

Although the conversion price of the Convertible Senior Notes is
    currently $21.15 per share, we entered into hedge and separate
    warrant transactions concurrent with the issuance of the
    Convertible Senior Notes to reduce the potential dilution from
    the conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes. However, we
    cannot guarantee that such hedges and warrant instruments will
    fully mitigate the dilution. In addition, the existence of the
    Convertible Senior Notes may encourage short selling by market
    participants because the conversion of the Convertible Senior
    Notes could depress the price of our common stock.

At the
    option of the holders of the Convertible Senior Notes, under
    certain circumstances we may be required to repurchase the
    Convertible Senior Notes in cash or shares of our common
    stock.

Under the terms of the Convertible Senior Notes, we may be
    required to repurchase the Convertible Senior Notes following a
    “fundamental change” in our corporate ownership or
    structure, such as a change of control in which substantially
    all of the consideration does not consist of publicly traded
    securities, prior to maturity of the Convertible Senior Notes.
    The repurchase price for the Convertible Senior Notes in the
    event of a fundamental change must be paid solely in cash. This
    repayment obligation may have the effect of discouraging,
    delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that may
    otherwise be beneficial to investors.



Hedge and
    warrant transactions entered into in connection with the
    issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes may affect the value of
    our common stock.

We entered into hedge transactions with various financial
    institutions, at the time of issuance of the Convertible Senior
    Notes, with the objective of reducing the potential dilutive
    effect of issuing our common stock upon conversion of the
    Convertible Senior Notes. We also entered into separate warrant
    transactions with the same financial institutions. In connection
    with our hedge and warrant transactions, these financial
    institutions purchased our common stock in secondary market
    transactions and entered into various

over-the-counter

derivative transactions with respect to our common stock. These
    entities or their affiliates are likely to modify their hedge
    positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of
    the Convertible Senior Notes by purchasing and selling shares of
    our common stock, other of our securities or other instruments
    they may wish to use in connection with such hedging. Any of
    these transactions and activities could adversely affect the
    value of our common stock and, as a result, the number of shares
    and the value of the common stock holders will receive upon
    conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes. In addition, subject
    to movement in the price of our common stock, if the hedge
    transactions settle in our favor, we could be exposed to credit
    risk related to the other party with respect to the payment we
    are owed from such other party. If the financial institutions
    with which we entered into these hedge transactions were to fail
    or default, our ability to settle on these transactions could be
    harmed or delayed.

Rating
    agencies may provide unsolicited ratings on the Convertible
    Senior Notes that could reduce the market value or liquidity of
    our common stock.

We have not requested a rating of the Convertible Senior Notes
    from any rating agency and we do not anticipate that the
    Convertible Senior Notes will be rated. However, if one or more
    rating agencies independently elects to rate the Convertible
    Senior Notes and assigns the Convertible Senior Notes a rating
    lower than the rating expected by investors, or reduces such
    rating in the future, the market price or liquidity of the
    Convertible Senior Notes and our common stock could be harmed.
    Should a decline in the market price of the Convertible Senior
    Notes result, as compared to the price of our common stock, this
    may trigger the right of the holders of the Convertible Senior
    Notes to convert the Convertible Senior Notes into cash and
    shares of our common stock.

Anti-takeover
    defenses in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and
    certain provisions under Delaware law could prevent an
    acquisition of our company or limit the price that investors
    might be willing to pay for our common stock.

Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain
    provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law that apply to
    us could make it difficult for another company to acquire
    control of our company. For example:

•

Our certificate of incorporation allows our Board of Directors
    to issue, at any time and without stockholder approval,
    preferred stock with such terms as it may determine. No shares
    of preferred stock are currently outstanding. However, the
    rights of holders of any of our preferred stock that may be
    issued in the future may be superior to the rights of holders of
    our common stock.

•

Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law
    generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any
    business combination with a person owning 15% or more of its
    voting stock, or who is affiliated with the corporation and
    owned 15% or more of its voting stock at any time within three
    years prior to the proposed business combination, for a period
    of three years from the date the person became a 15% owner,
    unless specified conditions are met.

All or any one of these factors could limit the price that
    certain investors would be willing to pay for shares of our
    common stock and could allow our Board of Directors to resist,
    delay or prevent an acquisition of our company, even if a
    proposed transaction were favored by a majority of our
    independent stockholders.

Item 2.
    Properties

We own land and buildings at our headquarters located in
    San Jose, California. We also own buildings in India. As of
    January 2, 2010, the total square footage of our owned
    buildings was approximately 950,000.

In January 2007, we completed the sale of certain of our land
    and buildings in San Jose, California. Concurrently with
    the sale, we leased back from the purchaser all available space
    in the buildings for two years. The lease term ended in January
    2009, and we have vacated the leased buildings.

We lease additional facilities in the United States and various
    other countries. We sublease certain of these facilities where
    space is not fully utilized or has been involved in
    restructuring plans.

We believe that these facilities, including our newly
    constructed building located at our headquarters, are adequate
    for our current needs and that suitable additional or substitute
    space will be available as needed to accommodate any expansion
    of our operations.

Item 3.
    Legal Proceedings

From time to time, we are involved in various disputes and
    litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business. These
    include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property,
    mergers and acquisitions, licensing, contracts, distribution
    arrangements and employee relations matters. At least quarterly,
    we review the status of each significant matter and assess its
    potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any
    claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount
    or the range of loss can be estimated, we accrue a liability for
    the estimated loss. Legal proceedings are subject to
    uncertainties, and the outcomes are difficult to predict.
    Because of such uncertainties, accruals are based on our
    judgments using the best information available at the time. As
    additional information becomes available, we reassess the
    potential liability related to pending claims and litigation
    matters and may revise estimates.

During fiscal 2008, three complaints were filed in the United
    States District Court for the Northern District of California,
    all alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and

Rule 10b-5

promulgated thereunder, on behalf of a purported class of
    purchasers of Cadence’s common stock. We intend to continue
    to vigorously defend these complaints and any other securities
    lawsuits that may be filed. See Note 15 to our Consolidated
    Financial Statements for additional details and the status of
    these complaints.

Also during fiscal 2008, two derivative complaints were filed in
    Santa Clara County Superior Court. These complaints purport
    to bring suit derivatively, on behalf of Cadence, against
    certain of Cadence’s current and former directors for
    alleged breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross
    mismanagement, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment.
    We are analyzing these derivative complaints and will respond to
    them appropriately. The parties to these cases have agreed to a
    temporary stay of the proceedings. See Note 15 to our
    Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details and the
    status of these complaints.

In light of the preliminary status of these lawsuits, we cannot
    predict the outcome of these matters. While the outcome of these
    litigation matters cannot be predicted with any certainty, we do
    not believe that the outcome of any current matters will have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position,
    liquidity or results of operations.

    the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K

regarding forward-looking statements.

Business
    Overview

We develop EDA software and hardware. We license software, sell
    or lease hardware technology, provide maintenance for our
    software and hardware and provide engineering and education
    services throughout the world to help manage and accelerate
    product development processes for electronics. Our customers use
    our products and services to design and develop complex ICs and
    electronics systems. During Fiscal 2009, we had orders of
    $615 million.

We primarily generate revenue from licensing our EDA software,
    selling or leasing our hardware technology, providing
    maintenance for our software and hardware and providing
    engineering services. Substantially all of our revenue is
    generated from IC manufacturers and designers and electronics
    systems companies and is dependent upon their commencement of
    new design projects. As a result, our revenue is significantly
    influenced by our customers’ business outlook and
    investment in the introduction of new products and the
    improvement of existing products.

Critical
    Accounting Estimates

In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we make
    assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant
    impact on our revenue, operating income and net income (loss),
    as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. We base our assumptions, judgments
    and estimates on historical experience and various other factors
    that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual
    results could differ materially from these estimates under
    different assumptions or conditions. At least quarterly, we
    evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates and make
    changes accordingly. Historically, our assumptions, judgments
    and estimates relative to our critical accounting estimates have
    not differed materially from actual results. We believe that the
    assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting
    for revenue recognition, accounting for income taxes and
    allowance for doubtful accounts have the greatest potential
    impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements; therefore, we
    consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. For
    information on our significant accounting policies, see
    Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue
    Recognition

We begin to recognize revenue from licensing and supporting our
    software and hardware products when all of the following
    criteria are met:

•

We have persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer;

•

Delivery of all specified products has occurred;

•

The fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or
    determinable, at the outset of the arrangement; and

•

Collectibility of the fee is probable.

Significant judgment is involved in the determination of whether
    the facts and circumstances of an arrangement support that the
    fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or
    determinable and that collectibility of the fee is probable, and
    that judgment can impact the amount of revenue that we recognize
    in a reporting period. We must also make these judgments when
    assessing whether a contract amendment to a term arrangement
    (primarily in the context of a license extension or renewal)
    constitutes a concession. Our experience has been that we are
    able to determine whether a fee is fixed or determinable for
    term licenses and we have established a history of collecting
    under the original contract without providing concessions on
    payments, products



or services. However, we have concluded that fees are not fixed
    or determinable for license arrangements executed with customers
    in certain countries.

For installment contracts that do not include a substantial up
    front payment, we consider that a fee is fixed or determinable
    only if the arrangement has payment periods that are equal to or
    less than the term of the licenses and the payments are
    collected in equal or nearly equal installments, when evaluated
    over the entire term of the arrangement. While we do not expect
    that experience to change, if we no longer were to have a
    history of collecting under the original contract without
    providing concessions on term licenses, revenue from term
    licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under
    the installment contract become due and payable and are
    collectible. Such a change could have a material adverse effect
    on our results of operations.

Our experience has been that we are generally able to estimate
    whether collection is probable. Significant judgment is applied
    as we assess the creditworthiness of our customers to make this
    determination. If, in our judgment, collection of a fee is not
    probable, we defer the revenue until the uncertainty is removed,
    which generally means revenue is recognized upon receipt of cash
    payment. If we were unable to determine that collection is
    probable, such a change could have a material adverse effect on
    our results of operations.

A multiple element arrangement, or MEA, is any arrangement that
    includes or contemplates rights to a combination of software or
    hardware products, software license types, services, training or
    maintenance in a single arrangement. From time to time, we may
    include individual deliverables in separately priced and
    separately signed contracts with the same customer. We obtain
    and evaluate all known relevant facts and circumstances in
    determining whether the separate contracts should be accounted
    for individually as distinct arrangements or whether the
    separate contracts are, in substance, a MEA. Significant
    judgment can be involved in determining whether a group of
    contracts might be so closely related that they are, in effect,
    part of a single arrangement.

For our subscription licenses, including “eDA Platinum
    Cards,” the software license agreements typically combine
    the right to use specified software products, the right to
    maintenance, and the right to receive and use unspecified future
    software products for no additional fee, when and if available,
    during the term of the license agreement. Under these license
    agreements, when all four of the revenue recognition criteria
    outlined above are met, we recognize revenue ratably over the
    term of the license agreement beginning with delivery of the
    first product. Subscription license revenue is allocated to
    product and maintenance revenue. The allocation to maintenance
    revenue is based on the average substantive renewal rates
    included in the sale of similar term license arrangements. In
    the event that the license fee for this type of arrangement is
    not considered to be fixed or determinable at the outset of the
    arrangement, we recognize revenue at the lesser of (i) the
    pro-rata portion of the license fee for the applicable period,
    or (ii) as payments from the customer become due (if all
    other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied).

For term and perpetual licenses, including “eDA Gold
    Cards,” when all four of the revenue recognition criteria
    outlined above are met, software license fees are recognized as
    revenue, generally with product fees associated with the
    specified products recognized “up-front” upon
    completion of delivery, and with the maintenance fees recognized
    ratably over the term of the maintenance period. Under our
    current business model, a relatively small percentage of our
    revenue from software licenses is recognized on an up-front
    basis.

License agreements under which software fees are recognized
    up-front do not include the right to receive unspecified future
    software products. However, in the event such license agreements
    are executed within close proximity or in contemplation of other
    license agreements that require ratable revenue recognition with
    the same customer, the licenses together may be deemed a MEA, in
    which event all such revenue would be recognized over multiple
    periods.

Revenue from service contracts is recognized either on the time
    and materials method, as work is performed, or on the

percentage-of-completion

method. For contracts with fixed or

not-to-exceed

fees, we estimate on a monthly basis the percentage of
    completion based on the completion of milestones relating to the
    arrangement. We have a history of accurately estimating project
    status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of
    internal and external factors can affect our estimates,
    including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and
    specification and testing requirement changes. If different
    conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could
    not be made, then the use of the completed contract method would
    be required and the recognition of all



revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was
    completed. Such a change could have a material impact on our
    results of operations.

Accounting
    for Income Taxes

We provide for the effect of income taxes in our Consolidated
    Financial Statements using the asset and liability method. We
    also apply a two-step approach to determining the financial
    statement recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions.

Income tax expense or benefit is recognized for the amount of
    taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and for
    deferred tax assets and liabilities for the tax consequences of
    events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial
    statements or tax returns. We must make significant assumptions,
    judgments and estimates to determine our current provision
    (benefit) for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and
    liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against
    our deferred tax assets. Our judgments, assumptions and
    estimates relating to the current provision (benefit) for income
    taxes include the geographic mix and amount of income (loss),
    our interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of
    current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax
    authorities. Our judgments also include anticipating the tax
    positions we will take on tax returns before actually preparing
    and filing the tax returns. Changes in our business, tax laws or
    our interpretation of tax laws, and developments in current and
    future tax audits, could significantly impact the amounts
    provided for income taxes in our results of operations,
    financial position or cash flows.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
    estimated future tax consequences attributable to tax benefit
    carryforwards and to differences between the financial statement
    amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax
    basis. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for
    recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more
    likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax
    assets will not be realized. To make this assessment, we take
    into account predictions of the amount and category of taxable
    income from various sources and all available positive and
    negative evidence about these possible sources of taxable
    income. The weight given to the potential effect of negative and
    positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the
    strength of the evidence can be objectively verified. For
    example, a company’s current year or previous year losses
    are given more weight than its future outlook. For the years
    ended January 2, 2010 and January 3, 2009, we
    concluded that a significant valuation allowance was required
    based on our evaluation and weighting of the positive and
    negative evidence. If, in the future, we determine that these
    deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized, a
    release of all or part, of the related valuation allowance could
    result in a material income tax benefit in the period such
    determination is made. For additional description of the
    valuation allowance, see Note 4 to our Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

We only recognize an income tax position in our financial
    statements that we judge is more likely than not to be sustained
    solely on its technical merits in a tax audit, including
    resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. To
    make this judgment, we must interpret complex and sometimes
    ambiguous tax laws, regulations and administrative practices. If
    an income tax position meets the more likely than not
    recognition threshold, then we must measure the amount of the
    tax benefit to be recognized by determining the largest amount
    of tax benefit that has a greater than a 50% likelihood of being
    realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority that
    has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts. It is
    inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as
    this requires us to determine the probability of various
    possible settlement outcomes. To determine if a tax position is
    effectively settled, we must also estimate the likelihood that a
    taxing authority would review a tax position after a tax
    examination has otherwise been completed. We must also determine
    when it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized
    tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease in the
    12 months after each fiscal year-end. These judgments are
    difficult because a taxing authority may change its behavior as
    a result of our disclosures in our financial statements. We must
    reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to
    consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances,
    changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and
    new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement
    would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional
    charge to the tax provision.

We are also required to assess whether the earnings of our
    foreign subsidiaries will be indefinitely reinvested outside the
    United States. As of January 2, 2010, we had recognized a
    deferred tax liability of $34.7 million related



to $67.9 million of earnings from certain foreign
    subsidiaries that are not considered indefinitely invested
    outside the United States. To calculate the tax liability for
    the repatriation of these earnings, we are required to estimate
    the geographic mix of profits and losses earned by us and our
    subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income
    and dividend withholding tax rates, the impact of foreign
    exchange rate fluctuations, and the potential outcomes of
    current and future tax audits. Changes in our actual or
    projected operating results, tax laws or our interpretation of
    tax laws, foreign exchange rates and developments in current and
    future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts
    provided for income taxes in our results of operations,
    financial position or cash flows.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

We make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding
    receivables and provide allowances for a portion of receivables
    when collection becomes doubtful. This allowance is based on our
    assessment of the creditworthiness of our customers, historical
    experience and the overall economic climate of the industries
    that we serve. While we believe that our allowance for doubtful
    accounts is adequate, we continue to monitor customer liquidity
    and other economic conditions, which may result in changes to
    our estimates regarding our ability to collect from our
    customers. Changes in circumstances, such as an unexpected
    change in a customer’s ability to meet its financial
    obligation to us or a customer’s payment trends, are hard
    to predict and may require us to adjust our estimates of the
    recoverability of amounts due to us. These changes could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
    operating results. As a result of our assessment of increased
    risk of customer delays or defaults on payment obligations, we
    have increased our allowance for doubtful accounts to
    $23.7 million as of January 2, 2010, as compared to
    $7.5 million as of January 3, 2009.

Results
    of Operations

Overview
    of Fiscal 2009

Our fiscal 2009 financial results reflected the following:

•

Continuing pressures on the research and development budgets in
    our customer base that are used to license, purchase or lease
    EDA products or services;

•

Lower business levels due to the challenging macroeconomic
    environment and the timing of our contract renewals with
    existing customers;

•

Lower business levels and up-front revenue recognized due to our
    transition to a license mix with a higher proportion of ratable
    revenue, beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2008;

•

Decreased costs throughout the company as a result of our
    restructuring plans and other expense reductions;

•

An increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts and the
    proportion of arrangements for which revenue is deferred until
    payments become due and payable or cash is received from
    customers, as a result of our assessment of the increased risk
    of customer delays or defaults on payment obligations; and

•

Our retrospective adoption of new accounting principles, as
    required by the “Debt with Conversion and Other
    Options” subtopic of the FASB Accounting Standards
    Codification, increasing interest expense for all periods
    presented.

Revenue

We primarily generate revenue from licensing our EDA software,
    selling or leasing our hardware technology, providing
    maintenance for our software and hardware and providing
    engineering services. We principally utilize three license
    types: subscription, term and perpetual. The different license
    types provide a customer with different conditions of use for
    our products, such as:

•

The right to access new technology;

•

The duration of the license; and

•

Payment timing.



The timing of our product revenue is significantly affected by
    the mix of orders executed in any given period. For some orders,
    such as subscription orders, product and maintenance revenue is
    recognized ratably over multiple periods. In addition, depending
    on the individual facts and circumstances of particular orders,
    we have some orders where product and maintenance revenue is
    recognized as payments become due and some where revenue is only
    recognized when payment is received. For other orders, all
    product revenue is recognized up-front in the same quarter in
    which the order is executed.

We seek to achieve a mix of orders with approximately 90% of the
    total value of all executed orders consisting of orders for
    which the revenue is recurring, or ratable in nature, with the
    balance of the orders made up of orders for which the product
    revenue is recognized up-front. During fiscal 2009,
    approximately 90% of the total value of our executed orders was
    comprised of ratable revenue orders. If we achieve this desired
    mix of executed orders over time and there are no significant
    changes to our business, eventually approximately 90% of our
    revenue would come from ratable orders.

Customer decisions regarding these aspects of license
    transactions determine the license type, timing of revenue
    recognition and potential future business activity. For example,
    if a customer chooses a fixed duration of use, this will result
    in either a subscription or term license. A business implication
    of this decision is that, at the expiration of the license
    period, the customer must decide whether to continue using the
    technology and therefore renew the license agreement.
    Historically, larger customers generally used products from two
    or more of our five product groups and rarely completely
    terminated their relationship with us upon expiration of the
    license. See the discussion under the heading “Critical
    Accounting Estimates – Revenue Recognition” and
    Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional descriptions of license types and timing of revenue
    recognition.

Although we believe that pricing volatility has not generally
    been a material component of the change in our revenue from
    period to period, we believe that the amount of revenue
    recognized in future periods will depend on, among other things,
    the:

•

Competitiveness of our new technology;

•

Timing of contract renewals with existing customers;

•

Length of our sales cycle; and

•

Size, duration, terms and type of:

•

Contract renewals with existing customers;

•

Additional sales to existing customers; and

•

Sales to new customers.

The value and duration of contracts, and consequently product
    revenue recognized, is affected by the competitiveness of our
    products. Product revenue recognized in any period is also
    affected by the extent to which customers purchase subscription,
    term or perpetual licenses, and the extent to which contracts
    contain flexible payment terms. The timing of revenue
    recognition is also affected by changes in the extent to which
    existing contracts contain flexible payment terms and by changes
    in contractual arrangements with existing customers (e.g.,
    customers transitioning from subscription license arrangements
    to term license arrangements).

Revenue Mix

We analyze our software and hardware businesses by product
    group, combining revenues for both product and maintenance
    because of their interrelationship. During fiscal 2009, fiscal
    2008 and fiscal 2007, our product groups were as follows:

Functional Verification

:  Products in this
    group, including the Incisive functional verification platform,
    are used to verify that the high level, logical representation
    of an IC design is functionally correct.

Digital IC Design

:  Products in this group,
    including the Encounter digital IC design platform, are used to
    accurately convert the high-level, logical representation of a
    digital IC into a detailed physical blueprint and then detailed
    design information showing how the IC will be physically
    implemented. This data is used for creation of the photomasks
    used to manufacture semiconductors.

Custom IC Design

:  Our custom design products,
    including the Virtuoso custom design platform, are used for ICs
    that must be designed at the transistor level, including analog,
    RF, memory, high performance digital blocks and



standard cell libraries. Detailed design information showing how
    an IC will be physically implemented is used for creation of the
    photomasks used to manufacture semiconductors.

System Interconnect Design

:  This product group
    consists of our PCB and IC package design products, including
    the Allegro and
    OrCAD

®

products. The Allegro system interconnect design platform
    enables consistent co-design of interconnects across ICs, IC
    packages and PCBs, while the OrCAD line focuses on
    cost-effective, entry-level PCB solutions.

Design for Manufacturing

:  Included in this
    product group are our physical verification and analysis
    products. These products are used to analyze and verify that the
    physical blueprint of the IC has been constructed correctly and
    can be manufactured successfully. Our strategy includes focusing
    on integrating DFM awareness into our core design platforms of
    Encounter digital IC design and Virtuoso custom design.

For additional description of our current product strategy, see
    the discussion under the heading “Products and Product
    Strategy” under Item 1, “Business.”

Product revenue decreased during each of fiscal 2009, as
    compared to fiscal 2008, and fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal
    2007, primarily because of lower business levels due to the
    challenges in the macroeconomic environment, the timing of our
    contract renewals with existing customers, our transition to a
    ratable license mix and a longer sales cycle. As a result,
    product revenue decreased for all product groups, and
    particularly for Digital IC Design, Custom IC Design and
    Functional Verification products during both fiscal 2009 and
    fiscal 2008. We expect to recognize increased revenue during
    fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009 due to higher business
    levels and our continued transition to our more ratable business
    model.

Services revenue decreased during fiscal 2009, as compared to
    fiscal 2008, because of lower business levels due to the
    challenges in the macroeconomic environment and an increase in
    the proportion of arrangements for which revenue is deferred
    until payments become due and payable or cash is received from
    customers, primarily as a result of our assessment of the
    increased risk of customer delays or defaults on payment
    obligations.

Maintenance revenue decreased during fiscal 2009, as compared to
    fiscal 2008, due to the following:

•

Lower business levels due to the challenges in the macroeconomic
    environment;

•

An increase in the proportion of arrangements for which revenue
    is deferred until payments become due and payable or cash is
    received from customers, primarily as a result of our assessment
    of the increased risk of customer delays or defaults on payment
    obligations; and

•

A decline in maintenance fees resulting from a reduction in the
    average duration of software license arrangements, because the
    annual fee for maintenance is lower for arrangements with
    shorter durations.



The following table shows the percentage of product and related
    maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product

As described under the heading “Critical Accounting
    Estimates,” certain of our licenses allow customers the
    ability to remix among software products. Additionally, we have
    licensed a combination of our products to customers with the
    actual product selection and number of licensed users to be
    determined at a later date. For these arrangements, we estimate
    the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the
    expected usage of our products by these customers. The actual
    usage of our products by these customers may differ and, if that
    proves to be the case, the revenue allocation in the above table
    would differ.

Although we believe the methodology of allocating revenue to
    product groups is reasonable, there can be no assurance that
    such allocated amounts reflect the amounts that would result had
    the customer individually licensed each specific software
    solution at the onset of the arrangement.

No single customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue
    during fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 or fiscal 2007.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates caused our revenue to
    increase by $7.8 million during fiscal 2009, as compared to
    fiscal 2008, primarily due to a decrease in the value of the
    United States dollar when compared to the Japanese yen,
    partially offset by an increase in the value of the United
    States dollar when compared to the British pound and the
    European Union euro. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates
    caused our revenue to increase by $24.5 million in fiscal
    2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to a decrease in
    the value of the United States



dollar when compared to the Japanese yen and the European Union
    euro, partially offset by an increase in the value of the United
    States dollar when compared to the British pound. Additional
    information about revenue and other financial information by
    geography can be found in Note 21 to our Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Stock-based
    Compensation Expense Summary

Stock-based compensation expense is reflected throughout our

Stock-based compensation expense decreased by $26.6 million
    during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, and
    $20.1 million during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal
    2007, due to the following:

•

Newly granted restricted stock awards and restricted stock
    units, collectively referred to as restricted stock, and stock
    options have lower fair values, primarily due to our lower stock
    price;

•

The decrease in the number of unvested restricted stock and
    stock options due to a reduction in headcount associated with
    our restructuring plans and the resignation of certain
    executives in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008;

•

The decrease in the maximum purchase limits under our Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, and a lower fair value of purchase
    rights granted; and

•

A decrease in stock bonuses.

Stock-based compensation expense during fiscal 2008 also
    decreased, as compared to fiscal 2007, due to the reversal of
    $6.5 million of stock-based compensation expense related to
    the modification of certain performance-based restricted stock
    awards, partially offset by an increase in stock option expense
    due to the acceleration of vesting of certain executives that
    resigned during fiscal 2008.

We expect stock-based compensation expense to continue to
    decrease during fiscal 2010, primarily due to lower fair values
    at grant dates for restricted stock and stock options, the
    cancellation of restricted stock and stock options as a result
    of our restructuring plans and other attrition, and a reduced
    number of equity grants during fiscal 2010.

Effects
    of Restructuring Plans

We plan operating expense levels primarily based on forecasted
    revenue levels. To offset some of the impact of the decrease in
    our revenue, we have implemented cost savings initiatives,
    including reducing headcount and related costs and reducing
    other discretionary spending. During fiscal 2008, we initiated a
    restructuring plan to improve our operating results and to align
    our cost structure with expected revenue. This restructuring
    plan decreased costs during fiscal 2009 by reducing our
    workforce throughout the company by approximately 625 positions.
    We expect ongoing annual savings of approximately
    $150.0 million related to the restructuring activities and
    other expense reductions initiated in fiscal 2008.

During fiscal 2009, we initiated an additional restructuring
    plan to improve our operating results and to align our cost
    structure with expected revenue. The 2009 restructuring plan,
    which we initiated during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 and
    continued during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, is intended
    to decrease costs by reducing our workforce throughout the
    company by approximately 345 positions. We expect ongoing annual
    savings of



approximately $30.0 million related to the restructuring
    activities initiated during the second quarter of fiscal 2009.
    We expect that substantially all of the estimated restructuring
    plan-related annual operating expense savings related to the
    2009 restructuring activities that we initiated during the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, and announced in January 2010,
    will be offset by increased spending in connection with
    developing and enhancing our product technologies. See
    Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional details of these and our prior restructuring plans.

Cost of services as a percentage of Services revenue increased

    decreased Services revenue during fiscal 2009 as noted above.

Cost of
    Product

Cost of product includes costs associated with the sale or lease
    of our hardware and licensing of our software products. Cost of
    product primarily includes the cost of employee salary, benefits
    and other employee-related costs, including stock-based
    compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangibles
    directly related to our products, the cost of technical
    documentation and royalties payable to third-party vendors. Cost
    of product associated with our hardware products also includes
    materials, assembly and overhead. These additional manufacturing
    costs make our cost of hardware product higher, as a percentage
    of revenue, than our cost of software product.

Hardware costs decreased during fiscal 2009, as compared to
    fiscal 2008, primarily due to a decrease in hardware sales and a
    write-off of obsolete inventory that did not recur during fiscal
    2009. Hardware costs decreased during fiscal 2008, as compared
    to fiscal 2007, primarily due to a decrease in hardware sales,
    partially offset by a write-off of obsolete inventory during
    fiscal 2008.

Amortization of acquired intangibles decreased during fiscal
    2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, due to the impairment of
    certain acquired intangibles during fiscal 2008. Amortization of
    acquired intangibles decreased during fiscal 2008, as compared
    to fiscal 2007, because certain acquired intangible assets
    became fully amortized during the related periods.

Cost of product depends primarily upon the extent to which we
    acquire intangible assets, acquire licenses and incorporate
    third-party technology in our products that are licensed or sold
    in any given period, and the actual mix of hardware and software
    product sales in any given period. Cost of product as a
    percentage of product revenue increased during fiscal 2008, as
    compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to decreased software
    product revenue during fiscal 2008.

Cost of
    Services

Cost of services primarily includes employee salary, benefits
    and other employee-related costs, costs to maintain the
    infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization and
    provisions for contract losses, if any. Cost of services
    decreased by $12.8 million during fiscal 2009, as compared
    to fiscal 2008, and increased $9.9 million during fiscal
    2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, due to the following:

Operating expenses decreased during fiscal 2009, as compared to
    fiscal 2008, primarily due to reduced headcount and related
    costs as a result of our 2008 and 2009 restructuring plans, and
    our cost savings initiatives to reduce discretionary spending.
    In addition, fiscal 2008 was a 53-week fiscal year, while fiscal
    2009 was a 52-week fiscal year. Operating expenses decreased
    during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to
    reduced headcount and related costs and our cost savings
    initiatives to reduce discretionary spending.

During fiscal 2007, we recognized a gain on the sale of land and
    buildings that related to, and accordingly reduced, operating
    expense for that period. There was no similar reduction during
    fiscal 2008.

Legal and other professional services costs decreased during
    fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to a
    decrease in professional services fees related to our proposed
    acquisition of Mentor Graphics Corporation and the restatement
    of our previously issued financial statements for the periods
    ended March 29, 2008 and June 28, 2008 that did not
    recur during fiscal 2009. See additional discussion of our
    current litigation in Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial
    Statements. Legal and other professional services costs
    decreased during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, due to
    litigation costs incurred during fiscal 2007 that did not recur
    during fiscal 2008, partially offset by increased professional
    services fees related to our proposed acquisition of Mentor
    Graphics Corporation and the restatement of our previously
    issued financial statements for the periods ended March 29,
    2008 and June 28, 2008.

Losses on the sale of installment contract receivables decreased
    during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, and during
    fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, due to a reduction in
    sales of receivables. The change in our license mix has resulted
    in an increased number of subscription licenses and a decrease
    in the sale of receivables to financial institutions because we
    generally do not sell the receivables associated with
    subscription licenses. Also, as a result of the credit losses
    recorded by banks during 2008 and 2009 and the financial
    challenges experienced by banks, a number of banks have become
    less willing to purchase assets because of capital constraints
    and concerns about over-exposure to the technology sector.

Bad debt expense increased during fiscal 2009, as compared to
    fiscal 2008, and during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007,
    because certain of our customers experienced and may continue to
    experience adverse changes in their business, which has resulted
    and may continue to result in a delay or default on their
    payment obligations.

Executive severance costs during fiscal 2008 relate to the cash
    payable to three of the five executives who resigned in October
    2008. The expense related to the other two resignations of
    executives is included in our Sales and marketing and Research
    and development expenses.

Restructuring
    and Other Charges

We have initiated multiple restructuring plans since 2001,
    including a 2009 restructuring plan which includes restructuring
    activities initiated during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 as
    well as restructuring activities initiated during the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2009 and announced in January 2010. These
    restructuring activities initiated during fiscal 2009 are
    together referred to as the 2009 Restructuring Plan. See
    Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional details of these restructuring plans.

Because the restructuring charges and related benefits are
    derived from management’s estimates made during the
    formulation of the restructuring plans, based on then-currently
    available information, our restructuring plans may not achieve
    the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level
    contemplated. Demand for our products and services and,
    ultimately, our future financial performance, is difficult to
    predict with any degree of certainty and is especially difficult
    to predict in light of the current economic challenges and
    uncertainty. Accordingly, additional actions, including further
    restructuring of our operations, may be required in the future.

    Restructuring Plan

We have recorded total costs associated with the 2009
    Restructuring Plan of $35.1 million. The costs recorded as
    part of the 2009 Restructuring Plan include severance payments,
    severance-related benefits and costs for outplacement services
    that were communicated to the affected employees before
    January 2, 2010, and estimated severance payments and
    related benefits that were both probable and estimable as of
    January 2, 2010 for employees notified after
    January 2, 2010.

Total severance and termination benefits of approximately
    $16.3 million related to the 2009 Restructuring Plan were
    paid to employees before January 2, 2010. Approximately
    $18.6 million of severance and termination benefits related
    to the 2009 Restructuring Plan will be paid after
    January 2, 2010, all of which is included in Accounts
    payable and accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheet as of January 2, 2010. Due to varying regulations in
    the jurisdictions and countries in which we operate, we expect
    substantially all termination benefits to be paid by
    January 1, 2011. We expect ongoing annual savings of
    approximately $30.0 million related to the restructuring
    activities initiated during the second quarter of 2009. We
    expect that substantially all of the estimated restructuring
    plan-related annual operating expense savings related to the
    2009 restructuring activities which we initiated during the
    fourth quarter of 2009 and announced in January 2010 will be
    offset by increased spending in connection with developing and
    enhancing our product technologies.

During fiscal 2008, we recorded $44.3 million of headcount
    reduction costs associated with the 2008 Restructuring Plan,
    including severance payments, severance-related benefits and
    costs for outplacement services, substantially all of which was
    paid by January 2, 2010.

During fiscal 2009, we recorded a net reversal of
    $2.5 million, consisting of reversals of $3.0 million
    in termination and related benefits costs that were less than
    initially estimated and $1.4 million of excess facilities
    costs due to a reduction in the estimated lease obligation
    associated with a facility vacated as part of the 2008
    Restructuring Plan, partially offset by restructuring expense of
    $1.9 million related to facilities included in the 2008
    Restructuring Plan that we exited during fiscal 2009.

Other
    Restructuring Plans

We recorded credits to Restructuring and other charges (credits)
    of $1.2 million during fiscal 2009, $0.3 million
    during fiscal 2008 and $9.7 million during fiscal 2007.
    During fiscal 2009, we recorded a release of $1.2 million
    of excess facilities costs due to a reduction in the estimated
    lease obligation associated with a facility vacated as part of
    the 2002 Restructuring Plan and a reduction in other facilities
    costs that were less than initially estimated.

During fiscal 2007, we completed a lease termination agreement
    for a facility included in the 2001 Restructuring Plan, whereby
    we paid $8.2 million and were released from all future
    obligations related to the facility. We recorded a credit to
    Restructuring and other charges of $7.1 million during
    fiscal 2007, representing the lease loss accrual related to this
    facility in excess of the amount paid.

Impairment
    of Goodwill

We conduct a goodwill impairment analysis annually and as
    necessary if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that
    the fair value of our reporting unit may be less than the
    carrying amount. We completed an interim goodwill impairment
    test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and recorded an
    Impairment of goodwill of $1,317.2 million, representing
    all of our goodwill. For additional description of our
    impairment of goodwill, see Note 13 to our Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Impairment
    of Intangible and Tangible Assets

In connection with our cost savings initiatives that were
    implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we made
    certain changes to our DFM product strategy. As a result, we
    recognized an impairment charge of $42.5 million arising
    from the abandonment of certain identifiable intangible assets
    and reducing to net realizable value certain other identifiable
    intangible assets. We also abandoned and impaired
    $4.6 million of other long-lived assets during fiscal 2008.

On the first day of fiscal 2009, we adopted new accounting
    principles as required by the “Debt with Conversion and
    Other Options” subtopic of the FASB Accounting Standards
    Codification, which requires issuers of certain types of
    convertible notes to separately account for the liability and
    equity components in a manner that will reflect the
    entity’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest
    cost is recognized in subsequent periods. This retroactive
    adoption required us to adjust our Consolidated Financial
    Statements for prior years to reflect increased interest expense
    in each of those years. The primary components of Interest
    expense for fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 consisted
    of the non-cash component associated with the amortization of
    the debt discount as required under these new accounting
    principles and the contractual interest expense of our
    Convertible Senior Notes.

The decrease in interest income during fiscal 2009, as compared
    to fiscal 2008, and during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal
    2007, was due to lower average cash balances and lower interest
    rates.

We determined that certain of our non-marketable securities were

other-than-temporarily

impaired and we wrote down the investments by $5.2 million
    during fiscal 2009, $8.6 million during fiscal 2008 and
    $2.6 million during fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2008, we
    determined that two of our

available-for-sale

securities were

other-than-temporarily

impaired based on the severity and the duration of the
    impairments, and we wrote down the investments by
    $8.1 million. All of these impairments are included in the
    Write-down of investments line in the above table.

During fiscal 2008, we purchased approximately 4.3 million
    shares of Mentor Graphics common stock in connection with our
    proposed acquisition of Mentor Graphics. After the announcement
    of our withdrawal of the proposed acquisition of Mentor Graphics
    during fiscal 2008, we sold our entire equity interest in Mentor
    Graphics at a loss of $9.4 million, which is included in
    the Gains (losses) on

available-for-sale

securities line in the above table.

The $9.3 million loss on liquidation of subsidiary is
    primarily attributable to currency translation adjustment
    losses, net of gains, previously recorded in Accumulated other
    comprehensive income on our Consolidated Balance Sheet for a
    subsidiary that was completely liquidated during fiscal 2008.



Provision
    (Benefit) for Income Taxes

During fiscal 2009, a change in United States federal tax law
    allowed companies to elect to carry back the fiscal
    2009 net operating loss for a period of three, four or five
    years instead of the general two-year carryback period. Our
    benefit for income taxes during fiscal 2009 is primarily due to
    $27.3 million of tax benefit from the fiscal 2009 United
    States federal net operating losses that can be utilized to
    offset taxable income in prior years, that is partially offset
    by current year interest expense related to unrecognized tax
    benefits of $13.3 million, and an increase in unrecognized
    tax benefits, penalties and interest related to prior year tax
    positions of $14.5 million. With the exception of the
    fiscal 2009 United States federal net operating loss that can be
    utilized in prior years, we recorded a valuation allowance that
    offset the tax benefit from other fiscal 2009 United States
    losses and tax credits.

The $14.5 million increase in unrecognized tax benefits,
    penalties and interest during fiscal 2009 included
    $7.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, penalties and
    interest that should have been recognized during multiple
    periods between fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2008. The effects on
    our fiscal 2009 results and our Consolidated Financial
    Statements for prior periods are not considered material.

We had a fiscal 2008 provision for income taxes, primarily due
    to the significant fiscal 2008 tax expenses related to the
    impairment of non-deductible goodwill, the increase in our
    valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, and our
    decision to repatriate previously untaxed foreign earnings.
    During fiscal 2008, we recognized the impairment of
    $1,059.7 million of United States goodwill that was
    non-deductible. We also increased the valuation allowance
    against our deferred tax assets by $326.0 million because
    of the uncertainty regarding their ultimate realization. In
    making this judgment, we considered the fiscal 2008 loss that
    resulted in a cumulative three-year loss and other factors.
    Finally, given the challenges in the global capital markets
    during fiscal 2008, we decided that $317.2 million of
    previously untaxed earnings from foreign subsidiaries would not
    be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. As a
    result, we accrued a tax expense of $101.1 million during
    fiscal 2008 to provide for the federal, state and foreign income
    taxes on these repatriations.

Our effective tax rate was negative for fiscal 2008, as compared
    to the positive effective tax rate for fiscal 2007, primarily
    due to the fiscal 2008 Loss before provision for income taxes
    and the fiscal 2008 tax expenses related to the impairment of
    non-deductible goodwill, the increase in our valuation allowance
    against our deferred tax assets, and our decision to repatriate
    previously untaxed foreign earnings. The fiscal 2007 effective
    tax rate reflects the $27.8 million tax benefit from the
    fiscal 2007 effective settlement of the IRS Exam for the

1997-1999

tax years.

We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 to be negative.
    Our expectation excludes the impact of possible effective
    settlements of tax examinations that may occur during fiscal
    2010. The effective tax rate is negative because we expect to
    record a loss before provision for income taxes during fiscal
    2010 and because we expect to have tax expense on the income of
    certain foreign subsidiaries and interest expense on our
    unrecognized tax benefits. In addition, we currently anticipate
    recording a valuation allowance that will offset the potential
    tax benefit of certain tax loss and credit carryforwards
    generated during fiscal 2010.

We intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately
    $79.0 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign
    subsidiaries as of January 2, 2010, to meet the working
    capital and long-term capital needs of our foreign subsidiaries.
    The unrecognized deferred tax liability for these indefinitely
    reinvested foreign earnings was approximately $35.3 million
    as of January 2, 2010.

We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability
    and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than
    not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not
    be realized. We concluded that a valuation



allowance of $383.2 million was required as of
    January 2, 2010. This represents an increase in valuation
    allowance of $52.0 million in comparison with the year
    ended January 3, 2009. If, in the future, we determine that
    these deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be
    realized, a release of all or part of the related valuation
    allowance could result in a material income tax benefit in the
    period such determination is made.

The IRS and other tax authorities regularly examine our income
    tax returns and we have received RARs indicating that the IRS
    has proposed to assess certain tax deficiencies. For further
    discussion regarding our Income taxes, including the calculation
    of our valuation allowance, our deferred tax assets, and the
    status of the IRS examinations, see Note 4 to our
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments

As of January 2, 2010, our principal sources of liquidity
    consisted of $571.3 million of Cash and cash equivalents
    and Short-term investments, as compared to $572.1 million
    as of January 3, 2009 and $1,078.1 million as of
    December 29, 2007.

Our primary sources of cash during fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008
    were:

•

Customer payments under software licenses and from the sale or
    lease of our hardware products;

•

Customer payments for services;

•

Cash received for common stock purchases under our employee
    stock purchase plan; and

•

Proceeds from the sale of receivables during fiscal 2008.

Our primary uses of cash during fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 were:

•

Payments relating to salary, benefits, other employee-related
    costs and other operating expenses, including our restructuring
    plans;

•

Purchases of property, plant and equipment;

•

Payments to former shareholders of acquired businesses;

•

Purchases of treasury stock as part of our stock repurchase
    program during fiscal 2008; and

•

Repurchase of the 2023 Notes in the amount of
    $230.2 million pursuant to their terms during fiscal 2008.

We expect that current cash and short-term investment balances
    and cash flows that are generated from operations will be
    sufficient to meet our working capital, other capital and
    liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months.



Net
    Working Capital

Net working capital increased $63.0 million as of

Cash
    Flows from Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased
    $44.7 million during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal
    2008, and $332.1 million during fiscal 2008, as compared to
    fiscal 2007, due to the following:

Cash flows from operating activities include Net income (loss),
    adjusted for certain non-cash charges, as well as changes in the
    balances of certain assets and liabilities. Our cash flows from
    operating activities are significantly influenced by business
    levels, the payment terms set forth in our license agreements
    and by sales of our receivables. As a result of the challenging
    economic environment, our customers, who are primarily
    concentrated in the semiconductor sector, have experienced and
    may continue to experience adverse changes in their business and
    as a result, may delay purchasing our products and services or
    delay or default on their payment obligations. Approximately
    half of our total Receivables, net and Installment contract
    receivables, net as of January 2, 2010 relate to ten of our
    customers. If our customers are not successful in generating
    sufficient cash or are precluded from securing financing, they
    may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts
    receivable that are owed to us, although these obligations are
    generally not cancelable. Our customers’ inability to
    fulfill payment obligations may adversely affect our cash flow.
    Additionally, our customers may seek to renegotiate pre-existing
    contractual commitments. Though we have not yet experienced a
    material level of defaults, any material payment default by our
    customers or significant reductions in existing contractual
    commitments would have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition and operating results.

We have entered into agreements whereby we may transfer accounts
    receivable to certain financial institutions on a non-recourse
    or limited-recourse basis. During fiscal 2009, we transferred
    accounts receivable to financial institutions on a non-recourse
    basis, totaling $5.8 million, net of the losses on the sale
    of the receivables, as compared to $52.2 million during
    fiscal 2008 and $215.4 million during fiscal 2007. The
    change in our license mix



has resulted in an increased number of subscription licenses
    and, therefore, a decrease in the sale of receivables to
    financial institutions. For additional information regarding our
    sales of receivables, see Note 17 to our Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

During fiscal 2008 and the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we
    initiated restructuring plans to decrease costs by reducing our
    workforce and by consolidating facilities and we expect ongoing
    annual savings of approximately $180.0 million related to
    these restructuring activities and other expense reductions. In
    January 2010, we announced additional restructuring activities
    that we initiated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. We
    expect that substantially all of the estimated annual operating
    expense savings associated with the restructuring activities
    announced in January 2010 will be offset by increased spending
    in connection with developing and enhancing our product
    technologies.

As of January 2, 2010, we had made payments in connection
    with these restructuring plans in the amount of
    $59.1 million and we expect to pay an additional amount of
    $20.8 million. We expect substantially all termination
    benefits related to these restructuring plans to be paid by
    January 1, 2011.

Cash
    Flows from Investing Activities

Our primary investing activities during fiscal 2009 and fiscal
    2008 consisted of:

•

Purchases and proceeds from the sale of property, plant and
    equipment;

•

Purchases of

available-for-sale

securities during fiscal 2008;

•

Cash paid in business combinations and asset acquisitions, net
    of cash acquired, and acquisition of intangibles; and

•

Proceeds from the sale of

available-for-sale

securities and long-term investments.

Net cash used for investing activities decreased
    $76.4 million during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal
    2008, and increased $18.5 million during fiscal 2008, as
    compared to fiscal 2007, due to the following:

In January 2007, we completed the sale of certain land and
    buildings in San Jose, California for a sales price of
    $46.5 million in cash. Concurrently with the sale, we
    leased back from the purchaser all available space in the
    buildings. During the lease term, we constructed an additional
    building on our San Jose, California campus to replace the
    buildings we sold in this transaction. The decrease in cash
    payments for Property, plant and equipment during fiscal 2009,
    as compared to fiscal 2008, is primarily due to the completion
    of this new building in January 2009.

During fiscal 2008, we purchased approximately 4.3 million
    shares of Mentor Graphics common stock for $62.4 million in
    connection with our proposed acquisition of Mentor Graphics.
    After the announcement of our withdrawal of the proposed
    acquisition of Mentor Graphics we sold our entire equity
    interest in Mentor Graphics for $53.0 million.



In connection with our acquisitions completed before
    January 2, 2010, we may be obligated to pay up to an
    aggregate of $15.9 million in cash during the next
    32 months if certain defined performance goals are achieved
    in full, of which $8.1 million would be included as
    compensation expense in our Consolidated Statements of
    Operations.

We expect to continue our investing activities, including
    purchasing property, plant and equipment, purchasing intangible
    assets, purchasing software licenses, business combinations, and
    making long-term equity investments.

Cash
    Flows from Financing Activities

Financing cash flows during fiscal 2009 consisted primarily of
    the issuance of common stock under certain employee plans.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $21.0 million
    during fiscal 2009, as compared to net cash used in financing
    activities of $443.4 million during fiscal 2008, and
    $170.1 million during fiscal 2007. The changes in our
    financing cash flows are due to the following:

The decrease in Proceeds from the issuance of common stock
    during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, is primarily due
    to decreased purchase limits under our ESPP, which became
    effective during fiscal 2009. We did not repurchase any of our
    common stock during fiscal 2009. As of January 2, 2010, we
    had $854.4 million remaining under the stock repurchase
    programs authorized by our Board of Directors.

During fiscal 2008, we repurchased $230.2 million principal
    amount of the 2023 Notes upon election of the holders of the
    2023 Notes pursuant to the terms thereof, for total
    consideration of $230.8 million.

We record a gain or loss on re-issuance of treasury stock based
    on the total proceeds received in the transaction. During fiscal
    2009, we recorded losses on the re-issuance of treasury stock of
    $213.4 million as a component of Retained earnings
    (Accumulated deficit).

Other
    Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources

Income Taxes

We provide for United States income taxes on earnings of our
    foreign subsidiaries unless the earnings are considered
    indefinitely invested outside the United States. As of
    January 2, 2010, we had recognized a deferred tax liability
    of $34.7 million related to $67.9 million of earnings
    from certain foreign subsidiaries that are not considered
    indefinitely reinvested outside the United States and for which
    we have previously made a provision for income tax. We
    repatriated $50.0 million of the $67.9 million during
    January 2010 and expect to repatriate $12.9 million of the
    remainder during fiscal 2010. We estimate that the fiscal 2010
    repatriations will result in fiscal 2010 cash tax payments of
    approximately $2.2 million.

We intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately
    $79.0 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign
    subsidiaries as of January 2, 2010, to meet the working
    capital and long-term capital needs of our foreign



subsidiaries. The unrecognized deferred tax liability for these
    indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately
    $35.3 million as of January 2, 2010.

The IRS and other tax authorities regularly examine our income
    tax returns and we have received RARs pursuant to which the IRS
    has proposed to assess certain tax deficiencies. For additional
    description of our IRS Examinations, see Note 4 to our
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

As of January 2, 2010, we had current income tax liabilities
    related to unrecognized tax benefits of $3.9 million. As of
    January 2, 2010, we had long-term income tax liabilities
    related to unrecognized tax benefits of $313.6 million. For
    additional information on the income tax liabilities related to
    unrecognized tax benefits, see the discussion under the heading
    “Contractual Obligations.”

1.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due December 2011 and
    1.500% Convertible Senior Notes Due December 2013

In December 2006, we issued $250.0 million principal amount
    of our 2011 Notes and $250.0 million of our 2013 Notes.
    Concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes,
    we entered into hedge transactions with various parties and, in
    separate transactions, sold warrants to purchase our common
    stock to various parties to reduce the potential dilution from
    the conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes and to mitigate
    any negative effect such conversion may have on the price of our
    common stock. The 2011 Notes mature on December 15, 2011
    and the 2013 Notes mature on December 15, 2013, and the
    principal amounts will be paid in cash at maturity. For
    additional description of the Convertible Senior Notes,
    including the hedge and warrants transactions, see Note 3
    to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

The 2023 Notes are due in August 2023. However, the holders of
    the 2023 Notes can require us to repurchase for cash the
    remaining portion of the 2023 Notes on August 15, 2013 for
    100.00% of the principal amount. Therefore, we have included
    $0.2 million of principal of the 2023 Notes on the
    potential repurchase of the 2023 Notes in the 3-5 Years
    column in the above table.

(2)

Included in other long-term contractual obligations are
    long-term income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax
    benefits of $313.6 million, and of that amount we estimate
    that $215.9 million will be paid or settled within 1 to
    3 years. We did not include the remaining long-term income
    tax liabilities of $97.7 million in the table above,
    because we estimated that this liability can be offset by
    available net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and
    that future cash payments will not be required to settle this
    liability. However, the total amounts of income tax payable and
    the timing of such tax payments may depend upon the resolution
    of current and future tax examinations that cannot be estimated
    with certainty. The remaining portion of other long-term
    contractual obligations is primarily acquisition-related
    liabilities.



With respect to purchase obligations that are cancelable by us,
    the table includes the amount that would have been payable if we
    had canceled the obligation as of January 2, 2010 or the
    earliest cancellation date.

In connection with our acquisitions completed before
    January 2, 2010, we may be obligated to pay up to an
    aggregate of $15.9 million in cash during the next
    32 months if certain defined performance goals are achieved
    in full.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

As of January 2, 2010, we did not have any significant
    off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in
    Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC

Regulation S-K.

New
    Accounting Standards

In October 2009, the FASB issued new accounting standards for
    multiple-deliverable arrangements and for revenue arrangements
    that include both tangible products and software elements.

The new standards for multiple-deliverable arrangements enable
    vendors to account for products or services (deliverables)
    separately rather than as a combined unit. This guidance
    establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the
    selling price of a deliverable based on:
    (a) vendor-specific objective evidence;
    (b) third-party evidence; or (c) estimates. This
    guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation and
    requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the
    inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the
    relative selling price method. In addition, this guidance
    significantly expands required disclosures related to a
    vendor’s multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements.

Under the new standards for revenue arrangements that include
    both tangible products and software elements, tangible products
    containing software components and non-software components that
    function together to deliver the tangible product’s
    essential functionality are excluded from the pre-existing
    software revenue guidance. In addition, hardware components of a
    tangible product containing software components are always
    excluded from the pre-existing software revenue guidance.

We are currently evaluating the application to our revenue
    arrangements of the two new accounting standards described
    above. The impact of these new standards may result in revenue
    being recognized for certain sales of hardware and
    nonsoftware-related deliverables separate from the software
    deliverables within a multiple element arrangement. Both of
    these new standards are effective prospectively for revenue
    arrangements entered into or materially modified during fiscal
    years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with the option
    to provide retrospective presentation for prior years, with
    early adoption permitted. We plan to adopt these two new
    accounting standards during our first quarter of fiscal 2011.

In June 2009, the FASB issued new accounting standards for
    determining whether to consolidate a variable interest entity.
    These new standards amend the evaluation criteria to identify
    the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and
    require ongoing reassessment of whether an enterprise is the
    primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity. The
    provisions of the new standards are effective for annual
    reporting periods beginning after November 15, 2009 and
    interim periods within those fiscal years. These standards will
    be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal
    2010. We are currently evaluating the impact that these new
    standards will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 7A.
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk

Foreign
    Currency Risk

Most of our revenue, expenses and material business activity are
    transacted in the United States dollar. However, certain of our
    operations include transactions in foreign currencies and,
    therefore, we benefit from a weaker dollar, and in certain
    countries where we invoice customers in the local currency, we
    are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major
    currencies worldwide. The primary effect of foreign currency
    transactions on our results of operations from a weakening
    United States dollar is an increase in revenue offset by a
    smaller increase



in expenses. Conversely, the primary effect of foreign currency
    transactions on our results of operations from a strengthening
    United States dollar is a reduction in revenue offset by a
    smaller reduction in expenses.

We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with
    financial institutions to protect against currency exchange
    risks associated with existing assets and liabilities. A foreign
    currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing
    in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying
    liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange
    rates. Conversely, a foreign currency forward exchange contract
    decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or
    underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in
    foreign exchange rates. These forward contracts are not
    designated as accounting hedges and, therefore, the unrealized
    gains and losses are recognized in Other income, net, in advance
    of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of
    these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or
    other current assets.

Our policy governing hedges of foreign currency risk does not
    allow us to use forward contracts for trading purposes. Our
    forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or
    less. The effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our
    ability to estimate future asset and liability exposures. We
    enter into currency forward exchange contracts based on
    estimated future asset and liability exposures. Recognized gains
    and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will
    ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the
    amount of currency forward exchange contracts with actual
    underlying asset and liability exposures.

The following table provides information, as of January 2,
    2010, about our forward foreign currency contracts. The
    information is provided in United States dollar equivalent
    amounts. The table presents the notional amounts, at contract
    exchange rates, and the weighted average contractual foreign
    currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign
    currency per United States dollar, which in some cases may not
    be the market convention for quoting a particular currency. All
    of these forward contracts matured during January 2010.

While we actively monitor our foreign currency risks, there can
    be no assurance that our foreign currency hedging activities
    will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency
    exchange rates on our results of operations, cash flows and
    financial position.

Interest
    Rate Risk

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates
    relates primarily to our portfolio of Cash and cash equivalents.
    While we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of
    the world’s leading industrialized countries, our interest
    income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the
    general level of United States interest rates. In this regard,
    changes in United States interest rates affect the interest
    earned on our Cash and cash equivalents and the costs associated
    with foreign currency hedges.



We invest in high quality credit issuers and, by policy, limit
    the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer. As part of
    our policy, our first priority is to reduce the risk of
    principal loss. Consequently, we seek to preserve our invested
    funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment
    risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality
    credit securities that we believe to have low credit risk, and
    by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a
    significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment
    issuer or guarantor. The short-term interest-bearing portfolio
    of Cash and cash equivalents includes only marketable securities
    with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio
    liquidity.

All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or
    less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash
    equivalents. Investments with maturities greater than three
    months are classified as

available-for-sale

and are considered to be short-term investments. The carrying
    value of our interest-bearing instruments approximated fair
    value as of January 2, 2010. The following table presents
    the carrying value and related weighted average interest rates
    for our interest-bearing instruments, which are all classified
    as Cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheet

    Section 4(2) of the Securities Act for resale to qualified
    institutional buyers pursuant to SEC Rule 144A.
    Concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes,
    we entered into hedge transactions with various parties and in
    separate transactions, sold warrants to various parties to
    reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the
    Convertible Senior Notes and to mitigate any negative effect
    such conversion may have on the price of our common stock. For
    additional description of the Convertible Senior Notes,
    including the hedge and warrants transactions, see Note 3
    to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Investments

We have a portfolio of equity investments that includes
    marketable equity securities and non-marketable equity
    securities. Our equity investments are made primarily in
    connection with our strategic investment program. Under our
    strategic investment program, from time to time we make cash
    investments in companies with technologies that are potentially
    strategically important to us. See Note 6 to our
    Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details of
    these investments.

Item 9A.
    Controls and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We carried out an evaluation required by

Rule 13a-15

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the
    Exchange Act, under the supervision and with the participation
    of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, or
    CEO, and our Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation



of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in

Rules 13-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Exchange Act) as of January 2, 2010.

The evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures
    included a review of our processes and the effect on the
    information generated for use in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

In the course of this evaluation, we sought to identify any
    material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures,
    to determine whether we had identified any acts of fraud
    involving personnel who have a significant role in our
    disclosure controls and procedures, and to confirm that any
    necessary corrective action, including process improvements, was
    taken. This type of evaluation is done every fiscal quarter so
    that our conclusions concerning the effectiveness of these
    controls can be reported in our periodic reports filed with the
    SEC. The overall goals of these evaluation activities are to
    monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and to make
    modifications as necessary. We intend to maintain these
    disclosure controls and procedures, modifying them as
    circumstances warrant.

Based on their evaluation as of January 2, 2010, our CEO
    and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and
    procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that
    the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports
    filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded,
    processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
    specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and is accumulated
    and communicated to our management, including the CEO and CFO,
    as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosure.

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial
    reporting during the quarter ended January 2, 2010 that
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent
    Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that
    our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control
    over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and
    all fraud. Internal control over financial reporting, no matter
    how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable,
    not absolute, assurance that the objectives of internal control
    are met. Further, the design of internal control must reflect
    the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
    of the control must be considered relative to their costs. While
    our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
    financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance
    of their effectiveness, because of the inherent limitations in
    all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide
    absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
    fraud, if any, within Cadence have been detected.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined
    in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Exchange Act). Our management assessed the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of January 2, 2010. In making this assessment, our
    management used the criteria established in

Internal
    Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Our
    management has concluded that, as of January 2, 2010, our
    internal control over financial reporting is effective based on
    these criteria. Our independent registered public accounting
    firm, KPMG LLP, has issued an attestation report on our internal
    control over financial reporting, which is included in
    Item 15, “Exhibits and Financial Statement
    Schedules.”

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Cadence Design Systems, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as
    of January 2, 2010 and January 3, 2009, and the
    related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss), and
    cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
    January 2, 2010. In connection with our audits of the
    consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the
    financial statement schedule, as set forth under
    Item 15(a)(2). These consolidated financial statements and
    financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial
    statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
    January 2, 2010 and January 3, 2009, and the results
    of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years
    in the three-year period ended January 2, 2010, in
    conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial
    statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
    consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents
    fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
    therein.

As discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for its
    Convertible Senior Notes due to the retrospective adoption of
    new accounting requirements issued by the Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (FASB), as of January 4, 2009. Also, as
    discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for
    uncertainty in income taxes due to the adoption of new
    accounting requirements issued by the FASB, as of
    December 31, 2006.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Cadence Design Systems, Inc.’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of January 2, 2010, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report
    dated February 26, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on
    the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Cadence Design Systems, Inc.:

We have audited Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and
    subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial
    reporting as of January 2, 2010, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in the accompanying

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

included in Item 9A. Our responsibility is to
    express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries
    maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of January 2, 2010, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and
    subsidiaries as of January 2, 2010 and January 3,
    2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss), and
    cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
    January 2, 2010, and our report dated February 26,
    2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
    financial statements and the accompanying financial statement
    schedule.

CADENCE
    DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS

January 2, 2010

NOTE 1.

CADENCE

Cadence Design Systems, Inc., or Cadence, licenses electronic
    design automation, or EDA, software, sells or leases hardware
    technology and intellectual property and provides engineering
    and education services throughout the world to help manage and
    accelerate electronic product development processes. Cadence
    customers use its products and services to design and develop
    complex integrated circuits, or ICs, and electronic systems.

NOTE 2.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles
    of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

Cadence’s fiscal year end is the Saturday closest to
    December 31. Fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2007 were 52-week
    years. Fiscal 2008 was a 53-week year. The consolidated
    financial statements include the accounts of Cadence and its
    subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts and
    transactions. All consolidated subsidiaries are wholly-owned by
    Cadence.

Use
    of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
    conformity with United States generally accepted accounting
    principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts
    of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates.

Cash,
    Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

Cadence considers all highly liquid debt instruments, including
    commercial paper, European Union euro time deposits, repurchase
    agreements and certificates of deposit, with remaining
    maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be
    cash equivalents. Investments with maturities greater than three
    months and less than one year are classified as Short-term
    investments.

Foreign
    Operations

Cadence transacts business in various foreign currencies. The
    United States dollar is the functional currency of
    Cadence’s consolidated entities operating in the United
    States and Cadence’s principal Irish, Israeli, Hungarian
    and Dutch subsidiaries. The functional currency for
    Cadence’s other consolidated entities operating outside of
    the United States is generally the local country’s
    currency, which is the primary currency in which the entity
    generates and expends cash. Cadence translates the financial
    statements of consolidated entities whose functional currency is
    not the United States dollar into United States dollars. Cadence
    translates assets and liabilities at the exchange rate in effect
    as of the financial statement date and translates statement of
    operations accounts using the average exchange rate for the
    period. Cadence includes translation adjustments from foreign
    exchange and the effect of exchange rate changes on intercompany
    transactions of a long-term investment nature in
    Stockholders’ Equity as a component of Accumulated other
    comprehensive income. Cadence reports gains and losses from
    foreign exchange rate changes related to intercompany
    receivables and payables that are not of a long-term investment
    nature, as well as gains and losses from foreign currency
    transactions, in its Consolidated Statements of Operations.
    Cadence recognized a $9.9 million loss attributable to
    currency translation adjustment losses, net of gains, from the
    complete liquidation of a subsidiary during fiscal 2008. There
    were no significant gains or losses on the liquidation of
    subsidiaries during fiscal 2009 or fiscal 2007.



Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Cadence enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts
    with financial institutions to protect against currency exchange
    risks associated with existing assets and liabilities. A foreign
    currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing
    in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying
    liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange
    rates. Conversely, a foreign currency forward exchange contract
    decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or
    underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in
    foreign exchange rates. The forward contracts are not designated
    as accounting hedges and, therefore, the unrealized gains and
    losses are recognized in Other income (expense), net, in advance
    of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of
    these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or
    other current assets.

Cadence does not use forward contracts for trading purposes.
    Cadence’s forward contracts generally have maturities of
    90 days or less. Recognized gains or losses with respect to
    our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how
    accurately Cadence is able to match the amount of currency
    forward exchange contracts with underlying asset and liability
    exposures.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

Cadence analyzes the creditworthiness of its customers,
    historical experience, changes in customer demand, and the
    overall economic climate in the industries that Cadence serves,
    makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding
    receivables, and provides allowances for the portion of
    receivables when collection is not probable. Provisions are made
    based upon a specific review of customer receivables and are
    recorded in operating expenses. Receivables and Installment
    contract receivables are presented net of allowance for doubtful
    accounts of $23.7 million as of January 2, 2010 and
    $7.5 million as of January 3, 2009.

Cadence’s customers are primarily concentrated within the
    semiconductor sector, which was adversely affected by the 2008
    and 2009 economic downturn. Approximately half of Cadence’s
    total Receivables, net and Installment contract receivables, net
    as of January 2, 2010 relate to ten customers.

Cadence believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts is
    adequate, but Cadence will continue to monitor customer
    liquidity and other economic conditions, which may result in
    changes to Cadence’s estimates regarding its allowance for
    doubtful accounts. The adequacy of the allowance for doubtful
    accounts is evaluated by Cadence at least quarterly, and any
    adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts resulting
    from these evaluations could be material to Cadence’s
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value.
    Cadence’s inventories include high technology parts and
    components for complex computer systems that emulate the
    performance and operation of computer IC and electronic systems.
    These parts and components may be specialized in nature or
    subject to rapid technological obsolescence. While Cadence has
    programs to minimize the required inventories on hand and
    considers technological obsolescence when estimating required
    reserves to reduce recorded amounts to market values, it is
    reasonably possible that such estimates could change in the near
    term. Cadence’s practice is to reserve for inventory in
    excess of

12-month

demand.

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost.
    Depreciation and amortization are generally provided over the
    estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, as
    follows:

Computer equipment and related software

2-7 years

Buildings

10-32 years

Leasehold and building improvements

Shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life

Furniture and fixtures

3-5 years

Equipment

3-5 years



Cadence capitalizes the costs of software developed for internal
    use and web site development costs. Capitalization of software
    developed for internal use and web site development costs begins
    at the application development phase of the project.
    Capitalization of software developed for internal use and web
    site development costs ends, and amortization begins, when the
    computer software is substantially complete and ready for its
    intended use. Amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis
    over the estimated useful life of the software. Cadence
    capitalized $10.5 million during fiscal 2009,
    $15.6 million during fiscal 2008 and $24.1 million
    during fiscal 2007 for costs of software developed for internal
    use.

Cadence recorded depreciation and amortization expense in the
    amount of $69.4 million during fiscal 2009,
    $77.9 million during fiscal 2008 and $73.7 million
    during fiscal 2007 for property, plant and equipment. Cadence
    abandoned and impaired certain long-lived assets of
    $6.7 million during fiscal 2009, $2.2 million during
    fiscal 2008 and $2.4 million during fiscal 2007, and these
    charges are included throughout Cadence’s operating
    expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
    Operations. In addition, Cadence abandoned and impaired certain
    long-lived assets of $4.6 million during fiscal 2008, and
    this charge is included in Impairment of intangible and tangible
    assets in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

In January 2007, Cadence completed the sale of certain land and
    buildings in San Jose, California for a sales price of
    $46.5 million in cash. Concurrently with the sale, Cadence
    leased back from the purchaser for two years approximately
    262,500 square feet of office space, which represented all
    available space in the buildings, and Cadence has since vacated
    the leased buildings. As of January 2, 2010, Cadence had
    capitalized $66.0 million in connection with the completed
    construction of its new building at its headquarters in
    San Jose, California. Cadence occupied a portion of the new
    building during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and the
    remaining portion of the building during the first quarter of
    fiscal 2009.

Software
    Development Costs

Software development costs are capitalized beginning when a
    product’s technological feasibility has been established by
    completion of a working model of the product and amortization
    begins when a product is available for general release to
    customers. The period between the achievement of technological
    feasibility and the general release of Cadence’s products
    has typically been of short duration and costs incurred during
    this period have not been material.

Goodwill

Cadence conducts a goodwill impairment analysis annually and as
    necessary if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that
    the fair value of Cadence’s reporting unit may be less than
    its carrying amount. Cadence’s goodwill impairment test
    consists of two steps. The first step requires that Cadence
    compare the estimated fair value of its single reporting unit to
    the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets,
    including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is
    greater than the carrying value of its net assets, goodwill is
    not considered to be impaired and no further testing is
    required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than
    the carrying value of its net assets, Cadence would be required
    to complete the second step of the test by analyzing the fair
    value of its goodwill. If the carrying value of the goodwill
    exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded.

In connection with the preparation of Cadence’s fiscal 2008
    financial statements, Cadence performed an interim goodwill
    impairment test and recorded an Impairment of goodwill of
    $1,317.2 million, representing all of Cadence’s
    goodwill at the time. See Note 13 for additional
    information regarding Cadence’s goodwill impairment
    analysis.

Long-lived
    Assets, including Acquired Intangibles

Cadence’s long-lived assets consist of property, plant and
    equipment and other acquired intangibles, excluding goodwill.
    Acquired intangibles with definite lives are amortized on a
    straight-line basis over the remaining estimated economic life
    of the underlying products and technologies (original lives
    assigned are one to ten years). Cadence reviews its long-lived
    assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived
    asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of an asset is
    measured by comparison



of its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash
    flows that the asset is expected to generate. If it is
    determined that an asset is not recoverable, an impairment loss
    is recorded in the amount by which the carrying amount of the
    asset exceeds its fair value. In addition, Cadence assesses its
    long-lived assets for impairment if they are abandoned.

Non-Marketable
    Securities

Cadence’s non-marketable securities include investments in
    privately-held companies, and these investments are initially
    recorded at cost. To determine the fair value of these
    privately-held investments, Cadence uses the most recent round
    of financing or estimates of current fair value using
    traditional valuation techniques. It is Cadence’s policy to
    review the fair value of these investments on a regular basis to
    determine whether the investments in these companies are

other-than-temporarily

impaired. This evaluation includes, but is not limited to,
    reviewing each company’s cash position, financing needs,
    earnings or revenue outlook, operational performance, management
    or ownership changes and competition and is based on information
    that Cadence requests from these companies. This information is
    not subject to the same disclosure regulations as United States
    publicly-traded companies, and as such, the basis for these
    evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the
    data received from these companies. If Cadence believes the
    carrying value of an investment is in excess of fair value, and
    this difference is

other-than-temporary,

it is Cadence’s policy to write down the investment to fair
    value.

Nonqualified
    Deferred Compensation Trust

Executive Officers, senior management and members of
    Cadence’s Board of Directors may elect to defer
    compensation payable to them under Cadence’s 1994
    Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan, or the NQDC. Deferred
    compensation payments are held in accounts with values indexed
    to the performance of selected mutual funds or money market
    accounts. Cadence consolidates the NQDC trust accounts in its
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

The selected mutual funds or money market accounts held in the
    NQDC trust are classified as trading securities. Trading
    securities are stated at fair value, with the unrealized gains
    and losses recognized in the Consolidated Statements of
    Operations as Other income, net. These trading securities are
    classified as Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets
    because the securities are not available for Cadence’s use
    in its operations.

Cadence’s obligation with respect to the NQDC trust is
    recorded in Other long-term liabilities on its Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. Increases and decreases in the NQDC liability
    are recorded as compensation expense in the Consolidated
    Statements of Operations.

Deferred
    Revenue

Deferred revenue arises when customers pay for products or
    services in advance of revenue recognition. Cadence’s
    deferred revenue consists primarily of unearned revenue on
    maintenance and product licenses for which revenue is recognized
    over the duration of the license. Maintenance on perpetual
    licenses is generally renewed annually, billed in full in
    advance, and the corresponding revenue is recognized over the
    ensuing

12-month

maintenance term. The fees under product licenses for which
    revenue is not recognized immediately and for maintenance in
    connection with term and subscription licenses are generally
    billed quarterly in advance and the related revenue is
    recognized over multiple periods over the ensuing license period.

Comprehensive
    Income (Loss)

Other comprehensive income (loss) includes foreign currency
    translation gains and losses and unrealized gains and losses on
    marketable securities that are

available-for-sale

that have been excluded from Net income (loss) and reflected
    instead in Stockholders’ equity. Cadence has reported
    comprehensive income (loss) in its Consolidated Statements of
    Stockholders’ Equity. Cadence reclassified from unrealized
    holding gains and losses on marketable securities to realized
    gains included in Other income (expense), net, in the
    accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations,
    $2.3 million during fiscal 2009, without any tax effect,
    ($7.9) million during fiscal 2008, without any tax effect,
    and $4.4 million during fiscal 2007, net of
    $1.8 million of tax. Cadence did not have a tax benefit for
    gross



unrealized holding losses in marketable equity securities during
    fiscal 2009 or fiscal 2008. The tax benefit for gross unrealized
    holding losses in marketable equity securities was
    $2.5 million during fiscal 2007.

Revenue
    Recognition

License
    Types

Cadence
    licenses software using three different license types:

•

Subscription licenses;

•

Term licenses; and

•

Perpetual licenses.

For many of Cadence’s term and subscription license
    arrangements, Cadence uses its proprietary internet-based
    delivery mechanism,

“eDA-on-tap,”

to facilitate the delivery of its software products. To maximize
    the efficiency of this delivery mechanism, Cadence created two
    types of “eDA Cards.” Subscription license customers
    may purchase what Cadence refers to as an “eDA Platinum
    Card,” which provides the customer access to and use of all
    software products delivered at the outset of the arrangement and
    the ability to use additional unspecified software products that
    may become commercially available during the term of the
    arrangement, until the fees have been depleted. Term license
    customers may purchase what Cadence refers to as an “eDA
    Gold Card,” which provides the customer access to and use
    of all software products delivered at the outset of the
    arrangement, until the fees have been depleted. Overall, the eDA
    Cards provide greater flexibility for Cadence’s customers
    in how and when they deploy and use Cadence’s software
    products.

Subscription licenses

– Cadence’s
    subscription license arrangements offer customers the right to:

•

Access and use all software products delivered at the outset of
    an arrangement throughout the entire term of the arrangement,
    generally two to four years, with no rights to return;

•

Use unspecified additional software products that become
    commercially available during the term of the
    arrangement; and

•

Remix among the software products delivered at the outset of the
    arrangement, as well as the right to remix into other
    unspecified additional software products that may become
    available during the term of the arrangement, so long as the
    cumulative value of all products in use does not exceed the
    total license fee determined at the outset of the arrangement.
    These remix rights may be exercisable multiple times during the
    term of the arrangement. The right to remix all software
    products delivered pursuant to the license agreement is not
    considered an exchange or return of software because all
    software products have been delivered and the customer has the
    continuing right to use them.

In general, revenue associated with subscription licenses is
    recognized ratably over the term of the license commencing upon
    the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery
    of the first software product. Subscription license revenue is
    allocated to product and maintenance revenue. The allocation to
    maintenance revenue is based on vendor specific objective
    evidence, or VSOE, of fair value of the undelivered maintenance
    that was established in connection with the sale of our term
    licenses.

In the event that a subscription license arrangement was
    terminated by mutual agreement and a new term license
    arrangement is entered into either concurrently with or after
    the termination of the subscription license arrangement during
    fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008, the revenue associated with the new
    term license arrangement is recognized upon the later of the
    effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the first
    software product, assuming all other revenue recognition
    criteria have been met.

Term licenses

– Cadence’s term license
    arrangements offer customers the right to:

•

Access and use all software products delivered at the outset of
    an arrangement throughout the entire term of the arrangement,
    generally two to four years, with no rights to return; and

•

Remix among the software products delivered at the outset of the
    arrangement, so long as the cumulative value of all products in
    use does not exceed the total license fee determined at the
    outset of the arrangement. These remix rights may be exercisable
    multiple times during the term of the arrangement. The right to
    remix all software products delivered pursuant to the license
    agreement is not considered an



exchange or return of software because all software products
    have been delivered and the customer has the continuing right to
    use them.

In general, revenue associated with term licenses is recognized
    upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or
    delivery of the software product.

Perpetual licenses

– Cadence’s perpetual
    licenses consist of software licensed on a perpetual basis with
    no right to return or exchange the licensed software. In
    general, revenue associated with perpetual licenses is
    recognized upon the later of the effective date of the license
    or delivery of the licensed product.

Timing
    of Revenue Recognition

Cadence recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an
    arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the fee is
    fixed or determinable, collection of the resulting receivable is
    probable, and VSOE exists.

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement

–
    Generally, Cadence uses a contract signed by the customer as
    evidence of an arrangement for subscription and term licenses
    and hardware leases. If a contract signed by the customer does
    not exist, Cadence has historically used a purchase order as
    evidence of an arrangement for perpetual licenses, hardware
    sales, maintenance renewals and small fixed-price service
    projects, such as training classes and small methodology service
    engagements of approximately $10,000 or less. For all other
    service engagements, Cadence uses a signed professional services
    agreement and a statement of work to evidence an arrangement. In
    cases where both a signed contract and a purchase order exist,
    Cadence considers the signed contract to be the most persuasive
    evidence of the arrangement. Sales through Cadence’s
    distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the
    relationship, together with binding purchase orders from the
    distributor on a

transaction-by-transaction

basis.

Product delivery

– Software and the
    corresponding access keys are generally delivered to customers
    electronically. Electronic delivery occurs when Cadence provides
    the customer access to the software. Occasionally, Cadence will
    deliver the software on a DVD with standard transfer terms of

free-on-board,

or F.O.B., shipping point. Cadence’s software license
    agreements generally do not contain conditions for acceptance.
    With respect to hardware, delivery of an entire system is deemed
    to occur upon its successful installation. For certain hardware
    products, installation is the responsibility of the customer, as
    the system is fully functional at the time of shipment. For
    these products, delivery is deemed to be complete when the
    products are shipped with freight terms of F.O.B. shipping point.

For customers who purchase eDA Gold or eDA Platinum Cards,
    delivery occurs when the customer has been provided with access
    codes that allow the customer to download the software pursuant
    to the terms of the software license agreement.

Fee is fixed or determinable

– Cadence assesses
    whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the
    arrangement, primarily based on the payment terms associated
    with the transaction. Cadence has established a history of
    collecting under the original contract without providing
    concessions on payments, products or services. For installment
    contracts that do not include a substantial up front payment,
    Cadence only considers that a fee is fixed or determinable if
    the arrangement has payment periods that are equal to or less
    than the term of the licenses and the payments are collected in
    equal or nearly equal installments, when evaluated over the
    entire term of the arrangement. Cadence has a history of
    collecting receivables under installment contracts of up to five
    years. However, Cadence has concluded that fees are not fixed or
    determinable for license arrangements executed with customers in
    certain countries.

Significant judgment is involved in assessing whether a fee is
    fixed or determinable. Cadence must also make these judgments
    when assessing whether a contract amendment to a term
    arrangement (primarily in the context of a license extension or
    renewal) constitutes a concession. Cadence’s experience has
    been that it is able to determine whether a fee is fixed or
    determinable for term licenses. While Cadence does not expect
    that experience to change, if Cadence no longer were to have a
    history of collecting under the original contract without
    providing concessions on term licenses, revenue from term
    licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under
    the installment contract become due and payable. Such a change
    could have a material impact on Cadence’s results of
    operations.



Collection is probable

– Cadence assesses the
    probability of collecting from each customer at the outset of
    the arrangement based on a number of factors, including the
    customer’s payment history and its current
    creditworthiness. If in Cadence’s judgment collection of a
    fee is not probable, Cadence defers the revenue until the
    uncertainty is removed, generally upon receipt of cash payment.

Vendor-specific objective evidence of fair
    value

– Cadence’s VSOE for certain product
    elements of an arrangement is based upon the pricing in
    comparable transactions when the element is sold separately.
    VSOE for maintenance is based upon the customer’s stated
    annual renewal rates. VSOE for services is generally based on
    the price charged when the services are sold separately. For
    multiple element arrangements, VSOE must exist to allocate the
    total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of a term
    or perpetual license arrangement. If VSOE does not exist for all
    elements to support the allocation of the total fee among all
    delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement, revenue
    is deferred until either such evidence does exist for the
    undelivered elements, or all elements are delivered, whichever
    is earlier. If VSOE of all undelivered elements exists but VSOE
    does not exist for one or more delivered elements, revenue is
    recognized using the residual method. Under the residual method,
    the VSOE of the undelivered elements is deferred, and the
    remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as
    revenue as the elements are delivered. Cadence’s experience
    has been that it is able to determine VSOE for maintenance when
    a stated annual renewal rate is included in the arrangement and
    time-based services. Cadence has not established VSOE for
    product, including licenses that include the right to receive
    unspecified future software products, or for annual maintenance
    that is not cancellable by the customer.

Other
    Factors Affecting Revenue Recognition

Multiple element arrangement

– A multiple
    element arrangement, or MEA, is any arrangement that includes or
    contemplates rights to a combination of software or hardware
    products, software license types, services, training or
    maintenance in a single arrangement. From time to time, Cadence
    may include individual deliverables in separately priced and
    separately signed contracts with the same customer. Cadence
    obtains and evaluates all known relevant facts and circumstances
    in determining whether the separate contracts should be
    accounted for individually as distinct arrangements or whether
    the separate contracts are, in substance, a MEA. Significant
    judgment can be involved in determining whether a group of
    contracts might be so closely related that they are, in effect,
    part of a single arrangement.

Finance fee revenue

– Finance fees result from
    discounting to present value the product revenue derived from
    installment contracts in which the payment terms extend beyond
    one year from the effective date of the contract. Finance fees
    are recognized using a method that approximates the effective
    interest method over the relevant license term and are
    classified as product revenue. Finance fee revenue represented
    approximately 2% of total revenue during fiscal 2009,
    approximately 3% of total revenue during fiscal 2008 and
    approximately 2% of total revenue during of fiscal 2007.
    Upon the sale of an installment contract, Cadence recognizes the
    remaining finance fee revenue associated with the installment
    contract.

Services revenue

– Services revenue consists
    primarily of revenue received for performing engineering
    services. These services are not related to the functionality of
    the products licensed. Revenue from service contracts is
    recognized either on the time and materials method, as work is
    performed, or on the

percentage-of-completion

method. For contracts with fixed or

not-to-exceed

fees, Cadence estimates on a monthly basis the

percentage-of-completion

based on the completion of milestones relating to the
    arrangement. Cadence has a history of accurately estimating
    project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A
    number of internal and external factors can affect these
    estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency
    variances and specification and testing requirement changes. If
    different conditions were to prevail such that accurate
    estimates could not be made, then the use of the completed
    contract method would be required and the recognition of all
    revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was
    completed. Such a change could have a material impact on
    Cadence’s results of operations.

Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental
    authorities

– Cadence applies the net basis
    presentation for taxes collected from customers and remitted to
    governmental authorities.



Accounting
    for Income Taxes

Cadence accounts for the effect of income taxes in its
    Consolidated Financial Statements using the asset and liability
    method. Cadence must make significant judgments in calculating
    its provision (benefit) for income taxes. Cadence is required to
    estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which
    it operates. This process involves estimating actual current tax
    liabilities together with assessing temporary differences
    resulting from differing treatment of items, such as
    depreciation, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences
    result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using
    enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
    years when those temporary differences are expected to be
    recovered or settled. To measure the deferred tax assets and
    liabilities, Cadence’s judgments include anticipating the
    tax positions Cadence will take on tax returns for future years.
    The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in
    tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes
    the enactment date.

Cadence then records a valuation allowance to reduce the
    deferred tax assets to the amount that Cadence believes is more
    likely than not to be realized based on its judgment of all
    available positive and negative evidence. Deferred tax assets
    are realized by an enterprise by having sufficient taxable
    income to allow the related tax benefits to reduce taxes
    otherwise payable. Accordingly, the taxable income must be both
    of an appropriate character (e.g., capital versus ordinary,
    foreign versus United States source income) and within the
    carryback and carryforward periods permitted by law. In making
    such assessments, Cadence must make significant judgments about
    the possible sources of taxable income and the evidence
    available about each possible source of taxable income on a
    jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. The weight given to the
    potential effect of negative and positive evidence is
    commensurate with the extent to which the strength of the
    evidence can be objectively verified. For example, a
    company’s current year or previous losses are given more
    weight than its future outlook. For the years ended
    January 2, 2010 and January 3, 2009, Cadence concluded
    that a significant valuation allowance was required based on its
    evaluation and weighting of the positive and negative evidence.
    See Note 4 for additional details. If, in the future,
    Cadence determines that these deferred tax assets are more
    likely than not to be realized, a release of all or part, of the
    related valuation allowance could result in a material income
    tax benefit in the period such determination is made.

Cadence takes a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring
    the financial statement benefit of uncertain tax positions. The
    first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by
    determining whether the weight of available evidence indicates
    that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be
    sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals
    or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax
    benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of
    being realized upon effective settlement of the audit. Cadence
    reevaluates its income tax positions on a quarterly basis to
    consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances,
    changes in or interpretations of tax law, effectively settled
    issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in
    recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax
    benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. Cadence
    classifies interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits
    as income tax expense.

Cadence is also required to assess whether the earnings of its
    foreign subsidiaries will be indefinitely reinvested outside the
    United States. As of January 2, 2010, Cadence had
    recognized a deferred tax liability of $34.7 million
    related to $67.9 million of earnings from certain foreign
    subsidiaries that are not considered indefinitely reinvested
    outside the United States. To calculate the tax liability for
    the repatriation of these earnings, Cadence is required to
    estimate the geographic mix of profits and losses earned by
    Cadence and its subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad
    range of income and dividend withholding tax rates, the impact
    of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and the potential
    outcomes of current and future tax audits. Changes in
    Cadence’s actual or projected operating results, tax laws
    or Cadence’s interpretation of tax laws, foreign exchange
    rates and developments in current and future tax audits could
    significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in
    Cadence’s results of operations, financial position or cash
    flows.

Restructuring
    Charges

Cadence accounts for restructuring charges with customary
    termination benefits when the costs are both probable and
    estimable. The costs are both probable and estimable on the date
    Cadence determines the number of employees whose positions will
    be terminated, their job classifications or functions, their
    location and the expected



termination date, even if the actual positions are not
    finalized. Cadence accounts for restructuring charges with
    non-standard termination benefits when the plan has been
    communicated to the affected employees.

In connection with its restructuring plans, Cadence has made a
    number of estimates and assumptions related to losses on excess
    facilities vacated or consolidated, particularly the timing of
    subleases and sublease terms. Closure and space reduction costs
    included in the restructuring charges include payments required
    under leases less any applicable estimated sublease income after
    the facilities are abandoned, lease buyout costs and certain
    contractual costs to maintain facilities during the period after
    abandonment.

In addition, Cadence has recorded estimated provisions for
    termination benefits and outplacement costs, long-term asset
    impairments and other restructuring costs. Cadence regularly
    evaluates the adequacy of its restructuring accrual, and adjusts
    the balance based on changes in estimates and assumptions.
    Cadence may incur future charges for new restructuring plans as
    well as for changes in estimates to amounts previously recorded.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Cadence recognizes the cost of employee services received in
    exchange for awards of equity instruments as stock-based
    compensation expense. Stock-based compensation expense is
    measured at the grant date based on the value of the restricted
    stock award or restricted stock unit, collectively referred to
    as restricted stock, option or purchase right and is recognized
    as expense, less expected forfeitures, over the requisite
    service period, which typically equals the vesting period. The
    fair value of each option grant and each purchase right granted
    under Cadence’s Employee Stock Purchase Program, or ESPP,
    is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
    pricing model. The fair value of each restricted stock issuance
    is determined using the fair value of Cadence’s common
    stock on the grant date. Cadence recognizes stock-based
    compensation expense on the straight-line method for options and
    restricted stock that only contain a service condition and on
    the graded-vesting method for options and restricted stock that
    contain both a service and performance condition. Determining
    the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires
    judgment, including estimating the following:

•

Expected volatility of our stock;

•

Expected term of stock options;

•

Risk-free interest rate for the period;

•

Expected dividends, if any; and

•

Expected forfeitures.

The computation of the expected volatility assumption used in
    the Black-Scholes option pricing model for new grants is based
    on implied volatility when the remaining maturities of the
    underlying traded options are at least one year and, when the
    remaining maturities of the underlying traded options are less
    than one year, it is based on an equal weighting of historical
    and implied volatilities.

When establishing the expected life assumption, Cadence reviews
    annual historical employee exercise behavior with respect to
    option grants having similar vesting periods. The risk-free
    interest rate for the period within the expected term of the
    option is based on the yield of United States Treasury notes in
    effect at the time of grant. Cadence has not historically paid
    dividends, thus the expected dividends used in the calculation
    are zero.

Judgment is required in estimating the amount of stock-based
    awards that Cadence expects to be forfeited. Cadence calculates
    a separate expected forfeiture rate for both stock options and
    restricted stock issuances based on historical trends. Judgment
    is also required to estimate the attainment of certain
    predetermined performance goals for a performance-based bonus
    plan, under which payments may be made in Cadence common stock,
    and performance-based restricted stock grants. Each period,
    Cadence estimates the most likely outcome of such performance
    goals and recognizes any related stock-based compensation
    expense. The amount of stock-based compensation expense
    recognized in any one period can vary based on the attainment or
    estimated attainment of the various performance goals. If such
    performance goals are not met, no compensation expense is
    recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is
    reversed.

The valuation of all options, including the expected life of
    stock options, are calculated based on one employee pool because
    there is no significant difference in exercise behavior between
    classes of employees. The expected



forfeiture rates for options and restricted stock are calculated
    based on an employee pool and an executive pool due to the
    vesting acceleration provisions in certain executive employment
    agreements.

Cadence made the election to calculate the tax effects of
    stock-based compensation expense using the alternative
    transition method and computed the beginning balance of the
    Additional Paid In Capital, or APIC, tax benefit pool by
    applying the simplified method, resulting in an APIC tax benefit
    pool windfall position. Accordingly, Cadence had cumulative
    excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation available in
    APIC that could be used to offset an equal amount of future tax
    shortfalls (i.e., when the amount of the tax deductible
    stock-based compensation is less than the related stock-based
    compensation cost).

Treasury
    Stock

When treasury stock is reissued at a price higher than its cost,
    the difference is recorded as a component of Capital in excess
    of par in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’
    Equity. When treasury stock is reissued at a price lower than
    its cost, the difference is recorded as a component of Capital
    in excess of par to the extent that there are gains to offset
    the losses. If there are no treasury stock gains in Capital in
    excess of par, the losses upon re-issuance of treasury stock are
    recorded as a component of Retained earnings (Accumulated
    deficit) in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’
    Equity. Cadence recorded losses on the re-issuance of treasury
    stock as a component of Retained earnings (Accumulated deficit)
    of $213.4 million during fiscal 2009, $110.6 million
    during fiscal 2008 and $24.4 million during fiscal 2007.

Concentrations
    of Credit Risk

Financial instruments, including derivative financial
    instruments, that may potentially subject Cadence to
    concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of cash and
    cash equivalents, short-term investments, long-term investments,
    accounts receivable and forward contracts. Cadence’s
    customers are primarily concentrated within the semiconductor
    sector, which was adversely affected by the 2008 and 2009
    economic downturn. Approximately half of Cadence’s total
    Receivables, net and Installment contract receivables, net as of
    January 2, 2010 relate to ten customers. The adequacy of
    the allowance for doubtful accounts is evaluated by Cadence at
    least quarterly and any adjustments to the allowance for
    doubtful accounts resulting from these evaluations could have a
    material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Credit exposure related to the forward contracts is limited to
    the realized and unrealized gains on these contracts. Cadence
    issued options and warrants to hedge potential dilution of its
    convertible notes, as described more fully in Note 3.
    Changes in the fair value of these hedge and warrant
    transactions are not marked to market and are not recognized in
    Cadence’s Consolidated Statements of Operations as long as
    the instruments remain classified as equity.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

On a quarterly basis, Cadence measures at fair value certain
    financial assets, including cash equivalents,

available-for-sale

securities, time deposits, trading securities held in
    Cadence’s Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plans, or
    NQDCs, and foreign exchange contracts. Inputs to valuation
    techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs
    reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while
    unobservable inputs reflect Cadence’s market assumptions.
    These two types of inputs have created the following fair-value
    hierarchy:

•

Level 1

– Quoted prices for identical
    instruments in active markets;

•

Level 2

– Quoted prices for similar
    instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or
    similar instruments in markets that are not active, and
    model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and
    significant value drivers are observable in active
    markets; and

•

Level 3

– Valuations derived from
    valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or
    significant value drivers are unobservable.

This hierarchy requires Cadence to minimize the use of
    unobservable inputs and to use observable market data, if
    available, when determining fair value.



The fair value of Cadence’s cash and cash equivalents,
    short-term investments, receivables, accounts payable and
    foreign currency forward exchange contracts approximate their
    carrying value due to the short-term nature of these
    instruments. The fair market values of Cadence’s long-term
    investments and installment contract receivables approximate
    their carrying values based upon current market rates of
    interest. The fair value of Cadence’s convertible notes is
    influenced by interest rates and Cadence’s stock price and
    stock price volatility and is determined by market trading. See
    Note 3 for the fair value of Cadence’s
    1.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due December 2011, or the
    2011 Notes, and 1.500% Convertible Senior Notes Due
    December 2013, or the 2013 Notes, and collectively, the
    Convertible Senior Notes, Cadence’s Zero Coupon Zero Yield
    Senior Convertible Notes Due 2023, or 2023 Notes, and
    Cadence’s convertible note hedges and warrants.

Advertising

Cadence expenses the costs of advertising as incurred.
    Advertising expense was approximately $6.7 million during
    fiscal 2009, $9.0 million during fiscal 2008 and
    $8.8 million during fiscal 2007, and is included in
    Marketing and sales in the accompanying Consolidated Statements
    of Operations.

Subsequent
    Events

Cadence evaluated subsequent events through the date on which
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

was filed with the SEC.

NOTE 3. CONVERTIBLE
    NOTES

1.375% Convertible
    Senior Notes Due December 2011 and 1.500% Convertible
    Senior Notes Due

December 2013

In December 2006, Cadence issued $250.0 million principal
    amount of the 2011 Notes and $250.0 million of the 2013
    Notes. The indentures for the Convertible Senior Notes do not
    contain any financial covenants. Cadence received net proceeds
    of approximately $487.2 million after issuance costs of
    approximately $12.8 million, including $12.0 million
    of underwriting discounts. Contractual interest payable on the
    Convertible Senior Notes began accruing in December 2006 and is
    payable semi-annually each December 15th and
    June 15th.

Holders may convert their Convertible Senior Notes prior to
    maturity upon the occurrence of one of the following events:

•

The price of Cadence’s common stock reaches $27.50 during
    certain periods of time specified in the Convertible Senior
    Notes;

•

Specified corporate transactions occur; or

•

The trading price of the Convertible Senior Notes falls below
    98% of the product of (i) the last reported sale price of
    Cadence’s common stock and (ii) the conversion rate on
    that date.

From November 2, 2011, in the case of the 2011 Notes, and
    November 1, 2013, in the case of the 2013 Notes, and until
    the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately
    preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their
    Convertible Senior Notes at any time, regardless of the
    foregoing circumstances. The 2011 Notes mature on
    December 15, 2011 and the 2013 Notes mature on
    December 15, 2013. Cadence may not redeem the Convertible
    Senior Notes prior to maturity.

The initial conversion rate for the Convertible Senior Notes is
    47.2813 shares of Cadence common stock per $1,000 principal
    amount of Convertible Senior Notes, equivalent to a conversion
    price of approximately $21.15 per share of Cadence common stock.
    Upon conversion, a holder will receive the sum of the daily
    settlement amounts, calculated on a proportionate basis for each
    day, during a specified observation period following the
    conversion date. The daily settlement amount during each date of
    the observation period consists of:

•

Cash up to the principal amount of the note; and

•

Cadence’s common stock to the extent that the conversion
    value exceeds the amount of cash paid upon conversion of the
    Convertible Senior Notes.



In addition, if a fundamental change occurs prior to maturity
    and if Cadence’s stock price is then greater than $18.00
    per share, the conversion rate will increase by an additional
    amount of up to $8.27 per share, for a holder that elects to
    convert its Convertible Senior Notes in connection with such
    fundamental change, which amount will be paid entirely in cash.
    A fundamental change is any transaction or event (whether by
    means of an exchange offer, liquidation, tender offer,
    consolidation, merger, combination, reclassification,
    recapitalization or otherwise) in which more than 50% of
    Cadence’s common stock is exchanged for, converted into,
    acquired for or constitutes solely the right to receive,
    consideration. No fundamental change will have occurred if at
    least 90% of the consideration received consists of shares of
    common stock, or depositary receipts representing such shares,
    that are:

•

Listed on, or immediately after the transaction or event will be
    listed on, a United States national securities exchange; or

•

Approved, or immediately after the transaction or event will be
    approved, for quotation on a United States system of automated
    dissemination of quotations of securities prices similar to the
    NASDAQ National Market prior to its designation as a national
    securities exchange.

As of January 2, 2010, none of the conditions allowing the
    holders of the Convertible Senior Notes to convert had been met.

Concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes,
    Cadence entered into hedge transactions with various parties
    whereby Cadence has the option to purchase up to
    23.6 million shares of Cadence’s common stock at a
    price of $21.15 per share, subject to adjustment. These options
    expire on December 15, 2011, in the case of the 2011 Notes,
    and December 15, 2013, in the case of the 2013 Notes, and
    must be settled in net shares. The aggregate cost of these hedge
    transactions was $119.8 million and has been recorded as a
    reduction to Stockholders’ equity. The estimated fair value
    of the hedges acquired in connection with the issuance of the
    Convertible Senior Notes was $4.3 million as of
    January 2, 2010. Subsequent changes in the fair value of
    these hedges will not be recognized in Cadence’s
    Consolidated Financial Statements as long as the instruments
    remain classified as equity.

In separate transactions, Cadence also sold warrants to various
    parties for the purchase of up to 23.6 million shares of
    Cadence’s common stock at a price of $31.50 per share in a
    private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the
    Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. The
    warrants expire on various dates from February 2012 through
    April 2012 in the case of the 2011 Notes, and February 2014
    through April 2014 in the case of the 2013 Notes, and must be
    settled in net shares. Cadence received $39.4 million in
    cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants, which has been
    recorded as an increase in Stockholders’ equity. The
    estimated fair value of the warrants sold in connection with the
    issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes was $2.1 million
    as of January 2, 2010. Subsequent changes in the fair value
    of these warrants will not be recognized in Cadence’s
    Consolidated Financial Statements as long as the instruments
    remain classified as equity. The warrants will be included in
    diluted earnings per share to the extent the impact is
    considered dilutive.

Zero
    Coupon Zero Yield Senior Convertible Notes Due 2023

In August 2003, Cadence issued $420.0 million principal
    amount of the 2023 Notes. Cadence received net proceeds of
    $406.4 million after issuance costs of $13.6 million
    that were recorded in Other long-term assets and were amortized
    as interest expense using the straight-line method over five
    years. In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Senior
    Notes in December 2006, Cadence repurchased $189.6 million
    principal amount of the 2023 Notes, and in August 2008, Cadence
    repurchased $230.2 million principal amount of the 2023
    Notes upon the election of the holders of the 2023 Notes and
    pursuant to the terms of the 2023 Notes, for a total
    consideration of $230.8 million, reducing the balance of
    the outstanding 2023 Notes to $0.2 million. As of
    January 2, 2010, the total fair value of the outstanding
    2023 Notes was $0.1 million.

Adoption
    of New Accounting Principles

Cadence adopted new accounting principles for its Convertible
    Senior Notes on the first day of fiscal 2009. These new
    accounting principles require issuers of certain types of
    convertible notes to separately account for the liability and
    equity components of such convertible notes in a manner that
    reflects the entity’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate
    when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods. These
    new accounting principles apply to the Convertible Senior Notes,
    but they do not apply to the 2023 Notes. Prior to this adoption,
    the liability of the



Convertible Senior Notes was carried at its principal value and
    only the contractual interest expense was recognized in
    Cadence’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Because
    these new accounting principles require retrospective adoption,
    Cadence was required to adjust all periods for which the
    Convertible Senior Notes were outstanding before the date of
    adoption.

Upon adoption of these new accounting principles and effective
    as of the issuance date of the Convertible Senior Notes, Cadence
    recorded $120.1 million of the principal amount to equity,
    representing a debt discount for the difference between
    Cadence’s estimated nonconvertible debt borrowing rate of
    6.3% at the time of issuance and the coupon rate of the
    Convertible Senior Notes. This debt discount is amortized as
    interest expense over the contractual terms of the 2011 Notes
    and the 2013 Notes, respectively, using the effective interest
    method. In addition, Cadence allocated $3.1 million of the
    issuance costs to the equity component of the Convertible Senior
    Notes and the remaining $9.7 million of the issuance costs
    to the debt component of the Convertible Senior Notes. The
    issuance costs were allocated pro rata based on their initial
    carrying amounts. The $9.7 million of debt issuance costs
    allocated to the debt component is amortized as interest expense
    over the respective contractual terms of the Convertible Senior
    Notes using the effective interest method.

The carrying amount of the equity component of the Convertible
    Senior Notes and the principal amount, unamortized discount and
    net carrying amount of the liability component of the
    Convertible Senior Notes as of January 2, 2010 and
    January 3, 2009 were as follows:

Upon adoption of these new accounting principles and effective
    as of the issuance date of the Convertible Senior Notes, Cadence
    recorded, as adjustments to Common stock and capital in excess
    of par value, deferred taxes for the differences in the
    financial statement and tax basis that resulted from allocating
    $120.1 million of the principal amount of the Convertible
    Senior Notes to equity and from allocating $3.1 million of
    the associated issuance costs to equity. In subsequent periods,
    Cadence reduced the deferred taxes to reflect the tax effect of
    the amortization of debt discount, net of capitalized interest,
    and of the debt issuance costs. Cadence also recorded tax
    adjustments to reverse previously recorded tax benefits from the
    Convertible Senior Notes to Common stock and capital in excess
    of par value and to Retained earnings (Accumulated deficit).

During fiscal 2009, a United States federal tax law was enacted
    that allows Cadence to elect to carry back its fiscal
    2009 net operating loss for a period of three, four or five
    years to offset taxable income in those preceding tax years.
    Cadence’s effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 reflects the
    $27.3 million tax benefit from the fiscal 2009 United



States federal net operating loss that Cadence intends to carry
    back to offset taxable income from fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007,
    which is partially offset by current year interest expense
    related to unrecognized tax benefits of $13.3 million and
    an increase in unrecognized tax benefits, penalties and interest
    related to prior year tax positions of $14.5 million.

Cadence’s effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 reflects the
    tax expense related to the increase in valuation allowance
    against deferred tax assets, the repatriation of foreign
    earnings and the impairment of non-deductible goodwill.
    Cadence’s effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 reflects the
    tax benefit from the effective settlement of the IRS Exam for
    the

1997-1999

tax years and from foreign income taxed at a lower rate than the
    federal income tax rate of 35%.

Cadence has recognized $7.3 million of provision for income
    taxes during fiscal 2009 that should have been recognized during
    multiple periods between fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2008. As a
    result, Cadence’s Net income (loss) would have increased
    (decreased) as follows, with a corresponding change in
    Cadence’s Provision for income taxes:

Cadence regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for
    recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance if it is
    more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
    tax assets will not be realized. Cadence considers various
    sources of taxable income and all available positive and
    negative evidence about these possible sources of taxable
    income. Cadence gives significant weight to evidence that can be
    objectively verified. Under this standard Cadence’s current
    year loss, the cumulative three-year loss, the limited
    visibility to the timing and extent of an economic recovery, and
    the Cadence expectation of a net loss in fiscal 2010, were
    considered significant negative evidence with a high level of
    objectivity that outweighed Cadence’s ability to rely on
    long-term projections of future taxable income in determining
    whether a valuation allowance was needed. Cadence also
    considered the availability of taxable income in the extended
    carryback years provided under the United States federal tax law
    that was enacted in fiscal 2009.

Cadence concluded that a valuation allowance of
    $383.2 million was required as of January 2, 2010.
    After consideration of the valuation allowance, Cadence had
    total net deferred tax assets of approximately
    $92.8 million as of January 2, 2010. The net increase
    during fiscal 2009 in the total valuation allowance was
    $52.0 million. The net deferred tax assets are primarily
    composed of United States net operating loss and tax credit
    carryforwards. The net deferred tax assets are presented gross
    of unrecognized tax benefits, which are not directly associated
    with the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The
    unrecognized tax benefits are presented separately as a
    liability and provide a source of taxable income for purposes of
    assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets. Although
    there is no guarantee that these deferred tax assets will be
    realized, Cadence believes that it is more likely than not that
    it will be able to realize the net deferred tax assets over time.



Cadence provides for United States income taxes on the earnings
    of foreign subsidiaries unless the earnings are considered
    indefinitely invested outside of the United States. Given the
    challenges in the global capital markets during fiscal 2008,
    Cadence determined that $317.2 million of previously
    untaxed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries were not
    indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. As a
    result, Cadence accrued a tax expense of $101.1 million
    during fiscal 2008 to provide for the potential federal, state
    and foreign income taxes on these repatriations. During fiscal
    2008, Cadence repatriated to the United States
    $250.0 million of the $317.2 million. Cadence did not
    repatriate any foreign earnings to the United States during
    fiscal 2009. As of January 2, 2010, Cadence had a deferred
    tax liability of $34.7 million related to
    $67.9 million of earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries
    that are not considered indefinitely reinvested outside the
    United States and for which Cadence has previously made a
    provision for income tax. Cadence repatriated $50.0 million
    of the $67.9 million during January 2010 and expects to
    repatriate $12.9 million of the remainder during fiscal
    2010.

Cadence intends to indefinitely reinvest approximately
    $79.0 million of undistributed earnings of its foreign
    subsidiaries as of January 2, 2010, to meet the working
    capital and long-term capital needs of its foreign subsidiaries.
    The unrecognized deferred tax liability for these indefinitely
    reinvested foreign earnings was approximately $35.3 million as
    of January 2, 2010.

As of January 2, 2010, Cadence had United States federal
    and California state net operating loss carryforwards of
    approximately $27.5 million and $181.9 million,
    respectively, available to reduce future taxable income. The
    federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various
    dates from 2021 through 2027. The California state net operating
    loss carryforwards will expire at various dates from 2014
    through 2029. For fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009, no California
    state net operating loss deduction is allowed. Cadence has tax
    effected net operating losses from states other than California
    of $4.7 million, which will expire at various dates from
    2010 through 2029 and $1.3 million in foreign jurisdictions
    which do not expire and carry forward indefinitely until
    utilized.

As of January 2, 2010, Cadence had United States federal
    tax credit carryforwards of $35.1 million, California state
    tax credit carryforwards of $29.1 million, tax credit
    carryforwards from states other than California of
    $8.3 million, and $4.2 million of tax credit
    carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions. $35.3 million of
    these available tax credits do not expire and carry forward
    indefinitely until utilized and the remaining $41.4 million
    of tax credits will expire at various dates from 2010 through
    2029. For fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009, California limited the
    utilization of tax credits to 50% of the tax liabilities.

Internal
    Revenue Service Examinations

The Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, and other tax authorities
    regularly examine Cadence’s income tax returns.
    Cadence’s federal income tax returns beginning with the
    2000 tax year remain subject to examination by the IRS.
    Cadence’s California income tax returns beginning with the
    2001 tax year remain subject to examination by the California
    Franchise Tax Board.

In November 2003, the IRS completed its field examination of
    Cadence’s federal income tax returns for the tax years 1997
    through 1999 and issued a Revenue Agent’s Report, or RAR,
    in which the IRS proposed to assess an aggregate tax deficiency
    for the three-year period of approximately $143.0 million.
    The most significant of the disputed adjustments for the tax
    years 1997 through 1999 related to transfer pricing arrangements
    that Cadence had with a foreign subsidiary. In December 2007,
    the Joint Committee on Taxation of the U.S. Congress, or
    the Joint Committee, approved and the Appeals Office of the IRS,
    or the Appeals Office, executed settlement agreements, which
    resulted in an effective settlement of the transfer pricing
    dispute. As a result of this effective settlement, Cadence
    recognized a tax benefit of $27.8 million in the
    Consolidated Statement of Operations during fiscal 2007. Cadence
    also recognized a tax benefit of $6.2 million in the
    Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity and
    Comprehensive Income during fiscal 2007 as a result of this
    effective settlement.

Cadence did not reach a settlement with the Appeals Office on
    separate tax refund claims that would increase its tax
    deductions for foreign trade income for the tax years 1997
    through 1999. Cadence continues to believe that its position is
    well supported and Cadence is considering its options for
    further pursuing this matter.

In July 2006, the IRS completed its field examination of
    Cadence’s federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000
    through 2002 and issued a RAR in which the IRS proposed to
    assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the three-



year period of approximately $324.0 million. In November
    2006, the IRS revised the proposed aggregate tax deficiency for
    the three-year period to be approximately $318.0 million.
    The IRS is contesting Cadence’s qualification for deferred
    recognition of certain proceeds received from restitution and
    settlement in connection with litigation during the period. The
    proposed tax deficiency for this item is approximately
    $152.0 million. The remaining proposed tax deficiency of
    approximately $166.0 million is primarily related to
    proposed adjustments to Cadence’s transfer pricing
    arrangements that it had with foreign subsidiaries and to
    Cadence’s deductions for foreign trade income. Cadence has
    filed a timely protest with the IRS and is seeking resolution of
    the issues through the Appeals Office.

In May 2009, the IRS completed its field examination of
    Cadence’s federal income tax returns for the tax years 2003
    through 2005 and issued a RAR, in which the IRS proposed to
    assess an aggregate deficiency for the three-year period of
    approximately $94.1 million. In August 2009, the IRS
    revised the proposed aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year
    period to approximately $60.7 million. The IRS is
    contesting Cadence’s transfer pricing arrangements with its
    foreign subsidiaries and deductions for foreign trade income.
    The IRS made similar claims against Cadence’s transfer
    pricing arrangements and deductions for foreign trade income in
    prior examinations. Cadence has filed a timely protest with the
    IRS and will seek resolution of the issues through the Appeals
    Office.

Cadence believes that the proposed IRS adjustments are
    inconsistent with applicable tax laws and Cadence is vigorously
    challenging these proposed adjustments. The RAR is not a final
    Statutory Notice of Deficiency but the IRS imposes interest on
    the proposed deficiencies until the matters are resolved.
    Interest is compounded daily at rates published by the IRS,
    which rates are adjusted quarterly and have been at an annual
    rate between 4% and 10% since 2001.

The IRS is currently examining Cadence’s federal income tax
    returns for the tax years 2006 through 2008.

Unrecognized
    Tax Benefits

Cadence adopted new accounting principles for recognizing
    unrecognized tax benefits on December 31, 2006, the first
    day of Cadence’s fiscal 2007. The cumulative effect of
    adopting these new accounting principles was reported as an
    adjustment to the opening balance of Retained earnings (or other
    appropriate components of equity or net assets) in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet for fiscal 2007. Cadence recognized a
    $59.4 million decrease in the net liabilities for
    unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as an
    increase to the December 31, 2006 balance of Retained
    earnings. Cadence also recognized a $42.6 million decrease
    in the net liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and
    accounted for these as a $35.3 million increase in the
    December 31, 2006 balance of Common stock and capital in
    excess of par value and a $7.3 million decrease in the
    December 31, 2006 balance of Goodwill. Cadence also
    recognized additional long-term income tax assets of
    $115.0 million and additional long-term income tax
    liabilities of $115.0 million to present the unrecognized
    tax benefits as gross amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
    Cadence also decreased current income tax liabilities by
    $26.2 million and increased long-term income tax
    liabilities by the same amount based on its anticipation of the
    amount of cash payments to be made within one year.

On the first day of the fiscal 2009, Cadence adopted new
    accounting principles related to Cadence’s prior business
    combinations. As a result, $22.0 million of unrecognized
    tax benefits, if recognized, will be recorded as an adjustment
    to the Provision (benefit) for income taxes in the period in
    which the unrecognized tax benefits are settled. Prior to this
    adoption, these unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, were
    accounted for as an adjustment to goodwill.

The total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits that, if upon
    resolution of the uncertain tax positions would reduce
    Cadence’s effective tax rate as of January 2, 2010 is
    $257.6 million as compared to $232.5 million as of
    January 3, 2009. During the period ended January 3,
    2009, Cadence recognized a $7.9 million decrease in the
    liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits based on new
    information received during the period, which Cadence accounted
    for as a $7.9 million increase in the balance of Common
    stock and capital in excess of par value.

The total amounts of interest and penalties recognized in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations for fiscal 2009, fiscal
    2008 and fiscal 2007 as income tax expense (benefit) are as
    follows:

The total amounts of gross accrued interest and penalties
    recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of
    January 2, 2010, were $80.0 million and
    $10.8 million, respectively, as compared to
    $62.5 million and $9.7 million, respectively as of
    January 3, 2009.

Cadence believes that it is reasonably possible that the total
    amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to the IRS
    examination of its federal income tax returns for the tax years
    2000 through 2002 could decrease during fiscal 2010 if Cadence
    is able to effectively settle the disputed issues with the
    Appeals Office. Cadence believes that the range of reasonably
    possible outcomes is a decrease in existing unrecognized tax
    benefits for the tax years 2000 through 2002 of as much as
    $244.0 million.

In addition, Cadence believes that it is reasonably possible
    that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits for its
    transfer pricing arrangements with its foreign subsidiaries
    could significantly increase or decrease during fiscal 2010 if
    the Appeals Office develops new settlement guidelines or adjusts
    its settlement positions that change Cadence’s measurement
    of the tax benefits to be recognized upon effective settlement
    with the IRS. Because of the uncertain impact of any potential
    settlement guidelines, Cadence cannot currently provide an
    estimate of the range of possible outcomes.



Subsequent
    Event

On January 13, 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
    Ninth Circuit issued an order withdrawing its May 2009 majority
    and dissenting opinions in

Xilinx, Inc. v. Commissioner.

While Cadence was not a named party to the case, the Ninth
    Circuit’s order impacts Cadence’s tax position for
    certain years prior to fiscal 2004. In the May 2009 decision,
    the Ninth Circuit held that related parties to a research and
    development cost sharing arrangement must share stock option
    costs, notwithstanding the U.S. Tax Court finding that
    unrelated parties in such an arrangement would not share such
    costs. As a result of the Ninth Circuit’s decision, Cadence
    increased its liability for unrecognized tax benefits and
    decreased Common stock and capital in excess of par value by
    approximately $6.4 million during the year ended
    January 2, 2010. Cadence believes that it is reasonably
    possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits
    related to the value of stock options included in its cost
    sharing arrangements with its foreign subsidiaries could
    significantly decrease during fiscal 2010 if the Ninth Circuit
    ultimately affirms the Tax Court finding. Cadence believes that
    the range of reasonably possible change is a decrease in
    unrecognized tax benefits of up to $6.4 million.

NOTE 5. RESTRUCTURING
    AND OTHER CHARGES

During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, Cadence initiated a
    restructuring plan, or the 2009 Restructuring Plan, and during
    the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, Cadence determined that it
    would initiate further actions under the 2009 Restructuring Plan.

The 2009 Restructuring Plan is intended to decrease costs by
    reducing Cadence’s workforce and by consolidating
    facilities. Since initiating the 2009 Restructuring Plan,
    Cadence has recorded total Restructuring and other charges
    associated with the 2009 Restructuring Plan of approximately
    $35.1 million which includes severance payments,
    severance-related benefits and costs for outplacement services
    for approximately 345 employees. As of January 2,
    2010, Cadence had paid $16.3 million of severance and other
    benefits and had a remaining liability of $18.6 million
    associated with the 2009 Restructuring Plan.

Of the total $35.1 million Cadence recorded during fiscal
    2009 under the 2009 Restructuring Plan, approximately
    $23.2 million is related to restructuring activities
    Cadence initiated during the second quarter of fiscal 2009. In
    January 2010, Cadence announced additional activities under the
    2009 Restructuring Plan which it initiated during the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2009, and Cadence recorded Restructuring and
    other charges of approximately $11.9 million as Cadence
    determined the amounts were both probable and estimable as of
    January 2, 2010. Cadence expects to record an additional
    $1.0 million to $2.0 million in restructuring expenses
    related to consolidating facilities included in the 2009
    Restructuring Plan as it vacates those facilities in future
    periods.

Cadence initiated a restructuring plan during fiscal 2008, or
    the 2008 Restructuring Plan, and restructuring plans in each
    year from 2001 through 2005, or the Other Restructuring Plans,
    in an effort to operate more efficiently. As of January 2,
    2010, Cadence had a liability of $2.2 million related to
    the 2008 Restructuring Plan that consisted primarily of
    estimated lease losses and a liability of $4.6 million
    related to the Other Restructuring Plans that consisted solely
    of estimated lease losses.

Facility closure and office space reduction costs included in
    Cadence’s restructuring plans are comprised of payments
    required under leases, less any applicable estimated sublease
    income after the properties are abandoned, lease buyout costs
    and other contractual charges. To estimate the lease loss net of
    Cadence’s cost recovery efforts from subleasing all or part
    of a building, Cadence management made certain assumptions
    related to the time period over which the relevant building
    would remain vacant and sublease terms, including sublease rates
    and contractual common area charges.

As of January 2, 2010, the total amount accrued for all
    restructuring plans was $25.5 million, consisting of
    $6.5 million of estimated lease losses related to these
    restructuring plans and $18.9 million of severance and
    severance-related benefits. The estimated lease losses will be
    adjusted in the future based on changes in the assumptions used
    to estimate the lease losses. The lease losses could be as high
    as $10.4 million and will be influenced by rental rates and
    the amount of time it takes to find suitable tenants to sublease
    the facilities. Of the $25.5 million accrued as of
    January 2, 2010, $20.2 million was included in
    Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and $5.3 million
    was included in Other long-term liabilities in Cadence’s
    Consolidated Balance Sheets.



Cadence regularly evaluates the adequacy of its lease loss and
    severance and related benefits accruals, and adjusts the
    balances based on actual costs incurred or changes in estimates
    and assumptions. Cadence may incur future charges to reflect
    actual costs incurred or for changes in estimates related to
    amounts previously recorded under its restructuring plans.

    Restructuring Plan

Cadence recorded total costs associated with the 2009
    Restructuring Plan of $35.1 million. These costs include
    severance payments, severance-related benefits and costs for
    outplacement services that were communicated to the affected
    employees before January 2, 2010, and estimated severance
    payments and related benefits that were both probable and
    estimable as of January 2, 2010 for employees notified
    after January 2, 2010.

Total severance and termination benefits of approximately
    $16.3 million related to the 2009 Restructuring Plan were
    paid to employees before January 2, 2010. Approximately
    $18.6 million of severance and termination benefits related
    to the 2009 Restructuring Plan will be paid after
    January 2, 2010, all of which is included in Accounts
    payable and accrued liabilities in Cadence’s Consolidated
    Balance Sheet as of January 2, 2010. Due to varying
    regulations in the jurisdictions and countries in which Cadence
    operates, Cadence expects substantially all termination benefits
    to be paid by January 1, 2011.

During fiscal 2009, Cadence recorded a net reversal of
    $2.5 million, consisting of reversals of $3.0 million
    in termination and related benefits costs that were less than
    initially estimated and $1.4 million of excess facilities
    costs due to a reduction in the estimated lease obligation
    associated with a facility vacated as part of the 2008
    Restructuring Plan, partially offset by restructuring expense of
    $1.9 million related to facilities included in the 2008
    Restructuring Plan that Cadence exited during fiscal 2009.

During fiscal 2009, Cadence recorded a release of
    $1.2 million of excess facilities costs due to a reduction
    in the estimated lease obligation associated with a facility
    vacated as part of the 2002 Restructuring Plan and a reduction
    in other facilities costs that were less than initially
    estimated.

On October 5, 2007, Cadence completed a lease termination
    agreement for a facility included in the 2001 Restructuring
    Plan, whereby Cadence paid $8.2 million and was released
    from all future obligations related to the facility. Cadence
    recorded a credit to Restructuring and other charges of
    $7.1 million during fiscal 2007, representing the lease
    loss accrual related to this facility in excess of the amount
    paid.

Cadence determined that certain of its non-marketable securities
    were

other-than-temporarily

impaired based on the current prices of similar non-marketable
    securities offered by the investees. Cadence wrote down the
    investments by $5.2 million during fiscal 2009. These
    amounts are included in Other income (expense), net in
    Cadence’s Consolidated Statement of Operations. The fair
    value of these non-marketable securities was estimated using
    Level 3 inputs as described in Note 2.

Cadence exited certain facilities in connection with a
    restructuring plan and recorded lease losses and adjustments to
    the recorded lease losses during fiscal 2009. These losses are
    included in Restructuring and other charges (credits) in
    Cadence’s Consolidated Statement of Operations for fiscal
    2009. See Note 5 for additional details on Cadence’s
    lease loss estimates. The fair value of these lease losses was
    estimated using Level 2 inputs as described in Note 2.

Cadence determined during fiscal 2009 that certain of its
    property, plant and equipment was impaired and Cadence wrote
    down the property, plant and equipment to zero, resulting in a
    charge of $6.7 million. This charge is included throughout
    Cadence’s operating in Cadence’s Consolidated
    Statement of Operations. The fair value of these impairments was
    estimated using Level 3 inputs as described in Note 2.

Marketable
    Securities

Cadence considers all of its investments in marketable equity
    securities as

available-for-sale.

Available-for-sale

equity securities are stated at fair value, with the unrealized
    gains and losses presented net of tax and reported as a separate
    component of Stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and
    losses are determined using the specific identification method.
    Gains are recognized when realized and are recorded in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations as Other income (expense),
    net. Losses are recognized as realized or when Cadence has
    determined that an

other-than-temporary

decline in fair value has occurred.



Net recognized gains (losses) from the sale of

available-for-sale

equity securities during fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal
    2007 were as follows:

During fiscal 2008, Cadence purchased approximately
    4.3 million shares of common stock of Mentor Graphics
    Corporation, or Mentor Graphics, in connection with its proposed
    acquisition of Mentor Graphics. After the announcement of
    Cadence’s withdrawal of the proposed acquisition of Mentor
    Graphics and during fiscal 2008, Cadence sold its entire equity
    interest in Mentor Graphics at a loss of $9.4 million,
    which is included in Losses on sale of

available-for-sale

securities in the table above.

It is Cadence’s policy to review the fair value of these
    marketable equity securities on a regular basis to determine
    whether its investments in these companies are

other-than-temporarily

impaired. This evaluation includes, but is not limited to,
    reviewing each company’s cash position, financing needs,
    earnings or revenue outlook, operational performance, management
    or ownership changes and competition. If Cadence believes the
    carrying value of an investment is in excess of its fair value,
    and this difference is

other-than-temporary,

it is Cadence’s policy to write down the investment to
    reduce its carrying value to fair value. These impairments are
    included in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated
    Statement of Operations. During fiscal 2008, Cadence determined
    that two of its

available-for-sale

equity securities were

other-than-temporarily

impaired based on the severity and the duration of the
    impairment and wrote down the investments by $8.1 million.
    Cadence did not recognize an

other-than-temporary

impairment of

available-for-sale

equity securities during either fiscal 2009 or 2007.

Non-Marketable
    Securities

Cadence uses either the cost or equity method of accounting to
    account for its long-term, non-marketable investment securities
    included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net
    realized gains on the sale of non-marketable investments were
    zero during fiscal 2009, $1.6 million during fiscal 2008
    and $6.0 million during fiscal 2007. In addition,
    Cadence’s 1996 Deferred Compensation Venture Investment
    Plan Trust recorded a gain of $0.6 million during fiscal
    2007. If Cadence determines that an

other-than-temporary

decline exists in a non-marketable equity security, Cadence
    writes down the investment to its fair value and records the
    related write-down as an investment loss in the Consolidated
    Statements of Operations.

The following table illustrates the carrying value of
    Cadence’s non-marketable securities as of January 2,
    2010 and January 3, 2009:

    cost basis of $5.2 million during fiscal 2009,
    $8.6 million during fiscal 2008 and $2.6 million
    during fiscal 2007. These write-downs are included in Other
    income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of
    Operations.

Equity
    Method Investments

Cadence’s holdings in equity method investments are held in
    the form of voting preferred stock or convertible debt of
    privately-held companies. If Cadence determines that it has the
    ability to exercise significant influence over



the investee and the investment is in the form of in-substance
    common stock, the investment is accounted for under the equity
    method.

The portion of equity method income or loss recorded by Cadence
    is based on its percentage ownership of each investee’s
    preferred stock or convertible debt available to absorb losses
    or with contractual rights to income. Cadence’s level of
    participation in future financings of its equity method
    investees may impact its proportional share in future income or
    losses. Cadence records its interest in equity method gains and
    losses in the quarter following incurrence because it is not
    practicable to obtain investee financial statements before the
    issuance of Cadence’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
    Cadence records its proportional share of the investees’
    gains or losses in Other income (expense), net. Cadence’s
    proportional share of its investees’ net losses and
    impairment losses was as follows:

    privately-held companies: Accent International S.A., GSR
    Associates II, L.P. and ZCIST Co., Ltd. As of January 2,
    2010, the difference between the carrying value of
    Cadence’s investments in these investee companies and
    Cadence’s share of the underlying net assets of the
    investee companies was immaterial.

NOTE 8. STOCK
    COMPENSATION PLANS

Equity
    Incentive Plans

Cadence’s 2000 Nonstatutory Equity Incentive Plan, or the
    2000 Plan, 1997 Nonstatutory Stock Incentive Plan, or 1997 Plan,
    and 1993 Nonstatutory Stock Incentive Plan, or 1993 Plan (the
    2000 Plan, the 1997 Plan and the 1993 Plan are referred to
    collectively as the Nonstatutory Stock Incentive Plans), provide
    for the issuance of non-qualified options, restricted stock
    awards, restricted stock units, stock bonuses and rights to
    acquire restricted stock to Cadence employees and consultants
    who are not executive officers of Cadence, members of the
    Cadence Board of Directors or beneficial owners of 10% or more
    of Cadence common stock at the time the grant is approved. The



number of shares available for issuance under the 2000 Plan is
    50,000,000, under the 1997 Plan is 30,000,000 and under the 1993
    Plan is 24,750,000. Options granted under the Nonstatutory Stock
    Incentive Plans have an exercise price not less than the fair
    market value of the stock on the date of grant. Options granted
    to new employees become exercisable over a period of up to four
    years, generally with one-fourth of the shares vesting one year
    from the vesting commencement date, and the remaining shares
    vesting in 36 equal monthly installments thereafter. Options
    granted to current employees become exercisable over a period of
    up to four years, generally vesting in 48 equal monthly
    installments. Options granted under the Nonstatutory Stock
    Incentive Plans expire seven years from the date of grant.
    Restricted stock, which includes restricted stock awards and
    restricted stock units, granted under the Nonstatutory Stock
    Incentive Plans vest at times and in installments approved or
    delegated for approval by the Board of Directors or its
    Compensation Committee, on the basis of one or more of the
    following criteria: continued employment, passage of time or
    performance criteria.

Cadence’s 1987 Stock Incentive Plan, or the 1987 Plan,
    provides for the issuance of either incentive or non-qualified
    options and restricted stock awards. The number of shares
    available for issuance under the 1987 Plan is
    75,370,100 shares, of which only 5,000,000 shares may
    be issued pursuant to restricted stock awards. Options granted
    under the 1987 Plan have an exercise price not less than fair
    market value of the stock on the date of grant and become
    exercisable over periods of up to five years. Options granted
    under the 1987 Plan expire seven years from the date of grant.
    Restricted stock awards granted under the 1987 Plan vest at
    times and in installments set forth in the 1987 Plan and
    approved by the Board of Directors or its Compensation
    Committee, on the basis of one or more of the following
    criteria: continued employment, passage of time or performance
    criteria.

Under the 1995 Directors’ Stock Option Plan, or the
    Directors’ Plan, Cadence may grant non-qualified options to
    its non-employee directors for up to 3,050,000 shares of
    common stock at an exercise price equal to the average of the
    closing price for 20 trading days prior to the grant date.
    Options granted under the Directors’ Plan have terms of ten
    years and vest one year from the date of grant.

Cadence has assumed certain options granted to employees of
    acquired companies, or Acquired Options. The Acquired Options
    were assumed by Cadence outside of its stock option plans, and
    each option is administered under the terms of the respective
    original plans of the acquired companies. All of the Acquired
    Options have been adjusted for the price conversion under the
    terms of the acquisition agreement between Cadence and the
    relevant acquired company. The Acquired Options generally become
    exercisable over a four or five year period and generally expire
    between five and ten years from the date of grant. No additional
    options will be granted under any of the acquired
    companies’ plans.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)

In November 1998, Cadence’s Board of Directors adopted, and
    the Cadence stockholders subsequently approved, Cadence’s
    Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which amended
    and restated the 1990 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the ESPP.
    Subsequent amendments approved by Cadence’s Board of
    Directors and Cadence stockholders increased the number of
    shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the ESPP to
    66,500,000 shares, reflecting the May 2009
    stockholders’ approval of an additional increase of
    12,500,000 shares.

Under the ESPP and through the January 31, 2009 purchase
    date, a majority of Cadence’s employees could purchase
    Cadence’s common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lower
    of the fair market value at the beginning of the applicable
    offering period or at the end of the applicable offering period,
    in an amount up to 12% of their annual base earnings plus
    bonuses and commissions, subject to a limit in any calendar year
    of $25,000 worth of common stock. The offering periods are six
    months with a corresponding six month purchase period. New
    offerings begin on each February 1st and
    August 1st, and those offerings run consecutively. The
    purchase dates under the ESPP are January 31st and
    July 31st of each year.

On January 30, 2009, because Cadence did not have a
    sufficient number of authorized common stock available under the
    ESPP to permit all ESPP participants to purchase Cadence’s
    common stock in the full amount that had been set aside for them
    through their contributions, Cadence allocated the purchase on a
    pro rata basis and refunded the excess contributions.



Cadence’s Board of Directors administers the ESPP and has
    the final authority to construe and interpret both the ESPP and
    the rights granted under it. Cadence’s Board of Directors
    also has the authority, subject to the provisions of the ESPP,
    to determine when and how the rights to purchase Cadence common
    stock will be granted and the provisions of each offering of
    these rights, including designating any limits on the percentage
    and dollar amount that may be withheld from the ESPP
    participants’ annual gross earnings for a particular
    offering period, and Cadence’s Board of Directors may
    modify such limits from time to time. Under the rules currently
    in effect under the ESPP: (i) for the offering period that
    commenced February 1, 2009, each eligible ESPP participant
    was entitled to purchase Cadence common stock in an amount not
    to exceed the lower of (A) $7,058.82 or (B) the
    difference between (x) $25,000 and (y) the aggregate
    amount of Cadence’s common stock such participant purchased
    on January 30, 2009 under the ESPP; and (ii) for the
    offering period that commenced August 1, 2009 and
    thereafter, each eligible ESPP participant would be entitled to
    purchase Cadence common stock in an amount not to exceed
    $7,058.82 in any calendar year, subject to a contribution limit
    of 5% of such participant’s gross annual earnings.

In October 2008, certain executive officers resigned from their
    positions at Cadence. Pursuant to the resignations and the terms
    of the respective employment agreements of these executive
    officers, stock options have either been accelerated or
    forfeited. Cadence recorded additional stock-based compensation
    expense of $6.5 million relating to the accelerated vesting
    of these stock options.

Restricted
    Stock and Stock Bonuses

Generally, restricted stock, which includes restricted stock
    awards and restricted stock units, vests over three to four
    years and is subject to the employee’s continuing service
    to Cadence. Cadence issues some of its restricted stock with
    performance-based vesting. The terms of these restricted stock
    grants are consistent with grants of



restricted stock described above, with the exception that the
    vesting of the shares depends not only upon the completion of
    the required period of service, but also on the satisfaction of
    certain predetermined performance goals. Each quarterly period,
    Cadence estimates the probability of the achievement of these
    performance goals and recognizes any related stock-based
    compensation expense. The amount of stock-based compensation
    expense recognized in any one period can vary based on the
    attainment or estimated attainment of the various performance
    goals. If such performance goals are not met, no compensation
    expense is recognized and any previously recognized compensation
    expense is reversed.

In July 2008, Cadence modified the performance goals related to
    its performance-based restricted stock. On the modification
    date, Cadence evaluated the probability of achievement of both
    the original performance goals and the modified performance
    goals. For the performance-based restricted stock in which the
    original performance goal was unlikely to be achieved, Cadence
    reversed the previously recorded stock-based compensation
    expense of $6.5 million, calculated the fair value of the
    restricted stock on the modification date, and recorded the
    stock-based compensation expense to the extent that the modified
    performance goals were expected to be achieved over the
    remaining weighted average requisite service period of
    1.0 years. The fair value of the modified performance-based
    restricted stock was $6.2 million, or $7.34 per share. In
    the case of performance-based restricted stock grants for which
    both the original performance goal and the modified performance
    goal were determined to be likely to be achieved, the original
    grant date fair value will continue to be recorded as
    stock-based compensation expense as if no modification had
    occurred.

In October 2008, certain executive officers resigned from their
    positions with Cadence. As a result of those resignations and
    the terms of the respective employment agreements of those
    executive officers, the performance-based restricted stock
    either was forfeited or will be subject to vesting according to
    the terms of those agreements. Cadence recorded additional
    stock-based compensation expense relating to accelerated vesting
    of certain portions of some of the affected performance-based
    restricted stock, which was partially offset by the reversal of
    previously recorded stock-based compensation expense relating to
    the performance-based restricted stock that were forfeited.
    Cadence also recorded an additional expense related to the
    acceleration of restricted stock that was not performance-based
    in connection with the executive officer resignations.

Stock-based compensation expense related to performance-based
    restricted stock grants for fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal
    2007 was as follows:

Liability-based
    Awards

Cadence maintains a performance-based bonus plan under which
    payments may be made in Cadence common stock or cash. Each
    quarterly period, Cadence estimates the most likely outcome of
    predetermined performance goals and recognizes any related
    stock-based compensation expense. The amount of stock-based
    compensation expense recognized in any one period can vary based
    on the attainment or estimated attainment of the various
    performance goals. If such performance goals are not met, no
    compensation expense is recognized and any previously recognized
    compensation expense is reversed. The dollar amount earned under
    this performance-based bonus plan is based on the achievement of
    the performance goals, and the number of shares to be issued
    under the performance-based bonus plan is based on the dollar
    amounts earned and the average stock price for three days
    preceding the grant date. Stock issued under the
    performance-based bonus plan vests immediately. Cadence agreed
    to make the fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 payments in cash under
    this performance-based bonus plan. The final payment under this
    performance-based bonus plan of $1.3 million was made in
    February 2010. Stock-based compensation expense, cash paid and
    shares issued related to this performance-based bonus plan for
    fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 were as follows:

NOTE 11.
    NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE

Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net
    income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common
    stock outstanding, less unvested restricted stock, during the
    period. Diluted net income per share gives effect to equity
    instruments considered to be potential common shares, if
    dilutive, computed using the treasury stock method of
    accounting. In periods in which a net loss is recorded,
    potentially dilutive equity instruments would decrease the loss
    per share and therefore are not added to the weighted average
    shares outstanding.

Cadence accounts for the effect of the 2023 Notes in the diluted
    net income per share calculation using the if-converted method
    of accounting. Under that method, the 2023 Notes are assumed to
    be converted to shares (weighted for the number of days
    outstanding in the period) at a conversion price of $15.65, and
    amortization of transaction fees, net of taxes, related to the
    2023 Notes is added back to net income.

Cadence accounts for the effect of the Convertible Senior Notes
    in the diluted net income per share calculation using the
    if-converted method of accounting under the assumption that the
    conversion spread, if any, will be settled in stock. Under that
    method, the only shares that will be considered for inclusion in
    diluted net income per share are



those relating to the excess of the conversion premium over the
    principal amount. As of January 2, 2010, no shares are
    included in diluted earnings per share, or EPS, for the
    Convertible Senior Notes.

The calculations for basic and diluted net income (loss) per

NOTE 13. GOODWILL
    AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES

Goodwill

Cadence completed its annual impairment analysis of goodwill
    during the third quarter of fiscal 2008, and determined at that
    time that it satisfied the first step of the two-step goodwill
    impairment test, and no impairment of goodwill was recorded.
    However, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, Cadence
    observed impairment indicators including a further deterioration
    in the market in which Cadence operates and a decrease in its
    market capitalization. Further, Cadence determined indicators
    existed that indicated that the fair value of Cadence’s
    reporting unit was less than its carrying amount.

Accordingly, in connection with the preparation of
    Cadence’s year-end financial statements, Cadence completed
    an interim goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2008. As part of the second step of its goodwill
    impairment test, Cadence determined the fair value of its
    goodwill by allocating the estimated fair value of its reporting
    unit to its assets and liabilities, including the estimated fair
    value of its unrecorded intangible assets, on a fair value
    basis. After allocating its assets and liabilities on a fair
    value basis, Cadence recorded an impairment of all of its
    goodwill of $1,317.2 million.

Allocating assets and liabilities on a fair value basis and
    determining the fair value of unrecorded intangible assets
    required that Cadence make assumptions and estimates about the
    fair value of assets and liabilities where the fair values of
    those assets and liabilities were not readily available or
    observable. In addition, Cadence made estimates regarding its
    forecasted revenue, expenses and cash flows, its research and
    development activities, its customer turnover rates, applicable
    discount rates and costs of capital and the marketability of its
    current and future technology.

Cadence uses a combination of the income and market valuation
    approaches. In determining its overall conclusion of reporting
    unit fair value, Cadence considers the estimated values derived
    from both the income and market valuation approaches and weighs
    the values from each approach equally.



The income approach provides an estimate of fair value based on
    discounted expected future cash flows. Estimates and assumptions
    with respect to the determination of the fair value of
    Cadence’s reporting unit using the income approach include:

•

Cadence’s operating forecasts;

•

Revenue growth rates; and

•

Risk-commensurate discount rates and costs of capital.

Cadence’s estimates of revenues and costs are based on
    historical data, various internal estimates and a variety of
    external sources, and are developed as part of Cadence’s
    routine long-range planning process.

The market approach provides an estimate of the fair value of
    Cadence’s one reporting unit using various price or market
    multiples applied to the reporting unit’s operating results
    and then applying an appropriate control premium. The control
    premium is determined by considering control premiums offered as
    part of acquisitions in both Cadence’s market segment and
    comparable market segments.

The market capitalization of Cadence’s reporting unit is an
    indicator of its fair value. Accordingly, the estimated fair
    value of Cadence’s reporting unit using the income and
    market approaches is compared to the market capitalization of
    its reporting unit as one measure that the estimated fair value
    is reasonable.

In connection with the Cadence’s cost savings initiatives
    that were implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008,
    Cadence made certain changes to its Design for Manufacturing
    product strategy. As a result, Cadence recognized an impairment
    charge of $42.5 million arising from the abandonment of
    certain identifiable intangible assets and reducing to net
    realizable value certain other identifiable intangible assets.

During fiscal 2008, Cadence acquired intangible assets of
    $8.6 million, including $0.6 million allocated to
    acquired in-process technology related to Cadence’s
    acquisition of a company. The acquired in-process technology was
    immediately expensed because technological feasibility had not
    been established and no future alternative use existed.

Amortization expense for fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal
    2007, by Consolidated Statements of Operations caption, was as
    follows:

NOTE 14.
    ACQUISITIONS

During fiscal 2008, Cadence acquired a company for an aggregate
    purchase price of $9.4 million, which included the payment
    of cash, the fair value of assumed options and acquisition
    costs. The $3.1 million of goodwill recorded in connection
    with this acquisition is not expected to be deductible for
    income tax purposes and was completely impaired during fiscal
    2008.

During fiscal 2007, Cadence acquired two companies for an
    aggregate purchase price of $75.5 million, which included
    the payment of cash, the fair value of assumed options and
    acquisition costs. The $45.7 million of goodwill recorded
    in connection with these acquisitions is not deductible for
    income tax purposes and was completely impaired during fiscal
    2008. Prior to the acquisition of one company during fiscal
    2007, Cadence had an investment of $2.0 million in the
    company, representing a 12% ownership interest, which had been
    accounted for under the cost method of accounting. Cadence
    accounted for this acquisition as a step acquisition. Subsequent
    adjustments to the purchase price of these acquired companies
    are included in the “Other” line of the changes of
    goodwill table in Note 13.

For each of the acquisitions described above, the results of
    operations and the estimated fair value of the assets acquired
    and liabilities assumed have been included in Cadence’s
    Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of the
    acquisition. Comparative pro forma financial information for all
    acquisitions have not been presented because the results of
    operations were not material to Cadence’s Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

For many of Cadence’s previously completed acquisitions,
    payment of a portion of the purchase price is contingent upon
    the acquired business’ achievement of certain revenue and
    product development performance goals. The portion of the
    contingent purchase price, or earnout, associated with employee
    retention is recorded as compensation expense. The specific
    performance goal levels, and amounts and timing of earnout
    payments, vary with each acquisition. The acquisition-related
    earnouts for all periods presented were not significant. In
    connection with its acquisitions completed before
    January 2, 2010, Cadence may be obligated to pay up to an
    aggregate of $15.9 million in cash during the next
    32 months if certain defined performance goals are achieved
    in full, of which $8.1 million would be included as
    compensation expense in our Consolidated Statements of
    Operations.

Write-off
    of Acquired In-Process Research and Development

Acquired in-process research and development charges represent
    in-process research and development that had not reached
    technological feasibility at the time of acquisition and had no
    probable alternative future use. For acquisitions completed
    during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, the purchase price allocated
    to acquired in-process research and development was determined
    through established valuation techniques. The acquired
    in-process research and development was immediately expensed
    because technological feasibility had not been established, and
    no future alternative use existed. The write-off of acquired
    in-process research and development is a component of operating
    expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
    Write-offs of acquired in-process research and development
    charges were zero during fiscal 2009, $0.6 million during
    fiscal 2008 and $2.7 million during fiscal 2007.

NOTE 15.
    CONTINGENCIES

Legal
    Proceedings

From time to time, Cadence is involved in various disputes and
    litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business. These
    include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property,
    mergers and acquisitions, licensing, contracts, distribution
    arrangements and employee relations matters. At least quarterly,
    Cadence reviews the status of each significant matter and
    assesses its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss
    from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and
    the amount or the range of loss can be estimated, Cadence
    accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Legal proceedings
    are subject to uncertainties, and the outcomes are difficult to
    predict. Because of such uncertainties, accruals are based on
    our judgments using the best information available at the time.
    As additional information becomes available, Cadence reassesses
    the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation
    matters and may revise estimates.



During fiscal 2008, three complaints were filed in the United
    States District Court for the Northern District of California,
    or District Court, all alleging violations of
    Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of
    1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and

Rule 10b-5

promulgated thereunder, on behalf of a purported class of
    purchasers of Cadence’s common stock. The first such
    complaint was filed on October 29, 2008, captioned
    Hu v. Cadence Design Systems, Inc., Michael J. Fister,
    William Porter and Kevin S. Palatnik; the second such complaint
    was filed on November 4, 2008, captioned Vyas v.
    Cadence Design Systems, Inc., Michael J. Fister, and Kevin S.
    Palatnik; and the third such complaint was filed on
    November 21, 2008, captioned Collins v. Cadence Design
    Systems, Inc., Michael J. Fister, John B. Shoven, Kevin S.
    Palatnik and William Porter. On March 4, 2009, the District
    Court entered an order consolidating these three complaints and
    captioning the consolidated case “In re Cadence Design
    Systems, Inc. Securities Litigation.” The District Court
    also named a lead plaintiff and lead counsel for the
    consolidated litigation. The lead plaintiff filed its
    consolidated amended complaint on April 24, 2009, naming
    Cadence, Michael J. Fister, Kevin S. Palatnik, William Porter
    and Kevin Bushby as defendants, and alleging violations of
    Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and

Rule 10b-5

promulgated thereunder, on behalf of a purported class of
    purchasers of Cadence’s common stock who traded
    Cadence’s common stock between April 23, 2008 and
    December 10, 2008, or the Alleged Class Period. The
    amended complaint alleged that Cadence and the individual
    defendants made statements during the Alleged Class Period
    regarding Cadence’s financial results that were false and
    misleading because Cadence had recognized revenue that should
    have been recognized in subsequent quarters. The amended
    complaint requested certification of the action as a class
    action, unspecified damages, interest and costs, and unspecified
    equitable relief. On June 8, 2009, Cadence and the other
    defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On
    September 11, 2009, the District Court held that the
    plaintiffs had failed to allege a valid claim under the relevant
    legal standards, and granted the defendants’ motion to
    dismiss the amended complaint. The District Court gave the
    plaintiffs leave to file another amended complaint, and the
    plaintiffs did so on October 13, 2009. The amended
    complaint filed on October 13, 2009 names the same
    defendants. Cadence has moved to dismiss the October 13,
    2009 amended complaint, and plans to continue to vigorously
    defend these consolidated cases and any other securities
    lawsuits that may be filed.

During fiscal 2008, two derivative complaints were filed in
    Santa Clara County Superior Court. The first was filed on
    November 20, 2008, and captioned Ury Priel, derivatively on
    behalf of nominal defendant Cadence Design Systems, Inc. v.
    John B. Shoven, Lip-Bu Tan, Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli,
    Donald L. Lucas, Sr., Roger Siboni, George Scalise, Michael
    J. Fister, and Doe Defendants 1-15. The second was filed on
    December 1, 2008, and captioned Mark Levine, derivatively
    on behalf of nominal defendant Cadence Design Systems,
    Inc. v. John B. Shoven, Lip-Bu Tan, Alberto
    Sangiovanni-Vincentelli, Donald L. Lucas, Sr., Roger
    Siboni, George Scalise, Michael J. Fister, John Swainson and Doe
    Defendants 1-10. These complaints purport to bring suit
    derivatively, on behalf of Cadence, against certain of
    Cadence’s current and former directors for alleged breach
    of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste
    of corporate assets and unjust enrichment. Many of the
    allegations underlying these claims are similar or identical to
    the allegations in the consolidated securities class action
    lawsuits described above, and the claims also include
    allegations that the individual defendants approved compensation
    based on inflated financial results. The plaintiffs request
    unspecified damages, restitution, equitable relief and their
    reasonable attorneys’ fees, experts’ fees, costs and
    expenses on behalf of Cadence against the individual defendants.
    A motion to consolidate these complaints was granted on
    January 20, 2009. Cadence is analyzing these derivative
    complaints and will respond to them appropriately. The parties
    to these cases have agreed to a temporary stay of the
    proceedings.

In light of the preliminary status of these lawsuits, Cadence
    cannot predict the outcome of these matters. While the outcome
    of these litigation matters cannot be predicted with any
    certainty, management does not believe that the outcome of any
    current matters will have a material adverse effect on
    Cadence’s consolidated financial position, liquidity or
    results of operations.

Other
    Contingencies

Cadence provides its customers with a warranty on sales of
    hardware products, generally for a

90-day

period. To date, Cadence has not incurred any significant costs
    related to warranty obligations.

Cadence’s product license and services agreements typically
    include a limited indemnification provision for claims from
    third parties relating to Cadence’s intellectual property.
    If the potential loss from any indemnification



claim is considered probable and the amount or the range of loss
    can be estimated, Cadence accrues a liability for the estimated
    loss. The indemnification is generally limited to the amount
    paid by the customer. To date, claims under such indemnification
    provisions have not been significant.

NOTE 16.
    LEASE COMMITMENTS

Equipment and facilities are leased under various operating
    leases expiring at various dates through 2025. Certain of these
    leases contain renewal options. Rental expense was
    $27.3 million for fiscal 2009, $34.7 million for
    fiscal 2008 and $34.6 million for fiscal 2007.

As of January 2, 2010, future minimum lease payments under
    non-cancelable operating leases were as follows:

    restructuring costs as paid.

NOTE 17.
    SALES OF INSTALLMENT CONTRACT RECEIVABLES

From time to time, Cadence elects to transfer installment
    contract receivables on a non-recourse or limited-recourse basis
    to third party financial institutions and these transfers are
    recorded as sales. The following table shows the amounts of
    accounts receivable transferred to financial institutions on a
    non-recourse basis during fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal
    2007:




(In thousands)

Losses on the sale of receivables are included in General and
    administrative expense in the accompanying Consolidated
    Statements of Operations. The recorded losses are determined
    based on the purchasing financial institution’s review of
    the credit strength of the customers whose installment contract
    receivables are being transferred by Cadence. The following
    table presents the losses recorded during fiscal 2009, fiscal
    2008 and fiscal 2007:

When Cadence sells receivables, it generally retains the
    servicing rights to the underlying accounts receivable. The fair
    value of the retained servicing rights have not been material to
    Cadence’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

During fiscal 2008, Cadence executed a transaction that was not
    deemed a true sale and Cadence was not able to record this
    transaction as a sale. Accordingly, Cadence recorded a liability
    of $18.0 million due to the financial institution in its
    Consolidated Balance Sheet and the cash received from the
    financial institution during fiscal 2008 and the cash repaid to
    the financial institution during fiscal 2009 are included as
    Cash flows from financing activities in the Consolidated
    Statement of Cash Flows.



NOTE 18.
    EMPLOYEE AND DIRECTOR BENEFIT PLANS

Cadence maintains a 401(k) savings plan to provide retirement
    benefits through tax-deferred salary deductions for all of its
    United States employees. Cadence may make discretionary
    contributions, as determined by the Board of Directors, which
    cannot exceed a specified percentage of the annual aggregate
    salaries of those employees eligible to participate. Cadence
    made total contributions to the plan of $9.0 million in
    2009, $12.2 million in 2008 and $12.2 million in 2007.

Executive Officers and Directors may also elect to defer
    compensation payable to them under Cadence’s 1994
    Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan. Deferred compensation
    payments are held in accounts with values indexed to the
    performance of selected mutual funds or money market accounts.
    These investments are classified as trading securities in
    Cadence’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and gains and losses
    are recognized as income (expense) in the Consolidated
    Statements of Operations. Net recognized gains (losses) of
    trading securities during fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal

Cadence adopted new accounting principles for recognizing
    unrecognized tax benefits on December 31, 2006, the first
    day of Cadence’s fiscal 2007. The cumulative effect of
    adopting these new accounting principles was reported as an
    adjustment to the opening balance of Retained earnings (or other
    appropriate components of equity or net assets) in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet for fiscal 2007, which amounts were
    non-cash items in Cadence’s 2007 Statement of Cash Flows.

    adjustment losses, net of gains, previously recorded in
    Accumulated other comprehensive income in Cadence’s
    Consolidated Balance sheet for a subsidiary that was completely
    liquidated during fiscal 2008.

NOTE 21.
    SEGMENT REPORTING

Segment reporting requires disclosures of certain information
    regarding reportable segments, products and services, geographic
    areas of operation and major customers. Segment reporting is
    based upon the “management approach”: how management
    organizes the company’s reportable segments for which
    separate financial information is (i) available and
    (ii) evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision
    maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing
    performance. Cadence’s chief operating decision maker is
    its President and Chief Executive Officer, or CEO.
    Cadence’s CEO reviews Cadence’s consolidated results
    as one reportable segment. In making operating decisions, the
    CEO primarily considers consolidated financial information,
    accompanied by disaggregated information about revenues by
    geographic region.

Outside the United States, Cadence markets and supports its
    products and services primarily through its subsidiaries.
    Revenue is attributed to geography based on the country in which
    the product is used or services are delivered. Long-lived assets
    are attributed to geography based on the country where the
    assets are located.
